books,Maybe it's not all doom and gloom?,"I know there's been a lot of discussion on this subreddit about the downfall of reading. Kids aren't reading anymore. Everyone's attention span is shot. Booktok is ruining the book industry, etc. Media literacy is dead. But is it really that bad? Has the times really changed that much?

1. Kids aren't being assigned books anymore, just sections of books. And that's a shame, right? But I grew up in the 90's. We often didn't read the full assigned reading. There was immense pressure to have a high GPA, be in all honors/AP classes *and* be in like a million clubs and activities to impress college admission boards. We could Cliffnote our way through Crime and Punishment but not calculus and physics so that's where our time went. Some of us had to work jobs. Some of us had to watch our siblings because our parents worked a lot. Some of us just didn't want to. We did read some of it, but it was highly supplemented by Cliffnotes. 

Were there kids who read every single word of every single assigned books? Absolutely. They genuinely enjoyed reading and prioritized it. But was that all of us, or even most of us? No.

I'm old enough that the many of the English department heads are probably about my age. I can totally see them going, ""Let's be honest, we didn't read the whole book when we were their age, they're not going to read it.  Let's just assign them to read the crucial parts so they can understand the themes and the cultural impact."" 

2. Kids, and people, are reading just as much as ever, just not books. I am ***not*** (again, *not*) saying that reading chats, texts, comments, emails, subtitles, etc is anywhere near the same as reading a book. Of course it's not, they are two completely different form of reading. But our lives have gotten *significantly* more text based in a past few decades. For a lot of us, we probably read more than we speak or listen. Maybe the reason we read less is because we just need a break from written words. You know how when you're at a party, it's just nice to go to the bathroom and enjoy a break from all the noise? Maybe we're not getting stupider or less intellectually curious, we just need a break from text.

3. I don't think booktok is ruining the publishing industry, but I do think that the publishing industry figured out they can sell mass market quality books at paperback prices. Low effort books were always around, they were just mostly sold as mass market paperbacks. And while those still exist, I feel like there's far less of it because, thanks to booktok, publishers can sell them at paperback prices. Sure, the ""As Seen on Booktok"" section is taking up space but it's probably taking up the same amount of space the Harlequin romance books would've taken up twenty years ago.

4. Regarding media literacy, thirty years ago, if I had a stupid hot take on a book, the only person hearing about it are my friends, maybe my teacher if it's for school. Now if I have a stupid hot take online, several somebodies all over the world are shaking their head in disbelief. Has the ideas gotten stupider or has it just gotten much easier to get our stupid ideas out there.  There used to be gatekeepers (newspaper and magazine editors) but now anyone can voice their opinions on a public platform.

And speaking of stupid hot takes... Maybe I'm being naive and optimistic. Reading has changed significantly, for sure. I'm just not convinced that we, as a society, have gotten stupider. I do think that reading will become more of a niche hobby, but just because people are reading less books, does that mean that people are learning less? Being exposed to any less ideas? Being immersed in less worlds?",Anxious-Fun8829,1h9r8nx,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9r8nx/maybe_its_not_all_doom_and_gloom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9r8nx/maybe_its_not_all_doom_and_gloom/,2024-12-08 19:56:05,228,0.82,228,0,191,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9r8nx
books,Jussi Adler-Olsen's final Dept Q,"I just finished and was disappointed with a lighter series when .y pre-ordered final Department Q novel downloaded to my Audible *I am blind) and suddenly I felt I was listening to an author who makes all his interesting characters progress and brings the series to a satisfying conclusion.  In fact, it almost comes full circle, in a way. 

These novels had somewhat horrible crimes but very endearing characters. Except for Assad's odd bits, and even they lighten up and he is a full partner. Even Gordon grows. That's what I want in a finale. The wait was worth the quality.

I am going to get all of the books and read them again in audible format. My husband and I listen to them on our trips.

books,"Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy. Yes, it seems you can read a book again for the first time.","I read this book for the first time in high school, which was over 30 years ago.  I remember really liking it but couldn't remember anything about it other than how the book jumped from character to character.  Now that I just finished reading it again, having forgotten nearly all of the details made it like reading it for the first time.

It's a little scary how nothing I read seemed even remotely familiar; I've usually been able to recall a fair amount of details from other books I've read, even ones from way back in childhood.

I highly recommend this one though, for anyone who likes techno-thrillers.  Anyone unfamiliar with the book, it takes place in the 1980s (contemporary to when it was written) and details a conventional war between the Soviet Union and NATO.

Are there any books that you re-read that felt like the first time all over again?",jemull,1h9peuc,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9peuc/red_storm_rising_by_tom_clancy_yes_it_seems_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9peuc/red_storm_rising_by_tom_clancy_yes_it_seems_you/,2024-12-08 18:35:27,102,0.92,102,0,46,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9peuc

books,"I like Stephen King's ""Mr. Mercedes"".","I just wanted to read a thriller about a killer whose weapon would be a car. Although the machine is only used at the beginning, I liked the book.

Let's start with the plot. Someone hit a crowd of people at a job fair with a Mercedes a year ago and managed to get away with it. Now the killer is pestering retired police officer Bill Hodges with letters to kill himself. As a result, this motivates Bill to search for the killer. That's how intellectual games begin.

The first half of the book is a game of ""who is smarter"", because what is Bill, what is Mr. Mercedes are trying to outwit each other in different ways.

The second half is ""to make it to ..."", where the characters must manage to prevent a new crime of Mr. Mercedes.

Let's do without spoilers and briefly. The book turned out to be intense, especially towards the end. The author does not hide the identity of the maniac and at the beginning of the book shows who he is and how he thinks (and his name is Brady). In the first half, it was funny to read how Bill pranked the villain by saying that Brady is not the real Mr. Mercedes (and how it bombed him).

About the characters. Bill Hodges is not a very interesting character yet. I don't even have anything to say about him. His friend Jerome is a funny character. Such a cheerful, brave guy who likes to make the reader uncomfortable by jokingly speaking bad English (because he is black). Holly Gibney, a character who later acquires a own cycle, develops well in the second half from a sociophobic and insecure woman into a completely resolute and talkative (at least, talkative with Bill and Jerome).

Brady Hartsfield aka Mr. Mercedes turned out to be simultaneously cartoonishly angry, pathetic and menacing. Like, look, he's a racist, a sociopath, and he's only turned on by his mother. He gets angry when someone is happy. At the same time, he is quite smart, because he hides well under the guise of an ordinary guy, he gets along well with technology, and in the end he cunningly equipped his new weapon. And when something bad happened to him, I was happy with all my heart, because to hell with that asshole.

I like the author's writing style. This is a regular Stephen King text, that is, a lot of information, especially about the characters, which is easy to read. But the scenes where he describes sex are very uncomfortable.

All in all, a good thriller. He's intense, the villain is nasty, the writing style is good. Maybe not the best of this author, but definitely good.",mystery5009,1h9mvlj,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,2024-12-08 16:44:23,72,0.82,72,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h9mvlj
