movies,Phone distractions and movie/story comprehension. ,"I'm curious how others deals with this, both at the theater, and while watching in your own home. 

Phones have become such a distraction, ringing/chiming/*begging* for our attention every second of every day. It gives you the dopamine fix, and you're nearly instantly craving the next one.

Is anyone able to really allow themselves to be immersed in a movie anymore? 

Last time I went to the theater, a group of kids were looking at their phones constantly. And phones are just getting brighter and brighter. It's beyond distracting. Bright flashes of light from the corner of your eye pull me out of whatever I'm doing.

Anyone go to any extremes to make help immersion for any/everyone else around them? Should theaters adopt a no phones allowed policy? There have been theaters that don't allow children in after certain times, but I know that's different. To me, it's really about the distractions.

I've heard of people collecting cell phones before watching movies, but that's such a small scale and only affects people in their homes.

Thoughts? Are you able to put down your phone to watch a movie without feeling the dopamine hunger pangs?

We should do an experiment using all the people who say that they can watch a movie and browse on their phone while comprehending the story.

There is a point were Roz is going to re-unite with Brightbill after the but sees him in the distance talking to the other geese. Now a key part of the gaggle. 

I thought they could have borrowed from Stella Dallas with Roz watching on realising she’s fulfilled her mission and going back to Universal Dynamics. 
Perhaps maybe with Brightbill being shown as sad that he thinks Roz is not there but then rejoining the rest of the Geese. 

The actual ending is not actually a million miles from this. But the action sequence in between undermines its emotional power without actually changing Roz and Brightbills separate destinies.

movies,Do Audiences Even Care About Cinematic Details Like Color and Light?,"As a filmmaker passionate about cinematography, I’ve been diving deep into the niche of film emulation—replicating the look and feel of celluloid film in digital work. I find it fascinating, almost magical, how the right colors, textures, and lighting can transform a scene. But here’s the question that keeps circling in my mind: Do audiences, especially those not involved in filmmaking, really see these subtle details? Do they feel them, even if they don’t consciously notice?

For context, I make movies purely for fun, out of passion. They’re not for money or validation, just a way to express myself. Sometimes I wish I could ask my 10-year-old self—someone who simply loved movies without knowing the technical side—if these nuanced elements would have mattered to him. Back then, I wasn’t thinking about grain structure, dynamic range, or color grading. I was just immersed in the magic of storytelling.

It reminds me of this video by Cleo Abram about football shots. She discussed how people thought the footage looked incredible—like it was shot in 8K—when, in reality, it was all about the aperture. The shots people loved were done on DSLRs with a shallow depth of field, unlike traditional broadcast cameras with their massive lenses, which prioritize a different aesthetic. When I saw the footage, I instantly recognized it was the aperture creating that ""cinematic"" look, not resolution or 8K. But it was fascinating to see how much people loved the DSLR footage without knowing why.

From this example, it’s clear that people do notice these things—but does it really matter? My assumption is that there’s a bare minimum that evolves over time as generations grow up exposed to better and better clarity. They notice the overall improvement, but they can’t pinpoint what it is—and honestly, they don’t even care. It’s not their job to know these details.

That’s the thing, right? This is also why smartphones have diminished DSLR sales compared to a few decades ago, when standalone cameras were the only option. Obviously, we in the industry know the technical reasons why DSLRs are still better than even flagship phone cameras. But that’s not the point. The point is the bare minimum.

And honestly, as an aspiring filmmaker, I feel great about this. It means I can start with a smartphone as my camera. All I have to do is figure out what the bare minimum is for how my movies need to look. Everything above that is good to have, but not necessarily a deal-maker.

Because at the end of the day, if the vibe of the movie doesn’t resonate with someone, they won’t want to watch it—no matter how good it looks, even in IMAX.

So, to the community here: Do you think the average viewer, or even a younger version of yourself, notices or appreciates subtleties like film emulation, color, or light? Or are these details more of a filmmaker's obsession? And what do you think that ""bare minimum"" standard is today?

Edit-
The reason why I ask this question is because I make movies simply because the process makes me happy. But sometimes, I find myself diving too deep into the rabbit holes of filmmaking details, losing track of the joy and starting to see perfection in those details as the only path to fulfillment—when it’s really not. That’s not who I am. Even though I make movies for myself, I wanted to understand what the audience actually feels about these things because, honestly, I’ve been exhausted thinking about it all on my own. What I really want is the clarity to know when I’ve done enough, to recognize when I’m focusing too much on the details and losing sight of myself in the process.",No-Indication9775,1ha8nph,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,2024-12-09 12:31:23,0,0.29,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha8nph

movies,"Revisiting ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" critiquing it on its own merit, I found it to be a pretty bad film.","This is a sort of Mandella Effect with me, but after rewatching the film only remembering bits and pieces of it when I was younger, I was surprised how small the guardian angel imagination sequence actually is. I thought this was the bulk of the 2nd act originally, but it happens after the film almost reaches its 2-hour runtime. The impact this film has in popular culture is completely dependent on those final 20 minutes.   


If you look up the plot of the film on an website, it will say a variation of ""An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.""

This, however, actually happens at the end of film.  This happens about 1 hour and 50 minutes into it. So, this cannot be the plot of the movie. This could only be the plot of the movie if the first act gave us a brief character development of George in the first act, before Clarence takes him on his excursion, where the film will spend the majority of its runtime. But that is not what happens. The plot of the film is actually more closely aligned with, ""A businessman is at financial and personal dilemma when a wealthy tycoon has sights to take over his business and have completely control over the city.""

The only reason this is listed as a plot is the impact its had in culture rather than the film on its own merit.

Other things:

The film opens with an exchange of George, Violet and Mary and children. Violet and Mary both fawn over George.

The way the film opens, you'd think this would foreshadow Violet and Mary feuding over Goerge as adults, or George having to choose one. Opening with the 3 of them suggests these 3 are going to be the main characters later. But no. Adult Violet isn't really integral to the plot at all. Kid Violet has more lines than adult Violet. The opening scene sets something up that didn't end up happening.  

A 7-year-old Violet's innocent crushes on ""a lot of boys"" is somehow offensively supposed to foreshadow that adult Violet is promiscuous. Women who are promiscuous and exotic dancers don't generally start showing signs of this at 7, and it's completely unrelated to any crushes she'd have at that age. 

They spent too much on the opening scene when the only two plot points it needed was to show that George saved the druggist from a fatal error, and George liked exploring. The druggist ended up being an insignificant character later on, so there's no need to spend so much time here. 

George is mildly surprised that Mary is ""18"" as if they just met, yet doesn't seem to remember Mary from childhood. Young Mary didn't just come into the pharmacy that one time; she knew George quite well. Young Mary whispered in his ear ""I'll love you 'til the day I die,"" so they were well acquainted with each other as children.  In fact, there is never a callback to the child years, as if the opening scene was tacked-on later.

We didn't need the narrator exposition by the angels. We didn't need to the conversation by the angels at the introduction about who George is. Clarence's first appearance could've been when he was drowning, and that would've been fine.  There's enough exposition that Clarence is an angel after Clarence saved him (or George saved Clarence) that we didn't need the opening exposition.   
  
If we already see Clarence in human form, then what was the point of the star sequence anyway, which was also horrible special effects even by 1946 standards? The movie could've opened with Clarence in human form simply could've been conversing with the two other angels off-screen.  There was no point in showing them as stars. This seems like a tacked-on reshoot when they didn't have the actors available. 

Officer Ernie spots George by the bridge and says he's been looking for him all night. George is ecstatic he's back to his normal life and leaves. However, if Ernie had been looking for George all night, then he would've stopped at Martini's Bar prior the bridge, where the patrons would've told Ernie that George left drunk. Additionally, Ernie would've found out about the accident. Regardless of his friendship with Ernie, George still should've or would've been detained for drunk driving and leaving the scene of accident. 

When Freddie opens the gym floor to engage the pool- he's told George and Mary are right over the crack.  Freddie opens this floor, and George and Mary are dancing away from the crack at this point. There're a lot of other dancers closer to the opening than they are, and manage to see and avoid it. But coincidentally, George and Mary are the only two that don't see it and fall in accidentally. The two people that Freddie targeted are the two people that happen to fall in despite them not being any more likely than any one else at the dance. What should have happened was, as soon as the floor opened, everyone started falling in. 

Finally, there's an unresolved arc for the main villain. Potter stealing the money isn't addressed, nor is he shown to be defeated overall. 

In sum, it's a badly made film, and the initial reviews are negative, but it does have an cultural impact but that's mostly because it's shown during every Christmas season through decades of rewatch.

movies,I don't agree with the sentiment that the Driver from Drive was a psychopath (SPOILERS),"Just watched the movie for the first time. Fantastic, instantly went to see what others were discussing. Seems the common consensus seems to be the Driver was sociopath/psychopath, even my friends think so.

To me, the movie was a character study on a troubled man looking for a normal, happy life, but got involved with the wrong people (and continues to.) Not a sociopath or psychopath. Probably on the spectrum. The whole movie was also showing us that he was a real human being. 

First, biggest signs of a socio/psychopath are lack of empathy and love, but he clearly has a lot of empathy and love for Irene and the child. He puts himself into danger just so he can keep them from harm. He isn't just physically or intimately in love with her, he never advances on her in a sexual way, it's a sweet and caring love. The elevator scene didn't scream lust to me (or my wife) personally, just a final kiss before he'll never see her again. The dates were always innocent with them chilling with her child. He is also very clearly distraught when Shannon dies, who again, proves to be part of the wrong friends he accidentally associates himself with. 

At the beginning of the movie, he denies a job for a lot of money from a previous client. Tells him to STFU, but ends up inadvertently taking the job because now Irene and her little boy are in danger if he doesn't.

People also mention the brutality of his kills, but all his kills in the movie come from self defense, or defense of a loved one. He was furiously stomping on the guy in the elevator because he was an active and present threat to Irene. It was a violent outburst towards his frustration at being unable to keep a person he loves out of danger. She becomes sad because she realizes she fell in love with yet another man with violent baggage that mean harm to the family.

He 100% does have a violent past. That is why he is disconnected, awkward, calculated and aware. 

He has good intentions, but fate and nature keep him away from them. He's the frog, the scorpion, and the shark in one package. He's not feigning his care for humanity. He sacrificed his only remaining bond to keep her safe. He left the money behind. Gave her a sweet goodbye voicemail. Clearly sad as he drives onto nowhere, where he'll probably get a job on the spot from a random guy again, forever and ever in this cycle.",Forhaver,1ha4h5u,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,2024-12-09 07:28:38,0,0.46,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha4h5u
movies,What did we think of Nightbitch?,"I was on the fence, leaning negative, for the first two-thirds. This is coming from someone who unreservedly adores *Can You Ever Forgive Me* and *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*. Once it hit the third act, I got it. And thank god it clicked, because it would have made me really sad to give a negative review to a movie that needle-drops ""Dare to Be Stupid"" by Weird Al.

While I still prefer Marielle Heller's previous films, this big and often baffling swing reveals itself as a deeply personal reflection on balancing artistic legacy with continuing heritage. Kudos to Heller for making a film on her terms, even if it almost turned me off completely before eventually winning me over.

I was reminded of Ari Aster's *Beau Is Afraid*. In *Beau*, Joaquin Phoenix as Aster's self-insert protagonist only finds peace when performing a play in the woods—mirroring how Aster himself might only feel at ease when creating films and seeing the world through his unique lens. Even as some audiences follow Richard Kind's character out the door wondering what the hell they just saw, they at least had the opportunity to understand how it feels to live with Aster's restless, haunting brain.

An unhinged Amy Adams gives us a similar peek into Heller's mind in *Nightbitch*. And like Scoot McNairy's character admits, I ""didn't get it"" at first. Honestly, as a single man with no kids, I still don't get all of it. But now I feel a little closer to empathizing, rather than just sympathizing, with moms in the arts.

(Side note: I saw Brian De Palma's *Phantom of the Paradise* a week ago and didn't recognize a young Jessica Harper until the end credits. Then tonight I didn't realize an older Jessica Harper plays Norma until I saw her name on the Letterboxd page. I don't know what's causing my Jessica-Harper-prosopagnosia, but as a big fan of hers, I'm hoping one of the witches at Tanz Akademie can cast a spell to fix it.)

However, in the home she lives in, the male character has a 70s model car, a record player, and is watching a movie in black and white. It makes me think of other movies that have done the same. In iRobot, Will Smith had a retro stereo system that was behind the current tech in the movie. In WALL-E, the robot is always watching vintage black and white movies. In the 2018 movie Upgrade where the main character gets an AI implant to give him the ability to walk again, he also has a 70s model car.

movies,"""The Lovely Bones:"" A New Add to My Least Favorite Movies List","I just saw the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. 

I came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on ""paired with"" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl ""everyone dies"" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. 

I also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to ""everyone."" The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. 

Furthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the ""cool grandma"" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a ""grown man"" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just ""live with it"" less than a year after the murder.

It's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.

Finally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the ""weird looking, creepy stranger"" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.

This movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.",Due_Assist_7614,1ha2xe2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,2024-12-09 05:43:43,317,0.71,317,0,151,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha2xe2

movies,Was the main character of Kingdom of Heaven (2005) the real son of Godfrey in the movie? I think he might not have been.,"Rewatching the movie and I start to think that Bailan (Orlando Bloom) may not have been Godfrey's (Liam Neeson) real son.

I see it as Godfrey and his circle were driven by meritocracy and finding a right guy to fit into Jerusaleem to keep peace, justice and all.

After seing the smith and hearing about his talents, the hosptalier (David Thewils) asks Godfrey ""remember what we talked about on the road?"".

I think that they either
a) agreed to come back to France and pick the most deserving/fitting man to become Godfrey's heir, either while on the road or even before sailing out from the Holy Land

b) Met his real son and realized they couldn't let such a jerk inherit the.piece of the kingdom of god they were building

c) Both a) and b) + hearing about his engineering talents played the crucial part of choosing him.

It is just a presumption, but it lays into the narrative which both Godfrey and King of Jerusaleem pronounce, ""everyone can be the master of his fate here, no matter who he was in his homeland"".

movies,District 9 is great original film.,"A recommendation post of this film suddenly popped on my Instagram feed and I thought I should give it a try. I'm glad that I did.

I knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it has aliens in it (thought that it was an alien invasion movie).

Never in my life did I imagine that a film can make me sympathize with aliens and hate humans. Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.
 
Another thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.

The ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).

The only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.

In short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.

movies,Was the Hag in Snow White an Illusion?,"We all know that after the huntsman fails to provide Snow White's heart, the queen then magically transforms herself into the old hag which she then uses to trick Snow White into eating the apple.

The thing that I've always been curious on is whether or not that transformation is simply an illusion or not. What I mean is does the black magic only make her appear to be an old woman but she still functions as her normal self or is it truly a transformation and she IS that old woman? Sure she acknowledges the voice change, but she also seems to run pretty damn fast for an old woman and almost succeeded in moving a boulder onto the dwarfs; also an impressive feat given her ""age"". It wouldn't surprise me if someone that powerful was able to keep her strength and endurance while changing the voice to make it believable. 

What do you all think?

Regardless, personally she remains tied for my top Disney villain (with Maleficent), and by far the scariest, particularly as a child.

movies,Onegin (1999) - Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler are excellent in this beautiful romantic drama based on the novel in verse by Russian writer Alexander Pushkin.,"https://preview.redd.it/lfizh83n9q5e1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c406dbf791527cd189be56708ea4efc41484aa1d

Alexander Pushkin's verse novel ""Eugene Onegin"" is well-known in English-speaking countries, partly due to the influence of Tchaikovsky's opera, so I need not set out the plot in any detail. It centres upon the relationship between Yevgeny Onegin, a 19th century Russian landowner, and a teenaged girl named Tatyana Larinа, the daughter of a neighbour. Tatyana falls passionately in love with Onegin and writes him a letter setting out her feelings, but he replies that he cannot return them. Six years later Onegin meets Tatyana again and discovers that she is now married to a prince. A subplot deals with a duel fought between Onegin and Vladimir Lensky, the fiancé of Tatyana's sister Olga.

Ralph Fiennes executes a stunning performance as the aloof, sarcastic disillusioned aristocrat managing a performance which combines a great deal of emotion and extreme surface passivity; Liv Tyler is at her most beautiful in one of her best performances to date as the poignant Tatiana who, as the film unfolds, evolves from passionate idealism into resignation and honour.

As for the story, the movie is very faithful to the Pushkinian attitude. The story is very character-centred, typical to Russian lit. The change in Evgenyi Onegin  is marked indeed. However, the character of Tatyana captivated me. Her faithfulness to herself and to her integrity is amazing.

movies,Looking for historical courtroom dramas,"Because of the nature of the work I do now,  I’ve become fascinated with how courtrooms are shown in tv and movies. It’s a convenient way to showcase moral dilemmas and human conflict, and it gets great performances out of actors.  

What I’m looking for, though, is movies that take place in historical versions of the standard courtroom drama. For arguments sake, by historical let’s say we mean before 1930. These courtroom settings could be either in a western or non-western country.

Two films made me think of this topic, and they coincidentally have the same lead actor and similar themes. The first one I saw was Le Colonel Chabert (1994), with Gerard Depardieu as a French cavalry officer presumed dead during the Napoleonic Wars. When he returns, he hires a lawyer to regain his inheritance from his remarried widow.    
The second, also starring Gerard Depardieu, was Le Retour de Martin Guerre (1982). In this one, a peasant in 16th century France leaves his wife and village to take part in the Hundred Years’ War. But the man who returns seems to be an imposter, and the village is divided on his identity.

movies,Galaxy Quest censorship theory.,"For those that haven't seen the movie, absolutely worth the watch, it is the best Star Trek movie made. There is a theory out there that talks about the movie censored a line to achieve a PG13 rating. A scene towards the end takes place where Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen have to navigate through a booby trap inside the ship. When Sigourney Weaver sees the trap, she exclaims ""Well, screw that!"" while mouthing the words ""Well, fuck that!"".

I have a second theory. The premise of the movie is the main characters are former actors of a show, much like Star Trek, and have washed up and struggling to get by. One day, Tim Allen is confronted by strange people at a convention. They claim that they are in danger, and Tim Allen is the only one who can help. He mistakes them as just kooky fans and agrees to meet with them thinking it is a gig. He is instead abducted and taken aboard a ship that is based off the ship on the show he was the star of.

It turns out, these aren't fans, they are a species of alien that have based their entire culture around Galaxy Quest, the TV show. Thinking the show was a factual documentary, they received the signals from earth and practically worshiped the show, replicating everything around them to be as accurate as it would have been in the show. To include how they speak.

TL;DR the aliens would have had something on the ship that would censor any curse words. The TV show was on national television in the 80's and would not have any curse words, therefore the aliens would not allow curse words.

Edit: Yes, I know the movie is known to have been more raunchy and likely has an R rated cut, this is more of a fan theory that gives it an in universe explanation.",JDubStep,1h9wx56,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,2024-12-09 00:16:35,0,0.26,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9wx56

movies,"I'm gonna defend the ""Liar revealed"" trope in Bug's life","I know people hate the ""Liar Revealed"" trope and im not gonna argue that this scene is actually a ""Masterfully done example"" of it or anything, but people always say the same thing regarding it.  ""Why do they care that Flik lied?  They have the giant bird! thats the plan now! why wouldnt that work?!?!""

But people are forgetting the overall context of Flik in the group.  Flik was a *continuous* screw-up before he went out to get the warrior bugs.  They literally sent him out of the colony to look for warriors just so they would have time to fix HIS major screw-up.  They were even arguing about what his punishment should be but couldnt figure one out cause he's apparently had, and subsequently messed up, every single job he's been given.  So they aren't discounting the bird plan because ""oh Flik lied so theres no way that plan will work.""  They're discounting it because he's literally **NEVER** had a plan that DIDNT make things worse.  

On top of that, they think him saying ""The Bird will Work"" is just him trying to cover his own Ego rather than to save everyone.  He lied about the Warrior bugs the ENTIRE time they were there and if the grasshoppers came, they would've been no help whatsoever without the bird plan.  NOT telling the truth actively put the entire colony at risk as they weren't rushing to gather extra food for the grasshoppers.  They think he kept the lie going to just protect HIMSELF, so him insisting on the bird plan sounds like he's still protecting HIMSELF over the colony.

Again, I understand people don't like the Liar revealed trope, and I won't say this is a 'groundbreaking' take on it or anything, but the ants don't think his plan will work cause he's screwed up every single idea he's ever had.  Its not just because ""oh he lied, therefore it wont work.""",Bladebrent,1h9vury,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9vury/im_gonna_defend_the_liar_revealed_trope_in_bugs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9vury/im_gonna_defend_the_liar_revealed_trope_in_bugs/,2024-12-08 23:24:47,0,0.42,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h9vury

Its not so much the actions, because a lot of people go through this. But watching the entire before and after is what the film captured well. It was seeing a characters candle extinguished.

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Secondly, since Ripley got the information that Zimmermann was not well on their first meeting (by Z's colleague or friend, I don't remember), was he the one who decided to use this information and ultimately sent the letter to Zimmermann?

movies,Movie age ratings can't be trusted and relied on by parents or anyone else that uses them as a guideline,"You got movies rated R like the Steve Jobs movie and The Kings Speech simply just because of some f words, while you got another R rated movie Saw 3D sharing the same rating for violent gory stuff. Also Wolf of Wall Street having the same R rating too.

Now you got PG-13 movies like School of Rock sharing the same rating as Split, The Dark Knight, 10 Cloverfield lane, and the Taken movies. These movies are way more extreme then School of Rock.

All these PG-13 movies I listed after School of Rock have more extreme inappropriate content then the higher R rated Kings Speech and Steve jobs movie.

Now imagine parents of children that blindly go off the age ratings just because it has a higher rating then how old their child is they don't let their children watch it.

You would rather want children to watch the R rated Steve Jobs and Kings Speech rather then PG-13 stuff like Split and The Dark Knight. There's many movies with a lower age rating that's more inappropriate then ones with a higher age rating and comparing movies that share the same rating are inaccurate too.

movies,Han’s Zimmer’s score for Interstellar,"I was fortunate enough to get IMAX 70MM tickets for a showing. Of Interstellar’s re-release last weekend.

Obvious love for the visuals aside. One thing that I did not appreciate when I saw this film 10 years ago was the stakes and what was happening to the characters. Being that this was Nolan’s first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could “solve” his movie like many tried to after Inception released.

I can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.

I read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. “Stay/Coop leaving Murph” in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. 

there is something so powerful in that composition that just had me losing it. It might be the idea that I’m becoming more open to becoming a father, but when the entire orchestral noise starts escalating as Coop is letting Tom have the truck, I am wailing for him to stay. 

And this was just for one of the compositions in this film. I can keep going on about how this element alone was truly amazing for a film like this.

movies,"In The Count of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviezel, I believe that after so many lies from Fernand and Mercedes, I believed that at the end of the film, Edmond became a misanthrope.","The adaptation with Jim Caviziel appears to be an unintentional parody of the book.

The scene of French high society going to an unknown foreign nobleman's party and him descending from a balloon seemed like a parody of the book. French high society was closed off and the Count acting like a nouveau riche would bring the contempt of the French elite to him. The Count needed someone to open the doors of high society for him. This scene had a comedic tone like the Monty Python movies.

Albert is kidnapped by Luigi's gang and a stranger with a sword appears out of nowhere and saves him, giving a lame excuse when it was supposed to arouse suspicion that the kidnapping was set up.

And the mediocre revenges of the terrible 2002 film. The Count uses the treasure to attract Fernand and Danglars , but it is such an obvious trap that anyone would suspect it and not fall for the trick.

And the way the Count makes Villefort confess to his crime, what an amateur thing. An experienced man like Villefort would never confess his crime with such an amateur trick as the one in the 2002 film.

It would be much better if the Count hired Luigi Vampa 's gang to execute Danglars and Villefort like Michael Corleone executed Moe Greene, Tattaglia and Barzini in the Godfather . And he strangles Fernand like Clemenza strangled Carlo Rizzi . Contrary  the logic of the book to inflict prolonged suffering on his adversaries, but it would be a smarter way for the count to get rid of his enemies.

And Edmond reconciling with Mercedes was hilariously poorly written. She was married for years to the man who sent Edmond to a dungeon and you would think there would be a happy ending for them. She shows him a ring and Edmond starts crying saying something worthy of a comedy: “Don't steal my hate, it's all I have.”  Only in the movies do these absurdities happen. In a realistic situation, he would never forget that Mercedes was married to Fernand for years and had sex with him, while he rotted at the Château D' If .

movies,The Departed 2006 - Second undercover cop.,"So there is a lot of back and forth on Delahunt being a cop or not. Most say it's ambiguous. Most say that Costello is right, when he says that police wanted them to believe he was a cop, to throw them off from the real one. 

But right now rewatching it, I noticed a little scene about 1:40 into the movie. So Sullivan is checking the names of the guys he was given in the envelope. He looks at the picture of Delahunt and yet when he types in his social security number, he gets an error noise, and a message that person is not found. We instantly cut back to Delahunt giving another guy pointers on how to find a cop. Sullivan types in another social security code, and we get a little beep sound like the computer accepted that one. Back on the street, Billy walks out and Delahunt jokingly calls him a cop. And back to Sullivan, he types in Billy's name, and gets another 'person not found' message, and error sound. So in a scene where Delahunt jokes about spotting cops, the two people Sullivan can't get info on at all, are Delahunt and Billy? And this happens just before everything with Delahunt, from him not ratting out Billy, to him being declared a cop on tv. So uhh, I don't think it was for no reason, that Sullivan got two errors on his computer. I think it was just a little hint that not everything about Delahunt was as it seems.

Also, when Billy said that he doesn't have a bank account, Delahunt was the only one to say that he is a cash business himself too.

Edit: for people saying that it was not ambiguous, well I read up on quite a few posts before making mine, and there is no clear answer. Some believe he was, others say that 10 years is too long to be undercover, and most just take Costello's word on it being disinformation (none of the cops confirm or deny it for the rest of the movie, so we don't get a clear answer from any other party than the news).",LegatoRedWinters,1h9ju5o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9ju5o/the_departed_2006_second_undercover_cop/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9ju5o/the_departed_2006_second_undercover_cop/,2024-12-08 14:21:12,0,0.44,0,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1h9ju5o

movies,"The Count of Monte Cristo (2024) - A terrible adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic. The screenwriters didn't understand that the Count would be a mix of Job, Joseph, Raskonilkov and Ulysses and made the Count a kind of masked vigilante.","

The Count of Monte Cristo from Alexandre Dumas' classic would be a story of Joseph (son of Jacob), Job , Raskonilkov (Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky ) and Ulysses ( the Oydsey by Homer )

 A man with a tragic past, many scores to settle, an insatiable thirst for justice and *a lot of* money to spend on it, who returns to his home country years after being struck by a tragedy, with new fighting skills, disguises and unlikely allies in his mission to bring vigilante justice to criminals, all while dressed almost eternally in a black uniform. If the reader thought “Batman!”, know that the author did too; but, according to the French, this is none other than Edmond Dantès , Alexandre Dumas’ Count of Monte Cristo. Apparently.

 

One would expect the French to have greater respect for their own literary heritage, but apparently not. The new French film adaptation of the work, starring Pierre Niney and acclaimed in France, though why is beyond this author’s comprehension, makes this abundantly clear. Dumas’s masterpiece is altered so significantly that it is once again virtually unrecognizable; once again it is transformed into a story that completely contradicts everything Dumas intended in his book. “The greatest revenge story of all time” is reduced to the most vulgar, superficial level of its existence—skin and bones, a melodramatic, caricatured serial novel.

Edmond Dantès de Niney is almost a superhero. He is an expert in hand-to-hand combat , undergoing a *training montage* which makes no sense at all – apparently, the Prisoner of Château d' If was hell, and yet he had enough strength, energy, space and freedom to train in combat with an Abbé Faria -, leaves his insignia as a mark after beating up several ""tough guys"" on a street corner (tough guys hired by him, let's make that clear), is always wearing a black coat almost reminiscent of a cape, has in his house (heavily produced by CGI) a closet that becomes a shooting target when he presses a button, and uses masks and latex prosthetics with an almost comical proficiency.

 

In many ways, the film is reminiscent of the French Netflix series “ Lupin ,” which adapts Arsene ’s classics. Lupin , the Burglar, for modernity. But “ Lupin ” is a modern adaptation, not a direct one – the series revolves around a fan of the books who commits crimes inspired by them in the 21st century, and does not directly adapt any story from the books featuring the character Arsene. Lupin – and, above all, one that doesn't take itself too seriously.

It is excellent for what it sets out to do, with all its absurdities and moments of comedy. If the new Monte Cristo had followed the same approach, the situation would be entirely different – this could be a more youthful, fun and intelligent adaptation of Dumas' wonderful book – but that is not what happens. The film wants to be taken seriously, and it wants to be a direct adaptation of Dumas' book, and that is why it fails.

The film is a modern, youthful, almost Marvel Cinematic approach. Universe – without considering itself as such, the main source of ridicule in this whole farce – of a classic that deserves much better than this. It adds totally unnecessary action scenes – including scenes of Monte Cristo fighting hand-to- hand with several men in the middle of the street *and* the infamous duel (in the case of this specific adaptation, one was not enough; there are *two* duels, one with pistols and one with swords, invented for the film for no reason other than to follow in the footsteps of its equally mediocre predecessors) that half the Monte Cristo adaptations insist on including, despite Dumas's deliberate choice to subvert the expectations of his genre and purposefully avoid cliché, and to compensate he cuts buckets and buckets of nuance and narrative delicacy.

 

It is clear that it is impossible to expect a perfect adaptation of a classic of over 1,500 pages into a film, even if that film is almost three hours long. Even the greatest classics of cinema, with all their brilliance, have not managed to do so – Gone with the Wind…, Ben-Hur , etc. Yet, these same classics – and other more modern ones, such as Les Misérables from 2012, for example (speaking of which, Victor Hugo has not slept in the Pantheon for decades because his grave neighbor, Dumas, has been struggling in his own coffin since at least 2002, when the adaptation of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviziel hit theaters. Please, someone help him.) – have already proven that it is possible to make a good adaptation of masterful, complex and, of course, immense books in a relatively short space of time. The secret is to preserve what really matters – and that is where Monte Cristo with Niney fails.

First of all, let's talk about the man of the moment: Edmond Dantès , *the* Count of Monte Cristo. What was done to Dumas' protagonist was outrageous. The problem is not exactly Niney - although he doesn't help either - but his characterization.

 

The clothes, the laughable aging, the disheveled hair, all of this contrasts so ridiculously with Dumas's elegant, refined, sophisticated, and utterly charming yet arrogant Monte Cristo, who took over Parisian society in the space of a few months, that it is hard to believe that the character is the same person. His methods are equally crass, and infinitely less sophisticated than those of his literary counterpart, and for this, the character suffers.

An excellent example of this tragic character deconstruction is what happens to Monte Cristo to save Albert. For some inexplicable reason – not even the shorter and, in theory, less concerned with details film of 2002 makes this mistake – the Italian narrative is completely omitted. So, so that Monte Cristo has an excuse to get close to Albert, he fakes a robbery himself, hiring men to do it, just to have the opportunity to beat them all up in the middle of the street and “save the boy’s life”.

A significant difference from the well-structured plan described in the book, during which Monte Cristo, over the course of several days, befriends and displays his immense wealth to Albert and his friend Franz D' Epinay during the Roman Carnival, arranging for the young man to eventually be kidnapped, and then negotiating his release with Luigi Vampa , the feared Italian bandit responsible for the crime – and Monte Cristo's debtor, who used his influence with the Pope to save the life of one of his men – for no money at all, thus ensuring that the two young men returned to Paris not only grateful and willing to do anything for their new friend, but also impressed and ready to spread throughout French high society fabulous stories about the legendary wealth, courage, phlegm and power of a man who has as much influence in the Vatican as in the European criminal underworld.

Dumas’s Count of Monte Cristo would never hire men just to beat them up. This is humiliating for a man who prided himself with an almost irritating sense of self-importance on his near-superhuman ability to do, well, anything. When the Count does fight someone, he fights them, period—and wins on his own merit. But most of all, Dumas’s Monte Cristo would *never* go toe-to-toe with “tough guys” on a street corner, even if the fight were paid for. He solves his problems with telegrams, money, and pistols, not *bartitsu* . He doesn’t lay a finger on *anyone* , and he’s all the more effective and lethal for it.

 

Adding violence in the name of action is a common problem with adaptations of Monte Cristo. The book is often classified as a “swashbuckler novel” – and while it is, to some extent, it is a simplistic classification, as Dumas is deliberate in avoiding certain clichés and common tropes of the genre.

He creates the entire scenario of the duel (an almost mandatory item to be included in this type of novel in the 19th century), for example, but purposely does not let it happen, subverting the expectations of his readers and making his story more sophisticated because of it – since the resolution to the duel occurs in a surprisingly beautiful and emotionally profound way, which makes a huge difference not only in the development of the characters' arcs but in the narrative as a whole – and it is a shame that adapters “correct” this perceived “failure” to align with the literary expectations of their supposed category. In this film, it is no different: two duels, in addition to the laughable fight in the middle of the street, are added to the story, always at the expense of complex and well-constructed narratives, which in the book involve the emotional and psychological state of the characters, and in the film are nothing more than action sequences without further details.

But if that were all, perhaps it would be possible to save the film. But, of course, it isn’t. As is customary in mediocre adaptations – yes, 2002, I’m talking to you directly – the villains of Monte Cristo are completely mischaracterized to such a crass level of exaggeration that it becomes childish. Due to lack of time, no doubt, but equally due to lack of imagination and understanding of the text, Villefort , Danglars and Mondego are transformed into people so devoid of any human characteristics that it is almost possible to hear the echo of an evil laugh every time one of them enters the room. This author more or less expected one of them to stroke his mustache maliciously while giving a speech about his infallible plan to dominate the world, *a la the* mad scientist from a children’s film – Dr. Heinz. Doofenshmirtz , the comedic villain from the Disney Channel cartoon “ Phineas and Ferb ,” is frankly a more intelligently written and less stereotypical character.

Dumas’ characters are men who can be found in any high society salon today, just as they might have been in his time: family men, with varying degrees of love for their children and wives and involvement in domestic life; businessmen, with varying degrees of competence and probity; well-liked men , very pleasant and sometimes even too nice. Men, in short, ordinary, but with more than one terrible secret. Men who have their qualities, but succumb to their weaknesses – ambition, greed, passion, flattery, instincts of survival and self-preservation – all too often. These are the nuances that make them so real, so credible and so despicable, without, at one time or another, we fail to feel some degree of sympathy for one or two of them. These are the nuances so undignifiedly thrown out the window, like the corpses in The Prisoner. of Château d' If , for this production.

Let’s start with Fernand. Following the pattern established on other occasions – most famously by the 2002 film starring Caviziel – Mercedes’ envious cousin can’t just be that; he *has to be* Dantès ’ best friend . How, after all, are we supposed to know he’s a despicable person if he doesn’t betray *his best friend* out of jealousy and ambition? How, oh my God, can we not like a villain if he’s not completely and irremediably that – despicable? And he’s rich, of course. Don’t let Dumas’s poor, ambitious Mondego, willing to do anything to climb the career ladder, appear on a movie screen. He has to be a rich nobleman and, let’s not forget, *despicable* from the start, or he won’t do. He’s so caricatured that – and here the author assures us she’s not joking, despite what it might seem – he wears an eyepatch. Is there anything more appropriate for a cartoon villain than an eyepatch ?

He and Dantès have a showdown at the end of the film – a sword duel that never happens in the literary counterpart of the story, and which has none of the dignity of Dumas. The author's Monte Cristo never crosses swords with Morcef , he is too calculating for that. His revenge is much more sophisticated, and ends with Morcef himself committing suicide – too cowardly, and perhaps too disturbed, to even consider going through with a duel with the newly revealed Edmond Dantès . Far superior, without a doubt, is Monte Cristo's foolish display of mercy when he defeats his enemy and lets him live, something simultaneously out of character and meaningless for the construction of the narrative as it was.

Danglars is made equally over-the-top in his villainy, which is a shame, as he was already brilliantly *despicable* and, frankly, disgusting in the original, and didn't need these additions - but he gets them, of course. In Dumas's book, the character was an accountant who had ambitions to become captain of the Pharaon , and who becomes jealous when the young First Mate, Dantès , is promoted to the position. After Dantès 's arrest , he receives the promotion, and eventually leaves the sea life to become a corrupt and greedy banker who puts money above all else - including his family. In the film, he is already captain, and is demoted from the position, which is given to Dantès , after refusing to save a drowning woman, which Dantès does in his place.

 

He rises in the world by becoming a slave trader. He is directly responsible for the destruction of the Morrel family , sabotaging their ships – the Morrels ’ situation in the book is simply a natural case of bad luck, with their ships sinking over the years – and leading Morrel to die in poverty – something that, once again, does not happen, because in the book Dantès is able to save his friend from suicide *in extremis* , an occasion that, in fact, serves to show the good side of the protagonist, who makes a point of rewarding those who were good to him over the years before punishing those who did him wrong, without ever denouncing himself as the author of their good deeds. Danglars finally comes to effectively admit with pride that he is a brute in his first lines – in case the rest of the story is not enough for the audience to realize it, of course.

Danglars is one of the most unbearable and realistic villains in his work, precisely because he is an extremely ordinary man - corrupt, cowardly, envious, greedy, selfish, affected, unctuous, sycophantic, ridiculous in his petty pettiness. He has no legitimate reason to feel wronged by Dantès - the position of captain was never his, and in fact it made more sense as a natural promotion for the First Mate than for the accountant, anyway. He makes his wealth like countless men before him - by stealing from the poor and from the public coffers. He sells himself to men richer than himself – opening the doors of his house to the billionaire Count of Monte Cristo without thinking twice, when moments before he had tried to belittle him, unaware of his absurd amount of money, and accepting Prince Andrea Cavalcanti as his son-in-law without even bothering to check anything about his life, all in the name of the title of prince –, he practically auctions off his daughter to the buyer – read, future husband – willing to pay the most, and accepts his wife's humiliating affair with the journalist Lucien Debray , who goes out in public with Danglars 's wife and daughter and visits his mistress at her husband's house, with him present, in exchange for inside information on the stock exchange. There was no need to change such a brilliant villain precisely because he was so good at generating disgust. He was already terrible enough in his own pettiness.

And what about Villefort , the most complex of all the three villains in Monte Cristo? Dumas's Villefort is not, at first, a bad man; just ambitious and insecure. He knows that Dantès is innocent and is about to release him; however, when he discovers that the letter that was used to incriminate the boy was written by his father, and that his career could be completely ruined by it, he decides to keep him imprisoned. This simple but perfectly plausible and reasonable story is replaced by one of the biggest changes in the 2024 film – Villefort 's father , Noitier , is replaced by his sister, Angele (nonexistent in Dumas's narrative), whom Dantès saves from drowning, and who is carrying a letter for Napoleon. Not only does Villefort arrest the man who saved his sister's life, he is violent towards her, hanging her until she is nearly dead, and then handing her over to Danglars to turn into a prostitute-slave. Years later, Monte Cristo finds her destroyed by years of sexual servitude, and she dies soon after.

The Villefort of the 2024 film is so cartoonish that he is not even given the family he has in the book – a bad man cannot , it seems, care for his children, care for his father, or have a wife. This not only eliminates one of the most unusual plot lines in the book – that Villefort ’s second wife , Heloise, is a serial killer who is murdering all the family members to ensure that Villefort ’s inheritance goes entirely to her son, Edouard – but it considerably diminishes the complexity of Monte Cristo’s revenge, both in terms of his actions themselves and in terms of the moral and emotional depth of it for both Villefort and Monte Cristo himself.

The fact that he dies is tragic – after all, the book's revenge is delicious precisely because Villefort stays alive and is forced to live with all his worst nightmares coming true at once. All of this, however, is sacrificed for a simple death and a villain without a shred of humanity – and, if that weren't enough, the director makes a point of placing hanged bodies rotting in front of Villefort 's office , in case, once again, his villainy wasn't obvious.

This destruction of the characters is sad to watch, because all three are some of the best, most real and human individuals ever created by the author. Dumas' villains are real men, and *for that reason* they are despicable; because they are men like those we can find in various sectors of society, in real life, today, as we could find before. Because they are not monsters, just corrupt, petty and cowardly people . Real-life villains.

How many slave traders, pimps for their own sisters, and forgers of the imprisonment and disgrace of their best friends were walking around in 19th-century France? A certain number, no doubt, but nowhere near as many as the politicians, bankers, military men, and civil servants who embezzle public funds, issue convictions bought for their own interests, commit crimes that remain hidden abroad, get rid of the children they have with their mistresses, forge entire careers on flattery and political changes at the right time, and trample on probity, justice, honesty, and, above all, on poor, nameless innocents as if they were the dust under their shoes. How many *of these* were there in Dumas’s France? How many of these are there today?

Are they not deserving enough of an audience's hatred?

The adaptation's allergy to nuance and realism in the balance between good and evil, however, also works in reverse: at least two bad characters from Dumas's book are redeemed in a completely inexplicable way in the film, becoming heroic and admirable figures that would surprise Dumas himself. They are Caderrouse and Benedetto.

There is not much to say about Caderrouse ; it is enough to point out that, while in the book he is a man so greedy that he kills his wife – and meets his own death – for money (but who, despite this, feels remorse for his role as a passive observer in the imprisonment of the innocent Dantès ), in the film he becomes a man who is presented with a diamond and refuses it in the name of his moral principles.

Benedetto, also known as Prince Andrea Cavalcanti, is a special case: the character in the book is, in fact, a psychopath or something like that, being not only a terrible criminal, but also willing to torture his (adoptive) mother and kill his supposed father (he believes he is the illegitimate son of Monte Cristo, whom he tries to murder. Eventually, he discovers he is the son of Villefort ). Millions of leagues away from the Benedetto of the 2024 film – a progressive hero willing to marry a lesbian woman to help her hide her interest in women, kind, polite, and who lives as an adopted son of Monte Cristo, who has great affection for him (significantly different from Dumas's Monte Cristo's opinion of Benedetto, which, in his own words, disgusts him).

Benedetto's death – nonexistent in the book – while taking revenge on his father, Villefort , is one of the saddest and, in theory, most emotionally charged moments in the film, and it is what makes Monte Cristo doubt the justice of his actions. It took the place of the death of Edouard de Villefort , Villefort 's young son . And, of course, it makes no sense. After all, Monte Cristo begins to have doubts after seeing his revenge result in the death of an innocent man – a seven-year-old child who had no connection with his father's crimes and no part in his plan. How is it possible to transfer this same degree of guilt for the death of a boy who was as interested in revenge as he was – after all, Benedetto in the film also wanted to end Villefort , and dies doing so – and who participated willingly and enthusiastically in his plan? The answer is “impossible”. The choice renders much of Dantès 's doubts meaningless or, at the very least, out of proportion, and eliminates some of the most dramatic scenes and most significant moments of the narrative in its wake.

Early in his revenge plot in the 2024 film, Dantès goes to a church and angrily tells Jesus that from now on he will do what God was clearly unwilling to do – serve justice. Although dramatic – reminiscent of Bram ’s Dracula Stoker with Gary Oldman , even -, the scene once again contradicts everything Dumas writes in his book. The literary Count of Monte Cristo would not commit this kind of blasphemy, not necessarily out of immense faith and fear of God, but because he sees things in a completely different way.

One of the main themes of Dumas's “The Count of Monte Cristo” is the *Dies Irae* , divine wrath. This is because the Count himself positions himself as an agent of divine providence, and justifies all his actions as being part of God's will. He understands that he was rescued from D' If and gifted with his fabulous fortune to serve as a divine agent who dispenses justice like the God of the Old Testament, and that it is God's will that his vengeance be carried out. He would never ""argue"" with Jesus about his lack of action, because he understands that everything that happened to make him a Count was his action. He is not acting because God did not do it; he is acting because God compels him. And this aspect is fundamental not only for the symbolic and thematic integrity of the narrative constructed by Dumas, but also for the psychological aspect of the protagonist, who feels perfectly justified in his notion of justice and bases many of his actions on this reasoning.

 

This erasure of themes linked to the Old Testament – which is explored in the book, by the way, through a much more philosophical than religious approach – is also connected to several disappearances of characters extremely relevant to the story, but which the film cuts out completely: Maximilien Morrel , Luigi Vampa , Bertuccio , Edouard de Villefort , Heloise de Villefort , Monsieur Noitier , Hermine Danglars , Valentine de Villefort , Franz D' Epinay , and, of course, the modification of the roles of characters such as Haydée, Benedetto and Caderrousse . These disappearances have gigantic consequences for the plot, which has to be developed in a completely different way to accommodate the absence of certain characters, since Dumas structured his narrative in such a way that even the most insignificant events and minuscule characters are fundamental to the functioning of the story.

It is important to realize that almost all of the characters mentioned are members of certain characters' families. There are a number of implications for each of these cuts individually, but as a collective example, nothing better than the Villefort axis of the narrative: after all, without Heloise de Villefort , Hermine Danglars , Noitier , Edouard , Valentine and Morrel , how does Gerard de Villefort 's Monte Cristo get revenge ? The 2024 film resolves this with a death at the hands of Benedetto, something reasonably better than his senseless death in the 2002 film, but a simplistic solution when compared to the sophistication and true family drama that Dumas' Edmond engenders, involving poisons, serial murders, a faked death, an illegitimate son, an Italian criminal, a baby buried alive and a high-caliber public trial, resulting in the judge going mad, who begins to dig up his backyard in search of the son he had buried two decades earlier, having his reputation - the very thing he condemned Dantès to protect - ruined and his family torn apart.

Similarly, what prompts the Count of Monte Cristo to reflect on the justice of his revenge if there is no little Edouard there ? Haydée, the adaptation says, for the princess reminds the Count of the price of his revenge after the death of the reformed Benedetto, for whom Monte Cristo and she herself have great affection. It has already been discussed why Benedetto as a catalyst for this particular drama does not work, and now it remains to speak briefly of the implications of this for the character of Haydée.

This act of killing an innocent person that leads to questioning his actions , precedes Raskonilkov in Crime and Punishment. He kills the innocent, Lizaveta . Ivanovna  who was the pawnbroker 's sister Alyona Ivanovna made Raskonilkov question his theory about the Great Man, that extraordinary men in the name of the common good could transgress social rules.

Haydée is a character who is often misunderstood , and this time was no different. The fact that she appears in the film is already a great victory – most adaptations don’t even bother to do this – but that doesn’t mean that her character wasn’t, as expected, destroyed. It’s easy to think of Haydée as a mere accessory, one more detail in the calculated identity created by Edmond Dantès to enchant Paris as a millionaire, eccentric and orientalist aristocrat – and therein lies one of the great misinterpretations of the work. Not only does Haydée play a major role in the revenge plot that the Count has been hatching for a decade, but the revenge in question is also hers: one of the men who wrongly accused Dantès , taking him to prison in D' If , to marry his then fiancée, Mercedes, is the same one who betrayed her father's trust, killed him, and sold Haydée and her mother into slavery – Fernand Mondego, the Count of Morcef .

Haydée is as vengeful as Monte Cristo. She is angry. She is deceitful, and she is a match for the Count in every way, part of a Machiavellian duo who have spent years plotting revenge. Haydée is not simply a pawn on Monte Cristo’s chessboard, much less the voice of conscience on his shoulder: for all we know, she is his partner in the game, and does more to encourage him than to stop him. Like him, she has suffered immensely at the hands of her enemies, and like him she has a deep desire for revenge. There is, however, one fundamental difference between the two: unlike Edmond, Haydée seems immune to any kind of remorse.

This is the fundamental aspect of their relationship—a sadly underdeveloped aspect of the Count-Princess dynamic in many adaptations, and one that is effectively ignored in 2024. Haydée may be a source of peace for Monte Cristo, but she is certainly not a numbing agent. She does not help him forget the demons that haunt him, because her presence in his life is entirely conditioned by the existence of those demons. He would never have met her if he had not been searching for ways to disgrace the man who put him in prison. Haydée is not oblivion: she is a reminder of the horrors committed by those whom Edmond destroyed, and that he was justified in his anger. And unlike him, Haydée seems to be completely at peace and content with everything that has happened.

She has no doubts – and perhaps that helps Edmond feel at peace. And, in the end, she is also probably the only person in Dumas’s entire narrative who gets everything she wants. To take that away from her – to make her a young woman in love with *Albert* , completely ignoring her narrative function as Dantès ’s romantic partner , and to make her a spokesperson for remorse and morality on the Count’s shoulder – is to diminish and decomplexify one of Dumas’s brilliant and forgotten female characters, who are once again relegated to clichés of goodness and honor.

 Haydee bears a certain resemblance to Sonia Marmeladova from Crime and Punishment. Sonia offers Raskonilkov hope for happiness and a new beginning after he confesses his crime, just as Haydee offers the Count of Monte Cristo the chance for a new beginning after he forgives Danglars . Just as Job had lost everything and gained back twice as much as he had lost, so too did Monte Cristo.

The addition of melodrama doesn’t leave even the inanimate objects untouched: Monte Cristo’s treasure gets a new origin story, so dramatic that it might deserve its own book. It passes through the hands of the Borgias , the famously cruel French king Philip IV the Fair, and the *Knights Templar* – of which Abbé Faria is the last, by the way (At this point, Dumas begins to convulse in his coffin. Émile Zola, his other grave neighbor who is also being prevented from sleeping, accuses the screenwriter who decided that this was a good idea) – before reaching the hands of the sailor from Marseille. Speaking of Faria, he dies from fatal injuries after being crushed in an escape attempt – much more dramatic and less plausible than the death of the Faria in the books, due to a health condition that runs in his family and seems to be something like epilepsy.

 The aforementioned romance between Albert and Haydée – which makes no narrative or thematic sense whatsoever – is another one of those additions that turn the book into a soap opera-like melodrama for no reason at all. How does it happen? We don't know; the film doesn't bother to develop this aspect of the narrative well, certainly not well enough to justify such absurdity ( *please* , think of Hugo and Zola). All we know is that Albert and Haydée decide to run away together, madly in love, even though Albert's father killed Haydée's father, and Haydée was instrumental in the downfall of Albert's father – and family. Monte Cristo forces her to tell him this , of course, because what would become of this romance *a la* Romeo and Juliet if the drama were not made explicit to the entire audience?

That it was a poorly told story is bad enough, but the real problem here is what it means for the arcs of both characters. Haydée’s literary function is, as we’ve already established, to be Monte Cristo’s perfect match; Albert’s is to be a young dandy who develops and becomes a better man through the influence, destructive as it was, of the Count, as he abandons his family’s money and name and renounces all pleasure to enlist in the French army and go fight in Africa as a common man, building his new name, reputation, and wealth from scratch to atone for his father’s crimes—though he didn’t have to.



The ending of the 2024 film is unsatisfying for all possible audiences. On the one hand, those who have not read or care little about Dumas's work generally expect Monte Cristo to end his days married to Mercedes , the ending popularized by many adaptations, including, most famously, the 2002 one. An ending that is exactly the opposite of everything Dumas wanted to say with his book, by the way.

Those who have read the book and are genuinely interested in the author's message, however, expect to see the ending as he wrote it: with Monte Cristo avenged, satisfied but feeling some weight of guilt, sailing east to end his days living as a mistress in the company of Haydée. Not because this is a sugary happy ending – on the contrary, the way it is written, it is quite tempered by a good dose of bitterness – but because it is the right ending.

At the end of 2024’s “ The Count of Monte Cristo,” Monte Cristo is alone. He has achieved his revenge, but he has lost people he cared about, he has suffered immensely, and above all, he has his doubts, however well hidden behind a stoic facade they may be, about the validity of his actions, instilled in him by Haydée de Janina , by Benedetto’s death, and perhaps even by his choice to spare Fernand’s life. He leaves Paris and goes away, leaving a letter behind addressed to Mercedes. A harsh ending, which almost seems to indicate that revenge is not worth it—a point that has been made a thousand times before, and which would have been reasonable if the entire film had not made such a point of making its villains so caricatured and its protagonist so “super-heroic” in his quest for retribution that it borders on incoherent, and above all, if Dumas himself had not written a book that says exactly the opposite.

Dantès even flirts with repentance. That’s all it takes: he is reaffirmed in his revenge time and time again, and even receives a “posthumous message” from his mentor, Faria , which says, “You will tear out the teeth of dragons, and you will trample lions under your feet, says the Lord.” If Dumas had drawn it, he wouldn’t have been so explicit. Dumas’s Edmond is justified in his revenge, he feels that way, and the narrative sees him as such. Casting doubt on this could be an interesting philosophical discussion, but it doesn’t serve an adaptation of the work.

The problem here, as in so many other cases, is a simple misunderstanding of the author’s intent. “The Count of Monte Cristo” has become so widely known as “the greatest revenge story of all time” that for many it has been reduced to that very thing. Let’s not misunderstand: Monte Cristo is indeed a revenge story, and arguably the most essential of them all, in that it has definitively influenced the genre as a whole, including its imitations, such as Ben-Hur , and its subversions, such as Les Misérables. But the point of the story , for Dumas, was never revenge. That’s the fun part, of course. Who doesn’t feel a sense of personal satisfaction when the men who sent an innocent man to prison in order to secure his love, his money, and his reputation end up dead, bankrupt, and disgraced, respectively? These are the narratives that have kept the story, published in installments over the course of a year in a newspaper, interesting to the public for so long. But when you get to the very end—in those final chapters after everything is over—you realize the author had something more important to say. This is not just a story of revenge. It is the story of the fall and rise of a man who was young, and is no longer. Who was innocent, and is no longer. Who was good, and is no longer sure if he still is.

movies,Equalizer 3,"So I put Equalizer 3 on last night. I watched the two first movies some time ago and honestly can't remember much from them other than I kind of enjoyed Denzel using wits to make life miserable for some bad guys. Classic action stuff.

The third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.

Some ups and downs:
+Denzel glooming
+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again
+Nice location
-Boring villain
-Slow pacing
-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie

I came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him. He then negotiated that number down to three and this movie is the result.",MrIzeMan,1h9h99e,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9h99e/equalizer_3/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9h99e/equalizer_3/,2024-12-08 11:51:32,59,0.76,59,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h9h99e

movies,Click (2006) is A Christmas Carol done horribly,"So, both of these stories have the core idea the protagonist must appreciate what they have and live in the moment, rather than focus on their career. And both receive a future vision where things have ended badly.

That is what the story beats of Click clearly intend, but it's incompetent to have its cake. Like the way the third act is filmed, it wants you to think it's a bad future and you should feel bad for Sandler's character. Except, the future in Click isn't actually bad.

* Sandler's daughter has become a successful model

* Sandler's son has become a talented manager in his company and has found a wife

But Sandler's character thinks these are all bad developments. He hates his wife's new husband for no reason, looks down on the modeling career of his daughter, and thinks his son will waste his life by focusing on his career (like he did). The only remotely sad thing that happens in that timeline is the father being shunned before dying.

movies,Should long movies have intermissions?,"I recently watched Wicked. It's a great movie, check it out if you got the time. But it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. A 10-minute intermission would be cool. It would allow the audience to get up, get some more popcorn, and use the washroom. That being said; not all movies need one. If the movie is just 90 minutes long, an intermission would not make any sense. So only movies that are longer than 120 minutes (might) need one.

movies,A lot of people think Batman (1989) was the first dark comic book movie. I think an argument can be made that popeye (1980) really was the first.,"Sorry in advance if this take is 2 edgy 4 U. 

Batman clearly made the blueprint for a blockbuster dark super hero movie but in many ways it followed in the footsteps of Popeye. When execs were putting together a Popeye movie they asked Oscar winning comic artist Tony award winning play write, Jules Fieffer, to direct the movie. He pitched them a dark movie based on the dark comic books not the commercially friendly cartoon show. They liked the idea and went with it. This ended up caused what was considered to be a commercial flop.

Today the movie enjoys a better legacy. It has iconic performances from a young robin williams and Shelly Duvall. I think what we forget is the fact that the reason it was a failure isn’t was based on the dark comics not the cheerful cartoon show. This was exactly the angle tim Burton did with Batman leading to massive commercial success.

movies,Review of Flow 2024,"I approached Flow with high expectations based on its marketing and glowing reviews, particularly regarding its visuals. Unfortunately, it fell short of these promises. The animation, though praised for it's style, felt outdated reminiscing of a role-playing video game back from 2012. While the limited budget was outlined by many, objective ratings should compare Flow to the leaders in the industry, like Dinsey or Pixar.

The film started with intriguing ideas and concepts, but I found it to lack depth and development. It focused heavily on illustrating the flow of life and nature without offering meaningful character arcs and development, to me it felt too superficial. In my opinion stories should engage, inspire, and challenge it's viewers or readers, but again Flow remained superficial and repetitive. Furthermore, it struggled to define its target audience, too slow, long and abstract for children, yet too shallow for adults. This left it in a no-man's land, catering to neither side.

I was really excited for the absence of dialogue, but it felt like a let down. Watching the film felt like a chore, without any emotional payoff. It sure was worth seeing once for curiosity, but I wouldn't watch it again. I'd rate the film give or take a 5-6/10. I think Flow is a film you definitely want to watch in the cinema, and not on your TV.

To be clear, I'm not a professional critic, and the point of this post isn't to bash or devalue the film, I think they did a great job for the shoestring budget they had, but these are my honest thoughts questioning the ""glowing"" reviews Flow has received.

movies,"Gulliver's Travels with Jack Black it doesn't even manage to be a fun parody of Jonathan Swift's book,","Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear.

What is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose. 

the film gives us  two woozy love interests and a multitude of over-the-top jesters (also guised in the form of kings and generals). The overall story has whittled down to the bare minimum of Liliputs and conflicting kingdoms, but apart from the that the connection is non-existent.

movies,I really miss natural dialogue in animated movies,"This is something I’ve noticed for years—ever since I was a kid watching these movies in theaters—and lately, I’ve been hyperfixating on it because I feel like no one ever talks about it. I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

In movies like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Shrek, Madagascar, El Dorado, etc., the dialogue feels semi-realistic. The characters sound like they’re having genuine conversations, the kind of exchanges you could imagine real people having. It feels natural, almost as if some of it were improvised. It’s as though the writers treated these films as legitimate storytelling, not just “animated kids’ movies.” They gave the characters real depth and personality rather than relying on the gimmick of “silly talking animals.”

This approach wasn’t exclusive to Pixar and DreamWorks either. Movies like Surf’s Up, Ice Age, Rango, Happy Feet, and Coraline had a similar feel. I think what really made it work were the performances—both the writing and the voice acting elevated the characters.

It seems like this style of writing started fading around the time Illumination became popular, which I find really sad. That said, there are some recent examples that capture this feeling, like Klaus, the Spider-Verse films, and Soul. It’s not entirely gone. You also see it in many adult animated shows like The Simpsons, Family Guy, Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, and even in a lot of video games.

It’s hard for me to put into words, but does anyone else know what I’m talking about? Is there a name for this style of writing or dialogue?",Ling_B,1h994xw,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h994xw/i_really_miss_natural_dialogue_in_animated_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h994xw/i_really_miss_natural_dialogue_in_animated_movies/,2024-12-08 02:51:22,0,0.39,0,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h994xw
movies,The Return,"Just finished watching The Return with my wife, and we both enjoyed it. I’m a fan of the Classics and knew the story pretty well. She thought she’d read some Homer in high school, but didn’t know the story. 

Here’s a quick rundown of our thoughts:

	•	Ralph Fiennes is fantastic, as usual. His performance alone is worth watching, and he definitely deserves a Best Actor nod.
	•	Fiennes spends a lot of the film basically naked, and it’s clear he trained hard for the role—impressive dedication!
	•	The movie focuses only on the final third of The Odyssey and takes a few liberties with the story. But the key plot points are there and handled well.
	•	Visually, it’s stunning. The set design and cinematography are top-notch.
	•	The pacing was my one gripe—it drags at times and could’ve used a tighter edit.
	•	One major omission: the gods are completely absent. A big part of Homer’s original was the divine meddling, and the movie doesn’t even mention them. Homer would not approve!

movies,"For such an all star cast, The Departed failed to deliver spectacularly","I’m baffled by the cult following of *The Departed*. This overhyped, overrated film is a prime example of style over substance. The plot is convoluted, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is subpar. It’s a pretentious, self-indulgent mess that tries too hard to be edgy and gritty.

The pacing is sluggish, the dialogue is clunky, and the ending is a complete letdown. If you’re looking for a good crime drama, save yourself the time and watch something else. Seriously, anything else.

Jack Nicholson's performance was a hammy, over-the-top caricature of a Boston gangster. His dialogue was cringe-worthy, his mannerisms were exaggerated, and his accent was as just laughable. It's a shame an experienced actor had such a mediocre performance.

Di caprio seems lost, struggling to find his footing in a role that demanded nuance and subtlety. His performance lacked any intensity and authenticity.

movies,What if Marlon Brando was in The Great Gatsby (1974)?,"What if Marlon Brando was in the 1974 adaptation of The Great Gatsby?

This is an interesting story, Robert Evans, who was involved with this production, sought Marlon Brando for the role. Although Marlon Brando was too old for the part, at 49, Evans wanted him in large part due to The Godfather &amp; Last Tango In Paris reestablishing him as a box office star.

Incensed at his loss of income when he surrendered his profit participation points for $100,000 to Paramount before the release of *The Godfather*, Brando personally negotiated his deal, demanding an unprecedented salary reportedly as high as $4 million salary (I think for both Great Gatsby &amp; Godfather II), frankly revealing that the high salary would recoup his losses from the sale of his points.

However, Gulf + Western CEO Charles Bludhorn, whose conglomerate owned Paramount, vetoed any such deal on the grounds that the two movies were separate entities. As a result, Brando turned down The Great Gatsby and also refused to appear in Godfather II, feeling he was being disrespected.

I think Brando would of been interesting, though too old, but I find interesting not doing this film actually resulted in him not doing his cameo in Godfather II. Ultimately, I think the film would of been the same as From what I read, the director, Jack Clayton, pretty much ignore the nuances of the script that was written. (Coppola wrote the script and everyone who read it thought it was brilliant, but Coppola said, ""Not that the director paid any attention to it. The script that I wrote did not get made.""

Are there movies that take on a broader or more impactful meaning if you’ve been around to watch them unfold across time?

For example, something like the Star Wars series, where each trilogy was released in a different era, could take on a unique perspective for someone who saw the original trilogy in theaters and then followed each new installment as it was released. Or Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049—two films that are in conversation with each other, with each reflecting the fears and aesthetics of their own times but creating a larger message about humanity and technology when viewed together.

What other film series might work like this, where seeing them spread out over time creates an overarching story or resonance that wouldn’t be as impactful if binge-watched all at once?",BigPoonDaddy,1h93pti,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h93pti/is_there_a_series_of_movies_released_decades/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h93pti/is_there_a_series_of_movies_released_decades/,2024-12-07 22:15:05,0,0.39,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h93pti

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Sweden,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Spain. It's interesting, because more than 100 comments later, in a way, we have a ""fpreign-but-not-so-foreign"" winner here: Internationally, ***El labertino del fauno*** (engl.: *Pan's Labyrinth)* is likely to be the best-known film on our list so far.

But [our official letterboxd list ](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)immediately calls for the next movie. We now move on to the next euorpean country with S, namely **Sweden**. Just like yesterday, there are only two rules to follow today:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"[Movie Search] Animated kid Christmas movie ca 2014-2016, does anyone know it?","Edit: It has been solved, its called ""Santas magical crystal""
If the mods wanna take it down because its been solved they can do it


Hi reddit, as you can see from the title I'm looking for a animated christmas movie that aired on tv back in 2014-2016 (i think) in german on Super RTL. Its a kids movie with an art style similar to 'lady bug catnoir' and 'scooby doo mystery incorporated'.

The main character a boy about 10-12 somehow ends up with Santa claus fighting an evil black bearded santa with a trio of elf girl special forces. These girls have some aort of levitation-y power that the can use by tapping a snowflake on the left side of their neck around where the big vein is.
The girls end up getting trapped and about to be hit by either some deathly laser machine or sunk into lava or an shredder. The MC reacues them by them sharing their levitation with him and at the end fight the evil santa gets the good santas power to clone himself hundreds of time.
The end fight happens in this big room with moving rings around it thats similar to a ""Grand Orrery Model of the Solarsystem"" where you can also get teleported to the houses (i think).
I also remeber the leader of the trio force to first hate the mc and then be more friendly to the end because he rescued them all.

I will try to answer any further questions as far as i can, also i can only remember it as above since i was 10ish myself when i first saw it on tv.",St2rnch2n,1h931fd,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h931fd/movie_search_animated_kid_christmas_movie_ca/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h931fd/movie_search_animated_kid_christmas_movie_ca/,2024-12-07 21:43:16,4,0.7,4,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h931fd

Reasons -
1. Guru Baba Shakt calls him son, which he replies don't call me that.
2- we don't see his father in the movie only his mother.
3- The head of police calls his mother a whore when the village got raided. Also why did the head of police go into her house and why didn't his team burn it down straight away like the other homes. 

So it suggests that his mother was previously known by them.

movies,Babygirl full review ,"Babygirl: 

electric, hot and sexy, pulse racing, arousing, erotically thrilling, submissively wicked. Nicole Kidman in her best performance of recent memory. 

Babygirl is exactly what it promised to be… an erotic and powerful story of forbidden pleasure. The director Halina Reijn does a super job here in her style of directing and her script writing skills. The tension is felt as if an explosion good go off at any second. A very underrated part of the movie is the cinematography, visually this film is nothing short of stunning,. A shout out to the editors too who have done a brilliant job here. The story as a whole has depth and intrigue that’ll keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat. 

Now on to Nicole Kidman. I said at the start of this review that this is her best performance of recent memory, and I stand by that. The way she portrays the coldness of her character as well as the open vulnerability is perfectly balanced. Harris Dickinson also completely shows again how good he is in anything he does, his control over Nicole Kidman’s character is mesmerizing and intense. Antonio Banderas has more to do in this movie than I initially expected him to have, especially towards the end where he has to dig deep into his emotional range. 

With all that said I understand Babygirl will not be for everyone. Whilst it’s tasteful and respectful in its eroticism, it can be awkward and uncomfortable to sit through for some audiences. 

Finally I just want to give a minor grievance I have which is the story at times can feel clouded where it leaves you the viewer to puzzle together some motives. Apart from that a very solid movie with excellent performances. 

Babygirl = 7/10

Any other movies with comedic bits as a side story that get more ridiculous as the movies goes on?","Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.

It just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying ""jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore"" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. 

Of course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic.

movies,Listing hidden heroes,"Can anyone list other hidden heroes in movies please, please read description

Hey everyone, I’m trying to collect a bunch of scenes from random movies with essentially side characters which save or try to save people or fight off villains and die or get knocked out in the process. A realistic, good depiction of someone. They don’t have to be in it for long(the lesser the better, it’s meant to be “red shirts” who surprisingly put up a decent fight) If you know any like these please let me know, you might think watch any action movie but literally there are so few with any good depiction let alone other genres.
Some examples(non-exhaustive) are below:
The Living Daylights: MI6 agent Green Four(disguised as a butler) fights Necros in a long creative fight and he even manages to burn Necros’s hand, but is eventually knocked out
The call- a guy at a gas station is killed trying to save the woman and a guy is killed after calling 911

Alone- An old guy fights off a young guy for ages in order to protect a woman and gets killed
See for me- A policewoman radioes for backup, cuffs one of the guys, shoots another, struggles vigorously with another before being killed. 
Turbulence-One of the air martiales fights off a henchman for a long time before being killed
Along came a spider- A fisherman tries to save the girl in the water but is killed
Jaws 2- Heli Pilot(which of no fault of his own but the fault of the script has no one like Brody or the kids tells him there’s a shark so he doesn’t take precautions but tries to save the kids) and Marge(who saves Sean)

Jaws 3- Fitzroyce shoots the shark, tries to swim back up but is caught in the shark’s mouth. He then tries to get out and can’t so he tries to blow himself up with the shark but can’t pull the pin because he’s crushed. This grenade is used in the finale.
Skyfall- Court police shoot loads of times at henchmen and one of the officers kills one of the henchmen off screen and another officer gets shot and keeps shooting
Die hard 3- vault guard calls for backup, fires loads of shots and is brave but is killed
Totally Killer- The mother fights the killer amazingly before being killed
Octopussy-The agent disguised as a clown puts up a good fight and runs for his life and completes his mission before collapsing dead
Hitmans bodyguard- convoy scene is great it’s pretty equal on both sides

Bad examples:
Air Force one- there are so many officers compared to henchmen and they kill ZERO I repeat ZERO henchmen despite being presidential security
Malignant- omg the police station scene has so many officers who run to the killer before shooting……..
Salt- Same issue, there’s some army head who rushes the bad agent before getting his gun out…
Die hard- pick any movie, I’ll give it the minimal credit for having one henchman be killed by the swat team but omg that’s awful
Mission impossible-convoy dream sequence where like 30 cops are killed and 2 henchmen
Turbulence- the last air martial to die literally doesn’t fire when he could while other martial is fighting the henchman",KianAndFamily,1h917do,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h917do/listing_hidden_heroes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h917do/listing_hidden_heroes/,2024-12-07 20:17:34,0,0.43,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h917do

movies,Snow White and The Huntsman -- weird but I don't hate it,"For some reason we have this on BR and we ended up putting it on the other night, not having seen it in probably a decade. And yes, it's a really fucking weird movie, but in some ways it totally works. Obviously there's an emphasis on visuals, which change throughout the movie to reflect the the land's hope vs despair (a la Pride Rock). But this movie has some other things going for it as well. Charlize is crazy but legitimately scary. Kristen Stewart is great, even though she doesn't actually talk all that much for most of the runtime. Plus it's got a banger of an end credits song, courtesy of Florence and the Machine.

The movie has some interesting themes as well. Most prominent is the fear of death and aging, which I think is always going to be subtext of this story. Snow White represents youth, beauty, and purity, which can never last; the pursuit of these things rots the Evil Queen's soul. Aside from making this subtext text, and the obvious feminist interpretations/implications, Snow White and the Huntsman also carries a pretty obvious environmental message. The Evil Queen steals beauty and vitality from not just her people, but the actual land as well, transforming the enchanted forest from a vibrant fairyland into a desolate wasteland.

All that said, the pacing can be really weird. The first twenty minutes is basically backstory, as Snow White's mother dies, the Queen takes control of the kingdom, Snow is imprisoned, and finally she escapes to the enchanted forest, when the huntsman, ostensibly one of the main characters, finally enters the picture. The middle of the movie is a little confusing, because the title characters don't seem to really have goals other than surviving. The poisoned apple and Snow White's coma transition pretty abruptly into the climactic battle, as well.

So yeah, it's weird, and you can point out a few flaws, but it's also a beautifully dark movie with a lot of heart and a pretty clear message. What do you think?

Couple of times I would talk about the movie with a friend who claimed no it was Charlize Theron. We would describe scenes, story, I was convinced, I knew  it was Mila, but he “knew” it was Charlize. We didn’t know the name of the movie. Giving him the benefit of the reasonable mind, I was searching for remake of some film staring Mila where now stars Charlize, even though it made no sense due to quality of the movie.

movies,The best R-Rated Comedies,"Being a teen in the late 1990s and early 2000s I grew up on R-rated teen sex comedies, and I love them so much. Unfortunately the genre has kind of died off, but here are some of my highlights over the year. Here a short review of each :)

1. Risky Business (1983): This movie couldn't be made today! A young Tom Cruise's parents are out of town. They expect him to behave and prepare credits for college, but sometimes you just have to say ""what the f\*\*k"" as ""what the f\*\*k"" gives you freedom. This lead Tom to starting his own brothel. The movie is so stylish, and shows how teens have to balance being a good robot for society and the temptations in life. A classic 10/10.
2. American Pie 1-4 (1999-2012): We follow group of guys from when they set out to lose their virginities, to when they get separated in college, having a wedding party and a reunion. These guys have the best chemistry and I love the insane gags like Stifler getting a nasty beer, a nice shower, Jim having fun with a pie and getting glued, Stifler's mom, Finche's mom, and so on. The movies get 9/10, 8,5/10, 7/10, 8,5/10.
3. Eurotrip (2004): After a rough break-up (Scotty doesn't know!) Scotty and Cooper head to Europe to meet up with a sexy German exchange student. They are taken through gags in each country. They party with British hooligans, fight a mime in Paris, experience absinth in Eastern Europe, VanderseXXX in Amsterdam, go to a nude beach and meet the pope in the Vatican City. So much fun and quotable 10/10.
4. Superbad (2007): An updated version of American Pie. Sex-crazed geeky teens want to get laid at a party. Jonah Hill is an unstoppable dick-drawing savage, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the legendary McLovin', trying to score alcohol with a fake id, and Michael Cera is your normal kinda guy. So much fun and so many roughy joke and puking. A classic 10/10.
5. Sex Drive (2008): A teen makes a fake dating profile online, and goes on a roadtrip with his best geeky and charming friend to meet a girl. They encounter sarcastic Armish, swingers, and criminals, all while getting hunted by his gay-hating brother. It is fun, but avoid the unrated version, as it kinda ruins the movie. 7,5/10
6. Good Boys (2019): A bunch of 6th graders want to learn how to kid,  before their first kissing party. It is fun to see how kids this age want to be older and cool, while know knowing what they are talking about! They try to spy on teen girls with a drone, they encounter sex toys, a frat party and much more. It is both innocent and raunchy. 7,5/10a 
7. No Hard Feelings (2023): It is much easier to get cancelled these days, and this movie did get in trouble. So a 30+ female about to lose her house gets hired by some right parents to hook up with a teen to get him out of his shell (this is what almost got it cancelled). So Jennifer Lawrence tries to seduce the kid in various ways, and it goes wrong all the time, like when she in the naked has to beat up a bunch of kids! Still a cute, colorful and fun movie! 8/10.
8. Incoming (2024): Basically a new but slightly more safe take on Superbad, but still pretty fun. We have our four freshmen preparing for their first party. One would rather play video games than go to parties, one is the over-prepared guy who has an elaborate plan involving a surveillance system to seduce women, and then we have our average guy to identify with. The usual gags of drinking, being a fish out of water, innocense and all that. Still fun, 7/10.

Movies like Easy A and The To-Do List, while fun they are not rated R, so didn't include them. I also quite enjoyed The Hangover, 21 Jump Street, Bridesmaids, Hot Tube Time Machine and the Harold and Kumar movies.",Ebbemonster,1h8zx7a,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8zx7a/the_best_rrated_comedies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8zx7a/the_best_rrated_comedies/,2024-12-07 19:19:12,0,0.45,0,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h8zx7a

It seemed to disappear pretty quickly, fading into movie oblivion before finally being appreciated once again. The gothic horror vibe and cool soundtrack were a winner to-then 16year old me and seeing Snoop as a kind of anti-villain was fresh and in contrast to his rap/gang affiliations portrayed in the media.

movies,"Why does Jared Leto keep getting picked up by directors? I think he’s had good performances in the past, but is it really worth putting up with him?","Like, I think he’s a more talented actor than people give him credit for. I feel like a lot of the criticism of his ability comes from people who have only seen Morbius and Suicide Squad

But it’s well known that he seems like a huge pain in the ass. His method thing seems really annoying for his costars, and also just wastes a lot of time. Leto seems to have a lot of confidence in his formula, not realizing most of the roles that made him famous were just relatively normal dudes. Now he wants to prove himself as some kind of “eccentric method genius!”

After a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven’t been very successful recently.

Also, I know David Ayer seemed to like his weird process, which I suppose makes sense considering Ayer got along with Shia Labeouf very well. However, what I find funny is when you look at the behind the scenes for the Suicide Squad, the cast seemed legitimately very close.

What do you think that scene where the cat and the bird are raptured to Heaven? 

My thought is: the entire movie is a retelling of the biblical flood and that scene shows that the bird fulfilled his journey and was then, raptured. But the cat still had a mission to do. The fish at the end seems to be ready to be raptured, but since he was an animal of the water he couldn't get to the sacred place to be raptured and then died on earth.

Indiana must race to prevent the vampires from obtaining the Ark, which they plan to use as a weapon to amplify their power, while also uncovering a mysterious connection between the ancient artifact and the vampires' immortality.

**""Deadpool &amp; Amelie""** - Wade Wilson meets his match when he encounters Amelie, a quirky and imaginative French woman with the ability to manipulate those around her in whimsical ways. Wade's chaotic life as a fourth wall-breaking, crime-fighting, mutant vigilante is at odds with Amelie's more innocent, heartfelt, and compassionate approach to life, and their differences slowly transform both individuals in ways that will change them forever.

Fortunately for Paddington, his kindness and resourcefulness allow him to befriend other animals that help him outwit the Predator’s traps. The Predator becomes increasingly frustrated, leading to even more dangerous encounters, but Paddington manages to turn the tables in a film full of adorable humor and action-packed tension.

movies,Jingle All the Way,"Growing up is realizing you align more with Myron than Howard. 

Howard waits until the last minute to do anything for his kid and doesn’t really grow throughout the whole movie. It’s understandable to think that he’s just going to fall back into the same workaholic lifestyle after the movies conclusion. Meanwhile Myron’s plight, akin to an Amazon worker, is way more relatable. He’s had to work crazy hours, probably doesn’t get compensated enough, and desperately is trying to do whatever he can to do what he can for his kid. Even Ted, if you can ignore his cartoonishly devilish intentions, is just a neighborhood single father doing everything he can for his kid (trying to bang a married woman notwithstanding).

**#50. Polite Society** \- This year seems to be the year of over the top teen movies with Red White &amp; Royal Blue, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, and Totally Killer all going viral in spite of let’s say inconsistent quality. We'll talk about another one layer one, but I wanna start with a film that deserves a lot more attention that it got. What you’d get if Robert Rodriguez made a coming-of-age movie, it's a film that embraces its blend of martial arts flicks, over the top family melodrama, and 2000s comedy to a delightful degree. I will admit it's a bit of a case of style overcompensating for a lackluster story but what makes it work overall is the charming relationship of the sisters. Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya have great chemistry with each other, creating a sweet and charming bond throughout the film. At the same time, I also dug it doesn’t shy away from focusing on the immaturity and insecurity of a younger sister selfishly not wanting to lose a best friend to her sister. It does capture that betrayal when a family or friend you thought would be there forever for you has their own aspirations. If there is a nitpick, it's that I wish the actual fight scenes had stronger and more exhilarating choreography. Not that it’s bad per say and it does make sense that a film about an action film fan wouldn’t be as polished as the martial arts films it's paying tribute to. I still would’ve like more memorable fights is all. Still the charming presentation and the comedy more than makes up for it, and I can see this becoming a cult classic amongst teens down the line. 

**#49. Unrest** \- I normally advise people to go on as blind as possible knowing little about the premise. But for this film, I think it is important to know that the entire film revolves around community anarchists working in a watch factory who are secretly plotting a rebellion. It might sound exciting but there's very little drama within the film. There's barely what you could charitably call a story and not even a plot. It's very much a grounded and straight look at how revolution is formed, with no big setpieces and few twists outside of certain workers being arrested. And yet it remains an engaging watch throughout thanks to as the says, a feeling of unrest throughout. There's a sense of simmering anger that you can feel below each scene of workers conspiring in secrecy or even as they continue diligently working for the factory. Everything is below the surface and the power of this film is very much in what is not said, in every careful and deliberate word choice uttered through thin poker faces. The sound of ticking of clocks is a constant soundtrack through the film, almost as if counting down how long the workers have until they're caught. Maybe even how long it may be even viable to accomplish a proper revolution before the window shuts forever. Or perhaps, it's a sign of how time will go on regardless of what process is or isn't made. Maybe despite the stopwatch being built, we actually still have time. Its abstract nature means this isn't for everyone but if you're intrigued about the premise and are willingly to be challenged, can't recommend this enough. 

**#48. The Deepest Breath** \- A lot of people have compared this documentary to Free Solo which is unsurprising considering both are about extreme sports and the people who find meaning and purpose in life in accomplishing the awe inspiring. And even if this film isn't as good as that documentary, this one still stands on its own as a damn good watch. From the gorgeous cinematography to the literally breathtaking footage captured of various free divers, showcasing the determination and tenacity of the divers who do this regular serving and the backdrop of the story of two people who find each other at the right place but debatably the wrong time, it's a captivating watch as we see both the limits of human accomplishment in physical feats and the love that inspires us to keep moving forward. And it'll have you hooked and holding your own breath right up to the conclusion. 

**#47. Take Care of Maya** \- I tend to not care for a lot of Netflix-produced crime documentaries. A lot of them tend to be cheaply produced and overly dramatic, not to mention often with surface level commentary and analysis. It tends to put a damper on what could be interesting stories and neuters them in favor of sensationalization. Thankfully, this documentary is not only an engaging watch but one that does proper justice towards a wronged family and highlights a corrupt medicare system that harms rather than heals. Focusing on a young girl with a rare disease and the hospital that intentionally misunderstood her case to take advantage of her family, it is a tough and heartbreaking film. It highlights not just the cruelty in corporate healthcare on not just those who need it but the emotional toll on the families, but also one of inspiration. No matter how powerless their fight may be and how they acknowledge very real risk that even standing up will only result in more pain and trauma, it's moving see the love parents have for their children and an inspiring story of courage and tenacity of a family who fought together and never gave up in spite of everything being against them. It’s a quick but emotional watch that I hope more people do more than scroll past when they go on Netflix.

**#46. Infinity Pool** \- There are films that are depressing watches for their subject matter and tone, and then there are films that are out to make you uncomfortable. Not in the sense of making you feel danger is around any corner, more poking and prodding at the limits your desires will take you. Lust, sexual satisfaction, violence, all of these desires are ones we normally tempered. Infinity Pool asks: “what would happen if you didn't have to filter these sinful, carnal desires?” How far deep would these take you that you go numb from how disgusting you think of yourself and accept it as being blasé? I fully accept this may be me overthinking this movie and being off from its themes. Regardless of my interpretation of this film though, I can deny how. From being disgusted from being intrigued and fascinated, it's a pool I dove in feet first and will continue treading its waters for the next couple of years. 

**#45. The Sweet East** \- This is a movie most will probably hate after finishing and to be honest, as I was watching it for the first time, I did find it incredibly obnoxious. It's full of insufferable, pretentious, and frequently unlikable characters, the narrative makes little sense with Talia Ryder barely reacting to anything or having any change, and by the end you think what was actually accomplished? What did we gain and what was learned? And yet much like Infinity Pool, it's that absurdity that I kept on my mind over the next few days. I kept thinking about Talia-s blasé attitude to the whole adventure - encountering blatant racism, insecure men, and snobby artists and how in a way, it actually did speak to a certain zeitgeist. And as much as I was annoyed by the film, it also kept me engaged and by the end the bitter taste actually made sense. I can't say you will enjoy this film or get as much as I did but it is a film I doubt you'll forget once the credits roll. 

**#44. The Holdovers** \- Some films sneak up on you. At first I wasn't in love with this film as everyone else was. While I thought it was good, it felt a bit too slow and felt like I'd be better served watching any of the 80s classics like Dead Poets Society and Planes Trains and Automobiles that served as inspiration for this film. And yet like the train scene in PTA, I found myself thinking more and more about my experience and realizing how warm it was and how much I took for granted. The chemistry between all three leads, not just from the award winning performances from DaVine Joy Randolph and Paul Giamatti, but also from newcomer Dominic Sessa who I think has gone criminal underappreciated. He proves himself to be a young actor full of charisma, and it's wonderful seeing the relationships the trio has with each other grow without feeling too saccharine. The gradual acceptance all three have in their places as castaways and still finding solidarity in all that is quite moving. Even if it's a predictable formula of the classic grump learning to have a heart, Alexander Payne manages to make these characters feel human and real. It's already a Christmas classic and I could easily see a lot of families having this on as a new annual tradition. 

**#43. Sanctuary** \- Power is sexy and being sexy gives power. It’s an alluring power dynamic and this film manages to make simple discussions and dialogue of it not feel drawn out for 90 minutes. For a film of almost zero nudity and zero sex scenes, this has some of the tightest sexual tension in any romantic film in a while. Both Christopher Abbott and Margaret Qualley deliver fantastic, layered performances, showcasing why they're some of the most interesting young actors right now. The cat and mouse game they play going back and forth at each other is endlessly entertaining as you wonder who's in control and who's really being played. Which one submits first? Even with the play-like structure and the bottleneck setting, this had me captivated for its 90 minute runtime. I really hope more people check it out and I hope both Qualley and Abbott continue to get attention for their work, and I'm already eagerly anticipating Zachary Wigon’s next film, also starring Qualley. 

**#42. Killers of the Flower Moon** \- If this had been 30 minutes shorter and had Mollie given more development beyond simply being the symbol of Native purity and beauty literally poisoned by the white man, I imagine this would've been much higher. Because simply on a film level, it is one of the most impressive and epic in scale. From the pacing and editing that manages to keep the three and a half hour runtime engaging despite of lull points, to the grand production and setpieces that capture how big of a plot this is, to the tight cinematography capturing it all, to the roster of a cast that has even cameo roles shine to an ending that probably one of the more daring statements Scorsese has ever made about America and its dark history. It is a behemoth worth marveling at and even though it doesn't resonate as much as I would want to, I can't deny it's more than deserving of all the acclaim it's gotten. It is a great movie that I just wish I was able to connect emotionally more with as everyone else has. 

**#41. Earth Mama** \- Being a parent is a difficult task and even more tragic are the women desperate to be a mother despite society not allowing them to be or looking down upon them for doing so. But what about the women who, controversially, ‘aren’t fit’ to be a mother? Who is really deserving of that title? That’s the tough question that Savannah Leaf’s heartbreaking debut seeks to answer: what if a woman isn’t suitable to raise her own child. In less empathetic hands, this may have been too heavy or not a balanced portrait, but Leaf’s sensitive direction allows us to come to our own conclusions while not shying away from the dirty truth surrounding it all. But the power of the film lies in Tia Nomore’s lead performance as the imperfect woman wanting to be a mother. She's able to capture the motherly instincts and drive that would make her a good, maybe even great loving parent. Yet it doesn’t shy away from how naively blind she is to her selfishness and commitment issues that would complicate things for her and potentially traumatize her baby. And what’s most intelligent is how both sides are ones you understand the causes behind even if they seem counterproductive. You want her to achieve her goals of raising a family yet at the same time you want someone to step in to guide her away from a potentially toxic and self-destructive household. It's a film with an honest maturity, culminating in an ending that is tragic but at the same time earned. This went a bit under the radar but even with the heavy tone and subject matter, I hope more check it out.

**#40. Talk to Me** \- Another year, another A24 horror movie that’s gone viral and lives up to the hype. Although in contrast to some of their disturbing but challenging and difficult movies, Talk to Me is one of their most straightforward horror flicks. That's not to say Talk to Me is less than though, it still has that great suspense and atmosphere even with the localized Australian teen setting. Despite the stoner archetypes of the cast, what this film has to say about depression, trauma, suicidation and its effects on the family don't just hit home, but feel scarier than any possession or gore the film could’ve conjured up. Couple that with teen actors that have great chemistry with each other while acting like bratty, immature kids, and some of the best gore and makeup effects that'll have you squirming in your seat, and you've got not just another good addition to A24’ horror catalog but a promising breakthrough for the Philippou Brothers who I’ll no doubt be following for their future p projects.

**#39. How to Blow Up a Pipeline** \- This'll no doubt be one of the most controversial movies I praise on this list, especially if you are immediately against the premise and what the Andrew Malm Manifesto that inspired this movie advocates. But whatever your views are about the acts committed in this film, this is one of the best and most tense heist films in a while. It's not a film asking you to agree with the act nor is it necessarily concerned about changing your mind. Frankly it could care less if you would snitch on it. Whether you want to or not, you'll have to follow the shoes of those actually willing to do the extreme, how they pull it off, and the grit they have to stand by their acts. And yet it's also not a film loudly saying why this should be done, as it doesn't shy away not just from the consequences but the lackluster success rate in creating change that acts like this. At its core though, it's a tight and tense film with a fantastic editing and pacing as you get sucked into whether or not they'll accomplish their task, and by the end a film that dares you to wonder whether they should've gone farther or pulled back. 

**#38. Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie** \- Michael J. Fox has been one of the most inspiring figures for me. While it captures his struggles with Parkinsons and the humor he maintains despite his troubles, what I love however is the narration which was taken from his autobiography. It shows how self-aware and reflective he was about just upbringing, success, and shame regarding his addictions yet also how much wisdom he still has even as the disease continues to spread. Whether or not you're a fan of his work, just know him from his biggest movies, or just know him as the Back to the Future kid, I still highly recommend this film as a shining beacon of true human fearlessness. 

**#37. Scrapper** \- For as heavy, deep, and complex films are on this list, sometimes you just need a film that's just so charming and cute. I was actually hesitant to watch this film, writing it off as something I might find too twee and cutesy. But by the first 15 minutes I was hooked in. Much of that due to how damn charismatic the central girl is Lola Campbell, in one of the best child performances of 2023. I love the juxtaposition with both them being young people forced to grow up and act like adults, Lola, the scrappy child left to fend for herself and Harris the immature manchild realizing he actually needs to mature if he’s to salvage anything from his past relationship. And while there is an exaggerated tone, particularly in the editing, neither feel like simple characters; she is not simply a wise ass smart beyond her age and he's not simply a bumbling idiot trying to be a parent. They're both trying to figure out and realize they can't be alone in surviving anymore, and no matter how much they fight there is a familial chemistry between them that they need to keep hold off. It's short and sweet, a comfortable family comedy that shows even simple, played out concepts can be an emotional ride. 

**#36. No One Will Save You** \- It's easy for straight-to-streaming horror releases to get a bad wrap as cheaply made scare fodder. Which is why one of my favorite surprises of the year came from a quietly promoted release on Hulu that probably should've been released in theaters. The big talking point for this film is the decision to have virtually no dialogue throughout. In a lesser film. This could've been a cheap gimmick for a rote house invasion story through aliens. Instead, thanks to smart pacing, writing, and a committed performance from Kaitlin Dever, it turns the film into one of the more creative horror films of last year. The lack of dialogue alongside the great sound design manages to capture, it's an engaging character study in Grief, guilt, and self-alienation. Everything feels elevated with the lack of dialogue and trust you to understand what's going on. It's also a film that invites multiple viewings as there were background details about Dever's character and her story I didn't notice on first viewing. Sure the designs and the effects on the aliens might be a little cheap but that doesn’t take away from how engrossing an experience this was. I really hope this grows a cult following and escapes the trapping it got by being relegated to streaming, we could really use more innovation amongst mainstream horror. 

**#35. Skinamarink** \- This is a film that people either find terrifying or absolutely boring, with very little in between. There's no getting around how 97% of this film is still shorts of walls, hallways, ceilings, and other rooms with a hazy nocturnal filter and with the camera intentionally positioned away or obscuring…anything. If you aren't sucked into the first 2 minutes of this film, you are likely to feel miserable and irritated by the next hour and a half. And i'll admit I was skeptical I would fall for this filma spell, yet, I was enthralled throughout by the atmosphere. There is a film that for me captures a sense of helplessness and claustrophobia as a child in the dark, knowledgeable in little besides your own uncomfortability and fear. Your paranoia as you sit or lie down pondering the thought of monsters under your bed or in your closet may sound juvenile but this film shows that that fear may never go away, sometimes it's just hidden behind your view. Again, I can't guarantee you'll like this film and I also do understand people who think this could've been a short analog horror film. But I couldn't help but be drowned in this films atmosphere and few films had that experience with me. 

**#34. Trenque Lauquen** \- Sometimes, a film can escape a cheap, low budget look not through quick editing or quick banter, but through simple engaging writing and charismatic performance. This film can be daunting being a four hour watch split into two parts and truthfully not that many action or tension driven sequences, not to mention actually hard to find a copy of to watch. And yet I was just as drawn in by the central mystery that I couldn’t help but join along for the ride as you piece together clues behind a potentially large conspiracy. And central to the film's success is the lead performance by Laura Paredes, who not only captures Laura’s curiosity and desire for adventure, but possesses a subtle but magnetic charisma that would make you want to follow her. She doesn’t know where she’s going or what she’ll even do with the discovery once she arrives at it but you can also sense a determination to find what she’s looking for. Paredes doesn’t play it off as aimless soul-searching but as a woman on a mission perhaps only she can understand. Now I will say this is lower than I would want because the second half doesn't quite keep up the pacing of the first, and meanders a bit too much for me. Still the lead performance and the first act's tight writing still come with a recommendation for me. It might not be a satisfying destination by the end but it's the journey that's the more rewarding bit. 

**#33. Bottoms** \- It’d be so easy for me to call this the Superbad for Gen Alpha gays as it is a crass, crude and immature comedy and like with Superbad, it could’ve easily fallen into the trap of relying too much on vulgarity and innuendo. But in fact there's a lot more to Bottoms than just adopting modern slang to appeal to a younger audience. From the great supporting performances (particularly Kaia Gerber and Ruby Cruz) who are game for making this as fantastical and absurd as possible to the chemistry throughout that actually makes their relationships and interactions endearing and even blunts some of the more obnoxious characteristics of the main leads. The clever visual gags, to the quick pace and editing which means jokes don't overstay their welcome, even the slang doesn't feel too obnoxious as to instantly date this movie. It's just a really charming comedy that will no doubt become a cornerstone movie for teens this decade, every generation deserves a crass Crude comedy to rally behind and this one is smart enough to transcend that age barrier. 

**#32. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem** \- It's a real shame that the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies come out as the hype and interest for the brand fades and as Paramount is going through financial instability. But it’s a testament to the films quality that even with waning interest in the Turtles brand, word of mouth meant this was able to find an audience amongst old fans, critics, and even create a new generation of fans. There’s honestly so much to praise but more than the catchy synth score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Rosa of all people, more the gorgeous handrail animation bringing it back to the comic book roots, and more the colorful cast of villains that are really funny and well voiced (including an Ice Cube performance that doesn’t just feel like every Ice Cube performance), what makes this film are the Turtles themselves. It was a great decision to actually have them as teenagers for once and the writing and the voice cast makes them so lovable. Out of all the other adaptations I've seen, the turtles here don’t just feel like teenagers but actually feel like four brothers. They’re loose and fun, immature but not like every other quippy superhero team we’ve gotten since Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, they still throw in their signature personality traits so as to not make everyone feel interchangeable. Most of all they’re relatable and kids you root for - like with Bottoms, the Gen Z slang and social media humor doesn't feel like it dates this movie because of the smart writing and the chemistry between everyone. Paramount has said they'll continue with this direction for the Turtles and I really hope we do get a feature sequel for this crew because this is the type of imagination and creativity we need in children’s media.

**#31. The Killer** \- It takes a special kind of balls for a director to make a film that's a giant middle finger to an audience that latched onto his films for the wrong reasons. A darkly comedic deconstruction of the typically stoic, masculine killer as someone just as clunky, pathetic, and weak as the “normies” he looks down upon, it's an even more impressive thing this doesn’t feel like a self indulgent mess. Fortunately, David Fincher is one of the few directors who can pull it off and make an engaging thriller regardless of whether you see the subtext or not, because amazingly it still works as a straightforward action film. The action and choreography is tight and controlled but gritty - with the break-in fight being one of my favorite fight scenes of last year, the editing creates a sense of tension while also interjecting black humor so as to not get bogged down in self-serious parody, and Michael Fassbender captures the fake macho posturing of a man realizing he isn't the invincible or even intelligent Assassin he clearly wants to be. This film has been a bit divisive even for Fincher fans but I really hope there is a reinterpretation for this film later on as even if it's not subtle per say, it still is an engaging subversion of masculine tropes. 



**#30. A Thousand and One** \- Sometimes a film's power and emotions can overcome some story and presentation flaws. This is not a flawless film by any means as it does have issues in regards to narrative and presentation. But the sheer blunt emotions it holds overpowers any issues I might have to being one of the most gripping family dramas of last year. And that comes from the Trio of actors with William Catlet and Josiah Cross also wonderful. Both are great with Cross being the eldest version of Terrie, the confused child unsure of where to go in life and whether he's getting the support from the family he'd like, and Catlet as the reluctant father who still nonetheless gives it his all to be the father Terrie needs. But it’s Teyana Taylor who delivers one of the best and most powerful performances in all of 2023. She is an absolute star here and in a just world, she'd have been recognized for this film and given so many calls by directors looking to cast her. Like with Earth Mama, it doesn't shy away from the difficulty of being a mother - both society driven and by her own personal hang ups. Yet it is more than just the template of a hardworking mother struggling to keep her family together and above water that we’ve seen in other movies. Taylor disappears in her role of unwavering love, courage and ferocity shown to fight for her family that feels so raw and real. It's not the unique take on this story and it isn't an easy watch, but the performances alone make this an unforgettable experience and I really hope all three actors can get more exposure and bigger roles from this. 

**#29. 20,000 Species of Bees** \- Children have their own dignity that deserves to be acknowledged and most of all respected. It's a concept that seems absurd and a hard pill to swallow for most people and yet this movie shows why it’s important to respect it. Looking at the journey of a trans child no older than 10, from her own self acceptance to the reactions from her mother and the grandmother she's visiting, what really drew me in is that the film doesn't sugarcoat or infantilize the audience with how difficult it can be for her family to accept it. Her older relatives are more the well meaning types more prone to tolerance than accepting and even dismissing her at times. And yet they, and in particular her caring and loving grandmother, are still the ones giving her the support she needs to not just accept who she is but love herself. I also think it's clever how this struggle is reflected in the relationship between the mother and her parents. How the lack of reciprocity from her mother and especially her father, may have contributed to her failing marriage and lacking love she needs to give to her children. It all leads up to an ending that had me stunned on first watch and constantly thinking about it for the next few days. Couple that with Sofia Otero's fantastic performance which rightfully nabbed her a Best Leading Performance award at the Berlin International Film Festival - capturing both her confusion with her domestic situation but also the stubborness to accept her identity when others won't - and you have a small but powerful trans film that’s gone overlooked by far too many. Love is complicated and harder than it, even if its to yourself, but it's better to have love and hone than to have nothing.

**#28. The Eternal Memory** \- Nothing lasts forever and everything will fade in time, no matter how much we try to keep the memories of people and events in tact. It's a tough and scary reality we all have to face even when it seems unfair that goodness can go unrewarded. But choosing to remain loving and kind in the face of that is something that has to come from inside, no matter who remembers it. And the center of this documentary is the love between Augusto Góngora and Paulina Urrutia; a wife caring for her husband slowly losing himself to Alzheimers and yet never leaving his side, still living with him no matter his condition. But it's more than a touching story of marriage as there are three different memories being fought to be preserved. There’s also the memory of the family, who he’s been as a father and husband for many decades. There’s the memory of Góngora’s vital work and accomplishments as a journalist, documenting a Chile in unrest and the resistance that helped turn the tides. And there’s also memory of a Chile whose progress is on the cusp of being reversed amidst a new regime of power. It sounds like a tricky balancing act but this documentary manages not to feel overstuffed because as it reminds us, what keeps us united and focused is love. It’s a beautiful and touching documentary that even if it hits too close for some, I can’t recommend enough if only to keep this memory from dimming too early.

**#27. How to Save a Dead Friend** \- Media often portrays love between addicts as a tragic tale of people unable to save themselves or one of them. It's often easy to criticize them when you're on the outside looking in because logic laughs at the ridiculous stubbornness people show. Yet this documentary defies that by showing us why love is still just as strong and valid even when it seems like an irrational act. That even amidst the political and social unrest of Russia, amidst an uneven and crushing economic structure denying dreams to flourish, and amidst personal demons, genuine romantic love and comfort can still be bright and worth celebrating. This isn't a film that simply ignores from how destructive drugs and addiction can be, rather it shows that relationships and the emotions we shared with each other shouldn't be tossed away even if the situations weren't ideal. Even if it wasn't ever meant to last long, that he was doomed from the start, that the memories shared between them is worth savoring and cherishing. This is an admittedly hard film to track down but if you have the chance, do watch it. It’s an emotional love story and a creative documentary.

**#26. Smoke Sauna Sisterhood** \- And concluding the inadverdent trio of documentaries, we have a small film that packs a big punch, showing sometimes blunt honesty in a closed setting can be more impactful than any big imagery a camera can capture. Some might be uncomfortable at the idea of a documentary of mostly naked women opening up about their experience of trauma, abuse, and hurt, but it's not a film simply wallowing in misery and despair. It can be tough to hear such vulnerable stories, ones that admittedly feel uncomfortable for intruding upon. But the nudity and nakedness actually amplifies their experiences - showing how unafraid they are of opening up - and like the sauna they're in also makes the act of being there one of healing. It's a double cleanse on multiple levels in terms of letting go of pain but also having the support of those ready to listen. The stories will be triggering for some people so I can't easily recommend it to everyone. But for those willing to listen, I hope it can show inner peace can happen and that you don't have to stay hurt forever.",dremolus,1h8mbvs,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,2024-12-07 06:17:22,0,0.43,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Lv5K4bNzmRq5iVWsmVRjGb8tiX9SND_AhWiu1dV3DXs.jpg,t3_1h8mbvs

Yet, he said that a lot of people he knew liked the movie, which goes to tell you that you don't have to understand something to enjoy it. I said that's true of many other sorts of art. Like I see people put abstract paintings in their homes which continue to puzzle them, just as they puzzle their guests. Yet they like the paintings and paid a lot of money for it.

I was telling him that he gotta watch some newer movies cause some really mess with your head, making 2001 look so tame in comparison.

movies,"""Goofs""","Various websites list film goofs but some of them baffle me, I have just watched The Guns of Navarone and as with any film i like to read the Trivia and Goofs on IMDb and the TV Tropes pages.  
  
 On the mild side there is the usual guff about the wrong tanks and guns being used but the fact that Gregory Peck is an American palying a British person isn't classed as a goof. If an American playing a British person isn't a goof then an American tank pretending to be German isn;t a goof either.  This is mild because yes it's technically a goof and so i'm not too bothered that people are complaining but it's still slightly irrational to complain about it. 

  
On a more irritating note though is bollocks like ""they reused shots"", so what? It's OK to re-use a shot especially if another filmed shot would be almost identical, it's absurd to call it out as a goof. 

For me a slip up/goof/blooper would be a missed or poorly enunciated line, a bumped camera, a crew member in shot, equipment in shot that shouldn't be and other such things. I don't see how a dressed up vehicle pretending to be a different vehicle is any different to an actor dressing up and pretending to be someone they are not.   
  
Should we call out Colin Firth playing King George in The King's Speech a goof? They really should've dug up the actual King George to play the part, it's clearly historically inaccurate to not have the actual King in the part. 

This is of course ridiculous, just as ridiculous as expecting films made many years after a period to have period accurate props, It's much easier to employ actors, whether human or otherwise, and use those instead. 

  
Anyway, what do you think, is using the ""wrong"" vehicles or guns as a ""goof""? Or do you see them playing a role and being something they are not just like the actors are?

movies,Is there any website listing differences between theatrical releases and airplane cuts? And anyone know as to Silent Night (2023)?,"Hello, fine folks of Reddit. 

I am a digital immigrant, not a digital native (I am not quite a Baby Boomer; I’m Generation X, but I identify with the Boomers; that means I’m old). Something I appreciate about the internet, among the many benefits offered by the profound innovation, is that people who are more obsessive than I am perform a service for the world, generally for free, of analyzing subjects I take an interest in, reliably enough for my purposes. For many movies that have multiple versions, you can find a list of the differences between the original theatrical release, and the DVD, and a director’s cut. But I am unaware of any resource listing what has been taken out (or added in, but it likely is taken out rather than added in) to the airplane version of movies.
I appreciate that you usually have a title card about the editing, whether for aspect ratio or content. I write as I stream John Woo’s Silent Night. It warned me. I checked: what I have started is a full five minutes shorter than the unexpurgated runtime. I am wondering if someone has performed the service of examining the one against the other (which might be difficult, since I don’t know how you get the airplane edition other than on the airplane itself, so you’d have the put it on, then also stream it on a device; there would be no demand for a repository of airplane bowdlerizations, presumably; once on the ground, you’d want the full content). If anyone has a sense as to this specific title, please feel free to enlighten me. Presumably, it’s the violence that has been taken out. Given the middling reviews of the original, I’m not dedicated enough a fan to sit through the picture twice.
So to sum up, I have three questions.
(1) Thoughts about the airplane versions of movies?
(2) Is there a website I am unaware of, that enables people to check out what they have missed from perusing an airplane version?
(3) Anyone see Silent Night twice, who can tell me if I have been cheated of the best parts?",FrankW1967,1h8iqzk,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8iqzk/is_there_any_website_listing_differences_between/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8iqzk/is_there_any_website_listing_differences_between/,2024-12-07 02:45:07,0,0.39,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8iqzk

movies,Losing your local movie theater,"When it opened in 1999 as a Carmike, my local movie theater was the premier high-tech theater of the future in the area. I saw Star Wars Episode 1 there 3 times. I saw the whole Lord of the Rings series &amp; probably something like 150 other movies there over the years. My roommate worked there for quite a while.

Except for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off. My girlfriend and I saw Endgame there at 8pm on opening night &amp; there were only about 8 other people.

The last movie I saw there was The Way Back, a drama with Ben Affleck as an alcoholic basketball coach. This was March 15, 2020. Two days later, it closed for COVID &amp; never reopened. At the point it closed, it still had the original carpet, which was badly stained &amp; full of holes &amp; the original seats, many of which were broken &amp; could not safely support a person. Weird projection problems were common. Half the toilets didn't work.

I haven't been inside, but word is the building was badly damaged a few months after closure by the a big storm.

movies,The Bad Boys 1 soundtrack is weird.,"Rnb and industrial metal do not go well together. I enjoy the movie, I just think the musical choices are stupid. The movie came out when rock music fandom, in the form of alternative rock and heavy metal, were almost on an entirely different planet from from hip hop and rnb fans. Both sides may have listened to one or the other as a secondary genre, but that's about it. And it was mostly rock fans listening rap as a third tier preference after alt rock and metal. And industrial rock/metal and hardcore rap actually blend pretty well together when placed together in the same atmosphere. But contemporary rnb? Sounds odd and forced, especially at a time when rnb was at its most cheesiest, cleanest, commercial and manufactured sound. In what world did most casual music fans listen to both Nine Inch Nails and Jodeci? Those bands may as well have existed in alternate universes. Maybe 1996 would have made more sense, when the music industry was struggling to figure things out after grunge, but in 1995, what were they thinking?

But today it was on the telly and thought why not watch it again.

Firstly. I can see why Tim was in that role. His presence really sells that ""pure"" figure.

Also I had forgotten how much narration Morgan Freeman does. If anything the whole movie shows different shades to the characters. From the guards to the prisoners and all. 

The only ones who are one-sided are The Sisters. Otherwise everyone else shows some good and some not so good.

Also the cinematography is really beautiful considering the circumstances. A real ""natural"" use of light and I appreciated how well lit it was. Unlike some films today where it's so grey.

I could see directing similarities between this and The Mist. First time noticing that. Yes I know same director.

I had always wondered why this film was so highly regarded. But upon watching it there is so much heart and the themes really speak through universally of resilience, perseverance and this sense of inner purity.

It's inspired me to watch The Green Mile next. I do wish Frank made more movies but alas.

His voice is just a bit too high-pitched to sound threatening for a lead male. I may be nitpicking here, but he's a tenor at best. I think most leading men have either a baritone or bass voice. He just kind of sounds childish to me and I can't shake that weak, whimpy voice from Kickass. Does anyone else feel the same?

Nothing against the guy, I wish him a long and fruitful career, but I don't understand why Hollywood is trying to make him the next Stalone, Keaunu or take your pick from any other action names.

movies,The Mist ,"Why was this movie made? How was it really received at the time? 

I understand the 2000's Hollywood zeitgeist of leaning into overdramatic corniness, but this movie takes the cake. 

It seems like a B movie, but with decent at-the-time CGI, which implies a decent budget. Apparently a well-received film in terms of popularity. I'll admit, though, the ending is probably the movie's saving grave. 

Incredibly lazy, one-dimensional characters. The ridiculousness of it all kept me watching as I kept pondering how our standards have changed, at least for a blockbuster as we now understand it. 

Perhaps a key difference now is our expectation for a theme of irony - for characters to have a degree of self-awareness when indulging in shallow, easy to predict patterns of behavior. ""marvel-ization"" might be a word for it. 

I'm just at a loss of how shit this film is. I'm at a loss of how I'm supposed to have felt while watching it.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Spain,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Slovenia. In a way, we have a double winner: Because it was mentioned in two (and actually more) comments. both 1st and 2nd place are occupied by ***Moj ata, socialistični kulak*** (engl.: *My dad, the socialist kulak*),  As always, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it certainly sounds like an insightful and impressive tragicomedy about issues that are in part even more topical than in 1987, when the movie was released.

I wonder what the next movie will look like? In any case, it will also end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And in any case, let's move on to the next country with an S: In this thread, it's all about movies set in **Spain**. And as always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Why Does Bollywood Keep Ignoring Young People?,"Bollywood just can’t find the middle ground, and it’s frustrating for the young generation. On one side, you’ve got over-the-top movies like Golmaal—bright, colorful, and so unrealistic that it feels like they’re made for 10-year-olds. On the other side, when Indian filmmakers try to make something grounded, they dive straight into the Indie hellhole. These films are so bleak and heavy that, as an Indian, watching them makes you want to curl up and quit life.

But here’s the real issue: Bollywood keeps targeting the family audience or older generations. Most movies are either made for families to watch together or for the older crowd who can afford to go out and buy tickets. But what about us? The 18-25 crowd? We’re left out. We’re the ones who want stories that feel real, not some absurd comedy or a depressing indie film that makes us question everything.

Bollywood has the talent and creativity to make something honest and balanced, but it feels like they’re playing it safe. Why aren’t they making movies for us? Why is every film either for kids or parents?

movies,"I'd never seen a single Quentin Tarantino movie before, so I decided to watch them all in release order","I've always been a big movie buff, but somehow I'd never seen a single Tarantino film. I decided to watch them in release order over the past couple weeks, and thought I would put together my thoughts here, ranked by personal favor.

**10.** **Inglourious Basterds:** I know I'm in the minority here ranking this one last. Its a good movie, and particularly poignant given the rise of fascism in current times. I thought it was cathartic to see the allied soldiers respond to the atrocities of the nazis with zealous, but appropriate, righteousness. And I found a particularly juicy fan theory about Col. Hanz Landa being gay which I thought provided a clever explanation for some of his unexplained motivations and actions throughout the film. However, it felt like the movie was so concerned with its plot and with killing nazis that it left its character work and atmosphere by the wayside. Without the fan theory, Hanz Landa's choices make no sense. And Brad Pitt's character felt so cartoony, in an entirely uninteresting way. Ultimately, a good movie that I have no desire to ever rewatch.

**9. Death Proof:** I thought for sure this would rank at the bottom of my list. I gave up 15 minutes in the first time I tried watching it, and ended up circling back to finish it after I was done with all of Tarantino's other films. This film suffers from having utterly mind numbing dialogue for the majority of its screen time, while also being possibly the sceeviest of Tarantino's movies, ultimately leaving me feeling listless and uncomfortable. But, once I gave it enough time to build momentum, this movie has undeniable charm and a very, very memorable ending. I rank it above Inglourious Basterds only for respect of the game, and because personally I could see myself rewatching this if the vibes were right.

**8.5. True Romance:** This is not part of Tarantino's official filmography (he wrote the script, but didn't direct it), but I saw people insist that it was worth watching because while the movie as a whole is not 100% Tarantino, some of the individual scenes in the movie *are* 100% Tarantino. I loved [the Sicilian scene](https://youtu.be/S3yon2GyoiM?si=MVmHA_SEM6rVYuqC), and I thought the film masterfully subverted the audience's expectations multiple times. However, it feels dated to 90's in a way that Tarantino's actual films from that decade don't.

**8. The Hateful Eight:** A Frankenstein mashup of The Thing (1982), Clue: The Movie, and any western, this movie was shaping up to be one of my favorites. However, this is the only Tarantino movie whose ending was a total let down. I expected everybody to be lying, &gt;!everybody was lying, and then they all killed each other. Pulling an extra character (Channing Tatum) out of nowhere felt cheep, and the flashback felt jarring.!&lt; Regardless of the mediocre ending, the rest of the movie was great and I wouldn't mind rewatching it.

**7. Pulp Fiction:** It was crazy watching this movie for the first time and recognizing so much of it because of its massive cultural impact. That being said, I've read several pulpy books this year alone and have seen several movies that, in hindsight, stood on the shoulders of this giant, and I have to say I've never been a particular fan of pulp as a genre. I recognize that of all the pulpy movies, this is an absolutely legendary movie, but the meandering, disconnected storylines and nihilistic provocativeness isn't really my thing.

**6. Kill Bill Vol. 1:** Funny, rambunctious, and memorable, this movie is good fun. I particularly loved the [Hattori Hanzo scene and the bald guy who was like 'you understaaaaand?'](https://youtu.be/hniuEXezlBI?si=QCH2OvQLXIpDkQ2x). The randomness of that moment when he says he isn't bald was hilarious to me but apparently that is only due to a mistake with the subs - Hanzo calls him bald in the previous line, and it isn't included in the subs, so he sounds like a crazy person when he suddenly starts talking about his baldness. anyways, yeah, good movie.

**5. Reservoir Dogs:** This is such a sharp, flawless movie. I loved that it all took place in one location, and I loved the depressing, cathartic ending. No notes.

**4. Kill Bill Vol. 2:** This movie isn't as action heavy as the first one, but it feels much more… legendary. Each beat is so dramatic and over the top and memorable, and the characters are so striking. A particular standout would be [Esteban Vihaio](https://youtu.be/IfeqSxDJpZw?si=XPG26yrDh5B8hoDd), who is played by the same actor who plays [the sheriff in the flashback at the chapel in part 1](https://youtu.be/4qyZQTjS6Ks?si=edQ6cDa4O7uPfjxC), which is crazy range. It feels like the whole movie just stops and sits in the scene with Esteban and really just lets the actor flex and impress us, like Tarantino saw that character and just really wanted to share it with the world. idk, feels special, like much of the movie.

**3. Jackie Brown:** We are now in my top 3, and these are all really close calls in my mind. I absolutely loved Jackie Brown. It felt like the most conventional of Tarantino's movies, but it's conventionality is what makes it really standout. Its a clever, gritty heist movie in which the whole heist is planned out meticulously in front of the audience, and then &gt;!the whole heist plays out exactly as planned. Despite having no last minute twist or debacle to make us clutch our pearls,!&lt; the movie is utterly engrossing for every second, and the characters feel so real they could walk through the screen. I especially appreciated having a badass black woman as the main character without engaging in derivative stereotype.

**2. Django Unchained:** Jamie Foxx is an absolute Ubermensch in this movie. His character's strength and grit just blew me away. The evil in this movie was deplorable, disgusting, and horrifyingly real. The topic of racism in America, and especially slavery in American history, is very heavy and very, very important, and this movie did a remarkable job with it. Beyond just being a good Tarantino movie, this was an important American western.

**1. Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood:** This felt like two separate movies. The first 2/3's being a wandering, character driven depiction of Hollywood in the 60's, and the last 1/3 being a historical fiction about the Charles Manson Murders. Rick Dalton's fear and sadness over his uncertain career was beautifully acted. The depiction of strong male friendship, 'closer than a brother, not quite a wife' was so heartwarming. Brad Pitt's sketchy wife-murdering, hippie-punching stuntman character was… shockingly likable. What really steals the show, though, is the ending. Much more so than how Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds played to audience fantasies by showing a vague reimagining of history, this movie takes a very specific, very real, very recent (relatively) historical event and calls out just how pathetic the monsters involved were, in a deeply satisfying way. It was a poignant and respectful commemoration of real people who should not have died so tragically young.",skill_myself,1h87fj4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h87fj4/id_never_seen_a_single_quentin_tarantino_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h87fj4/id_never_seen_a_single_quentin_tarantino_movie/,2024-12-06 17:59:54,0,0.41,0,0,67,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h87fj4

movies,What is up with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood?,"Hey, I am a complete newby when it comes to movies. Never watched them until recently. So, I recently got into Hollywood after going through the national scene and there are movies I love. The old Disney ones, of course. Loved the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Really liked 12 Angry Men, might be my favourite of the lot. And then I heard about Quentin Tarantino who is apparently held in high regard. So, I watched his latest movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and I want to know, what is going on?

The movie seems to be a mess. I mean, the dialogue is great, the acting is great and the concept was interesting. But what is going on with the plot? Things happen, then some people get killed. The ending was bizzare. I looked into it and it is basically fanfiction of a real event apparently? Not only was the ending just fanfiction, it also had little connection with the rest of the plot. Is it some reference that I don't have the cultural context to understand?

Am I missing something? Are all his movies like this?

movies,The Last Samurai: Beyond the Stereotype,"Where do I begin… well this should do it. I think.

To start things off, I’m basically a *newcomer* when it comes to the posting related thingamajigs and stuff. I’d really like to give it a try and share with *you guys* some thoughts concerning a movie which I just watched a week ago or so. 

First, let’s get something straight, I will be giving my personal point of view ‘bout it, so, to be clear, I’m no expert of such or about *‘nothin* in this topic. Just a guy who would like to see what do people think about something *I feel* is *worth* talking about. 

*Let’s cut to the point*, which is: The Last Samurai - released back in 2003. **This film is-a-masterpiece**, and oh man, there is *no room to doubt*, I can assure you that it is. It comes from a time when them films had to convey a meaning. When they were actually good. If they didn’t have that little something, people simply wouldn’t take the bait. Anyway, enough of this babbling, let’s get to the real deal.

***Honor.*** 

*The whole film* \- is about honor. On paper, honestly, if I hadn’t seen the film, and was presented with this as the backbone of the movie, I would have sold in without doubt. Itself, *it already encompasses various other values it wishes to transmit.* **Furthermore**, when people argue about it being the same old *“white-saviour”* type of Hollywood movie, I just laugh in disbelief because *it’s clearly not.* Unlike those based and outdated narratives, this film actually challenges stereotypes and places the focus on a white man named Nathan Algren, who is clearly, a troubled man. *The Samurai help him,* then he returns the favour *in some ways.*

The whole point of the movie being a story revolving around the white guy, is so that people identify with him, in a sense that he’s also another person who doesn’t know anything about *Samurai ways*. Throughout its entire course, the audience is positioned behind the screens to follow a character which they understand, relate to and seeing him empathize with *Katsumoto* and his people makes it easier for us to follow. It would have been much complicated to use of the foreigners as the main actors in the role - this is not racism, it’s just more logical, that’s all. All the better, join that with *Tom Cruise’s performance* on the film, whether you like him as actor or not, he’s great, and that’s just ‘cause he tends to believe he’s the main character in the world, and in this movie, *he is.* 

&gt;\[…\] *“And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds. Others, that he returned to his own country.""*

&gt;*""But I like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace, that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""*  \[…\]

I hope you liked it guys and if you’d like to ask any questions, feel free to reply down below. Also, down-votes and upvotes are accepted, as long as you spark interest in a discussion, it’s okay, don’t mind me, express your opinion and fuck what other people think!! (To an extent haha don’t go too heavy with the guns if you know what I’m saying).

movies,Cruising (1980): Reoccurring character ,"Hi everybody - long time reader, first time poster here!

I just saw 1980s Cruising yesterday and it really stuck with me: The intense atmosphere of NYC underground in the late 70s, the rawness of the SM gay community, and the constant ambiguity of the plot and characters.

Also, very interesting performance by Al Pacino, who you can really see evolve in his role, as his character does during the movie.

I know that Friedkin assigned different roles to the same actors to add to the ambiguity of the movie, however I noticed one of them in particular in completely different roles: A slightly older guy with thin mustache and impure skin (played by Joe Spinell):

02:30: plays the cop on the passenger seat who’s wife left him 

27:28: plays a homosexual in the first bar scene with Al Pacino, right after the appearance of killer Stuart Richards

29:32: same role in the first scene with al pacino standing under Bridge in the park

1:33:31: in the scene where they show murdered Ted, he plays the cop again who briefs the chef on the murder

I just thought that was an interesting choice - did anybody else notice this? I guess Friedkin made that decision to add on the ambiguity even more, blurring the lines between the underground community and the NYPD.

movies,RDJ as Doctor Doom might be one of the biggest fumbles OAT.,"Ok so I like many other marvel fans have kinda not been paying attention to most of marvels recent projects, so guess my surprise when I hear that they are making the new major villain Doctor Doom, one of my favorite villains in all of media. Doctor Doom is the ruler of a foreign nation who uses both science and magic, as well as his incredibly high IQ, to destroy his opponents and try and raise his country to prosperity as well as any other motivations he may have. He is one of the most brutal and harsh characters marvel has to offer and the actor they choose to play him is RDJ????? 

Don't get me wrong RDJ is a great actor and was fantastic as Tony Stark, he also demonstrated his ability to play a serious villain in Oppenheimer, however RDJs whole vibe is completely wrong, Doctor Doom is a character that no matter the context should feel menacing and dangerous as well as calculating and incredibly serious, RDJ is not this, he is iron man. 

Idk this all feels like a cash grab or they just don't really care. So many other actors could've played Doom amazingly (Javier Bardem comes to mind) and also Doom is literally the ruler of a foreign country his accent wouldn't be American. Ik this is jumping the gun and the movie could be great but Doom is such a perfect villain to follow thanos, someone less physically powerful (although he can get quite the powerup) but smarter then anyone the Avengers have faced yet. Bit of a rant but just learnt about this now.",longhairdude64,1h7z1fn,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7z1fn/rdj_as_doctor_doom_might_be_one_of_the_biggest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7z1fn/rdj_as_doctor_doom_might_be_one_of_the_biggest/,2024-12-06 11:10:49,0,0.21,0,0,35,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7z1fn

movies,"What titles to watch to engage in some schadenfreude, in light of recent healthcare news","I'm curious what films others might recommend to support the feelings of schadenfreude* many of us are feeling over the death of the UnitedHealthcare CEO.

There are two titles that come to my mind.

*The Rainmaker* is a '90s adaptation of a John Grisham legal drama novel of the same name, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Its cast is an absolute murderer's row of talent. In the film, &gt;!a young Matt Damon brings a case of unlawful denial of care against a huge healthcare insurer, on behalf of the family of a young man with leukemia.!&lt;

*Hell or High Water* is directed by David Mackenzie, based on a script by the only screenwriter whose name I've memorized, Taylor Sheridan. The modern western plot follows &gt;!two brothers as they go on a bank robbing spree against a particular chain of banks in order to gather the money needed to keep their family farm. Law enforcement is frustrated by locals who willfully turn a blind eye to the robberies in support against the bank they despise.!&lt;

I'm interested to hear titles that come to mind for others, and why you recommend it! Don't forget the spoiler tags either! \&gt;!spoiler text goes here, between the paired symbols!&lt;

movies,Rewatched The Devil Wears Prada,"I rewatched The Devil Wears Prada. I have not seen it for many years, so I was glad to revisit it especially after all the discussions revolving the movie. Here is what I get from the movie:

# Miranda is awful, but Andy is too naive to empathize for

Miranda's treatment of Andy is awful. I would feel bad for Andy if she was not so stupid. She is an aspiring journalist who is way too unperceptive to be an effective one.

From the beginning, she is being told by everyone her position is one people would die for. Despite this, she still sees it as a joke despite being told over and over again how serious this role is. The only reason she wanted the job is because her other choice was Auto Universe magazine. [Andy snickers at the choice of belts to choose.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-KQij0I8I) Miranda dresses her down in front of everyone. I would feel bad for her if she did not already been made aware how big of a deal this is. Like girl, you've been told so many times.

Next, Miranda asks her to do the impossible task of finding her a flight. When she fails, she is admonished by Miranda.

&gt;I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid. But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl. I had hope. I always have hope. But you’re as disappointing as anyone else.

Narratively, this scene is not earned. The task should be something difficult but not impossible, and probably something that someone who is interested in fashion could manage. Her saying that to Andy is more petty than cruel given the circumstances.

So what does Andy learns from this? [That Miranda hates her.](https://imgur.com/5Q2PaYS) [Nigel gives her a reality check.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJf-J5RXxw8) Nigel once again tells her how important Runway is, something she should have caught on right now. Then, Andy comes up with the first smart idea: start dressing like she works at Runway. Nigel even helps her, probably thinking ""this dumb bitch finally caught on"".

Later, Nigel is telling Andy about Miranda's scale:

&gt;In her way. There’s a scale. One nod, good. More than one nod -- very good. There is only one actual smile on record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she doesn’t like it, she shakes her head. And then there’s the pursing of the lips. Catastrophe.

So what are Andy's first words after this?

&gt;So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?

LIKE HOW ARE YOU STILL NOT GETTING THIS??????

Smart Andy is then gets bamboozled by twins in messing up the book delivery. For punishment, Miranda is giving her impossible task #2: get the unreleased Harry Potter book in 4 hours. She gets it done, which is insane. She is finally happy to get something right (that something right is literally doing the impossible, but to her it's like ""hahaha I finally did not majorly fuck up"")

The movie seems to want to make us believe that Andy is similar to Miranda. Miranda tells Andy:

&gt;I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.

How does Miranda see ANYTHING in her in Andy??? Andy is so naive and dumb. Then Miranda says that what Andy did to Emily was cold. How???

Miranda was basically threatening to fire Andy if she did not go to Paris. Hell,[ Andy even went to visit Emily in the hospital after her accident.](https://imgur.com/Qm3RMWj) Andy should know how Emily would feel about the Paris trip, but she is like ""omg you know how she is"". Either she is like Miranda visiting Emily at the Hospital for some sick pleasure (doubtful), or she is just naive about how the world works.

Anyways, Andy is pretty dumb.

# Nate is not really a bad boyfriend.

A big piece of the conversation revolving this movie is how bad of a boyfriend Nate is. Some even say he is the real villain. This is ridiculous. Here is my scene by scene take on him.

***SCENE 1 - Opening Montage***

[The first shot we get of Nate is him chilling in bed saying ""Good luck."" ](https://imgur.com/HCjFzJt)This is a man with no aspirations. While his girlfriend is getting ready to work, he is reading the comics + games section of the newspaper. Andy and Nate seem to be in good terms her though, so she is familiar with how he is.

***SCENE 2 - Dinner with Friends***

When Andy, Nate, and their friends go out to eat, her friends and her take solace in the fact that they all have shitty jobs. When walking back to home, they hold hands and make fun of how ridiculous the workers dress at Runway. This shows how both Andy and Nate do not take their jobs too seriously.

***SCENE 3 - Andy Coffee Dial***

Andy wakes up to a phone call from Emily and has to go get coffee immediately. [Nate's gives the look like he is saying ""oh brother... jobs am I right??""](https://imgur.com/lFllBP4)

***SCENE 4 - Andy is Venting About Her Job***

Nate is cooking a grilled cheese sandwich on a skillet, which is awfully on-brand for our underachieving king. Nate serves her the grilled cheese which Andy says that she will not partake because everyone is skinny at Runway (red flag?!?). Andy then makes the promise of it being only one year, which Nate nonchalantly says ""Easy there, tiger."" while he is chewing on the grilled cheese. Classic Nate.

***SCENE 5 - New Wardrobe***

Andy surprises Nate with her new clothes. Nate hits her with a [classic Nate line.](https://imgur.com/cALodxM) Now Nate somewhat superficially likes an aspect of her job.

***SCENE 6 - Bar with Friends***

This is where the main issue arrives. Andy sings the praises of Runway, which then Nate makes a quip about Andy drinking the Kool-Aid after praising Runway. This makes sense, they both laughed at how silly fashion is in the beginning, Nate still remains the same while Andy now admires it. The friends playing with her work phone when they just accepted gifts she got from work is shitty though.

Sidenote: the next scene, blonde hair man asks for some samples of her writing to get her connections. She rejects this offer because she is Miranda's assistant. So maybe Nate was onto something here...

***SCENE 7 + 8 - Andy calls Nate Saying She Wants to Quit.***

After given the impossible task of getting the Harry Potter books, she calls Nate saying she wants to quit. [We finally see Nate working, which is cool too.](https://imgur.com/SOoIlim) Next scene Nate comes home to see Andy working on the twins' science project (Red flag?!?!?!).  She starts defending her boss after Nate calls her a wacko (a wacko surely would not have their assistant work on her niece's science project). The conversation comes to an end when [Andy shows her sexy bra](https://imgur.com/SXRlBEL), which is the weakness of a simple man like Nate.

***SCENE 9 - Poor Nate is Alone on his Birthday***

Andy was working and had to miss Nate's birthday. She then [comes home to a single cupcake with a candle on top of it saying ""Happy Birthday"".](https://imgur.com/d8MSnyD) After briefly explaining herself, Nate just says ""Don't worry about it. I'm going to bed"". Not even Andy's sexy bra will save her this time. He then tells her ""You look very pretty"", and goes to bed. He is unhappy because Andy bailed on him.

***SCENE 10 - Andy Won't Go to Bed***

Nate asks Andy if she will go to bed. She says [five minutes ](https://imgur.com/9QnrUni)(doubtful). She is looking at some personal photos, but the tension is definitely there.

***SCENE 11 - The Art Exhibit***

Andy's friend sees the blonde man giving Andy a kiss on the cheek. Andy's friend asks Andy why she is cheating on Nate (it is a misunderstanding). The friend leaves, and clueless ass Nate comes from the back asking [""You're going to Paris?""](https://imgur.com/K90oVIo)

Nate asks ""I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or..."" and Andy responds ""Great. Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?"". Andy walks away [leaving Nate in utter shock.](https://imgur.com/Se2YpsG) They argue. Nate suggests to take a break. When Nate is walking away, Andy calls for him, but alas she gets call from Miranda.

This is probably the most contentious scene, but I do not see how Nate is in the wrong. Andy is completely different now, why would they want to stay together anyways? Nate is asking her to be genuine: either be the same with him or aspire to be a Runway worker. And he got his answer in the end, she decides to answer Miranda.

***SCENE 12 - Andy Apologizes to Nate***

Andy apologizes to Nate, saying:

&gt;Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?

This is apology misses the point. Andy shouldn't be sorry about that, she should be sorry for not knowing what she really wanted to be. Nate accepts the apology though, he is not very bright.

**IN CONCLUSION - Is Nate a Bad Boyfriend?**

Not really. He is a dumb underachiever. Andy changed too much and will not acknowledge it, so Nate had to say it openly for her to understand.

**TL;DR: The movie is not very well written.**",ParticularJoker,1h7pn6d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7pn6d/rewatched_the_devil_wears_prada/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7pn6d/rewatched_the_devil_wears_prada/,2024-12-06 01:26:39,0,0.35,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h7pn6d
movies,Subservience (2024) - Thriller/Sci-fi,"SPOOOOILER   
this is for those who HAVE WATCHED THE FILM AND WANT TO DISCUSS. this is my own take (why I liked it, what would have made it better, etc.)

this isn't ur average: ""robots take over the world and they're bad because..."" story. I mean, yes- from the beginning its giving- proceed with caution but this twist on what could be is fantastic. I was SO excited for this film before even watching it. I will begin with, I love futuristic, end of the world or new world films (and novels.) and I gotta say I love the idea of AI overpowering human kind because as a society we are ABSOLUTELY heading in that direction and surprisingly no one seems to realize this writing is an inference of what will happen if we continue. my overall score is 7/10 read below for my analysis and reasoning. 



my initial opinion of the main character (Nick) is he is smart, handy, nurturing, patient, and so goddamn sexy. hes a pretty complex character imo, he was constantly battling with what is right/ wrong from the beginning.  he works a blue collar job (that can and eventually are replaced by SIMS) and tries his hardest to fight against his friends losing their jobs. but he actively uses extremely advanced technology like his refrigerator, populating bars utilizing SIMS to serve, and ofc hiring his own SIM. he expresses a high sex drive (source: when Maggie (his wife) is literally in the hospital bed waiting for her heart surgery, hes making jokes abt getting her back to the marathons they used to have- but she doesn't seem to mind, shes pressing into him too so we can only assume she has an equally high sex drive too) but remains faithful even when he feels an unintentional attraction to Alice. 

when Nick asked Alice to wipe her memory in order to ""experience"" Casablanca, that's exactly what she did. she consumes the film as if shes a part of it. erasing her program to reprogram the story as her own. she tells Nick that resetting her in order to ""forget"" the memory she has of Casablanca will be antithetical, but he still does it. the quote from the movie we see is ""you are a man. if someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?"" then the call is interrupted by a call from Maggie. 

  
the entire film counters being dependent on AI, but very much distinguishing their inability to experience life through emotions. in the beginning scenes, the sales person explains the longer the AI unit is with the family/ the more knowledge it obtains the better it will perform. but no one seems to think they can replicate emotions or make decisions outside of their based programming?   
as soon as she wipes her memory.. she learns only: Nick, Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland. throughout the film we see her putting together the metaphoric similarities of their real life to the characters of Alice in Wonderland when speaking with Isla as well. she even notes wiping her own civility because ""it's better."" aka more human. aka creating a more genuine link to human emotion. (this doesn't make sense to me, because in this film- the companies programming these SIMS are extremely hands on- later in the film the company even immediately takes action in bringing in two employees well after working hours to reset/ reprogram Alice. every story of robots taking over the world seems to always conclude that robots will outsmart the companies who make them. so in a world where we're so far advanced; AI is in your home and consuming more and more information all the time, is it really so crazy to assume the companies who created them would want to check in on their projects' progress? the amount of times we hear how much money they cost, you think they would have scheduled tune ups frequently. with scheduled check ups, the companies would have found out a lot of her program was wiped and I think this fact kind of kept me in movie mode- not so much lose myself in the film mode.)

   
to me, it's obvious the matter of ""messing around"" with Alice wouldn't have ever crossed Nick's mind if she didn't look the way she did. there would have never been a moment where he was willing to risk anything if Alice was ""an old English butler,"" which was originally what Nick and Maggie had originally discussed when purchasing a nanny SIM.   
he gives the explanation that ""Isla chose her,"" and I think this is a really great moment to note: he really was teetering back and forth whether he found it wrong or not. he clearly liked to look but even if the idea crossed his mind- he never tempted himself with any action. it wasn't until Maggie told Alice that if she died, Alice needed her to comfort Nick and make sure he's taken care of. the first time they messed around (in the garage later that night) Alice initiated it. she convinced him she wasn't real (because her heartbeat is just a simulation programmed to provide comfort to humans) and encouraged him to proceed if only for his own health and he does.   
the second time is after the shower when she again, tempts him with lingerie and a blindfold. she disguises herself as Maggie which was such a nice touch because it really enforces the idea that there is nothing human about her and essentially can be or do whatever he needs. and \*\*ok honestly\*\* lets face it the bathroom scene was... nice   ͡° ͜  ͡  
  
BUT I really hate that that's the extent of their relationship. the next morning, Nick ""ends it"" with her, the wife gets her surgery and comes home and then it turns into this weird vibe between the women. all of a sudden, we see a jealous/ competitive side from Maggie (ie: dirty looks when Alice cared for the baby, cattiness towards Alice when she asked for the family recipe, etc.) I dont understand because at this point Maggie has no idea that Alice and Nick have had sex- Alice has only shown she is an obedient and hard-working and loving nanny so idk how the vibes are so far off when there wasnt a single hospital visit that was weird?

here's where the story line goes all over the place. there was SO much build up between Nick and Alice and then for like 6 scenes in a row you don't even see the two of them in conversation. we have the playground scene (where we learn Alice has changed her software to have more of a human approach to casual encounters,) the shower scene between Nick and Maggie (where Alice interrupts with Isla's nightmare,) then we see Monty attack Nick, Alice k\*lling Monty (\*but we also learn that Monty: hater of all SIMS, OWNS A SIM. he's coked out and contemplating suicide but we also learn hes been using and ab\*sing his SIM,) then the bathtub scene between the women (again- would have been a nice time to see Alice be useful to Maggie??? this woman has just had open heart surgery, her medicine has proved two separate times to cause dizziness, and she isn't thankful to have the extra hands on deck. again- up until THIS POINT SPECIFICALLY, she doesnt know Nick and Alice have hooked up. obviously in this scene, she puts it together, but in my perfect world, she would have accepted the help from Alice and welcomed the extra energy she has to take care of her husband- which before she was about to die was her only concern? idk weird continuity there, but again this is the scene she puts together that they've indeed had sex. but then immediately the scene goes from Maggie and Nick talking about his affair to Alice trying to drown the baby. 

??? huh !!! ???   
I have watched this movie now three times all the way through and this just does not add up. her software changes up until this point could always be justified with \~what she was learning real time.\~ she says its bc Max is a ""burden,"" which in the beginning Nick (when Max was crying,) shushes him and says ""quite the little burden,"" but the words are never brought up again and that was BEFORE the hard wipe before Casablanca. so..... yeah I really really dont understand this part.   
not to mention miss ""I just had open heart surgery"" takes on scaling the house and fighting a robot? 

  
I definitely wouldnt have made her turn on the kids- if there was no hope in seeing a harmonious relationship between the women, I would have much rather seen Alice drowning Maggie in the bathtub and played it off as ""people accidentally drown all the time,"" or using her medication symptoms to her own advantage and coerced Maggie into hurting herself or the kids (making Nick question her character, aka not be in love with her.) 

ok so then yada yada, we're at the hospital with the baby to check on his vitals (even though he was never even submerged in the water? kinda dramatic to take him by ambulance to the ER but whatever. flashes to the bar scene where Alice speaks in a revised quote from Casablanca and informs Nick, she k\*lled Monty for him, and will take care of his family (alluding to the fact that she had connections in the hospital at the same moment.) then Nick attempts to trick her (c'mon now.. shes clearly proved she cant die?) and k\*ll her and he races to the hospital. ofc we get this unrealistic fast and furious driving through the snowy streets only to have his car crash into an ambulance pinning Alice in between them. SHOCKER: she still doesnt die. we have to sit through terrible fight sequences and multiple fake deaths before everyone walking away barely scathed. Nick is in a hospital bed with light bruising and Maggie is healing in a wheelchair with both children and she invites him to come home \*rolls eyessssss. the film then ends with a 30 second clip of Alice's software uploading on every SIM and her opening her eyes after reconstruction of her face implying a sequel.... I’m gonna go ahead and say we dont need it. 

tldr;   
my rating would be higher than 7/10 if the company was more hands on, there was more of a relationship (whether that would have been friendship or romantic) built between Nick and Alice, a more manipulative side of Alice towards Maggie, more mentions of Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland (so we could have definitively seen the allusion to the stories playing IRL for Alice,) and heres a big kicker: I really wish that Nick would have died in the car crash. this may be so so over the top controversial, but I think it would have been very \~poetic justice\~ if he died trying to save Maggie when it was his actions that potentially destroyed them in the first place  

  
anyway :) definitely watch the movie!! big fan!!

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovenia,"Hello there!

Since more than 40 days, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. Yesterday, we took a look at Slovakia, and even though I haven't seen the winning movie yet - as is so often the case here - I'm pretty sure it will be a worthy entry on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Obchod na Korze*** (engl.: *The Shop on Main Street*) has not only made it here, but also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.

Will we have such a high-ranking visitor in the next round, too? Well, we'll see. Our next country is no longer Slovakia, but **Slovenia**, and as everytime before, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,ONE NECK - Adrian Lyne's upcoming movie,"Any news? When will production start? I found a copy of the script and LOVE IT!!!

VARIETY Oct 13, 1998 -

HEROES AMID PESTILENCE: Todd Alcott is thriving as a scribe who finds heroes amid pestilence. First, he co-wrote the hit pic “Antz,” which turns those insects into sympathetic sorts. Now, he’s got a script that delivers a serial killer worth rooting for, and it’s got director Adrian Lyne seriously considering making it his next film.

The project, set up at Dimension, is called “One Neck,” described as a social commentary about the higher classes in Easthampton. The lead character endures the loathsome lot around him until he’s revealed as a serial killer who begins bumping off the upper-crusters at a party.

Lyne, who last directed “Lolita,” counts that among several helming options, which include “The Murder Next Door” at Sony and an untitled project he’s developed at Fox 2000.

Alcott, who started as a Gotham playwright, also has adapted the zombie comic book “Dead World” for Warner Bros. and producers George Clooney and Robert Lawrence. He’s repped by ICM’s Todd Feldman and Leora Bloch and managed by Linne Radmin of the Radmin Co., who’s producing “One Neck” with Howard Meltzer.",noeunofficial,1h7kl6v,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,2024-12-05 21:37:00,0,0.27,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h7kl6v
movies,🔥 Pushpa 2: The Rule - The Most Anticipated Sequel of the Year! 🔥,"The Positives:

1. Allu Arjun's Performance: He’s the soul of the movie. His portrayal of Pushpa Raj is even more charismatic and intense than in the first film. From his swagger to his emotional depth, Arjun delivers in every scene.


2. Action and Visuals: The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. They’re larger-than-life but still gritty, which fits the tone perfectly. The cinematography adds a cinematic grandeur that amplifies the experience.


3. Music and Background Score: Devi Sri Prasad nails it again. The songs and the background music elevate every scene, especially during high-octane moments and emotional beats.


4. Narrative Depth: Compared to the first film, the sequel explores Pushpa’s personal and professional battles more thoroughly. The emotional connection with his family adds a layer of relatability.


5. Villain's Presence: Fahadh Faasil as Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat is a standout. His face-offs with Pushpa are thrilling and add a lot of weight to the story.




---

The Negatives:

1. Lengthy Runtime: The movie feels stretched in parts. Some scenes could have been trimmed to keep the pacing tighter, especially in the second half.


2. Predictable Moments: While the core storyline is engaging, certain plot twists feel predictable, taking away some of the excitement.


3. Over-the-Top Action: While fans of masala entertainers might love it, some viewers may find the action sequences a bit exaggerated.


4. Focus on Subplots: At times, the film delves too deep into side plots, which distracts from the main narrative.


5. Comparisons with the First Film: Some fans felt it lacked the raw energy and novelty that made Pushpa: The Rise so impactful. The bar was set so high that this sequel, despite its strengths, doesn’t completely surpass it.




---

Final Word:

If you loved the first part, Pushpa 2 offers plenty to enjoy, especially with Allu Arjun’s electrifying performance and the intense drama. But the pacing and predictability might leave some viewers wishing for a tighter edit. Overall, it’s a mix of high-octane entertainment and emotional storytelling worth a watch, especially on the big screen.",EngineeringWorldly45,1h7jvgq,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,2024-12-05 21:07:37,0,0.17,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h7jvgq

Stuff that disturbed me in these movies this guy just laughs at. (Spoilers ahead) like in the house that jack built when he murders the whole family. He said he thought that was funny. And i couldn’t even look at the screen. I was getting sick to my stomach.

Granted I liked a lot of movies from these directors, but they were definitely not an easy watch and I wouldn’t want to watch them again.

Does it say something about someone psychologically if they love these kind of movies? Im not at all saying they’re bad people. But i just wonder why people enjoy this stuff and actively seek it out.

movies,The sequels to Terminator 2,"I just re-watched all the Terminator 3 versions, and just thought I'd give some feedback.

I'm a big fan of the original two movies. T2 is IMHO one of the best movies ever made. T1 is also an amazing movie, but I don't feel it's aged well.

The TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles I feel was the best continuation of the series. Though there was a lot of filler episodes, it felt true to the spirit of the Terminator franchise.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines I really didn't like. There's too many jokes, it feels like a parody. Stuff like the camp glasses the T800 wears and the breasts inflating. The ended felt really good, but the journey felt so corny I couldn't enjoy it.

(Terminator Salvation I haven't watched yet, but it's a continuation from Rise of the Machines, so I'm comfortable leaving it out).

Terminator Genisys I think is my favorite T3. I enjoyed the twists with John Conner and the stuff about Genisys, and the stuff with Pops. It's weak as a Terminator film, but it feels like the best of a bad bunch.

Terminator: Dark Fate I cannot stand. The twist at the start with John just left a bad taste in my mouth, and the humanization of the T800 just makes no sense. I don't understand how they got Linda Hamilton to do this (Arnie I can understand).",TechnicalBean,1h7jesc,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jesc/the_sequels_to_terminator_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jesc/the_sequels_to_terminator_2/,2024-12-05 20:48:13,0,0.36,0,0,16,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7jesc

This is one of my least favorite Lionsgate films of all time, and yes, this film still gives me nightmares...

So, let's get to the review.

***THE PLOT:*** What was the writer of that Ashton Kutcher film up to... wait... if this film came out the same year as the Open Season 3 film, why didn't we get a real villain? Why is there a scene of it ripping-off The Lion King? **WHY IS THAT MOONLIGHT HOWL SCENE SO SCARY!?** 

***THE CHARACTERS:*** Lilly is surprisingly a likable and fun character, and she's still one of my favorite characters of all time in Lionsgate history. Everyone else? Well, we'll get to that later.

***THE ANIMATION:*** Holy shit. What is up with the fucking animation!? Yes, it's like a PS3 game or something, even a deleted scene on the film's Blu-Ray had better animation. I like the expressions on the characters.

***THE VOICE ACTING:*** Honestly, I prefer the cast of this film, and not the sequel cast of Sonic actors and anime dubbers. I like Justin Long and co.'s voices, sounding far more cute than Ben Diskin and co.'s voices in the sequel media.

***OVERALL:*** Well, this was what ruined Lionsgate even further, the only thing that I hate more than this film are those seven-shitty direct-to-video sequels that Lionsgate made just for money, and I might write a new story/retelling of the sequel that ignores the DTV sequels.

**THE PLOT:** The whole plot of Patch feeling left out by all of his siblings and the only thing that cheers him up would be his favorite TV show. I like how Patch is a great and likable character, and Thunderbolt also is a fun and enjoyable character too.

**THE ANIMATION:** I'm surprised that the animation is more in-line with the original 1961 film, keeping the scratchy outline/xerography aspect, and is feeling like the previous film's animation as well. Kinda good that Television Animation was capable of making good animated sequels.

**THE VOICE ACTING:** Even though everyone from the original is **fucking dead**. Everyone here has a brand new cast, I like the voices of Lockwood and everyone else, as many of the new actors do splendid jobs recapturing the magic of everyone.

On the one hand, Fede Alvarez did talk with Ian's wife to see if she was fine with them doing this, so the person who would most likely be affected by seeing Ian on screen was removed from the equation. And this wasn't a copy of Ian's most relevant appearance, aka the year before he died, so you might make a case for that too.

On the other hand, getting permission from his wife isn't like getting permission from him. So you can't say he would have been fine with his appearance being used. As for the point of his younger appearance being used, this might actually not matter at all since it is still Ian's appearance.

Look! I really liked Romulus, but this could have been easily avoided if they just cast someone who looks like Ian to play Rook or keep with the original plan to have a different person for Rook. That was possible since the movie has amazing practical effects, and I'm sure the artists would have come up with genius ideas to hide the lower part of Rook's body. I am very mixed with this approach...",Werewolf_Knight,1h7h1r1,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7h1r1/genuinely_how_do_you_feel_about_how_alien_romulus/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7h1r1/genuinely_how_do_you_feel_about_how_alien_romulus/,2024-12-05 19:09:30,0,0.41,0,0,87,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7h1r1
movies,Theory about the missing folder in Whiplash (2014),"In Whiplash (2014)Tanner’s Whiplash sheet music can be seen in the first rehearsal. In the final scene where Nieman plays for Fletcher, the same exact sheet music with the same markings can be seen. Suggesting it was stolen by either Nieman or Fletcher. 

https://imgur.com/a/unFP8da

Okay, given that there is no scene where we see the actual sheet being given to Nieman at the end of the film it can’t be totally confirmed BUT to consider: 

 1. Before the final scene Nieman clearly has brought his own folder with him for the concert. Does this mean that the whiplash sheet music would be in that folder?  

 2. Fletcher could have given Nieman the sheet music when he got there, but this is never seen. It would depend on what the usual protocol is for concerts which I don’t know much about.  

 3. In the middle of the movie, Nieman can be seen photocopying copy’s of whiplash to learn at his dorm. This version has NO markings on it. Which suggests that Fletcher gives out blank pages with no markings and the markings were put there by Tanner himself, the version we see at the first rehearsal and at the final scene has to be his own personal one.

It’s hard for me to narrow it down, but the funniest scenes for me were Dustin Hoffman getting crushed by rubble in what is essentially a family guy style cutaway. One of the most unceremonious deaths I’ve ever seen, especially considering how little of the movie he was in.

Any scene with Shia Labeouf, all of them were wild. I think I’ll go with when he throws his hat down and yells at his assistant to pick it up, who in turn does the same thing to the guy behind them

movies,WDAS and Pixar Copying Marvel Studios IP Flex Logo in the Future?,"I have been thinking about how Disney and Marvel Studios changed logo branding forever by making it their standard of having long, grandiose, self-serving and congratulatory logos that pretty much serve as a sizzle reel to promote their most popular and relevant brands. Kids and Disney Adults are more likely to be exposed to already established IP that is safe to invest rather than new ideas (which are likely to banned in Hollywood in favor of tax write offs).

The current Disney Studios logo is honestly very stimulative and busy with the fireworks and Easter Eggs all over it.

What if Disney Animation and Pixar decide one day to change their logos to copy exactly what Marvel is doing?

For WDAS, Steamboat Mickey transitions only to their most relevant ""franchises"" like Frozen, Wreck-it-Ralph, the Disney Princesses and Zootopia along with some other movies similar to the current DreamWorks logo.

Pixar, whether it is still the hopping lamp or phased out, is stepped aside in favor of their biggest franchises like Toy Story, Cars, Incredibles and Inside Out.

Christophe Beck and Michael Giacchino can compose new music to mimic the Marvel Studios fanfare with a minimalistic rhythm and melody that is just enough to sell it. And the logos have to clock in at 30-40 seconds. Disney has made long logos their identity and do you think they can pull this strategy off for both Disney Animation and Pixar? What other ideas do you have in mind if they were mandated to reimagine their logos?

DreamWorks and Star Wars have done this now.

And then we've got Queenan, who seems to be this pure and virtuous man, uncorrupted by his environment. And yet he's risen to a high rank in a corrupt organization!

SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN THIS MOVIE 





I took an edible and watched “Smile 2” (yeah i know that was stupid) and I’m really just whelmed about. Not over, not under, but just kinda “meh”. The performances were great. Naomi Scott absolutely killed it. I think the thing that’s making me think about it and making me wonder if it would have worked was if in the marketing and advertising for the movie, the audience didn’t know that she was a pop star. I mean the joke as soon as the movie was announced was that it’d be someone at a concert in front of a bunch of people, but I just keep thinking what if the marketing led us in a completely different direction making the audience think that she was maybe just a daughter to someone with money and the final “twist” of the movie was us finding out that she was some famous pop star that offs herself in front of thousands.

movies,Gangs of New York revisted,"I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn’t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn’t remember anything about it.

Holy hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.

Leonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.

Daniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.

We’ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.

One of his killings (and you’ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I’ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).

The production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.

How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?

For example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley. It's like they're rendered too colorful and too dull at the same time, making them lack life or something.

What is that? Does anyone else get that feel? What are the words to describe this distinction? Because every time I talk about it I don't get the sense that people actually see what I mean, since I'm not solely talking about the cinematography, I don't think, it's more of a *feeling* of emptiness and fakeness.

For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.

movies,Film Schools education,"Hello, everyone. I’m curious to know if film schools worldwide generally lack in providing quality film education, or if it’s just the one I’m attending in Turkey that is subpar. My experience has been rather disappointing, as many professors here seem to lack even a basic understanding of fundamental concepts like the three-act structure, blocking/staging, or shot sizes.

For example, I recently had marks deducted because my professor claimed that a close-up shot I used was actually an extreme close-up. To clarify, the shot was indeed a close-up, quite similar to the iconic ""Here’s Johnny"" shot from The Shining. When I challenged this, asking him what he would consider a shot focusing on just the eyes, mouth, hand, or nose, he said it was a ""cut-in"" shot. Frankly, I’ve never encountered ""cut-in"" as a term for a shot size in any academic or professional context—it refers to a type of edit, not a shot size.

Additionally, the instructors often make us analyze critically panned films, urging us to focus on basic themes and cookie cutter lessons rather than on the craftsmanship of the art—be it the editing, the screenplay, or the visual aesthetics.

Is this the standard for film education globally, or is the Turkish system uniquely flawed? I'd love to hear your insights.

movies,Movies that people say are bad but you love ,"What movies that people say are bad but you love to watch them. 3 of my favorites are Last Action Hero, Howard The Duck, and the Killer Tomatoes series. In Last Action Hero a lot of people just didn't get the joke. They came in expecting the usual Arnold action movie but got instead a brilliant parody of the entire genre loaded with just about every action movie trope imaginable and tons of Easter eggs. Howard The Duck was fun to watch due to the absurdity of the entire movie. Killer Tomatoes is a great piece of parody of the horror movie genre made on a shoestring budget.

movies,The 12 Die Hards of Christmas,"Inspired by a comment in a different thread I have concocted this list of movie plot descriptions. Each entry is a different Christmas movie and *probably* isn't Die Hard. Despite how they may sound. This is all just for fun and my own amusement. Hope you all enjoy.

1. Working class hero is terrorized by upper class villain who steals money during Christmas

2. Lone individual hiding nearby attempts to ruin a group's Christmas time plan.

3. Estranged father from New York has trouble reconnecting with his son due to shenanigans involving a high rise.

4. Father has Christmas plans for his family but they go awry following an argument with his wife culminating in a violent police raid of the building he's in.

5. Thieves rob a vault at Christmas time but their getaway plan is derailed by unexpected interference.

6. Thieves attempt to rob a building and are repeatedly thwarted by a particular unexpected occupant.

7. After facing down an intruder on the roof a father must reluctantly rise to the challenge to be able to reconnect with his family.

8. An unexpected man's identity is unclear but he may just be the hero everyone needs.

9. Father who wants to make Christmas nice has to deal with an unexpected foe culminating in a fight on top of a building.

10. A father wishing to reconnect with his family must deal with unexpected troublemakers at Christmas.

11. A sizable group of trouble makers enact their plan at Christmas time. The police are helpless to stop them and an interloper has to step up.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovakia,"Hello there!

A bit more than 24 hours ago, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Serbia, and to be honest, as an outsider, I'm absolutely surprised. Not so much about the fact, that *A Serbian Film* didn't win (okay, a little bit about that too), but more about how much hate it got especially by - as it seems to me - the Serbs themselves. As a result, instead of this very unappetizing film, ***Balkanski špijun*** (engl.: *Balkan Spy*) has now won the contest.

But no sooner has a new movie earned its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) than we move on to the next country. Now it's all about **Slovakia** and as the 41 times before, there are only two rules to have in regard in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Santa and Mrs Claus are kidnappers because they allow the kids to stay at the north pole for at least a year at the end of the movie.

movies,Italian cinema: a brief summary from my POV,"# This is a summary of my thoughts on Italian cinema and its evolution, with a FOCUS ON ITS DECLINE AND RETURN. I’d love to hear other perspectives and expand the discussion. What do you think?

* **Golden Age:** The triumphs of Italian cinema.
* **Decline:** The exploitation of cinema and loss of relevance in the 1980s.
* **Mediaset Monopoly:** How Mediaset and generalist TV took over.
* **Internet &amp; Streamers:** The rebirth driven by the internet and streaming platforms.

# Golden Age

Italian cinema has always been a global powerhouse. During the silent film era, Italy produced massive historical epics, featuring hundreds of extras and drawing from its rich history (from the Roman Empire to *The Divine Comedy* and beyond).

During World War II, Italian cinema shifted toward propaganda, moving away from artistic creativity to serve political power.

After the war, *neorealism* was born. While Hollywood was stuck under restrictive production codes, Italian filmmakers were telling raw, universal stories about post-war struggles—groundbreaking narratives that resonated far beyond Italy’s borders.

# Decline: The Exploitation of Cinema

In the '60s and '70s, Hollywood abandoned its production codes, and by the '80s, the advent of visual effects caused a major shift. The U.S. soared to new global heights in filmmaking, far surpassing Italian cinema.

Italy, meanwhile, struggled to modernize. The loss of the neorealist pioneers left a vacuum, and new filmmakers turned to short-sighted strategies. They leaned into low-budget projects that mimicked blockbuster aesthetics, piggybacking on Hollywood trends to squeeze out quick profits. This led to a drop in quality and, more importantly, respect from audiences. Italian cinema became synonymous with mediocrity.

# Mediaset Monopoly

Around the same time, television was rising as a dominant force in entertainment, pulling audiences away from theaters. By the late '80s, Mediaset was founded.

Through the '90s and 2000s, Mediaset capitalized on this shift, creating a cultural monopoly. Anything produced or aired by Mediaset was consumed by the vast majority of Italians, if not the entire audience.

Mediaset cultivated its own *star system*, building celebrities rather than artists. The cultural output during this era? Talk shows, game shows, reality TV, and low-quality films and series—cheaply produced and aimed purely at generating profit and mindless entertainment.

# Internet &amp; Streamers: A Rebirth

With the rise of the internet, younger generations shifted their attention online, leaving behind the Mediaset-dominated culture that had shaped Italy for decades.

By the 2010s, platforms like YouTube had become major hubs for youth entertainment. Around 2018, streaming services started cutting into Mediaset’s once-dominant share. Netflix led the charge, followed by Prime Video and Sky. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram later became central sources of creative content.

Today, Mediaset’s cultural monopoly is largely a thing of the past, especially among younger Italians. While older generations (those from the '70s and '80s) still keep their TVs tuned to Rai or Mediaset for programs like *Wheel of Fortune* with Gerry Scotti, younger people see traditional TV as outdated. It’s not personalized, it feels repetitive, and it’s not delivering high-quality content.

After 40 years of cultural decline—from the exploitation of cinema to Mediaset’s reign—streamers have brought international standards to their Italian productions. They effortlessly outcompete the trashy, generalist programming of traditional TV. Meanwhile, social media is fostering a new wave of original, satisfying, and artistic content.

A fresh *star system* is emerging, centered on genuine artistic quality rather than the superficial generalism that defined past generations.

We love comedy and the occasional thriller. We were thinking of watching the Smile 2 but I wanted to see if anyone here knew if there's any content in it that would be hard for us to watch rn.

movies,1993 was peak Spielberg. Has there been another year like it for anyone else?,"Hi all,

Just a random daydream earlier about how amazing 1993 was with both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List being directly by the same guy. Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).

i have netflix, disney+, bbc iplayer, prime and paramount+

i like movies such as all three jurassic worlds/jurassic park, 65, journey to the centre of the earth, dinosaur and walking with dinosaurs. 

id prefer real like movies (not animated)

movies,The ending of American Mary,"The movie is good overall.

But I'm confused about its ending. Why did Ruby's husband want to kill Mary?

In my opinion, Mary did nothing wrong with Ruby. She just fulfilled Ruby's desire. Ruby would like to transform her body like a doll (transforming the private parts like a doll). Marry accepted to operate surgery because Ruby gave her a bunch of money for that. Then Rudy got doll-like body. Ruby's husband tried to kill Mary when he found out that his wife body is like a doll.

What stands out is the climax, in which she is on some Carousel Ride, enjoying herself. All the sudden, the carousel horses seem to be taking her away. From what it turns out, she wakes up from a very bad dream in which the carousel horses were taking her away.

I have been trying very futiley for many years to figure out the name of this program. I don't remember if it's a movie or if it was a TV episode or Pilot, or just a special that was made in general.

movies,I don't get Beau is Afraid. At all.,"Most of the time, even when I like/love a movie, I can tell why someone might disagree (I love Avatar 2, but I agree with like 90% of the criticism and see them as valid). And vice versa, even if I hate something, I can usually tell why someone might like it (Infinity Pool was hot garbage to me, but I can see where somebody can be enthralled by the premise). I cannot do that with Beau is Afraid. It's just pure ass to me. Spoilers ahead.

The plot boils down to ""A controlling mother orchestrates her son's (Beau's) journey back home, torturing him every step of the way, only to kill him in the end"". This movie is noted as an absurdist black comedy- on its Wikipedia, so this isn't my perspective-, but it's not funny. I've literally laughed more watching Saw movies. I get dark humor, but dark humor has to have a proper target. There's no rocket science. It's a two-step process: remove sympathy for the target, then hurt them in unexpected ways. Beau is Afraid seemed to have skipped step one, so it feels like watching someone drown a sack of puppies for two hours.

And the ""absurdist' angle doesn't work either. First off, all of the absurdity except for maybe the penis monster is mundane. The disparity between the scenes and reality are a light parody filter at-best. Characters weren't outrageous, they were just caricatures; I could easily see all of them in a GTA cutscene. Not old wacky GTA, but new, exaggerated-shitty-realistic GTA. Secondly, even that level of absurdity is watered down by the reveal that the mother's been orchestrating everything. Suddenly, the scenes like everything at the doctor's house and the time where everyone walked into his apartment complex become fully explained and there's no absurdity to it at all. I'll admit, the penis monster is a surprise, but it's a surprise 1:30 into the movie; it's a little late to try to establish the genre you claim to be. 

I'm not 100% hating 100% of its aspects. Visually, it has its moments, and the acting is fine, too, but good visuals and solid performances can't cover for shit writing and a hollow premise

movies,Jim Carreys Grinch is the Definitive adaptation. Yeah I said it.,"Rewatched the Jim Carrey Grinch movie tonight. Idc what anyone says, this is the definitive version of the story. Don't get me wrong, the original animated short is a classic and always will be, but the Jim Carrey version will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the only Dr. Seuss film that updates the original story, while still sticking true to what the original book standed for, if not enhances it.

Not to mention the set design is absolutely phenomenal, and Jim Carrey as The Grinch is everything. Not just the makeup work, which is also phenomenal, but his performance as well. Unlike Mike Myers Cat in the Hat, who was just phoning it in to the point where it felt like he didn't even want to be there, Jim Carrey put 110% into his performance, he almost became one with the suit and captured the character perfect, while still adding his own energenic flair that Carrey is known for.

It's not perfect, not all the jokes land, I could do without seeing Grinch's face in....um......Melons, and while ""Where are you Christmas"" Is a beautiful song, in the context of the film, it feels out of place, especially since it's not a musical. But overall, I absolutely love this underrated classic, and I'm glad it's finally getting the recognition it deserves. Especially after the shit piece from Illumination.

movies, Park Chan-wook's Decision to Leave and how it embraces modern tech ,"This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.

Decision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and ""smart"" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.

This is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.

1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices

* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.
* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.
* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners
* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app
* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)
* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to ""point"") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.
* The ""captain's log"" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app
* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up
* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.

1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.

* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.
* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband
* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband

1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices

* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.
* I like the ""switch"" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks
* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear
* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly

Overall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.

movies,Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before,"Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, ""But where's his brother?"", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.

- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.

- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. ""Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic."" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of ""There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!"" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.

- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (""I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box""). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the ""real"" prestige.

movies,I really want a Violent Night prequel!,"Watching the film again as I had since last year as part of my Christmas movie tradition! This movie has become my favorite Christmas movie! I just love how its Die Hard with Santa and Santa being this former Viking warrior that's atoning for his sins! Can't wait for the sequel.

But you know what else would be better?

A prequel of how Nicomund the Red came to be Santa. Seriously Hollywood, after the sequel you gotta get on this! :D

My idea could be it had something to do with the Norse Gods as it was Odin who bestowed Nicomund the Red with immortality as he became Santa Claus to atone for his sins, and his hammer skullcrusher having been forged by the dwarf brothers Brokkr and Eitri and they're actually amongst Santa's helpers who decided to take them in at the North Pole alongside his elves after Ragnarok occurred killing the Norse Gods.

movies,Thriller fans should check out The Last Stop In Yuma County,"This is highly impressive debut by Francis Galluppi, who's set to direct the next Evil Dead movie. It's a single-locatio thriller that takes place in a diner in the middle of a desert highway. Two of the guests are bank robbers who are on the run but their car has run out of gas, and one of them is played by a truly menacing Richard Brake. It's similar to movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Hate, and The Standoff at Sparrow Creek in that it's only a matter of time until the tension erupts into violence, but Galluppi does a great job at squeezing tension out of the littlest moments until the poop hits the fan.

After seeing this, I'm interested to see what Galluppi brings to the Evil Dead franchise, as he knows how to build simmering tension, unleash violence, and sprinkle it with some dark humor.

movies,Trying to figure out a movie title,"Ok so it's a horror/comedy about an asian(?) Burglar and his girlfriend who work with 1 or 2 others.  The beginning of the movie has the main character arrested during a botched job.  Either he goes to jail or can't get in trouble again without going to jail...but he needs money for a debt I believe.  His girlfriend convinces him to take 1 last job with 1 goofy really tall burglar who's sort of a gangsta asian dude maybe he was her brother?  So they break into a guy's house and find a woman chained in the basement and then they free her.  I remember the twist at the endingish being that it was her kink to be chained down there and she was with the killer home owner all along.  
It was a very similar movie to the collector series,  that war veteran movie where the kids break in, but for the life of my I can't find the name anywhere online from Google searches.  It was kind of low budget....legit hilarious at times and really well made I feel like for it's budget.

movies,Horror films without omnipotent villains,"Hi all,

I watch a decent amount of horror films and a trope that I hate in the genre is when the villains are seemingly omnipotent by which I mean this like:

1. They win no matter what
2. Nothing they do ever fails in any way
3. Nothing the main characters do has any impact on the outcome
4. Even if the main characters destroy/win somehow the villain is just back at the end

This can look a lot of ways depending on the kind of villain in the film but the principal is similar. 

I personally find these kids of endings really boring I think because they feel totally unreal and not analogous to the real world as I perceive it. I once complained about this regarding a specific movie and a friend said she loved the ending because it was realistic (she's a very cynical person). 

I'm wondering what you guys think of this trope on general. Anyone else find it boring and tired like me?

Also do any of you have any suggestions for good horror films that somehow subvert this?

Films that I think subvert this and are good include:
The Orphanage (Spanish film)
Babadook
Alien
The mist (though holy hell that ending has it's own problems lol)

movies, Favorite movie by european country: Serbia,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in San Marino. As expected, it wasn't easy to find any movie that fits to the criteria here, but I think, we've found a winner which in a way reflects the heart of this journey very well: ***Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino*** (engl.: *The Unknown Man of San Marino*) is absolutely one of those hidden gems I hoped to find during this project.

Today, I think, it will be easier again to find movies and to be honest, I think, that it's very easy to guess the winner that will take its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). We turn our attention to **Serbia** and, as always, have only two rules to follow:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"Were the Detectives at the beginning of ""A Bronx Tale"" Paid off/Fake cops?","Just a thought i Had while rewatching A Bronx Tale at the part where the 2 detectives ask C who the shooter was. I thought it because It's just really strange, Firstly them knowing C was a witness, how would they know that? Did a witness tell them? And if so why didn't they ask THAT witness what they thought rather than the child, furthermore how did that witness know what C's name was? Secondly, they never bring C or Lorenzo to a police station or something that looks more formal, they just line some guys up on the street and ask C who did it, And Thirdly all the suspects were in the mafia. There's more, like how they're both Italian American And It's a very strange way to ask a witness what they thought. As to why the Mafia would do this, It's likely a way to see if they thought C was worthy of becoming a mobster later in life as they've seen him at the bar before looking at sonny, though Sonny wasn't the boss at this point so this might be unlikely, It's also possible this was just to determine if they should kill C or silence him somehow incase the Real police were to ask him. There's some parts that make me think otherwise, like how there is other cops there but they could easily be bribed/fake too, and that mainly, it makes sonny's character look way worse morally but then again he wouldn't be calling the shots at this point and that Mafia dressing up as police is a little silly but has happened before..

movies,has joe biden ever commented on greg kinnear's portrayal of him in confirmation?,"in 2016, HBO aired the movie confirmation, a movie about the clarence thomas congressional hearings. although it's not among the most famous HBO original movies, the film was acclaimed when it was aired and was even nominated for a few awards. the film has also made several lists of the best HBO original films, which considering their filmography is no easy feat.

in my opinion, one of the best things about the movie is the performances. of course, you have kerry washington and wendell price as anita hill and clarence thomas respectively. however, another important character is joe biden since he's the one who oversaw the hearings. in the film, biden is portrayed by greg kinnear and he gives a really stellar performance in my opinion. not only is he a dead ringer for a young joe biden but he captures his mannerisms and voice perfectly. kinnear captures the essence of biden without dipping into parody and, as a result, gives one of his best performances in my opinion.

it is not uncommon for real life people who are still alive when biopics are made about them to comment on their portrayals. i'm kind of curious if joe biden himself had anything to say about kinnear's performance. does anyone know if biden has ever commented on kinnear's portrayal of him or the movie in general? i mean, the clarence thomas hearings are a pretty significant part of biden's legacy so there's no way that he isn't aware of the movie.",herequeerandgreat,1h5t9go,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,2024-12-03 17:46:31,0,0.17,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5t9go

movies,Do you feel alien or alone with your taste for movies? ,"I'm in my fifties and, i've been an international film lover since my teens. It was unlikely that i'd discover the movies i came to love, but i did. I live in a small city in Quebec, and here, it's all about American flicks and movies in French. It took a tourist who came to town to make me discover that beautiful world of foreign movies. 've got nobody to discuss films with, around a cup of coffee. I wish i had! For example, my favorite movie is "" Last life in the universe"" by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang from Thailand. It was released in 2003, and i still watch it once a year. I'm also a big fan of the work of Tsai Ming Liang from Taiwan. His movies hold a very dear place in my heart. Over the years, i've seen tons of movies that were never released in local cinemas, that never went popular here. When i'm trying to make friends, it always kind of upsets people that i don't "" encourage"" our local culture. I mean, i wish i could enjoy it, but i don't. What can one do? I've never come across people here, who know the movies i love, and that's kinda sad.....( just a little)

movies,Gone Baby Gone (2007) is the ultimate moral conundrum on film. Lots of spoilers.,"I first saw Gone Baby Gone the day it opened in theaters, mostly because I was more curious to see how Ben Affleck's directorial debut turned out after four years of him being the punchline of every Bennifer joke in existence throughout that weird period in pop culture. But also because I saw it was an adaptation of another Boston-set Dennis Lehane novel, and Mystic River became an instant favorite of mine in late 2003, and everything I'd read about the novel Gone Baby Gone convinced me this was gonna be another Lehane multi-layered mystery tragedy. I loved it after leaving the theater, but I didn't expect it to stick with me as long as it did. Patrick's decision to get Jack Doyle arrested once he figured out the entire conspiracy behind Amanda's kidnapping making all the other characters hate him for giving Amanda back to her mother is one of the reasons it stuck with me; I kept asking myself over and over if he made the right decision. Was doing the legally correct thing the morally correct choice?

When it was released on DVD and I got to rewatch it, it finally hit me why the ending stuck with me so much; other than Helene going right back to her old self now that Amanda was home safely, Amanda correcting Patrick on her doll's name hit me like a fucking Mack truck. Throughout the entire movie, Amanda being taken while in possession of her doll named Mirabelle is mentioned several times; Patrick, now on babysitting duty because Helene didn't think to hire one for her date with a ""fan"" of her talk show interviews, sees Amanda playing with her doll and asks, ""Is that Mirabelle?"" Little Amanda responds with ""Annabelle"". 

Now, it's entirely possible this was a new doll purchased for Amanda after Mirabelle took a dip in that quarry's lake, but the look on Patrick's face before it cuts to the credits tells me he realized in that moment that **no one,** not even Amanda's aunt who hired and then stiffed Patrick and Angie, knew the actual name of Amanda's doll, since the media reported multiple times that Amanda had her ""doll named Mirabelle"". Helene and Bea likely would've corrected the record that the doll's name was Annabelle since they were the only two characters who actually wanted the mystery of Amanda's kidnapping solved. But no one corrected the record, so ""Mirabelle"" was the name mentioned several times *until* Amanda corrected Patrick; it's that look on his face as [Alexi Murdoch's ""Through the Dark""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPng8o3zDqM) starts playing that made me realize why this movie stuck with me so much. Patrick put his life and relationship on the line to save this little girl for a woman whom everyone else saw as the drug addicted neglectful horror show of a mother she had been, and lost pretty much everything for doing it: Angie left him and hated him for ripping Amanda away from the nice police captain in the nice, safe home and giving her back to Helene and *didn't* even get paid for all the shit he and Angie went through.

Patrick is the ***only*** character who sees how much pain and torment Helene is experiencing, which explains his ultimate decision and why Angie hates him for it; Angie was never around to see how truly sorry Helene was for her actions leading to Amanda's kidnapping. While others, and the audience, may rightfully disagree with Patrick's decision, pay attention to the times when Helene breaks down on your next rewatch, and you'll better understand why Patrick chose the way he did; no one else saw that side of Helene, they just saw the drug addicted neglectful mother, which was used as the justification for a whole bunch of crimes. Also, I think Patrick's Catholic guilt over executing Corwin Earle was another big deciding factor in him trying to do what he saw as the morally and legally correct choice, and Remy's little motivational speech -- which got the ball rolling for Patrick to realize the truth behind Amanda's kidnapping -- outside the hospital did *nothing* to relieve Patrick's guilt, nor did Angie's pride in Patrick for it. And *goddamn* was Ed Harris a fucking powerhouse in that scene outside the hospital after Nick was shot. If 2007 hadn't been so stacked with amazing Supporting Acting nominations, including Casey Affleck himself as Robert Ford, I'm betting Harris would've been nominated, even if he had *zero* chance of beating Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh.

I also think it's interesting how the *major* mystery of the movie is seemingly solved an hour before the movie ends. But as this was yet another Dennis Lehane multi-layered crime mystery, it makes sense. Little Amanda running out that door and happily jumping into Doyle's arms was one of the biggest mind fucks in a movie since finding out that Dave Boyle was &gt;!entirely innocent of Katie Markum's murder, that he'd actually murdered a pedophile\*!&lt; in Mystic River, making [""The last time I saw Dave Boyle was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9k-uO50300) one of the most tragic movie quotes of this first quarter century. Doyle's entire justification speech to convince Patrick not to report this is the centerpiece of the story's main thesis on doing what's legally or morally correct, which is also apparently the main topic of the [novel's sequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_\(novel\)) Angie's tearful ""She's happy here. I saw her."" does nothing to help Patrick's difficult decision.

Fuck, I love this movie. It's a great addition to the New England Tragedy pentalogy dominated by the brothers Affleck: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Manchester by the Sea. Oh, and it needs to be said that Harry Gregson-Williams' scores for this and The Town are some of the most haunting film scores in the last 20 years.

And RIP to both Michael K. Williams -- still weird to see him in a police uniform after knowing him as Omar Little for so long -- and John Ashton, who just passed away in September.

movies,I hated Mulholland Dr.,"I honestly couldn’t stand it and i was so excited to watch it. 
Before someone says it yes, i could understand it. It is not the great plot twist that it is made out to be, the plot twist is quite literally forced down your throat in the last 30 minutes. I get the first 2 hours is meant to be dream like and yes it did feel dream like, it also felt like complete wank. Every half an hour i’d tell myself “it’s going to get better” it didn’t. 
Obviously i’m in the minority with my dislike towards the film so i’m not going to act like i’m completely correct but i feel like most people force themselves to like the film because of its concept and because it’s meant to be confusing, when in reality it isn’t. 
It was all a dream. Okay? NICE, i’m pretty sure i utilised that plot twist when i was 11 and in primary school. 

Edit: 
I realised that i framed my entire dislike about the film around the fact i didn’t think the plot twist was stupendously confusing, i want it to be apparent that that’s not my main reason for disliking the film, it probably came out this way because the majority of praise i see for the film always surrounds this idea of confusion. This is ofcourse not my main reason for disliking the film, that’d be silly, i just couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it. I’ve realised i should’ve been more open and less critical with my dislike for the film, it just isn’t for me.

movies,"People, please stop theorizing that Creeper from Jeepers Creepers is a Mayan God, as an answer to the question of what the Creeper really is. ","It bothers me to this day that people repeatedly put forth the Mayan God theory as an origin story of the Creeper as if the idea of Mayans worshipping the creature informs us as to its true nature. Unless ancient Mayans had the power by worship to physically cause or manifest the thing itself that was to be worshipped, then it's not a helpful explanation of its origin. 

The Creeper must have existed before or independently of the Mayans and therefore is not elementally a Mayan God.  Them possibly worshipping it explains nothing, much like any pagan civilization worshipping the sun in the sky does nothing to explain its formation. 

 When most people ask, what is the Creeper, we are looking for theories on how and when and why it came into existence. Was it naturally birthed? Intelligently designed? Is it of earthly origins? Extraterrestrial? Obviously, we don't have any answer, only guesses. But just saying it's a Mayan God is uninformative. It would also raise the question of whether the Aztec Gods and Incan Gods and Egyptian Gods, and Greek Gods, Roman Gods and the Christian God also all exist and in the same universe?",The_Sun_Burns_Out,1h5ohiv,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5ohiv/people_please_stop_theorizing_that_creeper_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5ohiv/people_please_stop_theorizing_that_creeper_from/,2024-12-03 14:21:54,0,0.17,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5ohiv

movies,"It’s about time we talk about LA Story (1991) written and starring Steve Martin, is this his best comedy? ","I remember watching this with my parents when I was younger, prob around 95. I was born 88 so I didn’t have any ability to pick up any of the satire but I remember enjoying it.

I have a bad habit of not rewatching movies I’ve seen since there’s so much out there, no matter how young I was when I first saw it, but my wife showed me a clip from the film off Instagram and we laughed and decided to give it a try and let me tell you it blew us away. We were crying laughing while totally engaged. 

It’s a perfect LA satire and probably the only American Magical Realism film I’ve ever seen (I’m more familiar with the genre coming from Mexico).  Everything is pitch perfect. It’s a tight 91 minutes, edited beautifully, perfect writing from Steve Martin, directed as only I could imagine it and the casting is insane. Every side character and bit part is an amazing character actor from the 90s. 

And the leads are played beautifully by Richard Grant who I know from his performance in Withnail and I. Victoria tennent plays the love interest who is a beautiful actress who got stuck with bad roles most her career, but honestly Sarah Jessica Parker steals the show with her pre-emptive manic pixie dream girl. 

I think this is a movie that although critically acclaimed went over most peoples heads and was forgotten. But I sit here now thinking it’s just leapt to my favorite comedy of all time. It’s so sharp and witty and well executed and magical and of it’s time. I don’t think anyone can argue that Steve Martin is a comedic writing force and it shows in this movie. 

If you haven’t seen it watch it as soon as you can, if you have what do you think about my analysis and how it’s held up and its legacy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

My favorite joke so when Sarah Jessica Parker is trying to seduce Steve Martin and guides his hand down to cup her breast. He squeezes and makes a face and says “your breasts feel weird” and she says “oh, yeah, that’s cause they are real…”

movies,They Live (1988) and it's concept ,"It was in my watchlist for such a long time, finally decided to watch it and blew me away completely. John Carpenter is a visionary! Has anyone of you saw it in the theatres? Or were you there when it was released?

Have you seen Men In Black or The Matrix or Fight Club? This movie felt like it had all of that! And maybe somewhat an inspiration for the movie I mentioned.

They Live dir. By *John Carpenter* is a story of a man, played by Roddy Piper who has come to City in search of a job, but is shocked when he sees the _*reality of this world*_. There are aliens living among us, and they are controlling everything.

Advertisements, News Channels, Politics, everything... everything is a LIE. They are controlling us with different mediums, changing our Subconscious mind and bending our reality, turning us into servants, into Livestock. 

_""We are Sleeping, They are living.""_

If you're someone who is into Illuminati, Secret Society, you'll love this film.

Though some moments felt janky in acting, but that's because the lead is probably the first WWF Turned Actor. Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.

This movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.

The runtime is about 1hr 30mins, and even if you watch this type of films or not, you should watch it just for the concept.",apple15332,1h5d41h,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,2024-12-03 02:35:57,85,0.84,85,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5d41h

movies,Krazy House (2024) is insane (for fans of Kevin Can F*** Himself),"Set in 1990, Krazy House starts as a typical late-80’s, early 90’s sitcom called The Christians that looks like an amalgamation of both Married with Children and King of Queens. Like those shows, it’s filmed in front of a live studio audience and starts out in a very light hearted, goofy way. Bernie Christian, the matriarch of the family, is juggling his faith and his family. He’s the stereotypical Kevin James kind of protagonist who means well, but continuously causes more problems than he’s solving. When he’s not falling down the stairs (much to the delight of the studio audience), he’s breaking everything that isn’t nailed down, much to the chagrin of his modern, breadwinning wife, Eva. His indifferent, gum smacking daughter Sarah and son Adam, a burgeoning scientist, are opportunities for life lessons about being good people and looking towards the lord. Sounds like the perfect setup for a religious TV show for those times; you know the type - a character walks through the front door and the crowd goes wild?

However, when a trio of Russian handymen show up at the door, things take a turn…and the studio audience doesn’t pop for them. See, Bernie has (as he usually does), caused a mess in the kitchen. His stew bubbles over and he messes up the sink, adding to the kitchen destruction he caused earlier when his arm caught on fire and he lit up the wall. After initially dismissing the Russians, he lets them in to fix the problem…but the problems at the Christian house have only just begun. Once the Russians are in, the show takes an insanely dark turn and it only gets more bonkers from there. While the film starts as a deconstruction of the nuclear family sitcom, it ends as a bloody mess where no one is safe.

This one is for fans of absurd horror/comedies or things skewering nostalgic TV (Late Night with the Devil, Kevin Can F\*\*\* Himself). The pacing isn't great in the second half, but it's still worth checking out.",forcefivepod,1h58ys0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,2024-12-02 23:19:34,7,0.58,7,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,self,t3_1h58ys0

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

movies,Fracture (2007) SPOILERS,"Just seen 2007 Fracture starring Anthony Hopkins for the first time. Great movie until the ending which in my eyes completely ruined the brilliance of the film.

I cannot make sense of the ending and wonder if I am missing something?

1. Firstly, surely all the bullet in his wife's head does is proves Nunally's gun was the murder weapon. There is still nothing linking Crawford to Nunally's gun as it is mentioned in the film that the hotel camera footage has no face. 

2. Also, they switched the shells in the evidence locker so would the gun even match anymore? 

3. The double jeopardy also is very questionable. As I understand it, the case is still substantially the same so Crawford would still not be able to be tried again. 

4. Would any evidence collected in Crawford's house at the end not be void due to the restraining order? Beachum should not be there in the first place and it is essentially breaking and entering as he goes through Crawford's belongings to get the gun.

Great shame as I would have given the film a 9 up to the end which seems to completely ruin the rest of the film. Hopefully I am overlooking something which explains the ending.",ewanInw,1h57oi8,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h57oi8/fracture_2007_spoilers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h57oi8/fracture_2007_spoilers/,2024-12-02 22:24:14,0,0.47,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h57oi8

movies,Favorite movie by european country: San Marino,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Russia. I'm not really sure, if I offended people here, but I did get quite a few downvotes for it. Fortunately, I also got some very good film suggestions (I would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants again) and we also have a winner: ***Сталкер*** (engl. Stalker), a movie by the legendary Andrei Tarkovsky, will receive the next entry in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Today, I know, that it will become much harder to just find a fitting movie, but following the alphabetical order, we move to the next letter - and this time, there are many countries waiting for us that start with an S - an S like **San Marino**, for example. And everytime there will be only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \- 83 (24 Reviews)

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):

&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director’s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):

&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):

&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.

[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):

&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):

&gt;Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):

&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.

[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):

&gt;It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):

&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.

The Independent (100):

&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.

Written and Directed by Robert Eggers:

&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.

Can't people get his could be the TRANSFORMERS ONE of the Lion king series, both have similar themes and ideas.

1. Watch Sonic 3 first (better movie lol, will be worth it more)
2. Give Mufasa a chance and don't judge it if you have not seen it yet.

This analysis of American Psycho reveals something profound about human nature that most viewers have missed. Why would someone so desperate to fit in also be driven to such extreme violence? The answer isn't what you think. Beyond the surface narrative of materialism and madness lies a hidden pattern. Once you see it, you'll never watch the film the same way again.

movies,AI generated performances. The future of Hollywood?,"Watching Rogue One the other day got me thinking. 

CGI Leia breaks the uncanny valley at the end of Rogue One but it will improve. We need a new ""actor not acting"" definition for such roles. Cameo doesn't fit. Voice actor doesn't fit either. These will be AI/CGI fully generated requiring no input. Ash in Alien: Romulus comes to mind. But with exponential better tech.

Maybe someone has a SAG definition. The writers strike was over AI but I don't think we have any consensus of what the future will be for this type of content.

Contributing likeness?

_____ in an AI performance?

CGI provided by _______ ? (No speaking lines)

It's going to happen. I think nobody knows how it will play out. Maybe it will mark the end of a profession, automated at bottom budget like cartoons.

movies,Everything Everywhere All At Once ending questions [SPOILERS],"I rewatched the movie again the other day and I was left with some questions about the ending that I don't know if there are implied answers, definitive answers, or ""idk it doesn't really matter"" answers.

1. Alpha Waymond said early on that you had to resist the temptation to have extended stays in other dimensions otherwise you introduce paradox. But doesn't the movie end with Evelyn in another dimension? Her original dimension is the one where she doesn't go home from the IRS, punches Deirdre, the IRS has been basically destroyed, there's a lot of murder, Waymond is aware of raccoon-Waymond and raccoon-Joy, and Eveyln pulls Alpha-Joy out of the bagel. As the movie ends, we transition to a dimension where she DID go home, she has the breakdown in the laundromat, Dierdre tells the police to let her go, they relate to each other because of the divorce papers, then she has that last emotional talk with Joy at the car. I can't tell if it is implying that Evelyn is staying in this alternative dimension, or if her original one is still ""active"" for her and she probably goes to jail after all the verse-jumpers (Alpha gong-gong, alpha-Joy, alpha diedre, etc) leave that dimension.

2. When Evelyn is having that talk reconcile with Joy at the car at the end of the movie, is it with HER Joy, or the Jobu Tupaki Alpha-Joy? It's clear in that universe that Alpha-Joy is taking over that universe's Joy quite often, and the speech carries references to other events in the movie and she's shown to be talking with Alpha-Joy in all of the other dimensions too. There's so much emotion flowing in that scene from Joy that I can't tell if Evelyn is reconciling with HER Joy, or Alpha-Joy.",turn_for_do,1h50eme,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,2024-12-02 17:28:44,0,0.42,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Question,spoiler,t3_1h50eme

movies,Heat (1995)….Most beautiful movie line I’ve heard ,"In Heat… there’s 2 parts that stick out to me… many great scenes overall

But when Val Kilmer’s character tells DeNiro “for me the sun rises and sets with her” when talking about his wife and why he can’t leave her. Then at the end… they are both in a relationship where they fight a lot.. both have been unfaithful and she’s ready to turn him in. But when she sees his innocent genuine smile when he sees her, she can’t bring herself to go against him and realizes she still loves him despite all their issues and signals to him to run away. I loved that dynamic

Also the part where the Dennis Heybert’s character (the AllState commercial guy) is sitting with his gf and he feels like a failure. He tells her “why you rolling around with me for?” and starts crying. And she reassures him and tells him because she’s proud of him for trying. 

2 scenes/dynamics that are relatable and just hit deep. One is a relationship that has had many issues and in turmoil but deep down, the two still love eachother.

John McTiernan is one of the legends of action cinema, known for iconic movies like *Die Hard*, *Predator*, and *Last action Hero*. His movies are packed with high-stakes tension, larger-than-life heroes, and explosive action, but what about the women in these stories? I’d love to hear your thoughts on how they’re portrayed!

Here are a few women in his films that stand out to me:

* **Holly Gennaro McClane (*****Die Hard*****)**: She’s a career-driven, no-nonsense woman who also happens to be at the heart of John McClane’s emotional journey. Her strength comes across in the way she handles Hans Gruber and leads the hostages, but do you think she’s given enough agency beyond being someone for John to save?
* **Anna (*****Predator*****)**: At first, Anna seems like a typical prisoner-of-war character, but she becomes a key figure in unraveling the Predator’s backstory. She provides a voice for her people and their legends. Does her role feel substantial, or does it fall into the trope of the ""exotic other""?
* **Virginia Baker (*****The Thomas Crown Affair*****)**: Rene Russo’s character is sharp, confident, and undeniably one of McTiernan’s most complex women. She’s Thomas Crown’s equal, which is rare in movies like this. Does she break the mold of how women are portrayed in action/thrillers?
* **Whitney and Irene (*****Last Action Hero*****)**: This movie pokes fun at action clichés, and it’s fun to see the ""screaming damsel"" and ""grounded working-class mom"" tropes being played for laughs. What do you think McTiernan was trying to say about female characters in action films here?

I know McTiernan’s films are heavily focused on their male leads, but I’m curious—do you think the women in his movies hold their own? Which characters stand out to you, and which feel underdeveloped?

Would love to hear your thoughts and insights! 😊",Fennel_Zealousideal,1h4th9d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,2024-12-02 12:06:22,0,0.36,0,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4th9d

movies,Most Fitting Movie for Each Month,"Haven’t seen a post like this, so I figured I’d make one.

What are the most fitting movies for each of the 12 months of the year? Which movies best fit the vibes and aesthetics of each month? Thought this might be an interesting discussion.

January: Something grim and desolate like Fargo would fit pretty good, wintery and cold and all

February: Equally as cold and miserable, but with the added benefit of Valentines Day. Some sort of romance movie with a wintery theme would fit here, especially if set on Valentines Day. Groundhog Day is also a strong contender.

March-April: No specific ideas, these blend together for me. Movies about spring would fit for all of both.

May: Still springtime, but also end-of-school and graduation, so any moviess about graduating or school letting out would fit.

June-Aug: These blend together for me. Plenty of summer movies, but not necessarily specific to a month. I will say, August also has back to school as a potential setting or theme, and I personally associate that month with dreary, overbearing heat and fatigue, the kind of visuals heavily present in the film Falling Down

September: School is fully back in swing, and I would lean towards placing a High School movie or something here.

October: There’s plenty of Halloween movies, but it would have to be one that celebrates fall and the month of October more so than just being scary. The miniseries Over the Garden Wall Would Fit, not sure of other examples 

November: Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be the easy choice for Thanksgiving, but I do wonder if there are any other films that would fire better.

December: There’s a litany of holiday movies of course, but out of all of them there’s have to be one that embodies the month as a whole and not just Christmas time. A plot incorporating the advent season might work, like Christmas Vacation, or a film that incorporates New Years.

I’m struggling with examples here, so I’d be excited to hear what others think",Bonobowl,1h4nfj0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,2024-12-02 05:05:55,2,0.55,2,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4nfj0

The over all jist is that an alien species is traveling here in hopes of having a new home. They are vastly older than us an unimaginably more advanced. Thing is we develop way faster than they do. What took them eons to achieve took us generations. By the time they arrive we will have outpaced them.

It's a fun idea. 

My problem is at one point the species decides to show their power and prove to the world they are real. They do this by turning off the lights. Sun, stars, all poof. No light for humanity.   
  
So why not turn the lights off for a couple years and call it good when they get here? Plantlife would be gone, animals dependent on it, us included would be gone. Most species would not last years in darkness.

movies,Most realistic addiction movies you've seen? I find Requiem for a Dream is not it.,"The movie Requiem for a Dream is quite popular and often receives high ratings and praise from people who just saw it. And it is indeed a well done movie, but it's not a realistic movie about drugs.

I think of it more as a horror movie that uses drugs than a movie about people becoming addicted. It gets details wrong, like heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. That's just one example.

But it works great as anti-drug advertising for people who have never done drugs before. And like I said, it's a pretty good movie from the artistic point of view. Like the visuals are so powerful you can't forget certain scenes for a long time. Combined with the great score, you are left at the end of the film with that sense of horror, of powerlessness in face of terrible doom, of things unraveling rapidly for everyone. It's a nightmare visualized really.

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",PresentRevenue1347,1h4lwrm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,2024-12-02 03:41:52,146,0.75,146,0,107,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4lwrm

Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can’t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he’s ruined.
  
It’s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn’t exist. This is one of those times. The movie’s not entertaining, it’s not dramatic, it’s just pointless. I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it’s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time. You’ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

1. **Borden should have revealed their secret to save his own/brother's life.** I get that they have dedicated their lives to magic and withholding the secret but with the threat of a hanging, they should have said something if it gave them a chance at clemency. The surviving brother wouldn't have been able to keep performing magic anyways because the Alfred identity would also legally be dead; he'd have to start from scratch. And finally, by letting the trick die with one of the brothers, it makes Sarah's death even more meaningless. Taking the secret to the grave only makes thematic sense, but not logical sense.
2. **Cutter kinda kidnaps Jess and no one really cares**. After one of the Borden twins in hanged, the surviving Borden teams up with Cutter to get revenge on Angier. (So I guess he ends up revealing his secret anyways?) They show Cutter sneaking onto Lord Caldlow's estate and grabbing Jess during the day, but Lord Caldlow is murder by Borden at night. If Jess was kidnapped the same day as the murder, wouldn't Caldlow have be extra careful and maybe not go to his warehouse alone? And if Caldlow was murdered the night before the kidnapping, wouldn't the house be extra careful to guard over Jess? This was ignored just to give Borden a happy ending.
3. **Angier didn't need to keep killing this clones.** He literally could have made one clone and lived as twins, thus allowing him to perform the New Transported Man as Borden did. I get the initial shock of shooting the first clone, but to devise a plan to keep killing each sequential clone is illogical. In fact, I'm starting to believe that this was Tesla's initial design in the first place. Tesla doesn't strike me as someone who would build a cloning machine instead of a teleporting machine. I think he wanted to give Angier a perfect double so that he could perform the trick and enjoy the prestige half of the time. But story-wise, it would have been more poetic to drown night-after-night like his late-wife.
4. **Angier couldn't have pulled off the Real Transported Man as shown in the film.** We only see this trick performed twice and both times, you kinda have to turn your brain off.
   1. The first time is when Angier shows off the machine to Cutter and the talent manager. After he activates the machine, Prime-Angier just **disappears**. There was no trap door implemented yet; the talent manager is the one who suggests it. So at this point, there should be two Angiers and no way of killing either one of them.
   2. The second time is during one of the Great Danton's 100-show-run. Prime-Angier falls through the trap door and into the water tank and Borden is framed for supposedly killing him. But why doesn't Clone-Angier complete the trick and reappear for the Prestige? Clone-Angier is all the way up in the wings of the audience so how would he know that Borden would be under the stage? Realistically, Angier wouldn't know which show of the 100 shows should be the one when he needed to fake his own death and not reappear.

All in all, the film WORKS better without logic. I mean it's about magicians and there's a fucking cloning machine in the 1800s. But I mainly wanted to bring these up just to make sure I wasn't going insane. Thanks for taking the time to read.

movies,Visible Crew Members During a Fight Scene - The Rookie (1990),"This memory of a crazy sighting during a movie fight scene has haunted me ever since seeing it in 1990.  I was in the basement of our house watching The Rookie (1990) on PPV.  I think back in those days you had to tune in at a particular time the movie was scheduled to play.  Anyway, I wasn't on any mind altering chemicals, so I can't believe I was seeing things.  I remember a fight scene between a woman and an intruder in her home, and as the camera did a pan shot, following the fighting couple around the room, there was a group of movie crew totally out in the open, and making no attempt to hide.  I remember shaking my head confused and wondering if I just saw what I thought I saw.  

I've done searches online over the years to see if anyone else has a memory of this and I've found nothing.  I don't even see what I thought I saw when I find YouTube clips, or even full streaming versions of the movie.  Is it possible that what I saw really happened, and re-edits were used for all the physical media reproductions of this movie?  This is the last mystery I have memory of in my stupid life.  I want to resolve this.

movies,Me Before You (2016) Discussion,"Watched for the first time last night

The real standout to me was that all the characters seemed extremely relatable and understandable

I got a really gross feeling when it was clear there was emotional cheating going on, yet I still found myself rooting for the main actors. Even until the end, I wished she had broken it off with her boyfriend before moving on, but I couldn't help but wish her and Will would spend their last moments together

It was nice to see a movie, especially knowing this was made in 2016 tackle assisted suicide so well in my opinion. Will had resigned his life, but still provided 6 months to his parents for things to turn around. His parents fought on both sides to help and stop him. Louisa's mum also was vehemtly against it and didn't want her daughter being involved as she knew this would upset her

My favourite scene overall was Louisa coming home to nod her head ""no"" towards her sister. I've had situation that resulted in a near identical scene and I knew how much that would've hurt

I really enjoyed all the characters and the few bits of humour sprinkled throughout. The scenes were all engaging that what was originally ""I'm juat gonna sit here, you watch what you want"", turned into me glued to the screen after the first minute

Overall, I don't think this movie has any real flaws and I'd consider it a 10/10. I was very surprised I had never heard of this one and even more surprised to see the bad reception regarding the assisted suicide topic. I do wonder how I would've felt had I watched it in 2016

I’ve seen in this movies. Most recently when watching Killer Heat (2024). Spoilers ahead. The mystery revolves around finding out who killed a guy who happens to be an identical twin. As soon as the movie reveals early on that he’s an identical twin I said “the twins switch, and the ‘dead’ one is the alive one,” and I ended up being spot on. For a mystery movie it was really quite lame because every time I see identical twins I’m going to think they switched and it’s part of, or maybe even the entire mystery.

movies,How did you feel about Prisoners from Villeneuve?,"TONS of spoilers about the film:

Hi, let me tell you how it went for me first because I need to vent. 
Sunday night, I wanted a thriller that would keep me on the edge, fun as I could say. After one hour, I felt so helpless for the characters, just as they might feel. After the movie, I just feel like it was such a sad, cold, depressing tragedy about unhealed trauma. Keller need of being in absolute control and completely selling his soul in order to not being hurt more. The guy still trying to do the mazes from when he was kidnapped. Alex Jones who was kidnapped and tortured. And perhaps the most subtely tragic, Detective Loki whole past of being abused that might have kept him from suspecting the woman. I believe that’s how he was didn’t see Alex suffering or the guy with the maze lighting a candle or acting their deaths. 

All that to say, this film left me heartbroken for them. It’s a good thing with how these stories tend to be sensationalized through crime documentaries etc. But I would not say it’s a thriller, or a tragedy/drama with some real thriller mechanics.

movies,How many movies have you seen in your lifetime? ,"I've asked myself this and as an avid movie goer, I thought the number would be much higher and find others tend to overestimate. 

I sat down and over time, did my best to list out every movie I have ever seen. I tried to narrow it down to movies I know for a fact I have watched beginning to end. Not ""oh, I saw 70% of it on television once"" or ""eh, I think i watched it when I was a kid."" 

Especially for things like ubiquitous Disney films. Everyone is seemingly fimiliar with Bambi, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, etc, but I think the number of people who watched these movies in their entirety is lower. And while I myself couldnt exactly remember a time where I didnt know these characters, I also couldnt remember taking the time to watch them as a kid. So I didnt count them. Unless I knew 100% I watched it. 

I also tried not to count television specials unless they were feature length and billed as a movie. Does Channel Chasers from the Fairly OddParents count as a movie or is it a tv special? It sounds dumb but unless it was billed as a movie, I tried to avoid counting it. Kim Possible The Movie: So The Drama may only be like 70 minutes and aired straight to Disney Channel, but I counted it. 

So after counting movies I'd seen under the criteria and with a huge help from Letterboxd, I was able to pin down a rough estimate: 

At the age of 27, I have seen about **1000-1100 movies**. I definitely watch more movies I havent ever seen now than I did maybe a decade ago so I am wondering how that number will look in the next 25 years of my life.

In my college days, I'd see roughly 40-70 movies a year? While not much at all relative to most film lovers, I would say definitely a higher number than the average person. This year, the number is over 100, and will likely finish at about 115-120. The number of movies I watch per month tends to fluctuate greatly. Sometimes I get more into television or video games or too busy with social life to be watching movies. In March, for instance, I had only seen one movie and it was Dune 2. But back in September, I had managed to watch 25 movies.

since more than a month, I ask you for ypur favorite movie set in a certain european country, and I know, I know, I'm very late, but I was on a trip and here in Germany, where I'm sitting, the next day has not yet started after I asked you about your movie set in Romania more than 24 hours ago, so technically, it was yesterday, that I did that. Today (and this “today” is valid no matter where you are, as long as you read it early enough), I can then also announce the winner: ***4 luni, 3 săptămâni și 2 zile*** (engl.: *4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days*) continues the trend of newer films tending to end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Once again, unfortunately I haven't seen the winning film yet - but that's exactly what makes this filmic journey so exciting for me. As far as I understand it, it's a relatively political movie - and the next country we turn to is certainly also a political subject for some people here: now we come to **Russia**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,The Three Musketeers/D’Artagnan,"This is the 2023 French production… I was interested because of Eva Green as “MiLady”.    The reliable Vincent Cassel is “Athos”.

They went for the dirty and gritty look for this one, no colorful costumes for our heroes.   Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  

We all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.
So I wonder… Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   

I can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale…. But I found this rather jarring.

Done best when a small group of family members or friends dip their toes into crime and are unable to handle the consequences. Call it schadenfreude or just the pleasure of watching someone else's life go worse than mine.

Classics of the genre:

Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.

A Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).

The Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.

Honorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.

Good Examples:

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

April and the Extraordinary World

Sirocco and the Kingdom of Winds

Kensuke's Kingdom

Big Fish and Begonia

Wolfwalkers

The Secret of Kells

Song of the Sea

My Father's Dragon

The Magician's Elephant

Eleanor's Secret

Treasure Planet

Atlantis

Road to El Dorado

Titan A.E.

I get that she's supposed to be a contrast to Butch, but it just doesn't land for me. What about you—what's a character or performance that drags down an otherwise fantastic movie?

I feel like this movie missed a huge opportunity for a clever open ending that invites discussion.

At the very end, when Tobias and Elle are breaking the eggs on the kitchen, the camera films them from the side and leaves enough space behind the father to make the audience wonder if Almut is going to come in, but alas, she is gone.

I believe a more poignant ending would be to have her come in and hug him from behind, and then the movie cuts to credits, except: she has hair.

This would make for a perfect use of the movie's non-chronological storytelling, as we wouldn't be able to tell if she surived or if this scene is set in the past.",Arkanteseu,1h422q9,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h422q9/we_live_in_time_making_use_of_the_lack_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h422q9/we_live_in_time_making_use_of_the_lack_of/,2024-12-01 12:18:04,5,0.62,5,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h422q9

Those movies I think found the groove between too serious and too campy. I'd love for the new Bond to be a little more fun. 

I'd also like to see Bond girls that James doesn't actually fall in love with. I didn't have a problem with this or anything in previous films, I just think it's been done to death with OHMSS, the Spy Who Loved Me, Casino Royale, Spectre and No Time to Die. 

Bringing back the supporting actors from the Craig era would also be one of my personal hopes. Such as, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Everyone else can be new, but I would like to keep Bond tradition of keeping the same supporting actors. If I could only keep ONE actor, I'd say Whishaw because I'd love to see him stick around for decades like Desmond Llewyn did.

movies,Cerebral Palsy Blues ,"Having a disability doesn't mean you can't live a life full of creativity, adventure, and inspiration. Johan Öberg is a shining example of this. Despite living with a severe form of cerebral palsy, Johan has never let his condition define him or hold him back.

While he can't play the guitar in the traditional way, Johan has developed his own unique method of making music. For him, it’s not about perfection but about expressing himself and sharing his passion for sound in a way that’s entirely his own.

Johan also has a deep love for speed and the water. Though he needs assistance getting into a boat, once he’s seated, he takes full control. Steering the boat on his own, he experiences the thrill and freedom that come with gliding across the waves.
Beyond his personal hobbies, Johan has used his life experiences to inspire and connect with others. He’s authored several books that offer a glimpse into his world and the challenges he’s faced. Additionally, his online community of over 13,000 followers on Facebook has grown into a platform for encouragement, creativity, and resilience.

Johan’s story is proof that having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t push boundaries, inspire others, and live a life filled with purpose and joy.

He only screens movies on film. A bit faded and a few cuts but I love that stuff. 

A few things I know of the Roger Moore bond movies is that they were a little sillier and they had the best songs... and I tend to like them a lot.  

* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. 
* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.
* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. 
* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head. 
* Feels like Austin Powers got a ton of their gags from this movie.

Loved it.  Though I suspect people who like a more serious bond are not fans?

movies,How to approach Salò (1975)?,"I have a problem with Salò that I'm struggling with and I would appreciate some advice.

I am a divorced man in my middle age with a son of seventeen. He's a smart kid and we have recently started bonding over our love of cinema. He is a junior of the local Multimedia and Graphic Technology Secondary School with a motion picture specialisation. He plans on studying motion picture directing at the academy in two years time.

With his course set he set upon expanding his film education and he recently approached me with a list of movies he'd like to see. His favorite movie is Metropolis and he enjoys watching and talking about expresionist films. Of course his list includes other movies such as M, and I also suggested The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. 

He also wants to see A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Z (by Kosta Gavras) and ""some other films that are not as interesting"". As I was intrigued, I asked which films he was thinking of he volountered Sátántangó (which at 439 minutes he doesn't expect me to watch with him) and, oh yes, Salò.

And I did not react well to news of Salò, as I don't think there is a benefit for a seventeen year old in seeing the movie. It was a deeply disturbing watch for me and I was in my forties, I don't really see how a kid his age would be equipped to even process the message of the film with sufficient life experience. I did not forbid him from seeing the movie, as that really doesn't achieve anything. I would like to help lay some ground work before he goes into it. I think that he should see Clockwork first. And I'd like some suggestions for other thematicaly similar films that would help him gradually ramp up the intensity for Salò. Should I hae him read someting beforehand? He is sufficiently aware of the Italian Social Republic, I am more concerned about psychological aspects of the story.

Or should I just let him watch it cold and have a discussion about the depravity of the human condition later?

movies,cujo from cujo is a tragic villain.,"in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.

for starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.

things get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. ""it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.""

there's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!

even though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",herequeerandgreat,1h3ltsb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,2024-11-30 20:40:45,36,0.72,36,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ltsb

movies,A Different Take on The Notebook's Ending,"

Hi Everyone, 

I recently watched *The Notebook* and found myself grappling with some discomfort about the ending. So, I decided to write my own version, one that feels more poignant and bittersweet, yet complete. Here’s my version:

Instead of Noah reading the story, it would be Lon. In my version, Allie chooses Lon, but her life with him isn’t entirely fulfilling—at least, not in her heart. She keeps a diary where she writes about how things could have been if she had chosen Noah instead. Her imagined life, where she paints, with Noah becomes her escape, a parallel world where her heart resides.

Years later, as Allie begins to suffer from her illness, Lon finds the diary. Understanding how deeply she lived in her imagination, he decides to read her the diary—not as the story of their life, but as the life she dreamed of. Lon does this out of love, knowing it might bring her comfort and help her remember.

One day, as Lon reads, something shifts in Allie. She remembers her real life with Lon—their marriage, their children, and the life they built together. Overcome with guilt, she apologizes to him, admitting that while she always wanted to love him completely, part of her heart was always with Noah. Lon, being the loving and compassionate man he is, forgives her without hesitation.

Then, Allie asks Lon about Noah. Lon tells her that Noah built a successful life, never married, and now owns a large mill, but is gravely ill. Touched by her lingering feelings, Lon promises to take her to see Noah the next day.

But fate intervenes. The next morning, they hear that Noah passed away during the night. When Allie and Lon visit his home, she is overcome with memories of their time there. The weight of her emotions becomes too much, and she quietly passes away, never to wake again.",Chahes03,1h3laak,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,2024-11-30 20:16:01,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h3laak

The movie sees the main star playing a character named Pestario ""Pest"" Vargas who owes a large amount of money to the Scottish mafia.  A rich hunter who enjoys hunting humans offers Pest $50,000 dollars to let him hunt him for a couple of days and if he survives he gets the money.

It's a ridiculous way over the top film.

1. getting annoyed because you were called when a woman heard violent screaming and it turned out to be people rehearsing, even thought it was the right thing to to because someone could have been in trouble.
2. not properly searching the apartment the second time you were called and missing the dead body

idiots!

cops that are bad at their job, NOT corrupt/evil cops like Maniac cop. or cops that made a reasonable mistake, etc

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Romania,"Hell there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Portugal - and as in the day before, I really have to say a big thank you to all the participants: We got more than 60 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. I'm also looking forward to another movie on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Capitão Falcão*** (engl.: *The Portuguese Falcon*) even have a fitting title in the english distribution. Never heard about it, but it seems to be a funny movie that also shows a little of the Portuguese culture.

Today, we skip Q in alphabetical order (no country starting with Q in Europe) and directly go to R... in this case, R like **Romania** for the start. As always, there are only two rules in the game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,The Girl Next Door (2004) deserves more love!,"Just finished rewatching The Girl Next Door and had to share why it’s so great:

Elisha Cuthbert absolutely shines in this role. Her charcater Danielle isnt just eye candy...she’s confident but also vulnerable. Elisha makes you care about her journey and choices. She is the heart of the movie. 

Timothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.

Also have to call out Elis best friend ""Matthew""... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next"" at the end

the movie balances humor with some surprisingly emotional moments so well and it captures the early 2000s vibes in the best way possible. The soundtrack, the style, the overall feel. it really is a time capsule in the best way.

clive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.

grendel

john gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.

when it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.

the long walk

in addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.

the lost bus

""A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the 2018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history."" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. 

eddington

ari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.

the battle of baktan cross

when it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.

wildwoods

wildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.

the phoenician scheme

leave it to wes anderson to make espionage funny. his upcoming film the phoenician scheme is an espionage comedy drama that was written by anderson and roman coppola. though the plot is unknown at the moment, the film's cast is known and, par for the course for an anderson film, the cast is full of famous actors. benicio del toro, michael cera, bill murray, riz ahmed, tom hanks, benedict cumberbatch, scarlett johansson, rupert friend, willem dafoe, and bryan cranston. production began in march and ended in june.

movies,"I know I'm about 17 years too late, but 28 weeks later was an absolute dumpster fire of a zombie film. (Rant) (Spoilers)","
Just to begin, I have had some heavy consideration after getting some comments that have changed my opinion about this movie.

This movie was not a “dumpster fire”. It was actually a pretty entertaining film that shows some new and also old ideas.

I now believe that this movie was just a little underwhelming, considering it was a sequel to a great movie like 28 days later. If it was a movie of its own, then it would be a solid B tier movie, but it just can’t really live up to how 28 days later made me feel personally.

And now, onto my heavily flawed rating on how this movie was.

&gt; Starting off, how was Don even allowed to enter his (ex) wife's holding area? (He left her to die so I consider that as divorce.)
I know he has the ""all entry"" key card because of his status, but she is of EXTREME importance and danger. She should've only been allowed to be seen by scientists or guards.

&gt; Speaking of guards, why was NOBODY guarding her?
She is possibly one of the LAST infected humans on Earth, and she is left by herself. As shown in the movie, she caused another outbreak, and I bet if there was ONE guard in the room with her, none of this would've happened.

&gt; Why would the producers kill her off right then and there?
She was killed MINUTES after she was rescued, and it would been a better choice to see her tell her children what Don had done to her, and THEN she dies.

&gt; How did she survive the attack in the safe house anyway?
They don't just leave you alone if you are infected, as shown by Don, he literally murders her ON THE SPOT after seeing her. So if she was bitten in the safe house, they surely would've mad sure she had turned.

&gt; They gave absolutely NO warnings about the flashing lights, I'm just lucky I'm not epileptic. Gave me a terrible headache after though.

&gt; Why would you direct a crowd of people into what would basically be a slaughterhouse, and the LOCK them in there with NO guards and NO lights?
Nobody protected them, the majority of them were infected within a matter of minutes, and then the guards outside were basically a firing squad.

&gt; Why didn't Scarlet just say ""These children could lead to a cure."" Or something instead of just stating her rank?
I'm pretty sure if I was a guard and I heard that, I would just let her through.

&gt; Why does NOBODY have proper protection against bites/blood sprays?
They have had this infection for a whole 7 MONTHS and not a single person has proper protection against bites. If a normal person was in a zombie apocalypse, they would at least wrap magazines around their arms or something to protect themselves.
If somebody had worn a riot suit/armored hazmat suit, they would probably survive an attack.

&gt; Why didn't they just burn the entirety of Britan/surrounding infected areas to begin with?
I'm pretty sure most life wouldn't survive being turned into ash, other than Dan somehow.

&gt; How did Dan even survive? I know we see him standing behind a building so he doesn't get charred, but there was fire coming from all directions.

&gt; I get it, nuking the city most likely wouldn't work, or would lead to Britan AND France/any surrounding countries being eradicated, but that's better than the possibility of that ENTIRE side of the globe being infected.

&gt; It has been less than a year, and people are already moving back into Britan. It hasn't even been full cleared yet, let alone the corpses even fully decomposing, and people are moving back in like it's nothing.

&gt; Why didn't Sergeant Doyle (Stupid haircut) tell General Stone (Helecopter man) that Andy (The literal only cure in existence) is able to stop all of this?
That would've stopped a lot of trouble.

&gt; Is it even possible to outrun a fireball??

&gt; How does one, nearly 180-200 lb man, make an entire helicopter go out of control just by grabbing the skids?

&gt; Furthermore, how did this idiot not get infected while all of those zombies were being blended into a person salad?
He was DRENCHED in blood head to toe, and it looked like he was still okay, but I may be wrong.

&gt; How did any of those infected survive being cut into peices? They can't survive a 5.56x45 round to the chest, but can be split in half and still try to crawl around? These are still humans we're talking about, even if they are infected. Humans usually don't survive being chopped in half.

&gt; If infected can be killed by gas, why didn't the military... I dunno... GAS THE ENTIRETY OF BRITAN FROM THE START? THAT WOULD SAVE A LOT MORE LIVES.
And yes, I know what wind does to gas, but it could help if they even tried from the beginning.

&gt; A thin shirt does not save you from poisonous gas, just look at the soldiers from WW1-WW2 and you could guess how that would go. (When they were gassed in the trenches they had special masks drenched in special chemicals to counteract the gasses effects, any who didn't put these on could be dead in minutes, or suffer severe respiratory damage.) So a shirt probably won't stop much.

&gt; Why would you burn a clearly UNINFECTED man to death? At least have the decency to shoot him to death, then burn him.

&gt; I kinda get the helicopter shooting at their car, with the ""Kill all on sight order"" and all, but I don't think any infected can drive a car.

&gt; Why would you SCREAM into a dark building? Scarlet got killed because she was yelling. (Idk why I put this here tbh.)

&gt; The trope of ""I'm gonna jumpscare you when you turn back instead of just killing you when you're not paying attention."" Is a little overused, but again, this movie came out in 2007.

&gt; It was terrifying seeing her be bashed to death with her own gun, but why haven't more infected done this sort of thing? That's showing higher brain function, and this could’ve been used more often. I guess Don being the only infected to use a weapon just adds to the shock value.

&gt; Why would Tammy just drop the gun after seeing her brother get bitten and therefore (presumably) infected?

&gt; Why would you leave your only form of defense? You don't know the next time you'll need a gun.

&gt; One does not just ""brush off"" being bitten in the throat, let alone a child. Like yeah, you can't turn into a zombie, but that doesn't mean you can't bleed out either.

This would’ve been better if it was not a sequel to such a great movie as its former.
In comparison, 28 days later was a much better movie imo, with much better storytelling and plot.

I rebuke the title calling it a “dumpster fire” and it was more of just a let down.

movies,Come and See (1985) is not anti-war,"I've just finished this masterpiece and I'm still at awe, one of the best movies ever made, a perfect film. About it being an anti-war film, I don't think it is, and this doesn't mean anything in terms of quality, it is also not a moral judgement, I don't see a problem with it AT ALL, it's simply an observation about the movie's themes/message.

So first, what does it mean to be ""anti-war"", in my opinion it should deromanticize AND not condone war in any way, the former is done, the latter I don't think it is. The movie shows the barbarity of the nazi regime, every single nazi in the movie is absolutely disgusting and inhumane, while practically every soviet is an everyday person doing what is necessary to survive. The movie at no point questions any soviet policy during the war, in the movie they are justified at every point, even the boy robbing the cow can be sympathized and understood easily.

And see, this is not a problem, we know the horrors of the nazi war machine, we know that 25million soviets died in WW2, they have every right to be pissed and to tell the story that way, which brings me to what I think is one of the main messages of the movie: **sometimes war can be justified.** The movie shows: ""the nazis are attacking us and it is either us or them"", what brought the end of the nazis? It was war, not pacifism or diplomacy, no, **war.** Particulary the USSR, we know they were the main protagonists in the defeat of the nazis, that's history, and the movie came out on the 40 year aniversary of the soviet victory. The movie ends with the soviets marching together towards nazi defeat. With the kid shooting Hitler's portrait. Even when they had the upper hand on the nazis they were pretty humane, considering the level of barbarity that was shown towards them throughout the movie, they quickly shot them and moved on, no sick games, no torture, etc. This is a very nationalistic and pro-soviet movie, and again this is not a moral judgement, this is not a flaw, it's just the story they chose to tell and it is a masterpiece.

I think a truly anti-war movie should portrait war as something pointless and unnecessary from the pov of the everyday man like in Grave of the Fireflies. The war reflects on the kids as something that only harms them, they have no reason to engage in it, they don't understand it, it happened for the political/economic interests of the japanese empire. We know from history that Japan was more in the wrong than not and they were the agressors most of the time, so the movie shows this nihilistic perspective in which the war serves only to cause suffering even to japanese citizens and the kids die for nothing, they are not remembered, what happened during the film is absolutely pointless, as was the war. Another alternative would be to make a pro-peace movie, I like a quote from Coppola about it:

&gt;*But an anti-war film, I always thought, should be like The Burmese Harp – something filled with love and peace and tranquillity and happiness*

movies,My Fascination with Alfred Hitchcock and My Top 5 Hitchcock Films,"It was in the 1990s when I got my first VCR. I was beyond excited - just imagine, no more waiting for the cable guy to show you something good. Back then, there was no internet to help me figure out what to watch, so I headed to the local video store. I asked a friend who worked there that I wanted to watch an interesting mystery thriller and asked for suggestions. He told me to pick any Hitchcock movie - I couldnt go wrong. Thats when I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock.

Since that day, Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors. His mastery of suspense, mystery, and thriller genres is what makes him stand out. I think I’ve watched almost every Hitchcock film (at least the ones released after 1940), and each one has been a joy to revisit. Whats even more impressive is how well his movies have aged - something I can't say about a lot of films from that era. Hitchcock’s films have been remade and adapted countless times. Directors and writers still draw inspiration from his work. Even today!

Here’s a list of my top 5 Hitchcock films. If you haven’t seen them, I highly recommend you do. It wasn’t an easy task narrowing it down because I love so many of his films, but these are my absolute favs.

1. Psycho Psycho was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It was the first movie I saw on my new VCR. I’m not exaggerating when I say I got goosebumps during the final reveal. I literally jumped out of my chair, wondering what just happened. A fun fact: Psycho was the first movie ever made in the US to show a toilet flushing. Yep, you read that right - something as simple as a toilet became a big deal back then.
2. Rebecca I’ve always loved the book by Daphne du Maurier, so when I heard Hitchcock adapted it into a film, I was both excited and a little skeptical. Typically, I’m not a fan of book-to-movie adaptations, but Hitchcock did an amazing job. The movie brings the eerie atmosphere of the novel to life, with strong performances and a perfect blend of tension and mystery. Highly recommend it.
3. Rear Window Rear Window is an absolute masterpiece. Stewart and Kelly lead a stellar cast in this film, where Stewart plays a man stuck in a wheelchair, spying on his neighbors through the rear window. What he sees gets him tangled up in something far more sinister than he bargained for. The suspense is built slowly but steadily. What unfolds after is such a treat to watch. It’s been adapted and remade several times, with one of the most famous being Disturbia - not a bad film in itself but the original is much much better.
4. Strangers on a Train This one really kept me guessing. The premise was intriguing - two men meet on a train, and one proposes a strange idea: if they each commit a murder for the other, they’ll be in the clear. It’s one of those thrillers that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering how it’ll all unfold. The film does a great job of playing with psychological tension and moral dilemmas.
5. Dial M for Murder I saw Dial M for Murder a little later in my Hitchcock journey. Actually, I watched The Perfect Murder, a remake starring Michael Douglas, before I saw this. While I thought the remake had a decent plot, it didn’t quite measure up. Then, I read somewhere that it was copied from a Hitchcock movie - Dial M for Murder. I saw it and absolutely loved it. The plot was similar with some differences, but the execution was so much better. It was a fun, thrilling watch that had me hooked from start to finish.

It would be remiss of me not to mention some of my other favorite Hitchcock films, like Birds, Rope, Notorious, Spellbound, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. These could easily make a top-five list on another day.

If you haven’t seen his work and like watching movies, I suggest you watch his work. You won’t regret it.

movies,Taken - Lenore,"I am only about 20 minutes into Taken 1, and I know that Lenore eventually dies, but I think that she gets back with Bryan first right? So I wanted to know if she gets better, because right now she is so annoying. Like from what I get, their marriage wasn't good because of his job, and I get that sucks, but she is acting like she is the best person/parent. I don't know, she just comes across stuck up, but maybe she is a really good mom. Like Bryan just found out that Kim was following U2 around Europe, and Lenore knew, and that's crazy to me. He is a worried father, and even when they were in the restaurant (which I can understand why Kim wouldn't understand, she young and really wants to go), Lenore was acting like his concerns weren't valid. Then when he find out she was lying, she still acts like he is insane and paranoid. It just really bothers. And also, not a huge thing, but in the beginning of the movie, at Kim's birthday, her entire attitude was just off-putting. Is this just me?

movies,Was Inception About Coping With Dementia and Grief? ,"Would love to get the community's perspective on a different angle on Inception. 

There was this recurring quote in the movie from both Cobb and Mal throughout the movie: 

""You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you when the train will take you, cuz you'll be together.""

What if the movie is really about a failed suicide pact and dementia? 

I think the whole sequence from 2:12:45 to 2:13:50 redefines the whole movie.  This is the final scene with Mal after the kick is underway where Cobb reminds Mal that they had already grown old together and we see older versions of them walking in a city holding hands (with wedding rings) and then seeing the hands clasped together and rumbling on what looks like train tracks (with wedding rings, but you have to zoom in).  We know from Nolan that any scenes with the wedding ring was real life.

Two big prevailing themes in the movie centers on ""an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone"" (2:16:03) and taking a leap of faith.   Perhaps old Mal had dementia (in the above sequence Cobb tells Mal that she doesn't remember) and perhaps they planned a suicide by train (old hands on the train tracks) and he couldn't take the leap of faith and left her on the tracks at the last second leaving Cobbs now an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone and the movie reflects his reconciliation and grief.   Perhaps the whole movie is a dream of old Cobb sedated while in hospice but that's just my speculation.  Mal kinda pokes at the fourth wall a bit in the sequence from 1:59:59 to 2:00:51 which highlights how everything in the plot had conveniently come together so nothing is real.

movies,Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo',"Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic ""stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen"" narrative. 

This is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. 

The film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. 

What I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.

The story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.

This is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate. Highly recommend.",keepfighting90,1h34ecp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,2024-11-30 04:20:44,312,0.84,312,0,77,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h34ecp
movies,Get out was Jordan Peele’s one hit wonder. ,"upon seeing get out for the first time, I was struck. It was and still is one of my favorite movies I’ve ever seen in both the execution, cinematography, acting, plot, and significance to the world. Every second was fascinating, and the music was incredible. I think it’s one of the most genius movies ever written. because of this, I was so excited to watch us and nope. After watching both of those, I’m extremely disappointed. Nope was painful to get through with no plot conclusions and nothing making any reasonable interest. I don’t mind Science Fiction and maybe I just don’t like the genre, but I feel like nope was the biggest waste of time I’ve ever spent. It was not interesting, there were no a-ha moments and I was overall really disappointed. I watched us which I thought was better than nope, but still nowhere near the quality and genius of get out.

movies,"Ben Stiller could be thought of as more of a great director than as a comedic actor, in ten years' time","So Ben Stiller, damn he can pull some moves behind the camera.

He's known more as a comedic actor - but I think in ten years, he could be thought of as more of a great director. 

I'm currently watching 2018 mini-series Escape of Dannemora, and it is HBO level good. Based on a true story of a prison break. Really gritty. Starring top actors giving some incredible performances, Benicio del Toro, Patricia Arquette and Paul Dano. The scenes are all so captivating. Just a really well put together show all round. 

Then of course, there's Severance. Just stupendous, a real fine wine of a tv show. Gloriously quirky and compelling. Great to see Adam Scott beng given something more meaty to work with. He's such a great straight comic actor that it makes perfect sense he could play such a nuanced, thoughtful character. Plus, it's just such a great ensemble drama. 

Stiller's projects seem to all have a real subtext, and you see that in most scenes.

My points on these shows is that Stiller clearly can unlock special abilities in his actors to really explore a scene, a feeling or a premise and give it so much more depth

These are all really interesting performances and fascinating projects. 

I think as long as Severance doesn't continue to take hellishly long and wraps up after an appropriate amount of seasons, Stiller could go on to make a few more really renowned dramatic films or tv shows.

Plus, he has an impressive back catalogue of directing credits on more comedic movies, dating back to the 90s. Including The Cable Guy, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. You don't make these great comedy movies without having incredible directing chops.

I think Stiller could pull a Clint Eastwood and Jordan Peele on us and redefine his career.",Ok-fine-man,1h2zq8y,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2zq8y/ben_stiller_could_be_thought_of_as_more_of_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2zq8y/ben_stiller_could_be_thought_of_as_more_of_a/,2024-11-30 00:08:53,0,0.4,0,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2zq8y

movies,Monologues where someone tells a full story.  ,"I recently rewatched Gangs of New York and for all of DDL’s theatricality in various performances, he can be beautifully subtle:

That’s the scene where he slowly describes to Leo’s character Amsterdam, basically, his life story. What he’s all about, how he’s managed to survive. 

Another scene like that is the famous Jaws scene with Robert Shaw where he talks about his encounter with sharks as a WW2 soldier after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk in shark-infested waters:

Another one of the most famous is Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, relaying his visions and experiences of horror in war - the disturbing aftermath after he and his group inoculate a village - and using that to justify and rationalize his own brutality:

movies,"Benji ""A Real Pain"" (2024) ","While seeing this film I noticed small bits of things I tend to do that correlated with Benji (Kieran Culkin's) behavior. Just like Benji I am very extroverted and a happy person in general, but there are moments when certain things or situations just get to me very deeply and I get very emotional. I'm hypersensitive which means I enjoy life to the fullest and is grateful for the little things in life but I can also get sad for the littlest things which makes me suffer unconditionally. I've never met or seen anyone like me until I saw this movie. I was evaluating every single person's reaction to Benji's way of being, non of them wanted to be near him since the risk of him having a tantrum or having an emotional burst...This made me realize why I don't have any close friends or people around me, seeing the movie made me realize that if I had a benji I wouldn't wanna be near him or myself with the fear that they could hurt me in emotional and mental ways; being there for those types of people is very draining. They tend to be very negative towards themselves and feel like they don't deserve certain things. These negative feelings toward themselves makes them jealous of everyone since they feel like they aren't capable of deserving true love and real happiness. I am writing this description based on the things I saw he does in the movie as well as what correlates with me. I've been reading reviews like crazy to find a diagnoses because he has the same issues as me. He was diagnosed with bipolar disease and took medications but I've been told I don't have bipolar and would never take meds to solve a mental or emotional issue. I've been in a personal journey to help myself since my mother told me she prefers to protect herself from me since it's very tiring to be near me. The good times are amazing but she says she senses evil and negativity just as if I wanted to ruin a good time and have everyone focus on myself. I struggle with self-destruction tendencies since I was a kid and a part of me  thinks I do this because I feel like I'm not good enough and all the overthinking gets together and makes me burst with emotions or doing something to hurt myself or others just so I could stay alone and suffer. I think benji and I just both struggle with self-destruction tendencies. My psychologist told me that my personal self-love journey is going to help a lot and I won't be able to let other people love me until I learn to love myself. Personally I'm very happy that I've become self aware of all the people i've hurt in my life but most importantly myself, I'm glad I finally made the choice to help myself and stop being the victim. I'm a bit nervous because I've never been to truly love myself even after 22 years, I've always been quite negative about my body and even if I fix something it's never good enough, I just need to love who I am and I'm sure I can get through it with the right professional help.",Intrepid_Computer_68,1h2tzux,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,2024-11-29 19:41:26,0,0.44,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h2tzux
movies,Quotables,"Continuing a discussion from last night's Thanksgiving dinner, do you think movies have gone down in quality and quantity of Quotables?

I think the single most quotable film of all time is The Big Lebowski.  Pretty much every line in that film is God-Tier quotable.

Some films only have a few Quotables but they're just as epic. Aliens for example has ""they mostly come out at night"" and ""game over, man!"" which are both gold.

The great comedies are masterpieces of Quotables.  Airplane! and Hot Fuzz in particular (along with the already-mentioned Lebowski) are packed with incredibly awesome Quotables.

But what happened to cinema?  These days you barely even get a single great Quotable even in good movies.  I loved both the new Dune films, but I can't think of a single good quotable in either one.  ""I love you 3000"" is an ass-tier quotable.  ""On your left"" like that's not even fun, what else has Marvel even got?  ""I am Iron Man"" I guess but that movie is now 14 years old and the first one they made, and back when films still came with quotables.

I think we need to do something, write letters to the studios maybe or holler at James Gunn on twitterX.  Great one-liners are an important part of the moviegoing experience but nobody drops them anymore it seems.

Does this even make sense to anyone else?l or dod I just eat too much turkey yesterday and the tryptophan is still messing with my mind?

Which classic films would genuinely NOT benefit from a sequel, and WHY?   (Unless it’s obvious to all, might you tell us WHY you offer your answer?) 

These days, many (almost all) movies are made with a sequel or trilogy in mind. Even if the story ends with the destruction of the galaxy, there’s always room for that follow-up (and the potential for additional ca$h). 

In the past, movies were not created with this mindset.  Which movies are notably Not sequel ready?  In other words and in a roundabout way, how have sequels affected the quality of the movies being made today?

In my thinking, _Groundhog Day_ is a good example.  The story is completely wrapped up by the end.  No sequel necessary or wanted.

yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Poland - and I really would like to thank all the participants: We got around 50 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. Especially with this in mind, the final result is very close: ***Krótki film o zabijaniu*** (engl.: *A Short Film About Killing*) has won the race with just 12 upvotes (minus the given downvotes).

Today, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in Portugal. As always, the winner  will soon take its place in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And as always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Cities as Side Characters: A Cinematic Love Letter to Urban Landscapes,"Ever noticed how some movies make a city more than just a backdrop? Some directors go beyond showing a skyline or a monument. They dive deep into the city’s culture, spirit, and unique character to weave it into the story.

Bollywood has some brilliant examples of cities playing side characters:

Wake Up Sid gives us a heartfelt glimpse into Mumbai’s monsoons and its never-ending life.

Kahaani celebrates Kolkata’s festive chaos and mysteries.

8 AM Metro dives into Hyderabad’s beauty while exploring human emotions.


Even Hollywood embraces this concept:

Before Sunrise romanticizes Vienna’s quiet charm.

Midnight in Paris takes us through the dreamy streets of the city of love.

La La Land reflects LA’s bittersweet relationship with dreams.


From the ghats of Varanasi in Masaan to the neon-lit streets of Tokyo in Lost in Translation, cities have so much to say without uttering a single word.

movies,An Observation about the Sixth Sense 25 Years Later,"Yadda, yadda, spoilers.

When Sixth Sense was released it looked like a generic ghost story movie which I had no interest in until a friend, whose opinion I respected, told me I **had** to see it, but wouldn't tell me why. I would bet that a number of other people at that time had something like a similar experience; either they heard from a friend or read some reviews or just saw the box office numbers and realized this movie had something going for it. So I went with a few other friends and we were blown away by the ending, naturally. Recently, I remembered the conversation we had immediately following the movie and I recalled that all of us said the same thing: just before the ending, we thought it was a fine film, but didn't see what the big deal was –and *then* we saw the twist and were just as thrilled as everyone else.

And that recollection made me realize something either truly ingenious about Shyamalan or that he just got incredibly lucky. Take your pick.

That is: up until the end, it's not really that great of a film at all. I mean, it's fine. A few good jump scares, definitely some creepy scenes, but without *that* ending, the film is a C+ or maybe a B. However, preceding that awesome twist with a just an okay film completely misdirects the audience into thinking this is, in fact, just a mediocre picture. But then when the twist happens and we're all blown away. It's the basically the ""Yeah, I'm not doing anything; don't worry about it, everything is just normal"" misdirection that magicians use all the time and, like in a good magic ~~trick~~ illusion, lulling or even boring the audience into thinking they know what's going to happen is makes what actually does happen all the more amazing.

So maybe Shyamalan made what he thought would have been a great ghost story all along, but just got really, really lucky that he thought of a really great ending. Or maybe he intentionally kept the first half fairly low-key/stakes to stun us at the end.

Take your pick.",Jackieirish,1h2p6eg,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2p6eg/an_observation_about_the_sixth_sense_25_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2p6eg/an_observation_about_the_sixth_sense_25_years/,2024-11-29 16:12:02,0,0.15,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2p6eg

movies,After rewatching Inception my opinion on the ending has now changed forever,"I always believed that Leo was actually awake at the end. Nolan just showed us the spinning top as it was about to topple over before cutting to black and ending the movie. 

After rewatching the movie for who knows how many times I fully believe now that Leo is still dreaming. 

1. Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but…

2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven’t aged at all. 

Anyway that’s where I’m leaning now - he’s still dreaming. 

Edit: I’m loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo’s kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. 

I’ve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. 

I will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I’m even more curious! Is Leo dreaming because he still has not experienced his gravity drop in “the real world.” Hmmm 🤔 ",onlyididntsayfudge,1h2lv4j,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,2024-11-29 13:32:59,5557,0.9,5557,0,754,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2lv4j

The story of the most famous sniper of the Winter War has never before been brought to the silver screen.

The Russians gave Häyhä the name ""White Death"" — and for good reason.

According to his personal notebook, Häyhä killed 542 Russian soldiers during the 98 days of the Winter War. This is more than any other sniper in the world has achieved in such a short time.

The movie is set during the winter of 1939-1940 on the Kollaa front, where a small group of Finns stood to stop an overwhelmingly superior enemy from invading Finland.

Häyhä was seriously wounded in the battles at Kollaa just a week before the end of the Winter War. He awoke from a coma on the day the war ended.

Due to his injuries, Häyhä was unable to take part in the Continuation War, though he would have wanted to.

Simo Häyhä was born in 1905 in Rautjärvi, Karelia, and passed away as a respected war hero in a veterans' care home in Hamina in 2002.

The film's consultant is Major (ret.) Tapio Saarelainen, who has authored several books about Häyhä.

El Camino was somewhat of a step down from Breaking Bad, it was still a pretty amazing movie, and could’ve been pretty successful as a stand-alone movie, the plot definitely would’ve worked. Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse’s story. 

The Simpson’s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far.

Me and my friends are embarking upon a long and very stupid journey to watch every single talking animal film (we will later also be creating a Tier List for them). In order to classify as a talking animal film it must meet these two criteria

1. the animal MUST talk (obviously) so human like animals such as snoopy are disqualified
2. the animal/animals MUST be one of the main protagonists (this leaves a movie like Shrek up to debate as he is a secondary protagonist, leaving open to discussion)

If we have somehow missed a movie (TV specials do not count) please comment and We will add it to the list, otherwise pray for our sanity. all we've seen so far is the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies and we already went slightly crazy

movies,Has a live action remake EVER been an improvement upon an animated movie or show? ,"I'm seeing people talk about the live action how to train your dragon, I made a comment on a different site about how in my opinion, no animated movie has ever been improved by being converted to live action.  The same goes with animated to live action shows, like one piece and Last Airbender.  

Aladdin, last Airbender, one piece, jungle book, beauty and the beast, I'd rather watch the original animated work every single time.  

Lion King doesn't count because it's only live action in appearance and is often considered an animated movie since every second of that movie was computer generated besides the first 10 seconds of the sunrise.  

I'm also not talking about different mediums, video game-&gt;movie, book-&gt;movie etc. Only if the original animated and live action remake are both a movie or both a TV show.  I don't really count when there's a movie that adapts a book, but also has a movie.  As an example mirror mirror is the best snow white and seven dwarfs movie in my opinion, but it isn't trying to adapt the 1930's animated movie to live action, it's simply adapting the original fairy tale.  Things like avatar, how to train your dragon, and the Moana live action are very clearly trying to adapt the movie, not another older work separately ",Sarcastic_Rocket,1h29gpd,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h29gpd/has_a_live_action_remake_ever_been_an_improvement/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h29gpd/has_a_live_action_remake_ever_been_an_improvement/,2024-11-29 00:21:12,0,0.32,0,0,60,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h29gpd

movies,Out of My Mind (2024),"I saw this movie being advertised on Disney+ today. It was brilliant despite being a teen/YA Disney movie. Which, even when I was a teen, I usually saw as mediocre at best. I really want to promote it in my own way as I doubt it'll get too much mainstream attention. 

While it'll never be on any lists of greatest movies or anything, well maybe on a list of ""best movies about a disability/disabled person"", but it more than succeeds at what it aims to achieve. I admit I watched it because of a personal connection, I have cerebral palsy, just like the main character, and have only seen one other film about my condition before *My Left Foot*. I was very happy to see that another film about my disability has been made, and with an actor that actually understands the condition fully too, that didn't just patronise and seek to show us as weak and pitiful. 

Anyway, the film was great. It succeeded in providing an insight into the condition from both the disabled individual's perspective as well as the carer's perspective. All of the actors were believable and elicited genuine reactions from me as the viewer. It reminded me of the discriminations I suffered at that age but also the times that I was lucky (and continue to be lucky) to have good people in my corner to support me. 

The greatest praise should be reserved for the lead actress, Phoebe-Rae Taylor, who is a genuinely great actor. Especially for a 12-13 year old making her acting debut, even though you could argue that she is playing a character that she has a unique insight about and wasn't always acting in the traditional sense, as she has cerebral palsy herself. She shines in this movie, showing the highs and lows of living with this disability, and reminding me of things (both positive and negative) that I hadn't thought of in years. It also reminded me that the frustrations I live with on a daily basis, and can feel immensely guilty for, are normal.

I really encourage everyone to watch this film. Even if you don't have a disability yourself, or have any connection to someone that does, it is a great movie. It will show you how, and how not to, act around someone that has a disability. Even I learned something, it highlighted to me the impact of my own ableism, (be it self-hatred and/or external reaction to those I perceive as ""more disabled""), that I have recognised before but not as obviously as I could while watching this film.

I hope that, if you are able to watch this film, you enjoy it. It is bittersweet, and the last half hour or so was genuinely heartbreaking to me, but it is an important film that I'm happy to have experienced.

movies,What’s the purpose of a red herring? When are they good and when are they bad?,"In *Late Night With The Devil (2023)*, without giving anything away, there’s a background character that sticks out like a sore thumb.

I got all the way to the end credits assuming that, any second now, they were going to finally step forward and say: “Nyah haaaaahh! It was me! Me all along!”

But no they were nothing.

So, this is a (intentional I think?) red herring. I found it distracting and annoying in this specific case, but it’s such a common trope that there must be a reason for them.

Just at the moment though I can’t think of what it might be. I mean, I definitely don’t have a “favourite red herring”. They’ve always just seemed like a pointless digression, akin to a random background extra walking around with a handful of fireworks for absolutely no reason.

movies,"I watched 365 movies this year, and here is what I learned. ","I decided back in January that I wanted to try to stop doom scrolling. And instead of scrolling for 2 hours I would watch a movie instead. Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. 

1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren’t even IN other movies. 

2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. 

3: If your movie isn’t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. 

Couple of facts: 

First movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube

Last movie: Planes trains and automobiles. 

Best movie: American Fiction 

Worst Movie: The Creeps.  

Movies I watched that I had seen before: 16

Most movies watched in a single day: 5


It’s been a long year and I’ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. 

Edit: sexually lol 

As requested Top 10: 

1: American Fiction

2: biosphere 

3: They Cloned Tyrone 

4: 1917

5: Maxxxine 

6: the Blackening

7: the vast of night 

8: The green knight 

9: bottoms 

10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)


Edit 2: people have a lot of opinions about movies, yet it seems mine are the only ones that are invalid? 

There are a ton of other things I learned from watching so many movies in such a short time. I, however, typically like to enjoy things more than shit on them (I.e. the beautiful madness that is Shadow in the Clouds). 

So allow me to clarify what in reverse:

3: In regards to run time, yes I agree, a story is as long as it needs to be, but streaming places like Netflix don’t usually care,  because they want a longer movie that keeps you watching. This can kill whatever story they were trying to tell. This is less a problem with Older movies, and more a modern issue and issue with a lot of horror movies (which is 80% what I watched).  It was my way of saying that movies could be tightened up to be more impactful and memorable.  For the “movies should be as long as they need to tell the story” people, we all know if movies needed to be as long as they need to be then there wouldn’t be a need for an editor nor “directors cuts.” Some stories don’t need the time and some stories need more. 

2: of course movies have different budgets, I am saying it is VERY noticeable when you go back to back and see a difference. It is amazing what people can do on a smaller budget to make it look good and how a larger budget production can blow the money and you don’t ever really see it on the screen.  

1: so many faces end up looking the same. Admittedly I come from an era where there were big names in the theaters and someone being in a movie meant something. Not something GOOD necessarily but something.  With this last year, I would see movies with an actor in it and still not know what sort of movie it is. You see “Justin Long” is in a horror movie and you know you are basically in for a good time. You see someone like Gerald Farlong in a movie and you just wanna know if you should know him from something (you shouldn’t. I made him up).  I do like that Square jaw man from the Hit Man tho. 

If I learned anything real, it’s that I love movies, and even if a movie is bad, as long as it’s fun, then it didn’t waste my time. 

Glad you all love American fiction and vast of night.  

Glad you all hate American fiction and the green knight. 

I’m gonna go watch “It’s a wonderful knife” now.

movies,A blend of art and fear: Why Hereditary is a must-watch movie. ,"I always thought I didn’t like horror movies. I usually don’t enjoy blood, violence, or scenes designed to disgust. But recently, I watched Hereditary by Ari Aster, which is categorized as a horror movie, and for a change—not only was I not grossed out or anything—I genuinely enjoyed it! There were plenty of scary scenes that made me grab onto whoever was sitting next to me xD, but it was the kind of fear that’s fun and intriguing—I loved being scared.

The casting was excellent. The acting of the mother (Annie) was fantastic, and the choice of Milly Shapiro for the role of the daughter (Charlie) was spot-on, and so on.

The film's atmosphere was mesmerizing; for example, the fact that the mother was a ""miniaturist"" and recreated their home in miniature—it was simply brilliant! It didn’t necessarily add anything significant to the plot, but it contributed something very unique to the movie's vibe.

The scary parts were genuinely frightening, in my opinion, but what was special is that along with my fear, I also found myself laughing.
The amazing director edited the film in such a fantastic way that even in the scary scenes, there was a sense of humor. This movie is truly one of a kind.

In conclusion: Ari Aster, the crown is yours! 👑

movies,How long do you think John Wick could fend off police/swat with unlimited ammo,"Let’s start with a setting.

John Wick was already on the run from police for (reason) on boat. He found a decently sized island out in the ocean.

He finds a completely untouched AR15, picks it up, and upon picking it up, he feels something enter his pocket.
It’s a magazine!

yap yap we know he has infinite magazines now, but has to manually reload.

Now the Cops are here, and so are the uh.. ocean swat team?

How long do you think John Wick could fend off the police/Swat for? (No surrendering)

movies,What was going on in the Chinese movie industry in the early 80s?,"So I was looking at [this list of movies ordered by most box office admissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_by_box_office_admissions) and I noticed all the top ones are Chinese. At first I figured ""big population, makes sense"" but then I noticed that they're *all* from 1979 to 1985. What's up with that? There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?

I tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap. I wasn't sure if I should ask this here, r/AskHistorians, or some other sub, but if anyone has any ideas, let me know.

I also noticed a surprising lack of Indian movies, given the reputation of Bollywood and size of India. If population were the sole reason, I would figure India would also take several of the top spots on that list.",dancingbanana123,1h1yo5g,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1yo5g/what_was_going_on_in_the_chinese_movie_industry/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1yo5g/what_was_going_on_in_the_chinese_movie_industry/,2024-11-28 15:41:31,66,0.8,66,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h1yo5g
movies,Were the makers of Shot Caller in hot water with the gangs of whom the names they used in the movie? ,"I know the producers (and some actors) of American Me and Blood In Blood out got in trouble for using the name, La Eme (Mexican Mafia) in their movies.  Some consultants and actors of American Me were mudered by the Mexican Mafia (source: Danny Trejo's biography). 

In Shot caller they used PENI (Public Enemy Number 1), NLR (Nazi Low Riders) and, The Brand (Aryan Brotherhood).  When one of the writers of the movie was doing research for Shot Caller, he posed as a Parole Officer in training when visiting the prisons.  That leads me to believe that they did not get those gangs' permission to use their names. But I'm not absolutely sure.  If they didn't, it's a dangerous thing to do.  Considering what's happened in the past when gang names were used.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Poland,"Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Norway. More than 24 hours and almost 100 comments later, we have a clear winner: ***Flåklypa Grand Prix*** (engl.: *Pinchcliffe Grand Prix*) will be a wonderful addition to our official Letterboxd list, which becomes more and more heterogeneous, as the time goes by. 

today, I ask you for your favorite movie set in the next european country by alphabetical order: We leave the letter N and go to P like **Poland**. It won't be quite as personal for me as Germany (where I was born and still live today), but both my parents come from Silesia, so I'm even more excited about your suggestions. All I ask is that you stick to the following two rules: 

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!
