math,"Bashar Al-Assad's son Hafez has recently defended his doctoral thesis, can someone explain in laymans terms what exactly he did?","Given recent developments in Syria, I was surprised to learn after a bit of reading that the oldest son of now ex-president Assad is a mathematician. He studies at Lomonosov State University in Moscow.

In a bit of an ironic twist, he recently (like two weeks ago) defended his doctoral dissertation while the Syrian opposition was about to start their offense. I dug up a summary of his thesis although I can't actually find the full text. I'm not a mathematician so as I'm trying to read the translated summary, I'm still not sure what exactly he did.

The title is ""Arithmetic questions of polynomials in algebraic number fields "" and this is the summary translated from Russian:

The first topic we will consider is the representation of two rational integers as sums of three rational squares having a common square. Representations of rational integers as polynomials have always been of interest to mathematics. Many well-known theorems and results, such as Legendre's three-square theorem, Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorems, the Hilbert-Gamke problem and many others, are devoted to this issue. In particular, Legendre's three-square theorem completely solves the problem of representing a rational integer as a sum of three rational squares. For representing an integer by a homogeneous polynomial of degree two, the local-global Hasse principle reduces the problem to representability modulo all powers of primes and representability in real numbers. In 1980, D.L. Colliot-Thelen and D. Core generalized Hasse's principle to two homogeneous polynomials under certain conditions. Our study is aimed at generalizing the above-mentioned Legendre theorem, and exploits this generalization.

The second topic we consider is estimates of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. Trigonometric sums have long been of interest because of their deep connection with modular arithmetic in the residue ring modulo q. In particular, they arise in the Hardy-Littlewood-Ramanujan circle method in the form of I.M. Vinogradov's trigonometric sums for estimating the number of solutions of Diophantine equations. In particular, the solvability of a given equation is considered, first, in the real numbers, and second, modulo any rational integer q. The latter part is usually deeper and more difficult, and rational trigonometric sums play an essential role in it; they are effectively responsible for the solvability modulo q. In 1940, Hua Lo-keng found a nontrivial estimate for trigonometric sums in the field of rational numbers. Subsequent work by Chen Junrun and V. I. Nechaev improved the estimate. In 1984, Qi Mingao and Ding Ping found a constant in Hua Luo-ken's estimate. In 1949, Hua Luo-ken generalized his estimate to the case of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. The first part of our study on this topic is aimed at strengthening this estimate. The second part of our study on this topic is aimed at generalizing Hua Luo-ken's tree method for constructing solutions of polynomial congruences modulo a rational prime, used in solving the convergence problem of a singular series in the Prouet-Terry-Ascot problem, to the case of algebraic number fields.

The third topic we consider is the representations of Dirichlet characters. Dirichlet characters, first introduced by P. L. Dirichlet in 1837, play a central role in multiplicative number theory. They were originally used by him to prove a theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.Many important questions of the analytical number theory were developed on the basis of Dirichlet characters and the theory of Dirichlet L-functions. In the modern theory of L-functions, estimates of character sums are of great importance. A.G. Postnikov's formula, proved by him in 1955, expresses Dirichlet characters modulo a power of an odd prime number through exponentials of polynomials with rational coefficients. Thus, the problem of estimating the sums of such Dirichlet characters is reduced to I.M. Vinogradov's method of trigonometric sums. Our study on this topic is connected with the generalization of A.G. Postnikov's formula to the case of a Dirichlet character modulo a power of 2 and the application of both the original and the generalized formula of A.G. Postnikov to estimate the sums of characters in algebraic number fields.

math,Research in Galois and Field Theory,"Hi, I wanted to ask a question about active research done in algebra, more specifically in field theory.

In the math department where I study, it seems that the main research in algebra involves finding the asynptotics of the probability of a set of random polynomials  These questions are much different than the algebra courses I took (like Galois Theory and commutatice algebra)- they are more about asymptotics, bounding terms and overall much more calculation-heavy.

I was recently given a few papers to read, which also had a lot of calculations, and the results where about counting the number of polynomials that satisfy a certain condition. It didn't really interest me, and the whole thing makes me a bit hopeless about doing research in this subject- the courses I took where so beautiful, but now everything looks like it's just calculating things.

I wanted to ask if there are different areas of research in Algebra/Field Theory (I'm not talking about Group Theory in this post), which is less about calculating things and more ""beautiful"" (I know it's subjective but I don't know how else to put it), like things done in class.

math,I am so burned out and I don't know why :( I worry that I've lost my passion for math ,"* I am a senior and I am only taking one math course right now. It's just a numerical linear algebra course.
* I have really not liked this course and I feel no desire to study for it. I don't understand why I feel so blah. The material is quite important and useful, but I think the material isn't particularly well-motivated, especially given that every method has been developed to solve a practical problem.
   * For example, I guess when we talk about Krylov subspace techniques, we could mention the motivation of projection methods is to efficiently solve very large sparse systems arising from finite element method.
* I don't understand why I feel so bored and unmotivated. I think it may have to do with the teaching structure, as my instructor was absent for several lectures and has been quite busy this semester. I felt really quite frustrated as I have other courses during office hours and the instructor was only able to meet during office hours, but I guess this is on par for the course for a graduate course.
* Normally I am quite happy to study in whatever spare time I have, but I feel like I've lost my passion and I struggle to want to study.
* I am constantly confused, also, and I am doing poorly in the course. It's a graduate course and I currently have a B; to me, that indicates a deficiency in my effort level and / or my understanding. Maybe my linear algebra background is too weak.

This semester, I applied to graduate school and I've been working on research projects, hence my mind was elsewhere for much of the semester. But I feel so frustrated and I am scared that I've lost my passion for math.

math,Math became my unexpected escape from life,"I’ve always been fascinated by math, even as a kid in elementary school. Back then, I thought I liked it simply because I was good at it. I never really considered math as something I’d study seriously in university or as a particularly “useful” pursuit—it was just there.

Long story short, I ended up pursuing the path to medicine. But often problems would get stuck in my mind, and I couldn’t seem to shake them off.

Then came linear algebra. I took it as an elective, and it was my first real exposure to proof-based math. Honestly, I struggled with the proofs a lot, but something unexpected happened. After the course ended, I realized how much happier I was during that semester. Math had completely occupied my mind—there wasn’t room for other worries to creep in. That struggle, that focus, made my brain feel calmer.

Now, I’ve decided to make math my “side quest” alongside medicine, and I feel incredibly satisfied about it. These days, I carry an abstract math book with me almost everywhere. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I’ll open it, read a few pages, and immerse myself in it. It’s like a reset button for my mind.

Currently, I’m enjoying a book on Galois Theory, and it’s been amazing  so far. I just wanted to share this experience and see if anyone else can relate.

math,The unmatched beauty of logarithms,"Out of all the math I’ve learned, logarithms have been the ones I’ve been most fascinated by.

Logarithms very plainly serve as the inverse of exponentiation, which lays the foundation for understanding growth of quantities such as investments or population growth. But beyond that, logarithms represent the quantification of the impossibly large. To understand logarithms means to be able to multiply and divide impossibly large quantities given logarithmic rules. This concept seems given and simple but it was always interesting to me. It’s an elegant solution to understanding simple ROC and growth, which creates the foundation for transformation, and we see those absolutely everywhere. It can be applied for sorting and searching algorithms, statistical variance stabilizing, power law linearization of obscured data, even observed natural phenomenon like sound intensity finds its base in the decibel system (which, of course, is logarithmic). The nature of these large quantities are put into scale using logarithms, and that expands the scope of applied math.

All of this just is achieved just by understanding logarithms, which I find fascinating.",Mountain-Winter-9564,1ha4tdg,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ha4tdg/the_unmatched_beauty_of_logarithms/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ha4tdg/the_unmatched_beauty_of_logarithms/,2024-12-09 07:53:37,0,0.36,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ha4tdg
math,Dealing with meta-theory in research,"How important is it to understand the limitations of current techniques when coming up with new ones?

Whenever I approach a new (to me) topic in math, there always seem to be a few core standard arguments and lemmas that get repeatedly used to obtain many of the best-known results.

When approaching open problems in these areas, it often seems natural to try to try these methods to exhaustion. As these are open problems, such naive applications are almost inherently doomed to fail as they would have been discovered and published long before.


However, it usually leaves a nearly equally difficult problem of determining why such techniques don’t work—what I’m referring to as the “meta-theory”. 

Some examples of these “meta theory” arguments do include your classic peano or ZF independent statements, but they can also be more grounded in a particular approach. For instance one of the classic techniques for determining if a polynomial has nontrivial integer roots is to consider residues mod n (Hasse principle). However, the equation 3x^3+4y^3+5z^3=0 has solutions mod n for every n, but has no solutions in the integers.
Such a result shows that this elementary technique is fundamentally limited.

Another example in information theory is the existence of non-Shannon-type entropy inequalities. (entropy inequalities that can be derived solely from the non-negativity of mutual information.) 

I find these kinds of results very intriguing and yet very difficult to understand the full implications of. This is particularly because they can show that the current/basic techniques are not enough to solve certain problems. However, it they can sometimes be almost as challenging as the problems they are intended to help solve, as even formalizing what it really means to be (or not be) obtainable using a set of methods can be extremely difficult.

When mathematicians develop new tools to solve open problems, how well do they understand the limitations of the current techniques? I find it difficult to believe that people randomly stumble across new techniques without already having a pretty good sense of what a “correct” proof would have to look like, although im sure it happens rarely.

Does reasoning about the limitations of current techniques generally come before the creation of new ones?

math,How do I figure out what I like in algebra ?,"I am a final-year undergraduate student in mathematics, and I’ve taken a variety of courses that have helped me realize my general interest in algebra. So far, I’ve studied Representation Theory, Commutative Algebra, and Algebraic Number Theory, all of which I enjoyed and performed well in. However, I’m still unsure about which specific area within algebra excites me the most. 

I want to apply for masters and PhD programs in Europe and US (respectively). I want to figure out what I like before that (i.e. in about a month)  because I want a strong personal statement surrounding what I like and why I like it. Next semester, I’ll be taking courses in Algebraic Geometry, Lie Groups and Algebras, and Modular Forms. I’m concerned that I might end up liking these new topics just as much as or even more than my current interests, which could further complicate my decision-making process. 

Also, figuring out what I like is also essential before I choose any advisor anywhere. I’ve spoken to professors in my department, and each has emphasized the merits of studying their respective fields—whether it’s Commutative Algebra, Representation Theory, or Algebraic Number Theory.

math,How large is union of all prime ideals in a given ring?,"Hey mathmagicians, I’m not sure how to ask this question in a short title so apologies for that

Basically take an arbitrary ring R, then let A be the union of all possible prime ideals in the ring. I know that A isn’t necessarily an ideal itself but I don’t really care about that right now. I’m just curious, are we always guaranteed that A will contain a ‘large’ amount of R?

The example I’m thinking of is the reason for my intuition; take R=Z then all prime ideals are just ideals generated by prime integers. The union of all prime ideals contains every integer except 1 and -1.

If you’re curious why I want to know, I was trying to look into the following; Let A be a ring and let Spec(A) be the Zariski topology on A, will a non-empty open set (Zariski topology defines sets as closed) always contain 1?

On wikipedia it seems like you would only go to secant if a = c or b = c but then you'd only ever be doing secant for the first step right? Their example doesn't seem to line up with that.

math,Why do we approximate multivariate functions with Quadratics in Optimization Problems? ,"Currently I am studying for my linear algebra final and decided to go off the material and read interesting topics in Multilinear algebra from Axler's textbook, so far, I've gotten to the part regarding quadratic forms. Something that i've read (and now that I mention it, I don't remember from where) is that the Hessian matrix defines a Quadratic form when evaluated at any point. I've been trying to conceptualize quadratic forms in my head but it is pretty difficult for me to understand.

This makes understanding Quadratic Forms (and as an extension, Bilinear Forms) even more difficult for me, as Axler's book never really talks about the semantical reasoning as to why a function f(v) that can be written as a bilinear form b(v,v) is referred to as ""Quadratic."" With that being said, why do we approximate multilinear (""difficult"") functions with quadratics functions, and what does the Hessian have to do with linear forms?

math,Groups -- and Generators without Closure?,"I'm doing a project in music theory, and it has unexpectedly veered into Group Theory. I have been reading about it and I get the gist of it, but some of the definitions are unclear. I don't have a definitive textbook on the subject. Can you help?

Take for example the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}, which describes all the tones in the 12-TET Chromatic scale. We also define the operator of ""addition modulo 12"". I know that it is a Group because it satisfies the criteria:

* Closure
* Associativity
* Identity Element (it is 0)
* Invertibility

And this set definitely has a Generator. The generator could be 1, 5, 7, or 11 -- all the numbers that are coprime with the modulo. I've read that this is a ""generator set"", ie {1,5,7,11} is the set of all generators.

A Group with a generator is called a ""cyclic group"". And I've also read the definition ""a cyclic group has a single generator element"". Well, my Group has multiple generators. I take this to mean that we're only using one generator at a time... we aren't finding members of the Group by applying 1 or 5 or 7 any way we wish. We pick one generator, use it to generate the set, then put it back when we're done.

Furthermore, this is a ""finite cyclic set"" because of the modulo. It doesn't go on forever down the yellow brick number line.

Another definition says ""a group is cyclic if there exists an 𝑎∈𝐺 such that every element of G is a power of a. By ""power of"" I assume that means a repeated application of the operator ""addition mod 12"". By this definition, the set {1,2,3,...,11} is cyclic.

So far that all makes sense, and... if I've made any mistakes please let me know and correct me!

OK Here's where things get a bit unclear for me, and where I think I might be wandering astray.

The Major Scale is represented by a set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}. We'll use the same operator ""addition mod 12"".

This isn't a Group! It fails the Closure condition -- because we can add 4 + 2 = 6, and 6 is not in the set. It passes Associativity and Identity. But then it fails on ""Inverses"".

And yet... in the Music Theory literature there is a lot of theorizing around Generators where the Major scale is used as an example. From any tone in the set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}, you can add (or subtract) 5 or 7 enough times to find every other member of the set. Those of you who have studied music and the ""circle of fifths"" know what I'm talking about here.

But wait, forget about subtracting. We can create a path for the generator 7 if we start on the 5 and end on 11. It just can't go any further than that. According to what I've read in Group Theory, generators can't be stopped like that, but in Music Theory, they can?

Does the Major Scale fulfil the criteria ""there exists an 𝑎∈𝐺 such that every element of G is a power of a""? It almost does, but it's more like a + x\^n not a\^n 

So what's the deal here? There are sets (with the addition mod 12 operator) that are not Groups, but they are cyclic, they have a Generator, Or at least, something that behaves like a Generator, but it can't be applied forever in both directions; there is a start and end to its generation pattern. Are there words for this that I haven't learned yet? Group-like things that have a Generator, but no Closure?

I'm writing this for an advanced academic audience so it's very important that I get all the words correct, and that I'm not glossing over the mathematical details with some vague hand-waving.

math,Feeling Lost in My Math Journey: Seeking Guidance to Reignite My Passion,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics (Honors) at the University of Delhi, and I’m in my 5th semester (third year). While it’s a decent university, the curriculum and academic environment aren’t exactly top-notch (although the professors are good). In my fourth year, we’ll focus on research, but right now, I’m struggling with what I want to do after graduation.

Here’s my story: I’ve always been passionate about mathematics and video editing (I’m a tech enthusiast). I’ve always wanted to change how people perceive and approach mathematics, especially inspired by 3blue1brown’s YouTube channel. The way he explains concepts so smoothly really resonated with me, and I thought, “I want to do something like that.”

However, I feel completely lost now. I shifted my focus from mathematics and started taking a lot of video editing courses. I didn’t attend many of my classes and, as a result, my GPA has dropped to 6.5. For the past semester, I’ve been trying to rekindle my love for math, for that I participated in a national level workshop about Numerical Optimisation  but I feel like I’m failing at it. As a Gen Z student, I’m constantly on social media, which doesn’t help in staying focused. I want to dive back into mathematics, but I’m not sure how to balance everything or even what my next steps should be.

I have no clear idea about my career path after this, and I feel stuck. I genuinely want to become great at mathematics again and eventually make a difference in how mathematics is taught and managed, especially in India, where things aren’t structured in the best way.

Any advice or thoughts on how to get back on track with my passion for math, manage my time better, and figure out my career direction would be greatly appreciated!

math,"People who do research in math, did you occasionally feel like the results you discover are embarassingly trivial?","I hope the title manages to adress the question I am asking. So I am currently working on some stuff in low dimensional topology, more precisely I try to characterise a specific set of simple closed curves on surfaces by using homological considerations that are eventually needed for proving the main theorem of my work.  
  
Without getting too much into details, I am studying the behaviour of certain loops on  surfaces and I just recently finally managed to pin it down and give a full characterisation of these elements I was trying to understand for quite some time. First I witnessed some patterns by doing a bit of combinatorial considerations and once I understood what happens, I started proving what I had witnessed. The following day I noticed that everything I proved essentially comes down to basic linear algebra and now my proof is literally a few lines of nothing than very elementary linear algebra. 

To be fair, it is not entirely obvious at first glance.  The result itself is still novel in the sense that it helps me eventually prove a much more significant statement but still, once I found the proof, it felt utterly trivial all of a sudden.

I will of course discuss my results with my supervisor who can immediately tell whether or not my results are useful, but am still interested in hearing some of your experiences. Have you ever had a similar experience or feeling?

math,Building Probabilistic Intuition and Working Towards Applied Knowledge of Random Flights and Rough Paths,"**Background**

I hold a B.S. in math and CS, and recently graduated with my M.S. in CS. My day job consists of writing code for monte carlo integration and importance sampling. 

I’m looking to continue some of my M.S. research in my spare time, and pursue some new directions that I didn’t have time to build the background for in grad school. This background lies specifically in the domain of short random walks, random flights, and the theory of rough paths. 

My (formal) experience consists of:

1. Undergraduate probability theory
2. First semester real analysis
3. The first half of Durrett’s *Essentials of Stochastic Processes*
4. Two graduate topics courses in probability theory, which very loosely followed Alon &amp; Spencer, Bollobas, and Winkler’s collections of puzzles. 

I stress that since I work on the applied side of things, I’m not looking to understand results in these domains well enough to prove them myself. So while I have my own understanding of things like the pushforward measure’s usage in my own contexts, I have not yet needed to truly understand or learn the definitions for a sigma algebra. 

**In summary**
1. Given my background, what resources should I use and how should I best approach learning about random flights and rough paths?
2. What other interesting resources are availible to further my intuition about probability, stochastic processes, and related domains?

math,Need advice regarding math (book recommendations + general advice),"I haven't been interested in studies for quite a while till now though I didn't used to be like this before . It's been more than five years since I haven't excelled in a subject as I used to. The truth is I didn't care much then (I was busy being distracted.) Well, now, I'm not- at least I think I'm not.

I liked math a lot back then simply because I was good at it(I think). Though I got perfect scores or near perfect scores, I stopped doing even the moderate amount of work later. Everything seemed to get boring and I really did not like the Math curriculum at all. I got an A for my GCSEs though(which I think that happened because I volunteered to help a friend and since I did volunteer, I had to learn the stuff myself before tutoring another). Even though I said the curriculum is boring and all, at the time I tutored, I really had a great time sharing the little knowledge I had, giving tips I didn't even know I knew of. It was like tutoring math gave me a purpose, it made me feel very alive and content with the very little I did.

There were times I got eighties or lesser then, lower than any time before. Sometimes when I was slipping off my grades, I'd just have this need out of nowhere the day before the test and I'd spend the night on math and get a 90 or 95 out of 100 again. I think I did it to prove myself something, to remind myself I'm not dumb - or I don't know. It was purely because of this little voice in my head that echoed 'never enough' and I wanted to scream back that I'm not. My way of doing that was math paper I guess. I want to try this time, truly try. Though I love math, at the moment I'm unable to study it for my A/Levels. 

Everyone around me says that I'll get all As and get into med school. They all want me to be a doctor. It's not that I don't like becoming one, it's that I love math more.  So, I thought I'd learn it as a hobby.

 And I want to have a fresh perspective toward the subject and truly enjoy every second of it. I'm used to people around me saying 'of course, she's smart, she'll definitely ace her A/levels', 'I know her, she's capable of doing much more'. I really don't like it when people have set their expectations high for me, I really do not like pressure. I want to study because I want to, because I enjoy it, not just to write an exam and get into med school. And the other thing is that even though people say that kind of things and I'm used to hearing them, I don't feel special at all. I think I'm very average actually. The friend I tutored, she said that I'm a lot better than her private math tutor(a degree holder) and made her enjoy learning it(which she stressed ""I used to think math and enjoy doesn't belong to the same sentence'). I don't want to brag about myself or anything, I am really glad I was able to help her(she has an A too). Is it normal to not feel special though people around you imply you are? And how to handle this type of pressure?

 Can someone please recommend me a list of books I need to have to self-study math from the very beginning or intermediate level to advanced? Though my foundation isn't so bad, I'd rather start it all again from zero if necessary. They don't need to be conventional textbooks (I'd more like it if they weren't), any book you really think that's worth reading is fine for me.

I'd be really grateful if someone can give me a list of all the books that are needed to learn math while enjoying it. I'm open to any advice you think I'll need too.

Justin has contributed to both these areas via his book Morality and Mathematics, which takes the view that the standard position of being both a mathematical realist and moral antirealist is incoherent. Perhaps the most novel aspect of Justin's work is the treatment of the philosophy of mathematics and morality side-by-side, showing how these two topics, which are usually thought of as being unrelated, in fact have strong analogies.

math,Question about the Grigorchuk Group,"Hi, I'm currently reading this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607384) about the Grigorchuk Group and there is this proof I don't understand.

Lemma 7.1 says, every element g in G has all of its reduced decompositions of the same type (i), or of type (iv), or of mixed type (ii/iii).

The types are

* (i) a\*a\*...\*a
* (ii) a\*a\*...\*
* (iii) \*a\*...\*a
* (iv) \*a\*...\*

where every \* stands for one of the generators b, c or d.

The proof given in the paper is really short and honestly I don't understand it one bit. It goes like this:

The number of a's in a reduced decomposition of g is even iff. g stabilizes the vertices on the first level^(1). Thus g cannot have decomposition of type (i) and (iv) at the same time. (WHY?) The fact that decompositions of type (i) and (iv) have odd length, while those of type (ii) and (iii) have even length, implies the result.

If someone who is familiar with the Grigorchuck Group could explain this proof to me, that would be great :-)

math,Seeking Guidance: Niche in Mathematical Optimization/Programming in Finance ,"Hi there,

I am a master's student in Applied Mathematics specializing in Optimization, and I’m exploring research directions that combine mathematical programming with finance. Recently, while wandering through the library, I came across the book Optimization Methods in Finance by Gérard Cornuéjols and Reha Tütüncü. It captivated me with its focus on how different programming techniques (linear, integer, quadratic, etc.) can be applied to develop financial models.

From my understanding, the book is aimed at audiences in Computational Finance, MBA programs, and master’s courses in Finance. However, I’m particularly interested in exploring the mathematical backbone of these techniques, with a focus on deterministic programming methods rather than stochastic analysis.

To delve deeper, I checked the bibliography of the book and searched Google Scholar for related work. Surprisingly, I struggled to find a dedicated ""niche"" or group of researchers focusing exclusively on this intersection. It seems that relevant work is scattered across journals in Applied Mathematics, Finance, Optimization, and Operations Research.

So, I have a few questions for anyone working in this area or adjacent fields:

1. Why doesn’t mathematical programming in finance seem to have a dedicated niche or society, like stochastic analysis does?


2. Are deterministic programming techniques less useful compared to stochastic methods in finance, or is this a relatively newer area that hasn’t yet gained a strong foothold?


3. Can you recommend journals, conferences, or research groups that focus on applying mathematical programming (not stochastic methods) to financial problems?



I’m keen on developing a research direction that revolves around the mathematics behind such models, and understanding their practical applications. Any guidance, insights, or resources would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

For 3-dimensions, you can interpret as a sequence of matrices extending vertically in the z-directions. Higher dimensions than 3 though would not come so easily for a visual interpretation.

What I mean by this is, when I do the algebra portion of a problem, like let's say an integral was already set up, all the calculus was done, and now it's only 10th grade algebra that's left, there is a 50/50 chance I'll do it right the first time and then another 50/50 chance of me spotting the error (if the solution *feels* really wrong I usually find it, and it's something insane every time). I feel like the really talented math kids who've been doing math rigorously from like age 6 have this down to muscle memory.

To make a comparison to another hobby of mine, I feel like they are really good at writing prose while I'm very good at structuring a story. The issue is, a good structure with poor prose will give you a story no one will read.

I don't know where to go from here. I feel very concentrated while doing the ""hard parts"" of a problem and then my head feels full of cotton while I'm doing basic computations. I make errors that are both ludicrous and invisible to me, for example:

Let's say we have a function f(x) = (x^2)/(x^2-x),

This function is defined if x^2-x ≠ 0

After some basic computing we get the penultimate step:

x ≠ 0

x - 1 ≠ 0

And then I'll write

x ≠ 0
x ≠ **-1**

And I guarantee you I will not spot that error. It will sabotage the entire problem, whatever might come after it, and I won't notice it unless I redo the whole thing again.

I don't know what to do. This is just not good enough, but I don't know how to fix it. I've done probably hundreds and hundreds of practice problems and the same algebra mistakes are ruining me. It has gotten to the point where I never feel confident in my calculations, nor believe I have what it takes to be truly good at math. It's like I lack some mathematical intuition that really talented people have.

I've been feeling rather demotivated because of this, specifically because I can't trust myself and my own ability. If I could at least trust that and only have missing knowledge, I'd be excited to learn. The way things are I just feel useless as a mathematician and I have no plan on how this might be resolved.",zZEpicSniper303Zz,1h6ch6h,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,2024-12-04 09:50:20,8,0.65,8,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6ch6h

math,Triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°,"I would like to share a fun exercise that I came up with.

I was thinking about which points on a square grid have integer distance, and the answer is obviously given by Pythagorean triples, which can be generated by the famous Euclid's formula. Then I wondered: What about a triangular (or hexagonal) grid? There, the possible integer distances are given by the triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°. If the sides are a, b, c, and the 120° angle is between a and b, then they satisfy a² + b² + ab = c² (by the law of cosines).

Then I wondered if I could come up with the analogous of Euclid's formula for this class of triangles, and I found that, if m and n are two integers with m &lt; n, then the triple (a, b, c) where

a = n² - m²

b = 2mn + m²

c = m² + n² + mn

satisfies our condition. Moreover, it is not difficult to prove that if m and n are coprime and not congruent modulo 3, then the triple is primitive (i.e., GCD(a,b,c) = 1). It can also be shown that all primitive triples can be obtained by this formula.

That's it, I just wanted to share this fun little exercise in number theory. I also wonder if this formula already has a name. I am not aware of it, but probably someone knows better than me.

math,Is there any intuition behind results in stochastic processes?,"I'm taking a class on probability theory and stochastic processes. So far I've been able to follow all the technical arguments but I've been uncomfortable because I can't build an intuition on any of the results.

For example the Ito integral is an L2 limit of simple processes using a subsequence argument. Since this integral isn't defined pathwise this integral clearly isn't an area of any kind so I have no idea what the random variable that is the Ito integral even represents. 

Another example is Ito's lemma. Again the quadratic variation means the ""stochastic chain rule"" has an extra term (the second derivative) compared to the ordinary chain rule but is there any intuition why it should be 1/2 the second derivative? You can make some sort of argument using Taylor series but we're able to motivate the ordinary chain rule without resorting to any expansions so this seems like a bit of a stretch. 

Stochastic differential equations are another example. A non-random ODE or PDE clearly describes the rate of change of different functions.

math,How monstrously long papers are made?,"Following the steps of a recent discussion in the community, I have read a Wiki page on the Feit–Thompson theorem. There I found the following:

*The final paper is 255 pages long. &lt;...&gt;*

*Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the proof was its length: before the Feit–Thompson paper, few arguments in group theory were more than a few pages long and most could be read in a day. Once group theorists realized that such long arguments could work, a series of papers that were several hundred pages long started to appear. Some of these dwarfed even the Feit–Thompson paper; the paper by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen D. Smith on quasithin groups was 1,221 pages long.*

How do authors come up with such long proofs? I don't believe there are brilliant insights every few pages. If there were, these gigantic papers would be valued as high as FLT proof, but they are not. I imagine there should be some machinery that produces arguments more or less mechanically, but still,  these arguments are not so standard that they could be just omitted from the paper.

But that's just my guess. If it is true, what does this machinery look like? If it is not, how are behemoth-long proofs actually made?

What I’m interested in is the volume integral of div(x_k A *x* p(*x*)) (where x_k is the kth element of *x*) over all of R^n. My intuition is that, due to the divergence theorem, this integral should be the limit of the surface integral of x_k A *x* p(*x*) • *n* over a boundary increasing in size to infinity. My intuition says, since p(*x*) is a probability distribution, it will decay at infinity, and therefore the integral should be = 0.

math,How can I know my math problem/research is novel?,"I'm now doing math research on a probability theory question I came up with. Note that I'm an undergraduate, and the problem and my approaches aren't that deep.  
First, I googled to see if somebody had already addressed it but found nothing. So I started thinking about it and made some progress. Now I wish to develop the results more and eventually write a paper, but I suddenly began to fear: *what if somebody has already written a paper on this?*

So my question is, as in the title: how can we know if a certain math problem/research is novel?

If the problem is very deep so that it lies on the frontier of mathematical knowledge, the researcher can easily confirm its novelty by checking recent papers or asking experts in the specific field. However, if the problem isn't that deep and isn't a significant puzzle in the landscape of mathematics, it becomes much harder to determine novelty. Experts in the field might not know about it due to its minority. Googling requires the correct terminology, and since possible terminologies are so broad mainly due to various notations, failing to find anything doesn't guarantee the problem is new. Posting the problem online and asking if anyone knows about it can be one approach (which I actually tried on Stack Exchange and got nothing but a few downvotes). But there’s still the possibility that some random guy in 1940s addressed it and published it in a minor journal.

math,Notion of a standardized curvature?,"It’s been a while since I studied this in undergrad so apologies for the lack of rigor and specificity.

When I was in Calc 3, I remember learning about curvature, and I believe it was denoted with “k”. We were taught that a small circle was more curvy, than a larger circle with a larger radius.

I understood at the time, why this was defined as such, **however** I felt like there should also be some notion of curvature that is standardized for the shape of the closed shape.

So that all circles have the same shape regardless of size, but we could still compare the curvature of shapes, i.e. a circle is more curvy than a triangle.

In the same way that Usain Bolt can run really fast for his size, but a Giant 50ft troll running at 30mph would be quite average, if not slow. 

Then, I’m sure we could extend this in higher dimensions, where there would probably different ways to quantify curvature when standardized for the shape of the closed N-d shape.

math,Names for two desired properties of classifcation schemes?,"Hello! Forgive the improper terminology. 

If you are coming up with a system of classifying some set of things, you want the system to be: 

1. Complete, meaning every item in the set falls into one class or category, i.e., there are no items that cannot fit into some category or another, and 

2. Unambiguous, meaning every item falls into one and only one category; no item could be said to fit into more than one category. 

I'm pretty sure there are actual mathematical terms for those two properties, but I don't know what they are. Any wisdom or me?

math,Quaternion double-cover of SO(3),"It’s clear to me why the quaternion rotation formula works. The exps commute through the parallel component, cancelling and leaving it unchanged, but they anticommute with the orthogonal part, each performing a half-rotation. And we use exp because exp of a 90-degree rotation (e.g. all unit pure quaternions) generates all rotations.

What doesn’t make sense to me is how this relates to the double-covering of SO(3) by Spin(3). I understand algebraically that the sign of the quaternion cancels in the rotation formula. I also understand that the theta/2 in the quaternion rotation formula requires you to take a 720deg path around Spin(3) to make a full loop. But I don’t understand what’s really special about a full 720deg walk. So what if we need that to take a loop around Spin(3)? What makes Spin(3) a truer group of rotations than SO(3)? I know it’s the universal cover, but why is that relevant in this case?

And of course, there’s Dirac’s belt trick. I “get” what’s going on there, but I fail to see the significance of it.

math,"In the Yoneda Lemma, in what ways can Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) fail to be naturally isomorphic? How do such failures correspond to failures in C and D being isomorphic?","The paragraph below is from [https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/](https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/) , who posted four years ago in ""Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?"", [https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is\_it\_normal\_to\_be\_struggling\_to\_get\_the\_yoneda/](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is_it_normal_to_be_struggling_to_get_the_yoneda/) . The post is archived, unfortunately, which means I can't discuss it with the original discussants. But the paragraph says exactly what I want to start from. To go further, I want to ask: in what way can Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) fail to be naturally isomorphic, and how do such failures correspond to failure in C and D being isomorphic?

&gt;One way to appreciate the Yoneda lemma is through its corollaries. There's one particular special case which I find particularly enlightening: the Yoneda embedding. The idea is that we can think of an object C as being represented by a hom functor Hom(C,-), i. e. by all its relations to other objects in the category (in the form of arrows from C). Then, an arrow from C to D corresponds exactly to a natural transformation between the corresponding hom functors (this is because the Yoneda embedding is fully faithful, courtesy of the Yoneda lemma). In particular, if Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) are naturally isomorphic then C and D are isomorphic, which essentially justifies the ""it's the arrows that are important"" perspective of category theory. Note that we could just as well look at Hom(-,C) instead of Hom(C,-).

I've never seen this discussed, but is there a concept of ""C and D are isomorphic except for these cases""? Of, as it were, defects or deformations in isomorphism? As a programmer, I find it natural (sorry!) to study such points of failure. If I could do so for Yoneda, I think it would be enlightening. Because it's easy to see how a natural transformation can fail. Some components may not be there. But what kind of damage does that do to the wanna-be isomorphism arrows between C and D?

By the way, I attach a picture of a category with objects C and D in, also X, X', X'', etc. It also shows the functors Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-), with just visible hom-sets indicating their effect on some of the X's, and a natural transformation. Maybe someone can see how to complete it to make the source of C and D's isomorphism obvious.

math,"Looking for references on ""coproduct"" of random variables","I'm trying to find what a concept is called and references to learn more about it. My best guess is to call it a coproduct of random variables, but this leads nowhere.

---

Here's a description (handwaving measure theory to keep things short):

Given two random variables x : Ω → S\_x and y : Ω → S\_y, we can form the joint random variable (x,y) : Ω → S\_x × S\_y by taking (x,y)(ω) = (x(ω), y(ω)). This is a product in the category of random variables over (Ω, Σ, μ). This raises the question: is there a coproduct?

Yes, there is. We can prove its existence using Zorn's lemma or explicitly construct it by taking the coequaliser of the maps x : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y and y : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y, i.e. the random variable x∨y : Ω → E, where E = S\_x ∪ S\_y / ~ and ~ is the smallest relation such that x(ω) ~ y(ω) for all ω.

Another characterisation of this object is that the sub-σ-algebra of Σ induced by (x∨y)^(-1) is the intersection of the sub-σ-algebras induced by x^(-1) and y^(-1).

Some questions:

What is x∨y called in the literature and how is it usually denoted?

Are there references discussing this construction?

math,A simple but powerful map ban format for 2-player random queue games,"I have no idea what the right subreddit for this is but I wanted to share it since I feel like it might be interesting and/or useful.

**For a short description of the problem:** You are hosting a random matchmaking queue for a game where two players face off on one of multiple possible maps. Most players don't want to learn every map, so you offer map bans. But you still want to ensure that any two players will be able to find a map that neither of them has banned. What is a good way to allow your average joe to ban as many maps as possible without making things feel too complicated or too restrictive?

The format that is typically used in games (e.g. AoE2) asymptotes at a map pool size of `2n` maps if each player has to leave `n` maps unbanned.

My previously favourite format asymptotes at `4n` maps for `n` unbanned.

This new format that I just found asymptotes at `n²/2` maps for `n` unbanned.

I think the theoretical limit (Fano plane anyone) is somewhere between `n²/2` and `n²` but it seems way too unwieldy and restrictive to make that into a user-friendly system.

**So here's my new system:**

1. Arrange the available maps into a grid of `x*y` maps, where `x` is odd.
2. Any given player must select one of the `x` columns as their ""home column"". They can't ban any maps in their home column.
3. The player may then ban most of the maps in the other columns, except that every *second* column (starting from the home column and looping around) must have at least one map not banned.

If these rules are followed, three scenarios can happen when attempting to match two random players A and B:

**a)** Both players have selected the same column. In this case, any map from that column can be randomly selected and played (fully random, or prioritizing favourited maps, or something else, we don't need to care).

**b)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an odd column. Then player A has left open one of the maps in player B's home column, so that map can be played.

**c)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an even column. Then player B has left open one of the maps in player A's home column, so that map can be played.

**Example:** There are `5x4` maps in the pool (picture 1).

    A B C D E        - B - D -        - - - - E
    F G H I J        - G - - -        - G - - J
    K L M N O        K L - - -        - - - N O
    P Q R S T        - Q - - -        - - - - T

Player A's bans leave open the maps in picture 2. Player B's bans leave open the maps in picture 3.

Both players have left map **G** open, so map **G** will be played.

**EDIT:** As pointed out by u/mfb- and u/bartekltg, this system comes at the cost of reducing player choice, e.g. a grid of size `5x3` only gives the player `5*3*3=45` ways to leave 5 maps open, while a basic system with 9 maps and 4 independent bans offers `(9 choose 4) = 126` options.

By a different metric, however, grid sizes of `2k-1*k; n=2k-1` and `2k+1*k; n=2k` (with `n` maps left open) are optimal:

*There are* `n-1` *arbitrary bans; that is, for any set of* `n-1` *desired bans, a ban configuration banning all of them exists.*

**Proof:** Let `B` be a set of `n-1` desired bans. Since there are more than half as many rows as desired bans, at most one column can consist only of desired bans.

Case 1: No fully undesired column. Since there are more than `n-1` columns, at least one column remains without a desired ban. This column can be the home column, and by the case assumption, all other desired bans can be dodged.

Case 2: Exactly 1 fully undesired column. This uses up k desired bans, and the undesired column can be fully dodged by half of the other possible home columns. So in the `2k-1*k` case, there are `k-1` columns and `k-2` desired bans remaining, whereas in the `2k+1*k` case, there are `k` columns and `k-1` desired bans remaining. By pigeonhole, we can designate a home column with no desired bans from this set, and once again dodge all other desired bans.",Iwer_Sonsch,1h3dze9,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,2024-11-30 14:43:19,52,0.92,52,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h3dze9

math,Inductive definition of a set.,"I am a computer science student and have studied basic discrete maths, including set theory. I was pacing across some questions when I came across this one. It seems like the standard way of defining a set inductively. A basis clause stating that certain elements are in the set, and an inductive clause which states that if x is in the set, y is also in the set. 

  
Now the problem that I have with this definition is that for many objects, it does not specify if they are in the set or not (which are not taken into account in both of the clauses). For example in this question, I cannot tell if b is in L or not. According to me, a good definition of a set should be able to define for every object in the universe of discourse, that it belongs to the set or not. The answer here, also completely depends on this assumption. My question is, am I missing something in the way sets are defined inductively, or the question is just vague and poorly framed, or the inductive definition of sets is incomplete and there are better ways to define a set?

I'd be happy to provide any clarifications in my post. TY

math,How to check if one set in R3 is contained in another?,"Hi everyone,

I'm working on a problem involving subsets of R3 and I'm trying to figure out how to determine if one set is contained inside another. The first set is defined by a polynomial inequality, defining a closed volume. The second one involves a functional inequality with one real positive parameter. I've tried numerical methods (using integrals) and visualization, and it seems to be the case that the first set is contained into the second.

Has anyone tackled problems like this before or can suggest an effective approach? Any thoughts on a more rigorous analytical argument would be very helpful.

math,Displaying a musical piece as an attractor,"Hello! I'm currently working on a project that has to do with the fractal dimensions of Baroque music (specifically looking at Bach's fugue in BMV 565). Something that seems really interesting to me is the idea that pieces can be portrayed as strange attractors, apparently discussed in the book *Fractals in Music* by Charles Madden (which unfortunately I can't seem to find).

It seems like the attractors were presented by having the x-axis measuring the value of each note *n* and the y-axis being *n*\-1, then connecting between points according to time. I've added a reference image below. I was wondering if anyone here knows a way in which I could make something similar. Thank you so much in advance!

math,"Roadmap for Studying Homological Mirror Symmetry: References, History, and Key Concepts. ","Hello, everyone!

I am a mathematics student with interests in Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and theoretical aspects of Physics. Recently, I’ve been exploring Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS), and I’m fascinated by its deep connections to Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, and String Theory.

I would like to ask for guidance on the following:

1. Roadmap: What is a good progression of topics or prerequisites to study before diving into HMS? For example, how much familiarity with Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, or Category Theory is required?


2. References: Could you recommend foundational textbooks, lecture notes, or papers that introduce HMS in an accessible way? Are there any must-read works by Kontsevich or others to understand the origins and formalism of the conjecture?


3. History: I’m interested in the development of HMS. How did it emerge historically from Mirror Symmetry in Physics, and what are the most significant milestones in its mathematical formulation?


4. Applications and Extensions: Where is HMS actively being applied or extended in current research? Are there particular areas or open problems that are especially exciting?



I’d love to hear from those who have studied or worked with HMS. Any advice or insights into this beautiful theory would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions.

math,Alternatives to Billingsley's textbook,"My goal is to cover enough measure theory that will enable me to study and understand the following 

1. Math stats graduate books like that written by Jun Shao or Keener or Bing Li.

2. Stochastic calculus books (say the one by Oksendal or the one by Shreeve and Karatzas)

FWIW, I am working towards a career in quantitative research and these are supposed to be useful (perhaps necessary).

I have studied and worked through Rudin's PMA, Topology by Mendelson, Strang's linalg book, and have worked through most of Hogg and McKean's math stats book.

For measure theory, I have glanced at (1) Capinski and Kopp's book (2) Rene Schilling's book and (3) David William's book. They don't seem as dense as Billingsley's book. But many people seem to opine that Billingsley is a must read. 

I hope this is not a redundant post. I did google search for alternatives to Billingsley's book but could not find it. All I found was a plethora of book recommendations but not specifically as an alternative to Billingsley's book. Hence this post.

So I am requesting for a book that coveres as much or more as that of Billingsley's book, is not dense, and it would be a great plus if it has a solutions manual as I am doing self study.

I'm currently taking courses such as Ring Theory, Lebesgue Integration and Complex Analysis. On paper, it seems as if I have enough 'ability' to do well in mathematics - I'm the typical, did fairly well in olympiads and high school, and found math easy person.

Despite this, I'm finding it very difficult to crack into the top 10% of my cohort. It feels as if no matter how hard I study, some people just pick up material faster and have a better and deeper understanding. I just feel like I'm not smart enough. I also feel like my exam performance doesn't really reflect my ability - I tend to get very nervous and anxious and fumble hard in exams. I really do enjoy my subject and am considering further graduate study, and feel that my exam performance is going to close doors. I find this sad because I feel that exams aren't really that important in terms of real math understanding.

Does anyone have any tips, apart from just do a lot of math, that can point me in the direction of becoming really really good at math and math exams. I'm starting to feel like graduate study may not be something for me, and it's quite disheartening.

Is it possible to mathematically formalize the concept of one system ""understanding"" another? If so, are there any studies or theories that have explored this topic? I would be grateful if you could point me to any relevant work or ideas.

This question stems from the following motivations:

* By formalizing ""understanding"" between systems, I aim to identify subsets such as ""natural language"" and ""mathematical language,"" with the ultimate goal of exploring the limits of human intelligence.
* I believe that by turning the concept of ""understanding"" inward, we may gain insights into the possibility of understanding consciousness itself.
* Ideally, such a formalization would be applicable to human brains or intelligence in a relatively straightforward manner.

More specifically, I am interested in topics such as:

* Mathematical studies on ""understanding"" or ""correspondence"" between systems.
* Applications of information theory, model theory, or type theory to this concept.
* Research on abstract definitions of ""understanding"" in cognitive science or artificial intelligence.

math,I’ve been reading Max Tegmark’s book “Our Mathematical Universe” which argues convincingly that we’re living in some vast mathematical structure that somehow acts as a real-life model of itself…,"This seems to render the much-reviled simulation argument moot, because it’s like we drop all pretence that it was ever anything other than a simulation in the first place. 

But anyway my question: what structure could it be?

For this I think we have to call in the model theorists.

From my limited understanding of the subject, perhaps we’re looking for a countable structure (or maybe with the cardinal it the reals?) which is homogeneous, saturated - perhaps some kind of Fraïssé limit which also has a universal interpretability quality?

A countable structure able to interpret any other countable structure, and perhaps with additional saturation properties, would be nice - bonus points if it’s locally finite. 

If one framed a rigorous definition, it seems possible that there are many structures with these properties, and one could then reasonably ask for the simplest or most easily defined. Maybe the rational numbers fit the bill, which would be almost as Delphic and useless as 42 being the answer to everything. 

So… is there a model theorist in the house?",Factory__Lad,1gzs82t,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gzs82t/ive_been_reading_max_tegmarks_book_our/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gzs82t/ive_been_reading_max_tegmarks_book_our/,2024-11-25 19:59:51,0,0.35,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gzs82t

I'm an undergraduate senior in math. I just finished reading through Pierre Samuel's Algebraic Theory of Numbers, and now I want to learn the basics of adeles and ideles.

math,I think the formal definition of a limit in Walter Rudin’s Real Analysis text has an unexpected consequence,"This is the second of two definitions of a limit given in Walter Rudin’s *Principles of Mathematical Analysis,” which I understand to be a reliable reference text for analysis. The first definition comes before the introduction of the extended real numbers and, crucially, requires that the point A at which the limit is taken be a limit point of the domain. To cut to the chase I think this second definition allows for the following:

&gt; Let f: E = (0, 4) -&gt; R be defined by f(x)=x. Then f(t) approaches 4 as t -&gt; 5.

Given a neighborhood U of 4 in the codomain, U contains an open interval (4-e, 4+e) for some e&gt;0.
Now let us define a neighborhood of 5 in R which need not be a subset of the domain E. Let V = (4 - e, 5 + e).

We have thus met the required conditions for V: 
- V \cap E is nonempty; the intersection is (4-e, 4).
- On this intersection, we have 4-e &lt; f(t) &lt; 4+e, that is to say f(t) is in U, for every t in V \cap E

Is this an intentional consequence? If so I am curious to hear any perspective that might contextualize this property in a broader or more general topological framing.

Is it unintuitive but nevertheless appropriate because of the nature of the extended reals?

Or is it a typo of some kind that is resolved in other texts?

Or am I misunderstanding something?

math,Is there a bigger picture behind all the different operator norms on Hilbert spaces?,"One way to think of L\^p spaces is that it measures the decay of a function at infinite and its behavior at singularities. As p gets bigger singularities get worse but decay at infinity gets better. 

I noticed the operators on Hilbert spaces have a very similar definition to L\^p spaces and measurable functions. For example the equivalent of an L\^1 norm for operators is the trace class norm, the equivalent of the L\^2 norm is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, and the equivalent of the L\^infinity norm is the operator norm. Is this a coincidence or is there some big picture behind these operator norms similar to the L\^p space idea I gave above? What are these norms tell us about the operator as p increases?

Also while we're talking about this, do we still have the restriction that p &gt;= 1 for these norms like in L\^p spaces? If so why? What about for negative p? Can they have a sort of dual space interpretation like Sobolev spaces of negative index do?",If_and_only_if_math,1gyct46,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gyct46/is_there_a_bigger_picture_behind_all_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gyct46/is_there_a_bigger_picture_behind_all_the/,2024-11-23 23:20:20,93,0.94,93,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gyct46

math,Direction of the polygonal curve in the Schwarz-Christoffel integral,"https://preview.redd.it/0dm82t09bx2e1.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdbd72cb9b6b8fd5eb23eea96b32f3e3edd7e181

I am reading section 4.2 of Stein and Shakarchi's *Complex Analysis*, where the Schwarz-Christoffel integral is defined as in the image, where A1&lt;...&lt;An and all the beta's are in (0,1) and their sum is &lt;=2. The powers are defined using the branch of log which is defined everywhere except the nonpositive imaginary axis. We define a\_k=S(A\_k) for all k and define a\_∞=S(∞).

In the proof that this integral maps the upper-half plane into the polygon with vertices a1,...,a\_n,a\_∞, they note that S′(x) is real and positive when x&gt;A\_n.

I believe this should mean that when x travels from A\_n to ∞, S(x) should travel in a straight line parallel to the real axis, from left to right. Hence a\_n should be directly left of a\_∞.

However, the image shows what the textbook has drawn.

In the picture, when Σβk=2, a\_1 is to the left of a\_∞ which is to the left of a\_n. But it seems to me this should all be the other way around.

Even worse is the case when Σβk&lt;2, when the line between a\_∞ and a\_n is not even horizontal.

As well, a\_∞ is depicted as being at the top of the shape in these images, but I believe it should really be at the bottom (ie: it should have a smaller imaginary component). Since the line between a\_{n−1} and a\_n is at angle −πβn with the real axis, hence it ""points"" downwards, so a\_{n-1} is above a\_n.

So from my understanding, the polygon should have a flat bottom between points a\_n and a\_∞, where a\_n is to the left of a\_∞. And the rest of the points should be put counterclockwise around the polygon. But this is not what the picture in Stein and Shakarchi depicts, so I'm wondering if I have done something wrong.

Please let me know if my understanding is correct or if I have made a mistake somewhere.

math,"Strange Feature of the Finite Projective Plane PG(2,3)","I was playing with finite projective planes and stumbled across a phenomenon that surprised me. I've thought about it a bit, but cannot explain why it should be so.

Consider PG(2,3), the two-dimensional finite projective plane over GF(3). If we assign a numerical label to each of the thirteen points in the space then we can describe each line in the space by which points it contains. Each line contains four points, so each line can be written as a 4-tuple. So, we can characterize the thirteen lines in PG(2,3) as a 13x4 array. One example of doing so might be (taken from the La Jolla Covering Repository Tables):

|Point A|Point B|Point C|Point D|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3|5|11|
|3|4|6|12|
|4|5|7|13|
|1|5|6|8|
|2|6|7|9|
|3|7|8|10|
|4|8|9|11|
|5|9|10|12|
|6|10|11|13|
|1|7|11|12|
|2|8|12|13|
|1|3|9|13|
|1|2|4|10|

Since these labels are arbitrary, we can permute them however we want and get an equivalent description of the space.

I wondered, is there some permutation of these labels that is ""nice"" in the sense that the row sums of the corresponding array representation of the space are all equal? I've convinced myself that the answer is ""no"", but it looks like something stronger is true.

Clearly, permuting the labels won't affect the *mean* of the row sums of the array. What is surprising (to me anyway), is the fact that permuting the labels also won't affect the *variance* of the row sums of the array. No matter how you shuffle the labels, the variance of the row sums is always 42.

For example, in the array above, the row sums are \[21, 25, 29, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 31, 35, 26, 17\].

If we swap all of the 1s and 13s, however, the row sums are \[21, 25, 17, 32, 24, 28, 32, 36, 28, 43, 23, 26, 29\]

These are different multisets (notice, for example, that the second has a 43 as an element but the first does not), but both have a variance of 42.

What's going on here? It seems clear that there's something about the underlying symmetry of PG(2,3) that's is causing this, but I can't for the life of me see what could be causing the variance of the row sums to be invariant when permuting the point labels.",shdgctbei,1gy94bn,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,2024-11-23 20:33:09,18,0.92,18,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gy94bn

My question is, how is this behaviour reflected in/predicted by the Lie algebra su(2) (i.e. R\^3 with cross product)?

math,Struggling with Discrete Math Teaching Methods at My College—Is This Normal?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently taking a Discrete Math course at my college, and I’m finding the way it’s taught incredibly frustrating and borderline incomprehensible. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar or has advice for dealing with it.

Here’s what’s happening: the materials we’re given—lecture notes and problem sets—are filled with references to other questions, sentences, or formulas scattered across 400+ pages. For example, I’ll be trying to follow a proof, and it’ll say something like “According to question 28c” or “As per sentence 1.24 and question 14k.”

The problem is, I’m expected to use these earlier questions or sentences to understand the current proof, but I’m struggling to keep track of where everything is or how it all connects. If I didn’t understand question 28c, how am I supposed to use it to build a new proof? It feels like I’m being asked to construct something complex without being given a proper foundation.

I’ve talked to friends who study at other colleges, and their Discrete Math courses seem much more straightforward. They get proofs written out step-by-step in a clear way, without having to constantly refer to random questions or pages. Meanwhile, my course feels like a maze of scattered information, and it’s making me doubt my abilities.

I understand that math requires rigor and effort, but this approach feels unnecessarily convoluted. I don’t know if it’s meant to encourage independence or what, but it’s honestly just overwhelming and frustrating.

Does anyone else’s school teach Discrete Math like this? How do you deal with such a fragmented way of learning? Are there any resources or strategies you’d recommend for surviving this kind of course?

Thanks for reading—I’d really appreciate any advice or insight.

math,Is Lowenheim-Skolem just an artifact of the formalism?,"
People here, and on various math blogs,  love to point out the existence of countable models of ZFC. Seems like at least once a week, and this is stated like it has profound implications. Conclusions like ""uncountable sets are an illusion,"" ""God could count the reals,"" or ""we might live in a model where every set is countable"" are common.

But Cantor's argument shows, in a very generic way, whenever we conceive of a collection and its subcollections, there can be no one-to-one correspondence between them. The proof doesn't rely on any controversial axioms of a specific set theory. It's a basic consequence of a very general idea.

And sure, when formally studying models of a first-order set theory, some are countable from the metatheory. It's like making maps of the world. On any given map, South America will be larger than Europe, because it's larger in real life so we make maps that reflect that fact. But South America on one map might be smaller than Europe on a different map (because the whole map is smaller).

But *so what?* Why would you compare objects across models like that? It's common for diagonal arguments to relativize in this way. The halting problem: a Turing machine can't decide it's own halting, but there's always an oracle machine that can. Or the second incompleteness theorem: a theory can't prove itself consistent, but there's always a stronger theory that can.

Yet no one ever says ""incompleteness is an illusion"" or ""we might live in a model where every problem is decidable."" The fundamental ideas are reflected *within each level*, and comparisons across levels don't seem particularly important.

In physics, we encounter ""artifacts of the formalism"" sometimes. Like tachyons in special relativity, closed timelike curves in general relativity, or zero-point energy in quantum fields. Extra stuff that shows up in the math but generally isn't thought to be physically relevant.

Can we say the same about *mathematical* phenomena sometimes? Lowenheim-Skolem seems like a pretty good candidate. While the core idea behind |P(N)| &gt; |N| is reflected (in some form) in each of the models of the set theories we use, the existence of countable models feels like a technical limitation of formal systems, similar to the various paradoxes that ensue when you have to use logic to talk about logic. 

Thoughts? I'm sure there are some formalists here who disagree.

math,Could the decentralized web transform math research as Terry imagined?,"**Background**

* Terry Tao launched a project for decentralized math research where anyone can contribute a piece of progress to a math problem. See his [blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/).
* Bluesky, a social media platform, is building a protocol for decentralized communication. User's data, including content and followers, is reachable from multiple interfaces. If a user does not like the policy of a platform interface, it can move to another one with her followers and content. See their [blog post](https://bsky.social/about/faq).

**Ambition.** Bluesky aims to let anyone use their decentralized protocol and build new platforms, with a genuine access to all users content and data. Researchers and entrepreneurs may innovate interaction mechanisms, beyond for-profit prediction AI that aims to manipulate people and waste their time for advertisement.

**Discussion**

* If we took the stance of Terry Tao, and started to think of collaborative mechanisms for a new kind of math research, Would the new aspired wave of decentralized internet take place?

math,"Calculus I : Textbook-based online class or ""Growth Mindset"" method in-person class?","I will be taking Calculus I next semester, but I am not too sure on which class to register for. 

The online course is taught online synchronous with the use of James Stewart's book 2nd edition, chapter 1-5. We would be using Knewton for exams and homeworks. As I see it, it is a self-taught course as the lecture and notes will be taken directly from the book, and Knewton is an adaptive-learning program so it won't move to the next topic until you have ""mastered"" the previous one. And the professor is just there for guidance and input

The in-person course focuses on learning calculus through actively engaging; we do calc together as teams and individually. It will also use a lot of visualization concepts through graphs. The textbook is the openstax Calc Volume I, and the course is designed with the 'growth mindset' method which means a weird structure of learning targets, WebWork assignments, PLTL sessions (also in the online course though) and some more stuff like 'carnival days (?) which are remedial days. From what I understand, the class is more hands-on and tries to make it fun while the online is more """"serious""""

math,When to start this Coin Flipping Game over?,"I was thinking about the following problem. Take a game where you have a fixed number of flips f and a prerequisite number of heads h you need to win.

You can start the game anew whenever you like, your headcount get's reset and you get the same number of flips again.

The goal is to win the game as soon as possible so in the least amount of total flips. When is the probability to win the ongoing game low enough that you expect to win earlier by restarting and forfitting the flips you already did.

Let's say it's 100 Flips and you need 80 heads to win. I'd wager that if you flipped 30 times and got only 15 heads you're better off to start over, since getting 75/80 heads is too unlikely and you may hope for a better Start.

I tried some calculations, but my stochastic is very rusty. I though about this in the context of speedrunning a RNG heavy game, when is the run so bad, that you shouldn't waste your time playing it out - I thought this coin flipping game breaks this down to the most basic case?

math,"Examples where ""taking a step backwards"" is helpful","For a project I'm looking for examples in math where it's useful to ""take a step backwards.""

Computation example: the distributive law $a(b+c) = ab + ac$, which we can interpret as a pair of rewrite rules. If we assume that distributing $a(b+c)$ -&gt; $ab + ac$ is the forward direction [1], then factoring is running the distributive law backwards. Factoring is obviously incredibly useful, e.g. in finding closed forms for (convergent) geometric series, or finding roots to polynomials.

Proof-based example: [sometimes it's easier to prove a stronger statement than a weaker statement.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1007256/examples-where-it-is-easier-to-prove-more-than-less) Considering statements / theorems as vertices in a directed graph, where a forward [2] edge from A to B means ""A implies B"", deciding to prove a stronger statement is taking a step backwards in this graph. 

What are some more examples of ""taking a step backwards?"" Computational / algebraic tricks would be the most helpful for the project, but all examples are welcome.

[1] Justification of distribution being the forward direction: computationally speaking, it's easier to match patterns of the form $a(b+c)$ modulo associativity and commutativity than patterns of the form $ab + ac$. Anecdotally, students usually can easily identify situations where they can distribute, but it's harder for them to identify situations where they can factor.

I'm asking just because I'm currently applying for undergrad, and a lot of the colleges have why us questions, and my honest answer is that it will give me the freedom to choose better schools for grad school than I otherwise could have, but generally people say that your answer should be specific to the college, and looking up stuff about individual school's math programs, there doesn't seem to be that much difference to write about.

math,Pursuing master in Applied statistics in 2025? Need advices as international student,"Hey everyone,

I’m an international student considering pursuing a Master’s in Applied Statistics to break into the analytics field. The challenge is that my background isn’t in math or STEM (I studied International Business), so I’d need about 2 years to study Calculus 1-3 and Linear Algebra just to meet the prerequisites.

I’m drawn to analytics because of the opportunities in fields like data science, finance, and tech, but I’m questioning whether this is the best path for someone in my position. Some programs seem highly technical, and I’m wondering if the effort and time would be worth it in the long run.

A few questions I’d love advice on:
	1.	Is a Master’s in Statistics a good way to pivot into analytics, or should I consider other degrees (e.g., Data Science, Business Analytics)?
	2.	Would spending 2+ years preparing for the program and then 2 years in the program itself be worth the time and money investment?
	3.	Are there any alternative ways to break into analytics in the U.S without committing to a full master’s program?

Probably you have heard of the Interesting number paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting\_number\_paradox) which states that every integer is in some way ""interesting"".

So I started digging for the smallest uninteresting integer. First I looked for facts on Wikipedia. On [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_(number)) of numbers, the 2040 seems to be the smallest integer, that is not listed.

So on the search for properties of the 2040, I went to the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org) and found almost every number I was interested in, was somewhere in their database. So I wrote a small python script that searched the OEIS for numbers, to find the smallest integer that is not on there.

It is the 20067. Of course I was not the first one to discover this. Googleing the number, I came across [this blog post](https://benwiederhake.github.io/oeis-funfacts/) by Ben Wiederhake with fun facts about the OEIS, including the 20067.

I am willing to accept that being the smallest integer not in the database of the OEIS *is* in itself an interesting fact about the 20067. Even though the number is not actually that boring. For example it's semi-prime!

So the second smallest integer not in the OEIS is the 20990. I haven't found anything interesting about it so far.

\- It's factorization is  2 \* 5 \* 2099  
\- It is unhappy  
\- It is deficient

I haven't got any good ideas on how to discover interesting properties about numbers. So far I've got just by going through online databases and now I'm a bit stuck. Almost went out to make some sort of crazy piece of art with the 20990 in it...

Maybe someone here got an idea on how to study a number for it's hidden special properties. I'd be very grateful for any help, thank you in advance! :)

math,Determinant trick,"In Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, he uses what he calls the ""determinant trick"" to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.   He does this by working with matrices with elements from a subring A' of endomorphisms A\^n-&gt;A\^n corresponding to ""multiplication-by-ring-element"".  This allows actions by a homomorphism \\phi in A\^n to be treated as multiplication in the ring A'\[\\phi\].  Then he multiplies the matrix \\phi\*I\_n-N, where N is the matrix of the homomorphism with respect to a basis of the free module (regarded as having elements in A'\[\\phi\]) by the adjoint matrix to conclude that the determinant is zero in A'\[\\phi\] and hence, the characteristic polynomial applied to \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] (or N, remembering that multiplication by \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] corresponds to action by \\phi, and working with the chosen basis in A\^n) is also zero, because the map

\\Psi:A\[x\]\\to A'\[\\phi\], x \\mapsto \\phi

commutes with det(as a function on A'\[\\phi\] valued matrices) and det(as a function on A\[x\] valued matrices).

It seems to rescue the bogus proof of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (substituting N\*I\_n into x\*I\_n in x\*I\_n-N) by turning the unwieldy application of the characteristic polynomial to a matrix into the nicer application of the characteristic polynomial to a single element in the ring A'\[\\phi\].

This argument seems to be applicable in general to finitely-generated modules, and is used by Atiyah and MacDonald in the proof of Proposition 2.4.

Could somebody check if my understanding (after two hours of pondering yesterday and another two hours just now) is correct?

While I took courses that I absolutely loved like Abstract Algebra and Probability Theory (even Multivariable Calc was taught so theoretically that I loved every second of it), the math major wasn't the most rigorous and I didn't even take Real Analysis. I'm so embarrassed to admit that, because it's so fundamental. Nevertheless, I graduated with an A- average and did a math thesis in Fluid Dynamics.

I've then got my PhD in mathematical biology. While I was technically in a biology department, my dissertation and my research is all about graph theory. I've come up with a new construction in graph theory and proved theorems in research (not always perfectly, and I second guess myself so much it's impossible to get to the finish line efficiently). My PhD research group wasn't the most uplifting environment; my advisor was increasingly absent over the years, and while we have a good relationship and I respect him a lot, I always had the sinking feeling that he didn't respect me as much as other members in the group. When I look back at what I learned, I can see that I have managed to accumulate a real expertise in my area. However, compared to what I want to be able to do as a mathematical researcher, there are so many other fields I want to know (expand into geometry &amp; topology), as well as some basic areas I need to get more solid in (e.g. real analysis, measure theory). And I have had my spirit crushed by my advisor more than once.

I've just started an applied math postdoc, which I feel has been going well, but I can't help but still feel doubtful of my skills and frustrated that I don't get things quicker. I have to get papers out, but I also want to learn more fields of math. I have genuine passion for math and honestly have felt happier in the few months of my postdoc than I ever did during the entirety of my PhD, but I feel like the stress and burnout has been getting to me over the last few days.

What is the probability that M has all of its eigenvalues in F, as a function of q and n?

I am curious because, fixing n, as q increases, this seems to “converge” to some value, namely,

n=2 -&gt; ~.45
n=3 -&gt; ~.13
n=4 -&gt; ~.03

As n increases, I would expect to get less eigenvalues in F (the degree of the characteristic polynomial increases, so the probability that 1 solution lies outside of F increases). Similarly, as q increases, I would expect to get more eigenvalues (there are more ways to solve the eigenproblem). 

However, I wouldn’t necessarily expect this value to converge as q increases.

Something like proving the square root of 2 is irrational, that the harmonic series diverges, or that there are infinitely many primes. Along with those 3 examples, here are some I really enjoy:

1.Define a binary string to be “special” if it cannot be written as the concatenation of  several identical smaller binary strings. How many special strings of length n are there?

2. Show that a triangle’s circumradius is at least twice its inradius.

3. How many sequences of 2n correctly matched brackets are there (ie for any prefix of the sequence, there is always at least as many opening brackets as there are closing brackets)? How many are there if we start with some valid sequence of a opening brackets and b&lt;=a&lt;=n closing brackets?

4. What is the derivative if x^x ? What is the integral of ln(x)?

5. There are n people at a Christmas party, each of whom brought a gift. How many ways are there to distribute the gifts such that nobody gets their own gift? Call this a “correct” distribution. Given a random distribution of gifts, what is the probability that it is correct as n grows large?

6. Consider a town composed of 4 islands. There are two bridges connected islands 1 and 2, two bridges connecting islands 2 and 3, and a bridge from island 4 to each of islands 1, 2 and 3. Does there exist a route that crosses each bridge exactly once?

math,Is Topology too difficult for me right now?,"For context, I'm a high school student doing self-study. After learning some basic discrete math and introducing myself to proofs, I felt ambitious enough to tackle Munkres' Topology. It was a massive jump in abstraction at first, but eventually I got over it and gained some momentum. That all broke down once I got to the section on the generalized product topology and onwards; I could barely comprehend what was going on with those sections, and the exercises were hell to get through (I'm not even sure my solutions are correct). Come today, the section on the quotient topology is going smoothly -- the proofs are proofing, the geometric intuition is intuitioning, etc. Until I get to the exercises. I sat there for hours trying to crack the 2nd one, which I only managed after finding an online solution to peak at. I'm currently struggling with the 3rd one under similar circumstances.

Is it possible that I just came into this without the necessary preparation?

math,Is there a version of Vector Calculus that works in all dimensions? Why isn't it taught instead of Vector Calculus?,"Hey y'all,

Over the past few months I've had this growing... frustration(?) with Vector Calculus as it's usually taught in a Calculus 3 course, and I'm coming here because I kind of want to spill my thoughts about it in the hopes that someone else understands why I'm feeling this way and can offer some guidance.

(Also, just to be clear, I'm not posting this because I struggled with vector calculus or thought it was ""too hard,"" I honestly found it to be just fine)

I think most of my frustration stems from the fact that vector calculus is an exclusively 3-dimensional theory. The definitions of surface integrals and curl, as they're given in a typical course, only make sense in 3D, and this bothers me, because it feels to me like there shouldn't be anything ""special"" about 3D, right? Any R\^n can be treated as a vector space, so why was a theory of calculus created in such a way that it only works in R\^3? As an example of what I'm talking about, the fact that we represent the curl of a vector field as another vector field seems kind of like a ""coincidence,"" if that makes sense? Because it's been mentioned on numerous occasions that curl in other dimensions requires a different number of parameters (in 2D, curl only requires 1 parameter, and in 4D, it requires 6) and it just so happens that, in 3D, curl is described in 3 parameters. 

Is there a theory that serves the same purpose as vector calculus but that doesn't have this shortcoming? If there is, why is Vector Calculus so ubiquitous? I would love to live in a world where, for example, E&amp;M and Maxwell's Equations were taught using some other theory that's less reliant on 3D coincidences.

math,Are complex eigenvectors for nonconjugate eigenvalues orthogonal?,"For a complex eigenvalue conjugate pair, their eigenvectors will not be orthogonal. This is because if v = a + bi (a and b are vectors) and u = a - bi, then v · u = (a + bi) · (a - bi) = a · a + b · b, which is clearly non-zero since we established v and u are complex and thus have nonzero b.

(EDIT: Apparently, I was using an alternate inner product for complex numbers than most mathematicians would use. So apparently a + bi and a - bi can be orthogonal according to other inner products. Thanks u/lucy_tatterhood! Also, I meant to write I was only considering real-valued matrices.)

But what I'm wondering is for nonconjugate eigenvalues, are their corresponding eigenvectors orthogonal? For example, with the matrix:

A =  
\[0 1 0 0  
\-1 0 0 0  
0 0 0 -1  
0 0 1 0\]

nonconjuate eigenvalues do have orthogonal eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are (-i, 1, 0, 0), (i, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, i, 1), (0, 0, -i, 1), and we can see orthogonality with the nonpairs. But that could be do to how I structured this matrix. Afterall, this matrix was skew symmetric. Though I've tested with a non skew-symmetric matrix like

B =  
\[√3/2 -1/2 0 0  
1/2 √3/2 0 0  
0 0 √2/2 -√2/2  
0 0 √2/2 √2/2\]

and a similar result happened. But maybe I'm getting these orthogonal eigenvectors because my matrix has 0s separating the dimensions. But maybe because every rotation can be broken down into rotation of orthogonal planes, this result with nonconjugate eigenvalues eigenvectors being orthogonal will keep happening? I'm not sure.

The reason I've been thinking about orthogonal eigenvectors is I realized recently that ALL eigenvectors being orthogonal for distinct eigenvalues implies real eigenvalues (due to conjugate eigenvalues implying nonorthogonality, as shown earlier, meaning we can't have complex eigenvalues), which then by the Spectral Theorem implies a symmetric matrix. So I'm trying to learn more on what my idea of partial orthogonal eigenvectors (orthogonal for nonconjugate pairs) implies in terms of the matrix structure.

math,State Machine as a Binary Matrix?,"I'm a CS nerd, but I know enough about linear algebra to know that anything can be represented as a vector if you're brave enough. 

I want to make a hyper-condensed model of a Boolean logical circuit, using a series of 0 1 matrix operations to transform the inputs. 

While I've been able to find one explanation about binary matrices being used as logic gates and another about automata being mappable to a polynomial matrix, I'm having trouble figuring out how to bridge that to map automata onto a boolean matrix.  And with Google being what it is nowadays, even finding those two was hard enough on its own.

Does anyone know how I'd be able to map a finite state machine onto a binary matrix? Or a series thereof?


EDIT: For example, a Set-Reset latch would be modeled as the stateful expressions `Q_n=!(R_n+Q'_(n-1))` and `Q'_n=!(S_n+Q_(n-1))`, where S and R are inputs, but I can't seem to get myself to understand how to translate that to a binary vector or matrix.

Ideally, I would like to be able to repeatedly multiply the transformed vector and the matrix to continue ""ticking"" the circuit. 

Even if we deviate from linear algebra to another mechanism for deriving meaning from a set of numbers, I'd love to hear it. My current option is essentially 32^({layers of abstraction}) times larger per single binary value, which I just feel is wasteful.


EDIT 2: So when looking back at this, I realized that I'd basically need a matrix with one degree for every wire. And since most circuits don't have anything to do with each other, I'd end up with a hundred thousand wasted zeros.

It might be better to do a combination of a tree and a matrix then, using the tree to narrow down the required inputs and then the matrix to actually perform the computation.

math,Is there a geometric relationship between certain points and lines in barycentric coordinates?,"I've been playing around with barycentric coordinates recently, and a question came up that I couldn't find an answer to.

Suppose we are working with barycentric coordinates with respect to an arbitrary triangle. Given a triple of numbers (a_1, a_2, a_3) such that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ≠ 0, we have a point (a_1 : a_2 : a_3) in barycentric coordinates. Also, if a_1, a_2, and a_3 are not all equal, we have a line consisting of points (x_1 : x_2 : x_3) such that a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0.

Does anyone know if there is any geometric relationship between a point and corresponding line defined this way? If we go up to higher dimensions, does this geometric relationship still hold between a point is its corresponding hyperplane?

As an example of the type of thing I mean by a geometric relationship, if we were instead working in cartesian coordinates, we have that the vector from the origin to (a_1, a_2, a_3) is normal to the plane defined by a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0. This relationship gives us a way to go between a plane and corresponding point (up to a scaling factor) without going through the coordinate system.",Best_Measurement_496,1gtkt2o,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gtkt2o/is_there_a_geometric_relationship_between_certain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gtkt2o/is_there_a_geometric_relationship_between_certain/,2024-11-17 19:00:21,1,1.0,1,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gtkt2o

I ran into this theorem that I just can't believe I haven't heard before.  If a global maximum lies between any two zeros of a polynomial function, it will lie on the greatest interval between *x*\-intercepts.  Is this true?

So for example, the function *f*(*x*) = -*x*^(4) \+ *x*^(3) \+ 20*x*.  Without graphing, we know that *f* has a global maximum between *x* = 0 and *x* = 5 *because* the *x*\-interval \[0, 5\] is greater length than the interval \[-4, 0\].

Obviously I can draw a continuous function where this is not true, but perhaps that is not a polynomial.  What is the proof here?  It is just for certain polynomials?

Now, I of course took a complex analysis course in my undergrad and so I am familiar with standard Cauchy-Gorsaut, Jordan’s Lemma, and Residue methods. These all work for the standard meromorphic functions that one sees in a course like that.

But what about functions such that the set of singularities has cluster points or perhaps contains a continuum? A simple example would be something like

f(z)=(e^(1/z)-1)^(-1) or

g(z)=tan(1/z)

Neither of these are meromorphic as z=0 is both singular and a cluster point of other singularities. Now, I actually don’t know any minimal conditions for complex integrability like one might have in the theory of Riemann or Lebesgue integration.

math,"Why are estimated ""centers"" sometimes bimodal?","For a project I'm working on, I've been trying to find the most central point in each country, which I defined as the point inside the country that has the smallest mean distance to all other points in the country (I believe this is equivalent to the centroid if the shape is contiguous and convex, but the centroid can lie outside the country, whereas this point can't). I couldn't calculate this directly, so I estimated it with a Monte Carlo method as follows:

1. Generate 1000 points in the shape randomly according to a uniform distribution
2. Find the point that has the lowest average distance to all the other points, take that as the central point
3. Repeat 200 times
4. Take the average of the 200 central points

Much to my surprise, some countries (like Slovenia) had a unimodal distribution, while others (like North Macedonia) had a bimodal distribution.

To make sure this wasn't a mistake in my code, I tried it again with a different number of points in each trial (step 1). The distribution of central points oscillates between unimodal and bimodal as the number of points increases. I then ran the same algorithm on an ellipse in the plane, and this time, the distribution was sometimes unimodal, sometimes bimodal, and once even trimodal.

So, does anyone know what's going on? Why would the centroid of a series of randomly generated points not just converge unimodally to the actual centroid?

This is amazing to me, that the zeta function can capture the behavior of holomorphic functions arbitrarily well. It makes me think, are there just not that many holomorphic functions?

I love math but there’s so freaking much math and not enough time to get good at it. My semester classes are fast paced and confusing.

I’m able to do the problems but I don’t have the feeling I’m understanding anything. The class in taking rn is basically Calc III + an intro to analysis class where all kinds go different concepts are mixing together and I feel that don’t have time to deeply understand how these things relate or why they do. Linear algebra was a prerequisite for this class and so was regular calc iii and we’re doing a section on differential geometry and its mixing concepts from both in a way I’m not comfortable with. On top of that, my professor, who I’m sure is brilliant at their research, gets so caught up and excited in what they’re teaching that they’re extending it to topics beyond the scope of the course and expecting us to understand how it relates to many things. Physics, for example, isn’t a prerequisite for this class, but no we’re talking about relativity. The math makes some sense but I feel wildly unprepared.

math,"Typo in R. Milner's 1975: ""PROCESSES: A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF COMPUTING AGENTS""","**I will try to give as much context as possible to enable as many people as possible to answer but it is likely that only people with knowledge in denotational semantics and/or process algebra will be able to answer this question.**

Milner defines a process as a member of the Scott domain

`P = V -&gt; LxVxP` (1)

with `V` the domain of values, `L` the domain of locations and `P` the domain of processes. A domain of functions from values to a triplet &lt;location, value, process&gt;. Intuitively, it means that a process will receive a value and produce a location, a value and a new process (its continuation).

Let `w_1` and `w_2` be values and `s=pw_1` and `t=p'w_2`. From the previous definition (1), `s` and `t` are triplets so that each value in the triplet have the following types:

`(s)_1 : L, (s)_2 : V, (s)_3 : P`

Same goes for `t`

We say that a process returns a result when its continuation contains the special member `l` of `L`  
When defining parallel composition of processes `p` and `p'` receiving a pair of values `&lt;w1, w2&gt;`, Milner states that the rough idea is that if either `p` or `p'` reached a result, reduce the other one and return the pairing of the two results. If none is completed, ask an oracle to pick which process to reduce"".

I thus expected a definition of the type :

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) := 
    
    if ((s)_1=l) {
      // since p is complete, we sequentially compose p' with the result of p 
      (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2 
    } else if ((t)_1 = l) {
      // since p' is complete, we sequentially compose p with the result of p'
      (p * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1
    } else {
      // we ask an oracle to decide to reduce either p or p'
    }

using the notation of the paper for conditionals, we should get 

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) = 
    ((s)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2,
    ((t)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1,
    oracle_decision

math,Maximum Number of Near Orthogonal Unit Vectors in a High Dimensional Space,"Suppose we have a set V of k unit vectors in an n-dimensional space, where k &gt;&gt; n and both are large (at least on the order of hundreds in this case). All k vectors are mutually near orthogonal: -ϵ &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ with i ≠ j and 0 &lt; ϵ &lt; 1.

The goal is to find a function of n and ϵ that yields the maximum possible k.

From [this stackexchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4680506/what-definition-of-nearly-orthogonal-would-result-in-in-a-10-000-dimensional), we get: n ≥ C \* ln(k) / ϵ^(2), where C is a constant currently accepted 8 (ignore what the post says about C - assuming [the proof on page 6/7 of this](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/OBDA_spring16/material/random_projections.pdf) holds, 8 is the best available right now). Further, from that equation we move things around to get the desired k ≤ exp(n \* ϵ^(2) / C).

So problem solved right? Well, maybe. That post gets the equation from [this response](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/24864/almost-orthogonal-vectors/24873#24873) which was to essentially the same question. That response was written by Bill Johnson, who in turn references the [Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) for which he is a namesake.

So problem definitely solved, surely?! After all, one of the creators of the lemma themselves directly answered this question. The problem is: if you read about the lemma on wikipedia or the various other available sources, it becomes increasingly confusing how one is supposed to make the jump from the equation being used by the lemma as a condition for the existence of a linear map to the same equation being used to get a lower bound on the dimension size n needed to allow for k near-orthogonal vectors. Specifically, the lemma shows that V can be reduced in dimension from some N to some lower n so long as the equation holds, where the n is the same as used above in the equation but now V is of R^(N) instead of R^(n). **So, how was this jump made?**

Further, I could find no information on how this equation was derived in that form, which is a problem: I am looking for a generalization of this equation with -ϵ1 &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ2, both ϵ1 &amp; ϵ2 being between 0 and 1 but not necessarily the same value.",OblivionPhase,1gpyz8k,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,2024-11-12 23:37:48,30,0.83,30,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpyz8k
math,The Sandwich Problem (Open Discussion),"Suppose you have a square sandwich of area 1 with an infinitely thin crust along the edges. You remove a constant area from the sandwich such that it has area 1 at t = 0 and area 0 at exactly t = 1. This area can be removed in any way you'd please so long as dA/dt = -1. For example, you could remove it in an expanding strip from one side of the square to the other, two strips from both sides converging to the centre, an expanding circle centred at the middle of the square, etc. 

The method by which you choose to remove the area is called strategy S and can be as complex or as simple as you'd like.

Let P^(S)(t) be the crust-less perimeter of the sandwich at time t when using strategy S. That is, the total perimeter of the shape subtracted by the perimeter with crust on it at time t when using strategy S. 

Find the strategy S that minimizes the value of the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of P^(S)(t) with respect to t.



Some examples:

The integral has value 1 for the strategy where you remove an expanding strip from one side.

The integral has a value 2 for the strategy where you remove two expanding strips from opposite sides that converge in the centre.



From a bit of discussion with my friends, we've found that a good way to start is removing an expanding quarter circle from one of the corners, but it's unclear how to proceed once the quarter circle is inscribed within the square.

math,How Does an Infinite Number of Removable Discontinuities Affect the Area Under a Curve?,"Hey everyone! I am currently redoing Calculus 2 to prepare for Multivariable Calculus, going over some topics my lecturer did not cover this past semester. Right now, I am watching Professor Leonard’s [lecture ](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=V9z1wMUcNE_L9REs)on improper integrals and I am at the section on removable discontinuities [1:49:06](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=TWEzTwTz3diLYk88&amp;t=6546).

He explains that removable discontinuities or rather ""holes"" in a curve do not affect the area under the curve. His reasoning is that because a hole is essentially a single point and a single point has a width of zero, it contributes zero to the area. In other words, we can ""plug"" the hole with a point and it will not impact the area under the curve. This I understood because he once touched on it in some of his previous video, I forgot which one it was.

But I started wondering what if a curve had removable discontinuities all over it, with the holes getting closer and closer together until the distance between them approaches zero? Intuitively to me it seems like these ""holes"" would create a gap. But the confusion for me started when I used his reasoning that point each individual point contributes zero area, therefore the sum of all the areas under these ""holes"" is zero? 

If the sum is zero then how do they create a gap like I intuitively thought? or they do not?

How do I think about the area under a curve when it has an infinite number of removable discontinuities?

math, Why does the Lebesgue Integral not require countably many partitions? ,"Originally posted on r/learnmath but I thought it would be better suited here.

I'm working my way through Axler's Measure, Integration and Real Analysis. In Chapter 3A, Axler defines the Lebesgue Integral of *f* as the supremum of all Lower Lebesgue Sums, which are in turn defined as the sum over each set in a **finite** *S*\-partition of the domain *P*, where the inside of the sum is the outer measure of the set multiplied by the infimum of the value of *f* on that set.

My question is, why is it sufficient that *P* is a finite partition and not a countably infinite one?

In Chapter 2A, Axler defines the Outer Measure over a set *A* is as the infimum of all sums of the lengths of **countably** many open intervals that cover the set *A*. I'm confused as to why the Lebesgue Integral is defined using a finite partition whereas the Outer Measure uses countably many intervals.

math,"Which Of These Probabilities Is The Important One To Know? (Bayesian Belief Networks, Probability)","Hello Friends,

I am teaching a class on Bayesian belief networks and relevant sampling techniques. I've always found this to be a pretty dry subject compared to others that we study, so to make it more fun I designed a video game to play with the concept. In brief, you are a paranormal investigator trying to determine if visiting aliens are hostile or friendly. To do this, you have a relatively complex (15 nodes and about 25 edges) BBN, and the first part of the game is to query the BBN to get a sense of when the aliens tend to visit the town. The second part is an investigation where you interview people who claim to have seen the aliens and describe their behavior as friendly or hostile. Your job is, using the insights you gained from the first step, to determine if the eye-witness report is credible or dubious, and your judgment on the aliens if determined by a majority vote, ie did most credible witnesses describe them as hostile or friendly?

**My question is about defining credibility. I have two possible answers to this:**

**A witness is credible iff P(Aliens|evidence) &gt; P(Aliens)** \- or in other words, the posterior probability given their account of events is greater than the prior probability of alien visitation.

  
**OR**

**A witness is credible iff P(evidence|Aliens) &gt; P(evidence|\~Aliens)** \- relating the probability of their account to aliens being present or not being present.

These two conditions are clearly related by Bayes rule:

P(A|evidence) = P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/P(evidence) = 

P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/(P(evidence|Aliens)\*P(Aliens)+P(evidence|\~Aliens)\*P(\~Aliens))

All the terms are there and related to each other, but it need not be the case that if one condition is met then the other is necessarily met.

One assumption about this is that we are trusting the evidence the NPC is giving us, but we doubt their claim that they actually saw the aliens. That assumption is fine for me. We also are not evaluating the probability that someone saw aliens given that they say they saw aliens, and that is also fine with me.

What do you think? Or could there be another way we can evaluate credibility?

(Tangent) The game in its more simple form (without the interview mechanic) was a real hit last year, really transforming one of the most boring lectures into one of the most fun ones. The students also learned a lot because they get to actually see and explore things that they previously only heard about - like we say rejection samplers are wasteful because most of their samples are not used. Ok, how many samples are wasted? We say Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers are extremely expensive compared to other approaches - ok, how long do they take to run on a graph like this? With algorithms like these, getting to actually explore them and see them at scale is key, and I think that actually using these objects and algorithms does a lot for learning.",ProdigiousMike,1gpccdv,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,2024-11-12 04:13:49,13,0.79,13,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpccdv

I started my Master's not long ago, and I'm mainly interested in algebra (I really enjoyed the courses in Galois theory and commutative algebra).

Does every topic in algebra (which relates to Field theory) uses a lot of calculations? I don't really enjoy that type of proofs (I remember taking a seminar in number theory, where the theorems where really interesting, but the proofs were just a bunch of inequalities thrown together, like in Dirichlet's theorem, which I really didn't like)

Is it about creating an ever higher tower of abstraction? Is it about inventing new concepts that make what was once hard to achieve now possible? Is it about discovering unusual interesting properties of mathematical forms we've already created? Or something else...?

Any individual case studies or examples of how you think this process unfolds would be super useful.

math,Curious about forms of solutions for differential equations.,"I'll preface with I don't study differential equations and have at best a scattered understanding of parts of the theory.

When teaching or studying intro DE's, we pretty universally cover the Laplace transform as a method of solving constant coefficient linear IVPs. Some courses will also go over power series solutions to equations with nonconstant coefficients and, if they're lucky, possibly the Method of Frobenius.

Here's what I'm curious about: The motivation and ideas leading to the development of the Laplace transform itself are almost *never* taught. Things like the historical study of various integral forms and the extension of power series to a continuous indexing variable.

**Is there any well-developed study of solutions to DEs where, instead of a power series solution, we look for a solution in the form of an integral transform?**

I tried working out a few possibilities, but it seems to fail for various reasons depending on the form of the differential operator and even the form of the inhomogeneous term. For example, if we take something like a second order operator with polynomial coefficients and some forcing term g,

y''-2xy'+x^(2)y = g(x), y(0)=a, y'(0)=b

we can guess a solution of the form y=&amp;int;_0\^&amp;infin; f(t)x^(t) dt where f is an unknown function. This would be a continuum-indexed analogue of a power series solution. After substituting this into the DE, we can do some simplifying calculations and write the left side as the Laplace transform of some polynomial multiple of f. Using the properties of &amp;Lscr;, we can recast the original DE as a new DE whose solution is the Laplace transform of this unknown function f.

What seems to happen in some surprisingly simple cases is that this simply leads nowhere. It seems to be the case that if the function g is not chosen fairly carefully, then the equation expressing g as a Laplace transform of f simply has no solution. The issue is that the function g(e^(-s)) must tend towards 0 as s approaches &amp;infin; in order to be in the range of &amp;Lscr; and this simply is not the case for many reasonable choices of g.

So what gives? Why is it that a power series solution to the above equation is perfectly viable, but this integral transform solution appears not to be? And is there a better guess for a transform that *will* work? Could we perhaps try something like a ""basis"" of delta functions? I'd really like to know more about this sort of thing if it's out there.",OneMeterWonder,1gog0ff,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,2024-11-11 00:58:53,29,0.87,29,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gog0ff

math,Does Population Modeling Ever Work?,"I'm currently and undergraduate student doing a joint biology-math major. I'm taking my second class on modeling in biology, and it seems like everything we have learned has seemed very pointless. Every discrete model we looked at was just 2 pages of algebra that ended with ""real life testing showed that this model was not satisfactory"" or ""The system either approaches 0 or approaches the carrying capacity defined by these constants"" or ""now that you've done a bunch of algebra and got the eigenvalues you can raise this matrix to an arbitrary power to show that your population will approach infinity"". All the non-discrete models just involve taking the integral and raising e to some power and it somehow works out and gives you a line which it approaches or doesn't approach. Either that or we are just doing poisson distributions with nucleotides instead of other variables. 

Doesn't help that the textbooks we are using are all like 30-40 years old, but this stuff just doesn't seem useful.

math,Looking for Good Math Typing Software,"Due to nerve damage in my hand, it makes it very difficult to grip a pen for extended periods of time. I'm looking to get back into math and eventually go back to uni for a math degree. However, given this problem, and the extreme amount of writing which is required to study math, it's a challenge that I have had difficulty finding a solution for outside of TeX-styled markdown.

Is anyone aware of a more intuitive math typing software which would allow me to to type something like:

2x^2 + 3x + 4

or something similar, and get the equivalent TeX-formatted output in real time so I can study on my computer as opposed to on paper or by typing TeX for each simplification of an equation that I'm performing?

math,Why was the SVD never explained to me like this?,"I'm teaching Linear Algebra for the second time this year. (I teach at a special high school for exceptionally gifted youngsters). This year I committed to getting to the SVD by the end of the semester, and we will be introducing it next week.

As often occurs, I am finding that in needing to find a way to explain things to my students, I've found better ways to explain things to myself. This is the way I plan to arrive at the idea of singular vectors, and I haven't ever quite seen it shown this way before:

Evidently, the ""suggestions"" lead us to see that Av\_i and Av\_j have *remained orthogonal* after transformation by A. We can then re-define the u's to be the resulting orthonormal basis for the column-space of A, and get U \\Sigma = AV. From there, it is easy to show that the sigmas are the squareroots of the eigenvalues of A^(T)A and it all falls into place.

For me, this is *the way* that SVD should be shown to students. Any comments or further suggestions for my approach?

The website had a super easy user interface with wonderful printability. (silly me to not download everything back then)

However, I recently went to the site again but found out that it has been removed by the university he was teaching at with no forwarding address. Does anyone know how can I find that again? Is my only option to contact him on his email and ask him? I just wanted to know if anyone else has ever used the site, or knows what I am talking about?

math,Why should I care about logic?,"I'm a Master's student and would see myself as an algebraist (at least, I'm interested in algebraic number theory, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, that stuff).

Another reason for avoiding logic was mainly due to [Logicomix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix) (a really good graphic novel), whose subtext makes the claim that logicians become mad, and I don't want to get mad.
