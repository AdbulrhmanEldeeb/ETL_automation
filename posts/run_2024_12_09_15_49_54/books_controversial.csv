books,To Paradise-Hanya Yanagihara: Defying history to create a modern masterpiece,"**''We always think that we as individuals are responsible for shaping society. But what if actually society is shaping us?''**

Yanagihara's perception of history in this novel is totally decentered from individuality, an almost living, breathing entity, with her characters (of limited agency) being merely varied along in its wake. After all, To Paradise is a novel about all that history can take away from us: Our freedom, our dignity, our safety, our families, our loved ones (in Charlie's case in the third section of the novel even her literal emotional intelligence and critical thinking ability). But one thing it can not, argues Yanagihara: A series of certain fundemental desires too elemental to what humans are to simply be stamped out of humanity, no matter the society one may live in or how totalitarian a state may be: The desire to love, to be loved, to find affection, beauty and many more. And that has been proven true by human history for century after century, and hopefully will keep doing so. The three sections of the novel are seperated from one another by a century each. 100 years, no more, no less. The active years of the American experiment. The characters of the three sections who all share their first and last names, may be related, maybe not, may be echoes of one another, perhaps a remark about history repeating (or not) itself. Perhaps not. What is certain is that Yanagihara argues (and rightfully so) is that the idea of constant, almost perpetual progress, which is one of the main promises of modernity, is fundamentally non-compatible to the concept of history, and that periods of regression are inevitable. However, if she thinks regression is how it will all end, she doesn't say.

**Book 1-Washington Square:**

Drawing inspiration from Henry James' novel of the same name, Yanagihara twists (the old as time) concept of a marriage story to both to create a version of it which (defying the genre's standards) is not about a gendered association with money, but also the perfect opportunity for her to lay down American history, remove its puritanist, relegious spine, and set up what will be the start of her incredibly detailed reimagining of American history. Also, lots of interesting ideas about paradise actually being one's entitlement to making their own decisions about their own lives, no matter how foolish they may turn out to be. In the center of it all is a gripping story.

**Book 2-Lipo-Wao-Nahele:**

Divided into two sections. The first one dealing with AIDS crisis and the disctively human force (perphaps instict) which is present at every crisis and which drives us to keep on cling to life, to keep on fighting for the hapiness of us and our loved ones. I consider it worth mentioning that in this section, for the first time in any of her books, Yanagihara argues that this process may not be totally futile (I mean, no shit, but she really seems to belive that is the case on everything else she has ever written. Also, no matter how much she doesn't seem to embrace it, optimism suits her real well.). The second one is about the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, the impossibility of returning to state before colanization or contact, but also the enduring romance of it. I would say that the whole movement as well as the general feeling of an irreristible pull of a culture which you have never actually experienced and yet you mourn for all the time are approached with great compassion by Yanagihara.

**Book 3-Zone Eight:**

In a future that feels like a total regression in every sense of the word, driven by plauges and led by a totalitarian state, takes place the third and final section of the novel, narrated by two fundementally tragic characters, Charles and Charle. Charles is a tragic figure because he experienced a scientist's worst nightmare: He became one to contribute to society, to help people, but in a word where alutruism is no longer, appreciated or rewarded he seems to be punished for it. His discoveries and ideas are used to hurt people in the most morally dispicable ways, just for him to become hated by his own family for that, to end up trapped in a system to which's creation he once contributed thinking he was doing the right thing and to even lose his own lose (this is not a spoiler by the way). But what really makes him a tragic figure, is the fact that he experienced true hapiness, even for a relatively short amount of time, just to have it taken away from him without him being to blame, gradually, slowly, painfully, and have him live his remaining years mourning for its loss. Charlie on the other hand has never experienced something even remotely similiar to happiness and also lacks any prospect of ever doing so. And this is fundamentally tragic for a human being.

All in all, I can certainly say I'm in awe of both this wonderful and ambitious novel as well as Yanagihara as a writer. Both her ideas and prose are intruging and fabulous to me. Maybe the pacing of the novel is a bit off at times, but other than that I had no complaint about what this novel that I consider a masterwork and one of my favorite reads of the year. I have actually finished it for a month now but these 30 days or so were absolutely necessary for me to wrap my mind around the novel's scale and to properly articulate some of my thought and feelings on it (yup, this is just the tip of the iceberg).

books,I finished Wuthering Heights and am very confused,"I don't understand why this book is held in such high regard. All of the characters are so unrealistic. The elder Catherine and Heathcliff are so emotionally volatile it's ridiculous, the younger Cathy and Linton are also unstable and unsympathetic. I feel bad for everyone, but the main characters are so cruel to each other it's hard to care about anyone. 

Heathcliff is just a monster with no redeeming qualities. His behavior is inexcusable. And apparently, some see this book as romantic because of Heathcliff and Catherine's obsession with each other. 

This book is so depressing. All of these people's lives are lived in abuse and misery because of Heathcliff. I don't mean that every book has to be happy to be enjoyable, but there's a feeling of pointlessness to all this suffering. I feel like I got nothing out of this book other than a sense of hopelessness. 

I wouldn't say it's valuable commentary on human nature since the characters behave in such extreme ways that it's almost inhuman. 

I know I'm looking at it through a modern lens of everyone being traumatized and thus traumatizing each other and wanting for there to be some sort of redemption or recovery that isn't present. 

This book feels lost or wasted on me. Can someone help me understand it better or appreciate it?",StellaZaFella,1h9mnk6,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mnk6/i_finished_wuthering_heights_and_am_very_confused/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mnk6/i_finished_wuthering_heights_and_am_very_confused/,2024-12-08 16:34:18,0,0.36,0,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9mnk6
books,Maybe it's not all doom and gloom?,"I know there's been a lot of discussion on this subreddit about the downfall of reading. Kids aren't reading anymore. Everyone's attention span is shot. Booktok is ruining the book industry, etc. Media literacy is dead. But is it really that bad? Has the times really changed that much?

1. Kids aren't being assigned books anymore, just sections of books. And that's a shame, right? But I grew up in the 90's. We often didn't read the full assigned reading. There was immense pressure to have a high GPA, be in all honors/AP classes *and* be in like a million clubs and activities to impress college admission boards. We could Cliffnote our way through Crime and Punishment but not calculus and physics so that's where our time went. Some of us had to work jobs. Some of us had to watch our siblings because our parents worked a lot. Some of us just didn't want to. We did read some of it, but it was highly supplemented by Cliffnotes. 

Were there kids who read every single word of every single assigned books? Absolutely. They genuinely enjoyed reading and prioritized it. But was that all of us, or even most of us? No.

I'm old enough that the many of the English department heads are probably about my age. I can totally see them going, ""Let's be honest, we didn't read the whole book when we were their age, they're not going to read it.  Let's just assign them to read the crucial parts so they can understand the themes and the cultural impact."" 

2. Kids, and people, are reading just as much as ever, just not books. I am ***not*** (again, *not*) saying that reading chats, texts, comments, emails, subtitles, etc is anywhere near the same as reading a book. Of course it's not, they are two completely different form of reading. But our lives have gotten *significantly* more text based in a past few decades. For a lot of us, we probably read more than we speak or listen. Maybe the reason we read less is because we just need a break from written words. You know how when you're at a party, it's just nice to go to the bathroom and enjoy a break from all the noise? Maybe we're not getting stupider or less intellectually curious, we just need a break from text.

3. I don't think booktok is ruining the publishing industry, but I do think that the publishing industry figured out they can sell mass market quality books at paperback prices. Low effort books were always around, they were just mostly sold as mass market paperbacks. And while those still exist, I feel like there's far less of it because, thanks to booktok, publishers can sell them at paperback prices. Sure, the ""As Seen on Booktok"" section is taking up space but it's probably taking up the same amount of space the Harlequin romance books would've taken up twenty years ago.

4. Regarding media literacy, thirty years ago, if I had a stupid hot take on a book, the only person hearing about it are my friends, maybe my teacher if it's for school. Now if I have a stupid hot take online, several somebodies all over the world are shaking their head in disbelief. Has the ideas gotten stupider or has it just gotten much easier to get our stupid ideas out there.  There used to be gatekeepers (newspaper and magazine editors) but now anyone can voice their opinions on a public platform.

And speaking of stupid hot takes... Maybe I'm being naive and optimistic. Reading has changed significantly, for sure. I'm just not convinced that we, as a society, have gotten stupider. I do think that reading will become more of a niche hobby, but just because people are reading less books, does that mean that people are learning less? Being exposed to any less ideas? Being immersed in less worlds?",Anxious-Fun8829,1h9r8nx,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9r8nx/maybe_its_not_all_doom_and_gloom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9r8nx/maybe_its_not_all_doom_and_gloom/,2024-12-08 19:56:05,225,0.82,225,0,191,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9r8nx
books,"I like Stephen King's ""Mr. Mercedes"".","I just wanted to read a thriller about a killer whose weapon would be a car. Although the machine is only used at the beginning, I liked the book.

Let's start with the plot. Someone hit a crowd of people at a job fair with a Mercedes a year ago and managed to get away with it. Now the killer is pestering retired police officer Bill Hodges with letters to kill himself. As a result, this motivates Bill to search for the killer. That's how intellectual games begin.

The first half of the book is a game of ""who is smarter"", because what is Bill, what is Mr. Mercedes are trying to outwit each other in different ways.

The second half is ""to make it to ..."", where the characters must manage to prevent a new crime of Mr. Mercedes.

Let's do without spoilers and briefly. The book turned out to be intense, especially towards the end. The author does not hide the identity of the maniac and at the beginning of the book shows who he is and how he thinks (and his name is Brady). In the first half, it was funny to read how Bill pranked the villain by saying that Brady is not the real Mr. Mercedes (and how it bombed him).

About the characters. Bill Hodges is not a very interesting character yet. I don't even have anything to say about him. His friend Jerome is a funny character. Such a cheerful, brave guy who likes to make the reader uncomfortable by jokingly speaking bad English (because he is black). Holly Gibney, a character who later acquires a own cycle, develops well in the second half from a sociophobic and insecure woman into a completely resolute and talkative (at least, talkative with Bill and Jerome).

Brady Hartsfield aka Mr. Mercedes turned out to be simultaneously cartoonishly angry, pathetic and menacing. Like, look, he's a racist, a sociopath, and he's only turned on by his mother. He gets angry when someone is happy. At the same time, he is quite smart, because he hides well under the guise of an ordinary guy, he gets along well with technology, and in the end he cunningly equipped his new weapon. And when something bad happened to him, I was happy with all my heart, because to hell with that asshole.

I like the author's writing style. This is a regular Stephen King text, that is, a lot of information, especially about the characters, which is easy to read. But the scenes where he describes sex are very uncomfortable.

All in all, a good thriller. He's intense, the villain is nasty, the writing style is good. Maybe not the best of this author, but definitely good.",mystery5009,1h9mvlj,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,2024-12-08 16:44:23,68,0.82,68,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h9mvlj

books,"Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy. Yes, it seems you can read a book again for the first time.","I read this book for the first time in high school, which was over 30 years ago.  I remember really liking it but couldn't remember anything about it other than how the book jumped from character to character.  Now that I just finished reading it again, having forgotten nearly all of the details made it like reading it for the first time.

It's a little scary how nothing I read seemed even remotely familiar; I've usually been able to recall a fair amount of details from other books I've read, even ones from way back in childhood.

I highly recommend this one though, for anyone who likes techno-thrillers.  Anyone unfamiliar with the book, it takes place in the 1980s (contemporary to when it was written) and details a conventional war between the Soviet Union and NATO.

books,Rumaan Alam's Entitlement is one of the worst things I have ever read,"I don't know how to describe how bizarre this book was. I was flabbergasted at least once per chapter. The Guardian's review was apt, the [NY Times review](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/books/review/entitlement-rumaan-alam.html) feels like it's full of lies and exagerrations. The reviewer couldn't possibly have thought this was a good book.

I enjoyed Leave the World Behind, I didn't love it, but it was an easy read and I found it thought-provoking. Entitlement feels like he was in a rush and didn't want to lose the book advance. It feels like it's all telling and not showing. The main character feels 2-dimensional and has only 5 people in her life-- she's not fleshed out at all. The elderly billionaire has a similarly narrow characterization-- nothing going on with him besides his wife and his new charity foundation. I think this guy would be a bit busier?

The writing style- which I don't remember being this confusing in LTWB-- is very irritating. He uses sentence fragments constantly, in a staccato pacing, which becomes tiresome. &gt;!And there were a few scenes where the reality of what happened is not made clear-- one in particular where the main character, Brooke, either hits a woman at a coffee shop or imagines she does, and I could not discern what actually happened, or whether this was supposed to be ambiguous on purpose.!&lt;

&gt;!The main problems were that the main character's arc felt so unreal that she just seems to have gone crazy or had a mental breakdown.. that's the only way to describe the sudden turn he character takes. It's sloppy. !&lt;Oh, also nothing really happens in the book. That seems to be the main complaint on Goodreads from the 2- and 3-star reviewers.
