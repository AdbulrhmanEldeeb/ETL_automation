webdev,Full-stack dev looking to go solo - advice needed,"Hey fellow developers! üëã

I'm a technical lead with 5 years of experience building financial software and enterprise applications. I love turning complex business problems into elegant solutions, and I'm looking to branch out on my own.

My stack:

* Backend: Symfony/Laravel (built multiple enterprise apps)
* Frontend: NextJS/React (created dynamic form systems)
* Plus the usual suspects: Docker, AWS, Git, etc.

I'm particularly good at:

* Building smart form systems that adapt based on user input
* Integrating with external APIs and services
* Modernizing legacy systems
* Making complex processes simple and user-friendly

Instead of just looking for regular contract work, I'm interested in:

1. Finding companies whose problems I can solve (and potentially turn solutions into products)
2. Building relationships with businesses that need ongoing development support
3. Creating systems that can be repurposed for similar companies

I've already built a solid Symfony/NextJS starter template to hit the ground running. What I need now is to find the right companies to work with.

For those who've gone solo: How did you find your first real clients? Any specific industries or approaches you'd recommend?

webdev,update on my open-source social media scheduler,"Hi everyone, I built a little bit more into my open-source free scheduler :)

Postiz is an open-source social media scheduling tool that offers scheduling on the following:

Instagram, YouTube, Dribbble, LinkedIn, Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, Threads, X, Slack, Discord, Mastodon and BlueSky.

[https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app)

There are some cool new features:

* Option to add stories to Instagram and tag people for collaboration.
* Customer separation - you can group accounts per customer, and when you schedule, you can filter by customer.
* Option to tag companies on LinkedIn (I wanted to tag people also, but it was not possible)
* Fixes for different social media posts failing.
* **Introducing Plugs!** This is a concept you can find in other tools that can boost your engagement for your current posts. Here are some examples:
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, repost it (to regain visibility to it)
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, add another message to it (all your existing commenters will get a notification)

**What's next:**

* Public API - I have been too lazy to make it, I have to push more :)
* One Inbox - so you can reply to all your messages from one place.
* Google My Business provider
* AI Agents - I am still trying to figure out what to do with it, but it looks interesting.

webdev,I created this all-in-one JSON Toolkit,"This post might come across as a bit self-promotional, but I created this tool for personal use, and some of my colleagues have found it helpful. It's mainly for developers and testers, so I think r/webdev is a good place to share it, and I hope it will be useful to others too.

This tool addresses some pain points I face when developing, debugging, or testing features that involve JSON data.

* I often need to search for each key whenever I get the data, so I built a way to query multiple keys at once.
* It's difficult to remember deep paths to locate my data, so I built a JSON viewer that lets me extract any path by simply clicking on the key.

Some might argue that I should use Postman test scripts or Postgres' `json_extract_path`. But I find these solutions better suited for stable APIs or data. When I‚Äôm developing a new feature or debugging an issue, the target field can pop into my mind at any moment. So I prefer to quickly access the field and the data directly, rather than having to write a Postman script or SQL query.

If you're interested in the tool, here it is: [https://www.devtoolkits.tech/](https://www.devtoolkits.tech/)

webdev,How to get a .org website for a political initiative,"Hi. I want to set up a very simple home page for a website for a political initiative.

I just want a page with basic information and contact details and so forth, really just a holding page for the moment so that I have a website I can add to an email sig.

I tried to buy a domain and make a website through Wix, found it to be a difficult process. If buying a domain and building something myself through Wix is the only route I'll just crack on at it but I was wondering if there's some other way I'm not aware of. I just want something that;

Contains basic information, hyperlinks to relevant resources, contact details etc  
Involves no economic activity, is a .org  
Looks reasonably professional  
Doesn't require that I sign up for anything for more than a year  
Costs $10 a month or less

webdev,"High-level architecture of my point-of-sales app (Vue, IndexedDB, Electron &amp; React Native + Laravel)","I've been building a point-of-sales app that works on iPads, Android devices and Windows systems, and I drew up a high-level architecture diagram to show you.

At the core sits a Vue SPA, that gets wrapped in:

* Electron for Windows/MacOS builds
* React Native for Android and iOS builds

[High-level architecture of our POS app](https://preview.redd.it/n3s58yejau5e1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6912edbafd36ace6bfe35d1c68efeb39de887fbf)

Both the React Native app, and the Electron app have a shared NodeJS component, that allows the SPA to communicate with devices on the network using TCP for example.

This way, our app can communicate with peripherals like thermal printers and payment terminals.

Since React Native doesn't come with a NodeJS runtime, we ship [NodeJS mobile](https://nodejs-mobile.github.io/) with it, and this entire setup allows me to share \~95% of my entire codebase for all platforms.
