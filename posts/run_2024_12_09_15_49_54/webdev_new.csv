webdev,"High-level architecture of my point-of-sales app (Vue, IndexedDB, Electron &amp; React Native + Laravel)","I've been building a point-of-sales app that works on iPads, Android devices and Windows systems, and I drew up a high-level architecture diagram to show you.

At the core sits a Vue SPA, that gets wrapped in:

* Electron for Windows/MacOS builds
* React Native for Android and iOS builds

[High-level architecture of our POS app](https://preview.redd.it/n3s58yejau5e1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6912edbafd36ace6bfe35d1c68efeb39de887fbf)

Both the React Native app, and the Electron app have a shared NodeJS component, that allows the SPA to communicate with devices on the network using TCP for example.

This way, our app can communicate with peripherals like thermal printers and payment terminals.

Since React Native doesn't come with a NodeJS runtime, we ship [NodeJS mobile](https://nodejs-mobile.github.io/) with it, and this entire setup allows me to share \~95% of my entire codebase for all platforms.

webdev,Full-stack dev looking to go solo - advice needed,"Hey fellow developers! üëã

I'm a technical lead with 5 years of experience building financial software and enterprise applications. I love turning complex business problems into elegant solutions, and I'm looking to branch out on my own.

My stack:

* Backend: Symfony/Laravel (built multiple enterprise apps)
* Frontend: NextJS/React (created dynamic form systems)
* Plus the usual suspects: Docker, AWS, Git, etc.

I'm particularly good at:

* Building smart form systems that adapt based on user input
* Integrating with external APIs and services
* Modernizing legacy systems
* Making complex processes simple and user-friendly

Instead of just looking for regular contract work, I'm interested in:

1. Finding companies whose problems I can solve (and potentially turn solutions into products)
2. Building relationships with businesses that need ongoing development support
3. Creating systems that can be repurposed for similar companies

I've already built a solid Symfony/NextJS starter template to hit the ground running. What I need now is to find the right companies to work with.

For those who've gone solo: How did you find your first real clients? Any specific industries or approaches you'd recommend?

webdev,I created this all-in-one JSON Toolkit,"This post might come across as a bit self-promotional, but I created this tool for personal use, and some of my colleagues have found it helpful. It's mainly for developers and testers, so I think r/webdev is a good place to share it, and I hope it will be useful to others too.

This tool addresses some pain points I face when developing, debugging, or testing features that involve JSON data.

* I often need to search for each key whenever I get the data, so I built a way to query multiple keys at once.
* It's difficult to remember deep paths to locate my data, so I built a JSON viewer that lets me extract any path by simply clicking on the key.

Some might argue that I should use Postman test scripts or Postgres' `json_extract_path`. But I find these solutions better suited for stable APIs or data. When I‚Äôm developing a new feature or debugging an issue, the target field can pop into my mind at any moment. So I prefer to quickly access the field and the data directly, rather than having to write a Postman script or SQL query.

webdev,update on my open-source social media scheduler,"Hi everyone, I built a little bit more into my open-source free scheduler :)

Postiz is an open-source social media scheduling tool that offers scheduling on the following:

Instagram, YouTube, Dribbble, LinkedIn, Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, Threads, X, Slack, Discord, Mastodon and BlueSky.

[https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app)

There are some cool new features:

* Option to add stories to Instagram and tag people for collaboration.
* Customer separation - you can group accounts per customer, and when you schedule, you can filter by customer.
* Option to tag companies on LinkedIn (I wanted to tag people also, but it was not possible)
* Fixes for different social media posts failing.
* **Introducing Plugs!** This is a concept you can find in other tools that can boost your engagement for your current posts. Here are some examples:
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, repost it (to regain visibility to it)
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, add another message to it (all your existing commenters will get a notification)

**What's next:**

* Public API - I have been too lazy to make it, I have to push more :)
* One Inbox - so you can reply to all your messages from one place.
* Google My Business provider
* AI Agents - I am still trying to figure out what to do with it, but it looks interesting.

I have been working on a side project - a web framework built on top of Bun that is supposed to feel like Angular, as that's the framework I'm most comfortable with. I have components that update on property changes &amp; I'm building the components out using Google's incremental-dom. I am currently a little stuck on SPA routing and am wondering if anyone has ideas for what libraries might work well for inspiration, or if anyone has tips on how to put together a minimalistic router. I have taken a peek at the Angular repo &amp; routing is insanely complicated - I'm trying to start out small. TIA

webdev,Offering financing to clients,"Own a digital agency and IT consultancy. 

Something I've thought about for a while is offering finance options to clients. For example, if an ecommerce site costs ¬£30,000, they could put down a deposit and spread the cost, say ¬£1000 a month for 36 months (subject to credit check). Clients wouldn't gain ownership of anything until it is paid off entirely.

Another alternative is potentially leasing whereby we include maintenance and hosting but the monthly is indefinite. They'd commit to a minimum time period and keep paying after this to keep the site active or start again and rebuild. 

Changes outside of the agreement would be billed at ""x"" amount extra for the remaining agreement months. 

Could offer this by partnering with a bank/broker potentially. Contracts would have to be watertight. 

Drawback - debts die with the company if it folds unless we enforce a personal guarantee. 

Thoughts?

webdev,Help needed - Embassy Appointment ,"Need help

Hello,
I have been trying to get a germany study visa appointment for the last six months. All the appointments get taken in a few seconds. I have tried everything. I had to defer my semester and now the deadline is going to pass again. 
The problem is that there is a server side limit of 3 seconds before which you can't submit the captcha and appointment form. Considering this limit, the earliest you can submit the form after the appointments are open is 4 seconds (one second to click the appointment slot, open the form and fill it; and 3 seconds wait before the submission). I have many a times clicked the submit button at exactly the 4 second mark, but still no luck . 
I was told that there are some people who have somehow bypassed this limit and they can submit the form and captcha from the client side before the 3 second limit. They book all the appointments. 
I don't know if this is true. But if someone can confirm this or help me, i would be eternally grateful.

I try my best to help where I can, but I just don't have the desire to overstep beyond my commitment.

webdev,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6sm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:46,3,1.0,3,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9l6sm

webdev,Do you know where i can find a solid Full Stack Pre-built Chat App? (next.js &amp; shadcn),"Hey everyone!
I‚Äôm working on a chat app built with Next.js/Supabase/Shadcn (Tailwind + Radix), and currently, the UI is built from scratch, using Supabase (with their websocket). 
It works, but I‚Äôm looking for something more solid in terms of both backend and frontend (logic and UI)

‚ÄîFRONTEND‚Äî
I‚Äôm searching for a library or package that:
- Provides a ready-to-use and robust UI for a chat app (paid options are totally fine).
- Handles common behaviors efficiently, like:
1. Fetching older messages while keeping the scroll position intact
2. Auto-scroll to the bottom when a new message arrives
3. Maybe even built-in gestures or animations to improve the UX.
- It's highly customizable, similar to shadcn: I want to copy/paste components into my project and have the freedom to tweak them directly, rather than being tied to a rigid external library.

‚ÄîBACKEND‚Äî
If it's already related to the package/library it would be great, otherwise if you have any valid alternative to the Supabase architecture with their websocket please let me know

Do you have any recommendations or experience with something like this?

webdev,Consulting on a web dev niche technology vs overall web dev services?,"Hi all,

I am in the process of spinning up my own consulting / development shop and I am stumped on one thing and I would appreciate some advice from the group...

Should I focus my consultancy on the niche technology that I know very well (MyNicheTechConsulting.com) and only do work in that tech / framework, or should I broaden out to do whatever people need and will pay me for?

There is a part of me that thinks that focusing on the niche will pay off down the road, and that doing overall tech consulting will find me building wordpress sites for people, competing against every other firm on the planet.

That said, I hate to leave money on the table and if a potential customer needs X, Y, or Z I should be willing to provide X, Y, and Z.

I am asking this question mostly in the context of what services do I list that I offer on my website. I CAN do X, Z, or Z but part of me thinks 'marketing specialization"" on the website would pay off in the long term.

webdev,Tracking order section in a wordpress website ? ,"I am creating a website using WordPress. Basically as for now, the website is free and I am also using WooCommerce in the website. I am not a web developer. I don't have much knowledge. I am just building a website through WordPress and WooCommerce with the basic knowledge im getting through tutorials from here and there.

So my question is that I want to add a tracking service to my website. I am not sure of which delivery service will be used later. The question is that if I add a tracking order section into my website and the section includes the customer to add a tracking ID or whatever tracking data that the user enters, is it supposed to lead to the delivery service's own platform on which they can track the order? Is there any coding or plugins involved in such a thing if I want to include it into my website?
Or how does this whole process of creating such a tracking section goes on about? Any help would be really appreciated since I have zero knowledge about web development as a whole. :)

webdev,"Help! P2P Video Call App with React, Express, and Socket.io - Remote Stream Not Working","Hi all,

I'm building a P2P video call app using React, Express, and Socket.io. I've gone through several articles and tutorials, and I believe my setup is close to working, but I'm running into an issue. Everything seems to be functioning well, but I'm not receiving the remote video stream. There are no errors in the console, but the remote video doesn't display.

# Setup:

* **React** on the frontend for UI and WebRTC implementation.
* **Express** and **SocketIO** on the backend to handle signaling and peer connections.
* **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication (using STUN server for ICE).

# Logs:

From the server logs, I see that the peer IDs are being set successfully, and messages are being passed between peers.

Logs from Server: 

    [2024-12-08T08:34:19.378Z] Received message of type 'setPeerId' from Ub0_7yT_57X6Ngd7AAAS

    [2024-12-08T08:34:23.419Z] Received message of type 'candidate' from two_2x42mksyr6v

As you can see, the peers are getting connected correctly, but the remote video stream isn't showing up on the client-side.

# Steps I've Tried:

* Ensured that the remote video element is being updated with the incoming stream.
* Checked that the RTC connection is correctly handling the tracks.
* Verified that the signaling messages (offer, answer, and candidates) are being sent and received properly.

# My Question:

Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this issue? Why isn‚Äôt the remote video stream displaying, and what could I be missing in the WebRTC setup?

Any help is appreciated!

webdev,Framework for desktop-like approach to developing web applications?,"I'm an engineer in a classical sense, I work with signal processing equipment, system integration, and also implement and manage corporate infrastructure. I'm not a web developer by trade, and¬†*have no such aspirations*. I do however occasionally write specialized utilities for the business.

I wish to ask for a very specific thing. I would like a framework that would allow me to develop applications that will display in a web browser, developed in a desktop application manner, meaning not like traditional web development with separation of front-end and backend, separated by an API. I would like my application code to be monolithic and application be ""rendered"" on the server. In other words,¬†**I do not wish to (read: must not) write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, that should be handled by the framework.

**I found one such example:**

[**Webswing Demo**](https://prototype.webswing.org/webswing-demo/)

This is pretty much perfect, I'm very proficient in Java and Swing. But. My company will likely not adopt Java, and Java runtime.

**Are there other examples of this type of framework? How about something for scripting languages, like Python or PHP? Is there something like this for .NET?**

I have a much better chance of adopting something if the webserver prerequisites come from official RHEL packages repos (CentOS/Rocky/Alma). My company avoids 3rd-party stuff for security reasons.

webdev,Suggestions for developing a simple interactable line graph front end for an econometric model,"Hi I'm a total noob when it comes to web dev but I'm pretty technically savvy and can devote time to self teach. I have an econometrics model which I developed in R that queries Google Trends at a daily interval and then produces an output value using this data. I want to build a simple attractive web front end to display the output of this model in a line graph, that has some basic interactivity (change timespan, zoom in / out, mouse over line to see data value etc.). 

My needs aren't very esoteric / complex, so the simplest tool for the job would be great. What is the best way to do this for someone who is a bit of a web dev noob? I've looked at streamlit and shiny but I'm not sure if these would be the right tools for the job. The model is not very computationally expensive so can run on basically anything and requires very little storage. It would be a bonus if I could run it in some sort of containerisation system like Docker for portability. I'd appreciate any help!

Talking about this site of mine, the contents of the blog posts: [https://bryanhogan.com/blog](https://bryanhogan.com/blog)

I know that there are some optimizations that I could do to improve readability, but do people actually notice that? Like:  

- Reduce font weight - Often white text on black background has a perceived stronger font weight than black text on a white background.
- Allow for a light and dark mode toggle. (Dark and light mode toggle definitely would help some people, but how many, is it worth the time implementing it?)
- Reduce brightness of text - Text too bright on a dark background may be harder to read.

Do you think these changes could actually help here?

* I‚Äôve worked with static and dynamic site generators like Astro.js, Gatsby, and Next.js.
* I‚Äôve built single- and a few-page websites before but nothing too big yet.

# What I‚Äôm Thinking

* **Content Type:** The site will have lots of equations (thinking LaTeX in Markdown for simplicity and readability) and visual content like graphs and images.
* **Speed:** Priority is speed, especially when loading pages.
* **Approach:** Considering Astro.js for a fully static site to keep things fast, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions.

# Questions:

1. Is LaTeX rendered in Markdown a good approach for displaying equations? Any better options?
2. For images and graphs, what‚Äôs the most efficient way to handle them while keeping performance in mind (e.g., CDN, image formats like WebP)?
3. Should I consider other frameworks or approaches besides Astro.js for this use case?

Would love any advice or insights from people who‚Äôve worked on similar projects!

Thanks in advance!

webdev,Looking for feedback! - Making (grant) expense tracking less painful,"**LINK:** [**https://grantkeeper.com/**](https://grantkeeper.com/)

Hey everyone üëã

After struggling with spreadsheets and scattered receipts while reporting to funders (mainly Innovate UK), I built GrantKeeper - a simple tool to help UK organisations manage their grant expenses and reporting.

It lets you:

* Upload and organize receipts/invoices
* Automated data extraction
* Track expenses and automatically handle currency conversion
* Export Excel with all your data and files
* Collaborate with team members on financial reporting

**Screenshots**: [https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png](https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png) / [https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png](https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png)

I've already worked with others receiving grants and it's turned a task which typically takes weeks into hours (and I want to make it better!)

I'm curious how others currently handle their expense tracking? Are you using spreadsheets, accounting software, or some other solution? Have you tried other specialised tools, and if so, what was your experience?

I know similar stuff exists, but in this case I've decided to start by targeting a niche before thinking about expanding it for more general use cases.

webdev,Feedback wanted,"Hey everyone! 

I‚Äôve been working on a fun project called [whothatpokemon.com](https://whothatpokemon.com) which is just a browser based game inspired by the iconic ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs That Pok√©mon?‚Äù challenge. I mainly built it as I'm looking to eventually teach others how to code and wanted a project that can be enjoyable to build. I know this has been done before in this community and I've added my own sort of twist to it. You can compete against friends online to see who can guess the most correctly. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes (currently limited to 1 on 1 matches).

I‚Äôd love to get your feedback on any of these areas:

* Gameplay: Is it fun and engaging? Is it too easy? I let my cousin who is a Pok√©mon fanatic a try and had to take the phone away from him because he was guessing them all too easily lol.
* Design: I tried to keep this area as cleaned up as possible but I'm also not a designer so it was a bit hard to be creative in this aspect.
* Features: What could make it better or more exciting?
* Bugs: If you run into anything that's not supposed to happen, please let me know. It also hasn't had any users yet since this is the first time mentioning it, so I was hoping this could be some sort of stress test as well.

  
I‚Äôm open to any ideas to improve the game or even expand on it (like leaderboards, new modes, or generation specific challenges).

If you do have some spare time please check it out, and let me know what you think. I‚Äôd really appreciate your input as I work on making it better.

Let's start with Chat GPT and other chat bots that are separated from local data, is the code produced by these bots yours or theirs? Who owns the copyright? If it's theirs can you make enough changes to now own the code?

When it comes to AI integrated into an editor like VS Code, it says in on the VS Code website that your data (i.e your code) will be sent to Microsoft for them to feed into their model. I guess they have to do that to make it work at all, but again what is going on with copyright and security here? Do Microsoft now have access to your entire codebase, API tokens etc and do you have full ownership of the code it helps you write? This seems like a huge level of trust for a commercial non-partner operation to agree to, not to mention obvious security issues.

Are there any local AI models used by code editors that don't send your code to the likes of Microsoft?

This runs flawlessly for a few hours after which the Google Calendar API that fetches all events from the calendar starts returning 0 events even though I have existing events on the calendar. As a result, older tasks don't get deleted from the calendar and I now have more than 20 duplicates of each task on my calendar.

Weirdly enough, if I delete the calendar and create a new one and pass the new calendar ID it again starts working flawlessly. This lasts for a few hours after which the same thing starts happening again. The Google Calendar API starts returning 0 events even though there are existing events. 

I am at my wit's end. Anyone else ever encountered this?

webdev,Meet CSSformalize: Simplify Your Form Styling Workflow,"Hi¬†[r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)!

Styling HTML forms can often feel like navigating a minefield. Achieving consistency across various states‚Äîsuch as active or focus‚Äîrequires meticulous attention to detail. It's all too easy to miss a crucial style or struggle with the myriad of browser-specific prefixes like -webkit- or -moz-. This complexity can turn what should be a straightforward task into a tedious chore. Recognizing these challenges, I was motivated to create a solution that streamlines the entire process.

Thus, CSSformalize was born‚Äîa comprehensive open-source CSS framework designed to transform the way native HTML forms are styled. By leveraging CSSformalize, developers can effortlessly generate elegant and consistent form elements. This framework eliminates the need to memorize complex styles or write repetitive CSS code, offering a much-needed shortcut for both seasoned developers and newcomers alike.

webdev,Node or Springboot,"Hi Guys,

I'm thinking of adding a backend for my portfolio website (this is HTML and CSS only). My goal is to have a blog in my portfolio site.

Others said that use the tech stack that you already know. Well I know Angular 17 and Spring Boot for creating side projects.

Then others also said that it is overkill if I use a framework or library (React or Angular) for a simple website with backend (portfolio)

And also, I want to become a Java developer so I searched that most of job postings for Java position need to have knowledge on (HTML, CSS, JS/TS) or (React or Angular).

So what would you recommend?

1. Create the portfolio with vanilla js and node then all the side projects will be React/Angular and Spring boot.
2. Create all side projects with the tech stack Angular/React with Spring boot.


My purpose is to demonstrate or show to interviewer that I am knowledegeable on fundamentals of HTML CSS and JS when I show to them my portfolio.

webdev,Advice for building an app with Cloud Sync?,"Hey everyone,

I'm eyeing a project with Cloud Sync functionality as my next side project. I believe I have the skillset for most of the things the project needs except Cloud Sync, which I have never done before. I have done some googling and collected some articles covering different approaches but I would also like to ask what your recommendations would be for implementing this? 

Here is the project outline:

* Basically, the project will allow users to have an account and store a bunch of data the user enters in their client. This data is synced to all their devices, i e mobile apps and web clients where they have logged into their account.

* You cannot edit data from multiple clients at the same time in real time, but rather work from one client at a time. 

* Users don't have to be able to collaborate on editing the same data, rather each user has their own private data. A future addition might enable other users to see your data, but it's not required for now, and changes don't have to become visible to other users in real time.

* A central server and database keeps track of the data, enables login/auth etc. Probably gonna write this in PHP (Laravel) and postgres unless you tell me this is a bad idea.
* Data is viewed in a mobile app client and stored in a local SQLite database as well for scenarios when they don't have internet. If the user edits data offline, it will be synced the next time they come online. In the future, a web client will be added as well. Will write this in React / React Native because my strongest skillset is in Typescript / React.

* If the user opens another client than the one they're currently on, the current one will disable data entry in favor of the new one (user will be asked if they want to switch) so that they can't try to change the same data from multiple clients at the same time. The only way I have pushed events from a server to clients (in this case, user has opened another client so disable this one) has been with WebSockets but I assume this could be done another way too?

I would assume Cloud Sync can be implemented by adding time stamps to each row of data telling when that row was last edited, and then updating rows that have been edited after the last sync date on that device. Or would it better to pick up a ready made solution for this, and perhaps switch server technology accordingly? For example, if there is a good, readymade solution for Cloud Sync available via NPM I could write the server with express, feathers or what have you instead.

webdev,"Your first project, from a business owner's perspective","I recently decided to start my own online bakery. Because I have a background in programming, I also decided to make the website myself. After completing most of it, I realized that what I had learned would be valuable to people starting off. Often it is the case that new web developers aren't sure where to start. They aren't sure what kind of a project would look good to show potential employers. The following is a list of things I ended up needing for my site, each of which would be excellent things to code.

Order submit form.  
‚Ä¢ Layout: I started out using a column design. It looked great on my PC, but once I switched to my phone, it was a garbled mess. First lesson: make sure your design works for everyone.  
‚Ä¢ Updating totals: Whenever the user changes the number of ordered items from 1 to 2, update the subtotal. Take into consideration shipping and tax as well. Know what event to trigger this on. There is onchange and oninput, for example. Users are often able to bypass these triggers when they copy and paste data in. Know how to deal with that.  
‚Ä¢ Restrict input: Should it only be numbers? Only letters? Only a certain length? Restrict it. Learn how to use regex also. It's scary at first, but it is powerful.  
‚Ä¢ Autocomplete, required, and read-only attributes: Sometimes autocomplete ends up making your site look tacky; it makes a dropdown field appear and that can be confusing for some users. Other times, it's handy to use. Know when to use it and when not to. Fields like subtotal, shipping, taxes, and total should be read-only.  
‚Ä¢ Pricing: Have a single, small file that contains pricing information if you have a small site, and source this into your order page. Price figures will be used in too many places to have you going through and updating the numbers everywhere manually - they are displayed next to the products and used in the equations to calculate pricing. Having them in a small file greatly simplifies things. Obviously if it's for a large site, use a database.  
‚Ä¢ The backend: Don't trust user input. There are various ways to screen it to avoid SQL injections depending on the language you are using. Everything you did on the front end you need to do again on the backend, and more, concerning checking that number inputs are numbers, that inputs aren't too long, that email addresses are in fact email addresses (there is a regex for this), etc.  
‚Ä¢ Database: Insert the order into a database to save it. You will learn about the different kinds of fields like int, tiny int, date, and datetime. You will learn what specific format is acceptable for something like datetime as well.  
‚Ä¢ Invoice: Once complete, you should show an invoice to the customer, detailing everything that was selected. Showing invoices is actually part of the Visa guidelines, which business owners will care about if they are accepting credit card transactions. Taking this a step further, you can also figure out how to automatically email the invoice to them without too much trouble.

Payment  
‚Ä¢ Composer: Know how to use this, as many payment gateways will have you install their payment SDK this way. Know that there can be issues with trying to install it through shell access from an ftp client. It's more ideal through the terminal on your server.  
‚Ä¢ Payment Gateways: Look at the developer guides for various payment gateways like Stripe, [Authorize.net](http://Authorize.net), and Elavon. It's also a good idea to explore their customer service, as some of them are absolute garbage. Some of them have code for Ruby, PHP, C#, etc, but others will not have one or the other. Some will have SDK's that are so out of date that they expect developers to edit the code themselves. Read the comments on the github pages to see what people are saying about it.  
‚Ä¢ PCI Compliance: Understand the different levels of PCI Compliance, specifically SAQ A, SAQ A-EP, and SAQ D. Try to spot if the payment gateway specifically states what level of PCI Compliance you can achieve using one of their methods. If I had any advice to give here, it would be this: SAQ D is a significant step up and requires a lot of time, money, and effort to achieve. Stick to the easier ones. Lastly, do NOT have any CC data hit your server. The payment gateway should give you a nonce to use instead or take you to an entirely different payment page on their servers.  
‚Ä¢ CC guidelines: Look at the Visa, Mastercard, and American Express guidelines. They want you to display their logos on CC forms, have specific image files for them, want specific spacing around the logo's, and specific coloration, even for the background in some cases (where their logo would be not as visible). They are even specific about capitalizing the V in Visa, and not having it as all caps: VISA. Some of these guidelines don't absolutely have to be followed, but you may be required to follow some by the agreement you signed with your acquirer, for example. For you, the new student just getting your feet wet, you don't need to go so far as to read the terms and conditions to get all this, but you still can familiarize yourself with the guidelines and attempt to adhere to them. It also offers you the chance to elaborate on what you know about this subject in interviews.  
‚Ä¢ CC spacing: Another thing that comes from the guidelines is the spacing of the numbers in a CC for an input field. 6589756425691215 is difficult to read, but 6589 7564 2569 1215 is much easier to read. Coming up with the code to make this work is a bit tricky as well. With some solutions, using Replace() can alter the caret position, which can be jarring to the user. Copy/pasting can also bypass the event you are trying to wait for. AE cards can have 15 digits instead of 16. Some fancy CC forms also update a logo to the right of the CC number to reflect the kind of card the user is attempting to use. What first seems like a simple form can turn into a completed amount of code.  
‚Ä¢ CC expiration dates: They should be separate - one field for the month, one for the year; limited to numbers only; limited to two digits.  
‚Ä¢ Security field: I believe most are 3 digits long, but AE's is 4.  
‚Ä¢ Luhn algorithm: You can use this to verify if a CC number is typed correctly.  
‚Ä¢ Hide CC: The most ideal way to do this is to have each number of the CC that is typed be briefly visible, then switch it to an asterisk ( \* ). Simply putting the input field type as hidden will not accomplish this. I believe this is also a consideration the CC issuers want you to take, but it's not absolutely required. Always nice if you can achieve it though.

Coupons  
As a coder, you might not think this is that big of a deal, but on the business side of things, you realize this is huge when it comes to Direct Mail. Businesses will want to send out fliers through the mail. Postage is expensive, so you begin to learn about programs like EDDM through the United States Postal Service. This allows businesses to send out many fliers at significantly lower cost. You also learn about paper weights and dimensions for what is acceptable. All of this costs money. It's about $200 to hit 650 residents just for the usps side of things. The actual mailers cost around 20 cents each. As a business owner, you do not want to be blowing all this money to end up with zero new customers. This is where coupons come in. Fliers are the perfect place to put coupons, and so your website then needs to be able to process them as well. Coupons will lessen the chance that your fliers are immediately trashed.  
‚Ä¢ Just like with pricing, have a centralized location where coupon codes can be sourced from to validate them.  
‚Ä¢ You need to display to the user that the coupon code applied. The pricing equation needs to know what to do to account for the reduced price.  
‚Ä¢ Consider how many coupons a user can use in a single transaction.  
‚Ä¢ Consider if that coupon code should be used up or if it's fine to use it with infinite transactions so long as its not expired.  
‚Ä¢ Calculate it on the backend side as well. Have a spot in the database for it so the total price makes sense if you have to investigate a customer order for some reason.  
‚Ä¢ Have a way to remove the coupon discount if they decide they don't want to use it yet.

Security  
Fraudsters will buy millions of card numbers off the dark web, find a website with bad security, then will try to run as many of them through with a $1 charge to see which cards are still good. If you allow users to run millions of cards through, you can not only be subject to thousands of dollars worth of fines, but the credit card issuers will also then view you as a problem. Every incidence of fraud creates a problem for them, so if you are the reason, they can and will bar you from making any future online credit card transactions. Just like that, your business will have gone straight down the toilet.  
‚Ä¢ Log IP's: Every time someone tries to run a transaction through, even if it is unsuccessful, their IP address needs to be logged in a specific table.  
‚Ä¢ Suspension: Once an IP address has exceeded the maximum attempts allowed, that IP address should be suspended for 24 hours from making any transactions at all.  
‚Ä¢ Absolute limits: To prevent IP spoofing, there should also be a limit to how many transactions can be attempted overall for a given time period.  
‚Ä¢ Be careful of setting the field that counts transaction attempts as something like a tiny int. An attacker could continue to attempt transactions, running the number up to 256 where it may roll back over to 1, thereby making the system think that IP address has not exceeded the maximum transaction attempts any more. Then they of course would try to run more credit cards through. Ideally, the transaction counter for a specific IP address should stop counting once that IP address has been suspended to prevent this from happening.  
‚Ä¢ Log IPs first; do the transaction second. Imagine this: an attacker edits a field so that it submits a bad value, causing your page to crash; however, because you have written your code in such a way as to complete the transaction first, they are still able to run millions of cards through to check them, all while avoiding the IP logging part of your code. By logging the IP addresses first however, you lessen the possibility of this occurring.

Customer Retention  
‚Ä¢ Allow users to sign up for your website. Have a profile, settings, and order history for their account.  
‚Ä¢ Store passwords in an appropriate way, using cryptographic algorithms and a salt.  
‚Ä¢ Have sign-ups for monthly promotional emails and also a way to easily unsubscribe from them.

When you lay all of these things out, it really does amount to a tremendous amount of code. An employer would love to see this kind of work in an interview.

webdev,Recommended tech stack / approach for simple hobby project?,"Hello all, programming beginner here!

I basically want to build a simple web app that runs **locally on my computer on** **windows** with minimal dependencies. I have created the app on linux with a cms before but i wanted to simplify it and make it more portable (ideally just copying the folder, not installing anything).

It queries the wikipedia api and lets the user add things to a list and then edit, filter and sort them smoothly. I also want to be able to add items manually to the list with file uploads and have persistent data storage.

I want to install as little as possible and make it easy to backup and transport but still maintain some good practices and learn about relevant technologies.

**What i have so far is html, css and js files and a barebones node server** that can store the data on my system in a json file. I can already add items to my list, save it and load it initially.

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I built a straightforward PDF generator.,"# PDFLabs - Simple HTML &amp; URL to PDF Converter

Hey everyone! I wanted to share a simple tool I've been working on: [PDFLabs](https://pdflabs.net), a straightforward web service for converting web pages and HTML to PDF documents.

## What it does
- Converts URLs directly to PDF files
- Handles HTML-to-PDF conversion
- Provides an API for developers who want to integrate PDF conversion into their applications

## Why I built it
I noticed there was a need for a clean, simple conversion tool without all the bloat and ads you typically see on free PDF converters. 

## Tech Stack
[Could you share what technologies you used to build it? This would be interesting to the community]

## Try it out
You can check it out at [pdflabs.net](https://pdflabs.net) - I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvements!

This is still a work in progress, and I'm actively developing new features.

I made a search term management tool that helps you go through the search terms for a campaign so you can find new entries for the negative keywords list.

This is an internal tool that I've build for my own use, and I'm offering it for free, so if it feels unpolished, it's because it is. Should there be interest in it, I'll gladly keep improving it and adding new features.

Although it works just fine without it, it is AI-aided, so if you follow the instructions and the tips on the page, it should give you decent suggestions for negative keywords, which should speed things up quite a bit. It's not perfect, but it made me realize I didn't have a clear delineation in intent for my campaigns. Your mileage may vary.

webdev,Will Authentication always suck?,"The entire web dev scene is  coming to a point where authentication is annoying than ever. Something so simple in concept but the way it is being implemented has frustrated me to a point that I'm writing this because i want to know if it is only me who can't implement proper auth. 

I've used many authentication services across many architectures but in my 3 years of experience I've still not figured out a way or even guidelines that i can follow for implementing authentication across all my applications! Which completely sucks. Authentication is probably the one thing that is keeping me from developing any of my projects which is pretty stupid but if not implemented correctly it poses huge security risks.

  
So I'm writing this to well, maybe discuss what is your approach to authentication. 

  
For context, I'm a full-stack developer (MERN stack) and the problem i encounter is implementing cross-oirigin authentication, many MERN auth videos i see online they either only do it on the frontend or if they are adding auth to both the client and server, that approach is usually not practical or has security risks. I mostly succeed in adding auth to the frontend side, it is securing the backend where i usually screw up.

  
Also when i check the documentation of auth libraries (ex. clerk or next-auth) they lack documentation for client-server architecture and how to secure routes in both frontend and backend. I usually come up with my own route protection system when using any of these but again all types of questions are in my mind. 

**Is this conventional? Is this secure? Is this a good approach?**

  
Again it's not like I've not implemented authentication in a client-server architecture but it's these questions that make me doubt my way of doing things. Anyways would like to know your opinions on this!

webdev,Which field has the highest demand in freelancing,"Hello friends,

I am a Node.js backend developer with 2 years of experience. I want to start freelancing, but I have no idea how to begin. Based on a friend's suggestion, I created an account on Fiverr and made a simple gig.

My question is: which field has the highest demand in freelancing? I mean fields like frontend, backend development, WordPress, DevOps, data pipelines, data engineering, etc. I want to learn as many skills as possible so that I can set up my own business and avoid working as an employee for a company.

Over the past few months, I have met many people and attended several interviews, some of which were not even related to my field. For example, I gave a data engineering interview where I built an ETL data pipeline using Node.js, Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, and Postgres. I also interacted with companies that develop gambling websites, games, and even crack software to steal user data or bypass paid APIs for WhatsApp and Meta applications.

After working for 2 years, I have realized that most IT companies have middlemen who take a significant cut of the revenue, leaving employees with very little. I want to do something of my own.

I have a few friends who are frontend developers, full-stack developers, and UI/UX designers.

If you have any advice, please share it with me. I‚Äôd like to know what strategies I should use, which platforms I should focus on, etc.

I am not interested in frontend development, and I‚Äôm not good at designing UIs. I prefer backend development and want to explore more opportunities in server-side technologies. Should I explore fields like DevOps or data engineering?

Thank you.

webdev,working with users location,"tldr: ive got an app that asks the user for location and stores in a localstorage but its giving me issues. I'm looking for a write-up or some tips on how to handle users location within a react/next app. 

full story-

i plan on using location throughout the app, so I was planning on using a context. one issue is whether I should ask for location on load, which means any page that gets loaded would ask for users location, even on pages its not needed. for this I could add a second function in my context like fetchLocation and on pages location is needed, if !location fetchLocation. so now I need to check for this every page location is needed?

also, some people don't like to share location. In a way I don't want to bother with them, but I should try to handle this and at least handle it gracefully rather than have the page error. i was considering using an API call to try to get some location from an IP address, or maybe just let people pick a city they'd want to use

the main page for this is an events page that uses location and also can move a map and get lat/lng so there's some logic to change the event location. somewhere in there I'm getting things mixed up and on initial load the maps trying to load without either and erroring. maybe if the first two were worked out I wouldn't fall into this. but I'm clearly doing something out of order. for example when testing in incognito, the page fails as the request to use location is still on the screen.

webdev,Help me choose a stack for my freelance portfolio,"Hi folks,

I'm a freelance dev currently revamping my old portfolio - which doesn't really showcase my skills - and I have trouble choosing a stack for it.

Let me explain:  
I'm a front-end developer with a specialty with CSS / integrations but also a WordPress developer, so I do lots of PHP too. I'm really not used to JS Framework, either front or back end, so I could use this occasion to learn one !  
Since the goal of this website is to present both my front-end and my WordPress services, I'm not sure which way I can go.  
Basically, I've narrowed it down to these four choices :

* **A WordPress with a homemade ACF/Gunterberg theme :** Seems logical since I do lots of WP sites anyway.
* **Just a from scratch HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS website :** Simple enough, I can add a tad of PHP for a contact form. Not even a back-office to add projects, I could to it manually, old-school style.
* **Another CMS like ProcessWire :** An occasion for me to learn some more CMS and not to bother creating a back-office of some sort.
* **Use a JS Framework like Vue.js or React :** I feel way behind modern webdev and I could use a bit of experience. But it might be overkill for a simple portfolio. I could use a boilerplate to have a backoffice/admin and such

Soooo, if I promote among others services, Wordpress dev, it is better to go this way ? Or should I just learn something modern and new ?

webdev,DON'T BUY DOMAINS FROM GODADDY!!!! SCAM!!!!!,"I recently had a terrible experience with GoDaddy, and I feel compelled to warn others about their unethical and exploitative practices. 

Here's the list what they do (according to what i observed so far)  :-

1. **Deceptive Domain Availability**: When I searched for a domain, it was initially shown as cheap and available. However, shortly afterward, it was claimed as unavailable, marked as a ""premium domain,"" and priced ridiculously high.
2. **GoDaddy Monopolizes Domains**: I noticed that every domain I searched for was suddenly ""claimed"" by GoDaddy. Visiting these domains leads to their landing page, where they sell the domain at inflated prices or suggest hiring a broker‚Äîessentially forcing users to overpay for domains they initially showed as affordable.
3. **WHOIS Confirms Suspicious Practices**: When I checked WHOIS information for one of the domains, here‚Äôs what I found:

https://preview.redd.it/meuivvga995e1.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51bcfc6eddabc92886686167d641e4309cbcea13

4. It‚Äôs clear that GoDaddy is holding these domains through their proxy service, making them unavailable to regular users unless they pay a premium

5. **Unfair Market Manipulation**: GoDaddy is deliberately creating scarcity by claiming domains people search for and reselling them at inflated prices. This is not just unethical; it‚Äôs exploitative and undermines trust in domain registration services.

üí° **What You Can Do**:

* Avoid GoDaddy at all costs! Use alternative domain registrars like Namecheap, Hostinger, Cloudflare or Porkbun.
* Be cautious when searching for domains, as GoDaddy seems to track interest and manipulate availability to force you to pay more.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Conclusion**:  
GoDaddy‚Äôs practices are a blatant scam, designed to exploit users searching for domains. They manipulate the market to extort money and provide no transparency in the process. Stay away from GoDaddy and use trustworthy alternatives instead!

this happen for all the domain i checked specially (.com) all the one also don't say .com are popular in demand then why it available and now its register then why now and why after i checked and why all and why all the domain are directing to godaddy not once to their registered owners website

here the live proof:

see they are telling to buy at high price it's okay this premium one i don't want but why do they claim anonymously the domain after i looked or searched on their website in one day even after 3 months the domain does not have a website only godaddy promotion this is for all domains i looked into",Invincible-Bug,1h85tfm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h85tfm/dont_buy_domains_from_godaddy_scam/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h85tfm/dont_buy_domains_from_godaddy_scam/,2024-12-06 16:51:46,973,0.92,973,0,540,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85tfm

After encountering performance issues with `jsdom` while trying to integrate the [dom-accessibility-api](https://github.com/eps1lon/dom-accessibility-api) library, I started working on a similar library that is potentially faster.

[https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils](https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils)

Having tested the library on some previously heavy tests that could even lead to timeouts, I noticed a performance improvement of about 50% when using my library when retrieving element accessible names. When combined with `happy-dom`, the improvement is even greater.  


Would it be possible for some of you who have experienced similar performance issues to let me know if this library provides any improvements in that regard? Also, feel free to share any feedback on potential issues‚Äîit‚Äôs still a library in development :)

webdev,"Recently, I have been trying out LLMs for coding and they are surprisingly bad for anything even a tiny bit complex?","Since LLMs (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.) became popular, I have used them for basic things, but only sporadically for coding. Recently, I was entrusted a Vue 3 codebase, and since I didn't know Vue, I thought to myself: Why not get some help from AI? So, I started trying out different models and to my surprise, it's incredible how even basic things such as flexbox in component styling is just too much for them. Anything that has to do with styling, really, that goes beyond ""Set this component's border color to light gray"". If you use Vuetify and custom style classes, then the machine just doesn't WTH is going on anymore. Also, I tried it to make it tell me the difference between React's portals and Vue 3's teleport functionality, and it was disappointing to say the least. The fun became real, though, when I asked it how to teleport a Vue 3 component into a Cytoscape JS node; After 30 minutes or so of back and forth prompting, I gave up, and this is in general how my sessions end: With time wasted, frustration and back at the start of the task.

Other behaviours I have noticed are:

* In the same chat, repeating the same answer to different prompts (this is typical of Mistral), even though you try to nudge it in the right direction by telling it the answer wasn't satisfactory.
* Making up random stuff, e.g., CSS directives or a function's options and then saying ""My bad, you're right. Function x doesn't have the option y"".
* Mixing up versions (e.g., Vue 2 patterns in Vue 3)

... and more.

Honestly, the majority of the time it's useless. Also, for beginners, this is probably the worst one can do to learn programming, people should stay the hell away from it under they have some experience under the belt.

I thought Models were intended to handle business logic. I would assume a Model created exclusively to, for example, call an external API and parse the results would be valid to the MVC pattern without requiring database interaction at all.

Is my assumption incorrect, or is there a particular advantage to forcing automatic database connections?

webdev,The Rise of AgentWeb,"This is something I have been thinking about recently. Basically the idea how the Web is going to evolve in the future with AI. You can read the whole thing at my post, but just to flag a few things here:

""The web is splitting into two distinct futures: one driven by relentless AI agents, the other shaped by human hands. It fills me with both excitement and sadness - excited by the possibilities of AI-driven efficiency, yet nostalgic for the craftsmanship of a human touch. Let's dive into what this means for the future of web development and ownership.

# The Rise of AgentWeb

The AgentWeb represents the industrialisation of web development, where AI agents autonomously build, maintain, and optimise websites at scale. These digital properties will be born in vast WebFarms (remember Bitcoin farms?) where AI systems handle everything from design decisions to content optimisation and user experience refinement.

For website owners, this means hands-off management with AI handling:

* Complete brand identity creation and evolution
* Content creation and SEO optimisation
* Automated maintenance and security updates
* Real-time performance monitoring and optimisation
* User experience refinement through continuous testing
* Integrated social media presence and content distribution

# The Future Renaissance of ArtisanWeb

On the flip side, we might be witnessing a renaissance of handcrafted websites. Like craft beer versus mass-produced lagers, ArtisanWeb represents the boutique approach to web development. I can imagine content on the web being labeled¬†Handcrafted by a Human¬†or¬†No AI Was Used in Creating This Content.

The interesting thing is that while handcrafted web will be proud to display these labels, web farms would not do the opposite:¬†AI Generated Content. They are likely to try to fake that they are really hand-made content. In the same way¬†[browsers once faked their identities to gain compatibility](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/?ref=mantcz.com), AI-generated websites might strive to mimic human craftsmanship to gain trust‚Äîa new battle for authenticity in the AI driven digital age.""

I am curious to hear what people think.

webdev,Learndash and FluentCRM API related issue ,"Hi folks,

I am running a WordPress site hosted on Rapyd Cloud and the site uses LearnDash as the LMS, FluentCRM for managing email engagement, and WP Fusion for advanced syncing. I also use Uncanny Automator and LearnDash Notifications for additional functionality.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to achieve:

When a student completes a topic in LearnDash, I want to log the completion date in a custom field within FluentCRM for that student.

After 7 or 14 days, I want to check if the student has started the next topic in the course.

If no progress is detected within those two weeks, FluentCRM should trigger an automated email encouraging them to continue.

I‚Äôve written a PHP function using LearnDash‚Äôs hooks and FluentCRM‚Äôs API to update the custom field, but it‚Äôs not working. The completion date isn‚Äôt being stored in FluentCRM, and I‚Äôm unsure if the issue is with the hook, the API call, or something else.

I also reached out to Rapyd Cloud‚Äôs support to check if it might be a server-related issue, but they confirmed it‚Äôs more of an application-level concern and suggested I check with LearnDash or FluentCRM.

Some questions I have:

Is learndash\_topic\_completed the correct hook for this, or is there a better one to use?

Is there a more reliable way to update FluentCRM custom fields programmatically?

For the follow-up, should I consider using WP Fusion‚Äôs tagging features or a cron job for better reliability?

Here are the relevant documentation links I‚Äôve been looking through:

LearnDash Developer Docs

FluentCRM API Docs

WP Fusion Documentation

If anyone has set up something similar or can point out where I might be going wrong, I‚Äôd really appreciate your help! Let me know if you need more details.

webdev,Next steps for semi-successful websites (and devs),"I have made a few websites over the years, but have substantially stepped up my skills over the last 12 months or so through uni study.

I currently have a simple game website averaging about 400 users per day and 10,000 views per week. It‚Äôs a little puzzle game that resets every 24 hours.

After a couple months of very little interaction it has built up to this point completely organically over a few months, but the growth is slowing.

So what do now? Try and advertise the site? Put google ads on the site and hopefully get $20-30 per week hoping not to alienate the users?

My full time work is currently in audio production and journalism so I am used to building creative things with technology. I think I could make more websites that attract users, but who knows? Making a living wage out of this feels pretty improbable. 

The most complicated website I have made but not put on the internet is a e-commerce site with flask - besides that mostly little games. I consider myself a bit more of a creative than strictly a dev - I can do a lot with a little. Having said that I am studying comp sci post-grad.

webdev,How to communicate better during meetings? ,"I‚Äôm a new developer and an issue I‚Äôm facing is being able to clearly communicate the challenges of a task during team meetings. Sometimes clients would make requests to add something new or modify something prebuilt that sounds easy to do in theory but poses a great technical challenge. It could either be something entirely impossible to do or beyond my skillset. I‚Äôve found when I try to communicate the difficulties, I‚Äôm being seen as ‚Äúnot having a can do attitude‚Äù or ‚Äúnot wanting to do the hard work‚Äù. Boss would interrupt me and tell me I just have to figure something out. 

I feel that my job as a developer is to clearly communicate the possibilities of what the client is asking for and/or provide possible solutions. But my boss just wants me to pretty much say yes to whatever and I think it‚Äôs because the more time I spend on the project the more he can charge the client. This may mean going away with a task then doing absolutely nothing and saying I‚Äôve tried xyz and it didn‚Äôt work whereas this whole bullshit could‚Äôve been avoided in the first place. I‚Äôm getting paid so not exactly complaining but this feels exploitative. 

And the other developers although understand the scope of the task, they just agree with the boss and the client to stay on their good side because it‚Äôs gonna be me doing the work anyways and not them. Also during calls they would briefly look at my code and confirm with the client exactly what I‚Äôve said which I find disrespectful because I‚Äôm the one who wrote the code yet the client is more trusting towards someone who‚Äôs not even part of the project. They‚Äôre also very quick to make suggestions even though they don‚Äôt know anything about the codebase which is annoying asf.

How do I get subsequent lines for long subitem names to be exactly underneath the first line? 

This is driving me mad!

webdev,Was interviewer being picky?,"I completed a relatively simple task for a Frontend Developer position. One part involved making a single word in a block of HTML bold.

I chose to wrap the word in a &lt;span&gt; tag and assign it a class, applying font-weight via CSS. However, the interviewer pointed out that this wasn‚Äôt the best approach and recommended using the &lt;strong&gt; tag for semantic reasons.

I understand their perspective, but aren‚Äôt both approaches valid? My reasoning was that if design requirements changed in a real-world scenario (e.g., the bold word needed a different color or style later), it would be easier to manage through CSS without touching the HTML structure.

Was the interviewer being overly picky, or is there a stronger case for using &lt;strong&gt; in this context? I‚Äôm open to feedback and willing to admit if I was mistaken.

My intention is not to distribute this app or for other users to use.  I simply want to be able to post to pages I administrate without having to log into Facebook each time.

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I‚Äôm working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What‚Äôs the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?

webdev,NodeJS work on WordPress?,"You'll have to pardon the ignorance guys, but I'm wondering what the best way to interface nodeJS with WordPress is? I have a shared server on Hostinger. No nodeJS functionality. I don't care to configure a VPS.

I wish to write a WooCommerce extension / plugin with a client-side image manipulation feature for my WordPress site eg. dynamic text, crop &amp; resize images. JIMP for node seems like an optimal solution.

Ideally, the user would be able to manipulate the text on the actual image. Not in an external text input. My intention is to create a WooCommerce extension for my site. Have the user manipulate an image. Upload to my server. Pay over WooCommerce. I'll use a pdf api to create a pdf. Print this and post it to them. 

Something like the Photo Editor SDK:

webdev,Genuinely do you need a JS framework?,"Genuinely do you need a JS framework?

I was just talking with some coworkers, and one of them brought up that they think the bell curve meme around the use of JS frameworks would be low IQ - use framework, mid IQ - just use base HTML CSS JS, high IQ - you must use a JS framework.

Personally I am of the opinion that JS frameworks have their place but for the vast majority of websites you don't need anything other than a templating language and vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

I've certainly written webapps that required the use a JS framework, but I would hardly call those websites they were more extremely complicated web apps that simply could not have been made without the use of a framework.

But that's the exception and 99% of all websites on the internet don't need anything more than HTML + a templating language for format, CSS for layout and prettiness, and JavaScript for interactivity (frankly HTML and CSS get you 90% of your interactivity), server requests, and content reactivity. There's a reason 80% of the internet is PHP, and why libraries like HTMX, and frameworks like Astro are becoming so popular - because they just get out of your way.

I sort of responded that for work and for personal projects I mainly build websites using no framework, and I asked why does he think that's the shape of the bell curve. But he didn't seem open to having a dialogue about it, and just kept responding ""it's just what it is"" with a really smug smile. And I didn't want to push it further / potentially start any conflict with a coworker so I dropped it.

I just feel like frameworks add so much complexity and overhead to development (unless your app truly absolutely needs it), that it's really unnecessary and creates so much work compared to using no framework and at the end of the day your user won't notice a difference. 

Runtimes, CSS modules, picking/learning a package, package specific JS, npm packages, typescript, webpack, docker, build tools, hosting... Homie this is a static page that fetches content on load and sends basic CRUD requests to the server, I could have it finished and hosted before you have your environment set up and project initiated. And mine will be functional with JS disabled and for users with 3G connections.

But I'm really curious, is the use a framework (JS or other) really the big brain move, and every website no matter what should use one.

webdev,"How do server-sent event ""streams"" work on a lower level?","Hi, and sorry for the lack of a tl;dr; - I'm not sure how to get away from providing the context. Basically I'm interested in connecting to a web server and consuming [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) using a lower level HTTP API and am hoping somebody can explain how the push vs pull of these events might work at a lower level.

I'm working on a hardware project (ESP32-S3 / espressif ESP-IDF based) where I'm writing C with a bit of higher level abstraction to support HTTP interactions. For example, the methods I might call are:

* `esp_http_client_open()`: Open the HTTP connection with write_len parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set write_len=0 for read-only connection.
* `esp_http_client_fetch_headers()`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). 
* `esp_http_client_read()`: Read the HTTP stream
* `esp_http_client_close()`: Close the connection.

([more examples / docs are here if you're currious](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client.html#http-stream))

Now what I'm trying to figure out is what `esp_http_client_read()` actually is doing in terms of the server to client communication. When I connect to a server over HTTP, and assuming `keep-alive`, I can call `esp_http_client_read()` every millisecond, or I can wait 100 milliseconds and call it. Both ""work"" in that if there is no data being sent from the server, nothing will happen, and if there is data, I'll read it and be able to do something with it. _edit: for clarity because it may be non-obvious, my intention is to have my hardware device connect to a server and stay connected to it indefinitely, waiting for the server to send data using server-sent events - so picture a while(true) loop, but I'm responsible myself for checking when new data comes in_

But I don't have a good sense of what it means to ""read data"" in an already open HTTP stream. As far as I'm aware, for this type of connection (which is similar as far as I understand to a chunked response), nothing is communicated to the server asking for more data for example, it's certainly not like an additional HTTP request is being made. I'm guessing ""read data"" just checks some sort of lower level buffer handled by the WiFi chip or some lower subsystem. I'm guessing if I chose to ""read data"" from an HTTP connection the server is none the wiser. 

That said, I also might 100% wrong, and perhaps (like other forms of communication) part of the underlying protocol is a message to the server that you've read data. This might not be important to the server, but perhaps it acts as a sort of heartbeat. 

My end goal here is to understand how often I should call ""read data"" in my code optimizing for quickly getting updates from the server but also not having any negative impact on the server or taking up needless CPU cycles by reading data every millisecond when once every 50ms would suffice for my needs. 

I'm hoping somebody in the web dev community who perhaps has more experience or a better understanding of lower level HTTP ""stuff"" might be able to understand the spirit of what I'm asking and help me understand.

webdev,Standard SSL to AutoSSL in cPanel?,"  
i decided to go with godaddy for webhosting (already regretting this after scrolling through this sub) and i got standard SSL and my website wont work (im getting the connection is not private message). I chatgpt'd it and its saying i need **AutoSSL**. I recently purchased a **Standard SSL certificate** from GoDaddy,  and i called the help desk and they told me to switch to **AutoSSL** because it automatically handles SSL installations and renewals, and I‚Äôd rather not manage SSL certificates manually.... 

Here's what I've done so far:

1. **Purchased a Standard SSL** from GoDaddy.
2. Installed the certificate manually via **cPanel**.
3. I saw that my certificate is self-signed in cPanel.

# What I want to do:

  
Make my website work.

I want **AutoSSL** to take over and automatically install and renew my SSL certificates. I‚Äôve checked my cPanel, but I **don‚Äôt see an option for AutoSSL** anywhere in the **SSL/TLS Manager** or **SSL/TLS Status** sections. I also don‚Äôt see an option to **enable AutoSSL** in cPanel.

# Questions:

1. **Am I missing something?** Should AutoSSL be available by default, or is it something that needs to be enabled by GoDaddy?
2. **How do I get AutoSSL working for my domain?** Do I need to enable it manually, or does GoDaddy handle that?
3. **Is AutoSSL only available on specific hosting plans?** I'm on a basic hosting plan, so I‚Äôm wondering if AutoSSL is available for my plan.

If anyone has had similar issues with GoDaddy and cPanel, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on how to get AutoSSL up and running.

webdev,Can't get everything recolored correctly for custom css.,"\[SOLVED\]

I am trying to learn css by creating a general custom css that works for all website in the nord theme. I took the solarized-everything project and tried to add a generic nord theme for all site.

In some websites, e.g. reddit, this bit from the pictures for replies don't seem to get recolored.

Other things in reddit that doesn't get recolored is the markdown editor box for post. Home popular, explore tabs when they are highlighted etc. Others relatively blend in but the subsequent thread line for replies and hide replies area are very jarring to see.

How do I fix this?

\[SOLUTION\]

It was taking a global variable `--color-neutral-background`

However setting the variable in `:root` didn't work but setting it to `*` worked

\[[Here](https://github.com/jojowakaki/dots/blob/main/config/qutebrowser/solarized-everything-css/css/nord-dark-all-sites.css)\] is the css just in case somone is interested.

    :root{
    --color-neutral-background: #xxxxxxxx !important;
    } /*doesn't work */
    
    * {
    --color-neutral-background: #xxxxxxx !important;

webdev,Can anyone explain how scrollbars  determine which element they get attached to? Mine is getting attached to the body for whatever reason and don't really understand it...,"I have encountered the worst problem in my web dev project. **SCROLLBARS**

Imagine implementing a *simple* chat system and you know nothing about websockets and broadcasting yet the **worst roadblock** is getting the scrollbar to go down in a react app.. I can get it to go down when I set `h-[some value]` but it won't go down otherwise...

So I throw in some `overflow` magic. Nah uh, the scrollbar ain't moving an inch.. I do all my scrollbar effecting witchcraft (looking at you **tailwind**) on the element that I think is managing the scrollbar. It did not move one inch. Then I change the potions, seems like `useEffect` ain't cutting it, so my truth sayer (**chat gpt**) recommended `useLayoutEffect`  and it still did not work. Then I go on a hunt for the element which the scroll bar is getting attached to.

Turns out it is getting attached to the body element. I was able to confirm this by adding overflow-hidden to the parent components one by one and it only worked on the body element!!

Now the realization hit me, I know nothing of scrollbars. I can't seem to find a resource to actually learn what it is relevant to my current **context**. I have spent hours on this problem and can't seem to figure it out.

EDIT: Did not add code because idk if it is allowed here

EDIT: Further context: In a chat app, the scrollbar should be at the bottom coz you want to see the latest message not the oldest.

webdev,Monorepo architecture and scopes,"Monorepo architecture

Hi there! I‚Äôm using NX with Angular for a monorepo (but I don‚Äôt think this issue is specific to Angular nor NX) (4 projects, multiple libraries). As the repo is growing, the current library structure feels unsustainable, and responsibilities between modules are becoming unclear. Here's the current setup:

# Current Library Structure

1. `libs/features`
   * Each ""screen"" (micro-frontend) gets its own library.
   * **Problem:** Shared logic across screens creates overlapping responsibilities.
2. `libs/services`
   * Libraries aligned with backend microservices, split into subcategories:
      * **UI:** Frontend-specific logic/components for an ""entity"" such as order-card.
      * **Feature:** Core functionality (but sometimes imports across services, which feels wrong). Could be a smart search screen for orders, an oder dialog etc.
      * **Data-access:** Backend-specific data handling logic. Like order-rest/websockets
   * **Problem:** The ""feature"" sub-lib crosses boundaries and doesn‚Äôt align with service isolation. And it doesnt seem to make sense since its generally more defined by the wanted frontend functionality.
3. `libs/shared`
   * Shared functionality, including:
      * Config
      * Notifications handling
      * Shared UI components not tied to entities

# Questions

1. **UI Libraries**
   * Should all UI components be consolidated under `libs/shared/ui` and divided into sub-libraries/categories (e.g., `shared/ui/&lt;category&gt;`)?
2. **Backend vs. Frontend Domains**
   * Should backend-related libraries only include `data-access` and avoid mixing in UI or feature logic?
   * Should the frontend code be reorganized into ""frontend domains,"" where each domain encapsulates:
      * Shared business logic
      * Specific screens (which could eventually become micro-frontends)?

# Goals

* **Clear separation of concerns**
* **Sustainable structure as the repo grows**
* **Logical boundaries between backend services and frontend domains**

# How should I reorganize my libraries to achieve this?

  
Really grateful for any inputs or direction. Im feeling a bit lost at how to best structure this. I think the way to go is splitting things up more by front-end domains. But what sort of library types would be suitable, and which scopes and types should be limited from importing what?

webdev,How/why is chatgpt free?,"Well, I know it has a paid tier which is far better than the free version, but to me it feels insane to make something such power intensive globally free. Shouldn't they be hemorrhaging money by making it free for everyone?

Couple months ago I tried downloading a much inferior version of an LLM to run on my machine (don't remember the name atm) and my mid-tier PC took over 10 minutes to generate a single response, which was still far, far inferior compared to gpt.

I remember the saying ""if something is free, you're the product"". I'm wondering if that's the case here.

Same goes for Microsoft copilot as well, and that one can generate unlimited images while chatgpt has a limit on free tier. And it's much better at image generation from what I've experienced so far. Response -wise, free tier chatgpt can still kick copilots ass though.

If it's for advertisement, aren't there much better and cheaper ways they could spend their ad budget on?

webdev,Best WYSIWYG website editor with full website control? (Leaving Squarespace),"I‚Äôm migrating my photography website away from Squarespace because it‚Äôs too limiting. I can‚Äôt manage my web pages and other media files directly (no FTP or local mounting), making it impossible for me to automate webpage creation amongst other things. 

This makes managing the many photo galleries I have, and something as simple as linking full-res images to every photo a huge pain. The latter is not even possible on Squarespace‚Äîwhen you upload a 12 MP photo to a gallery, it gets downsampled to 1-2 MP and there's no way to view the original-resolution file. Nor can I link the original resolution file to that gallery preview. 

I need a platform where I can control the entire website structure (individual HTML pages and media), ideally with local file system access via FTP or similar. My goal is to use Python scripts to automate tasks like generating new galleries/web pages, uploading images, and linking previews inside a gallery to full-resolution files (Squarespace forcibly downsamples images and the full-res versions are inaccessible to the end user).

What platforms would you recommend for this level of customization? Note that I do prefer a WYSIWYG editor so that I'm not spending hours setting stuff up from scratch, but when I need to do more powerful things like change sections across all my photo galleries, I want the option for stuff like multi-file regex replacements across all my galleries' HTML files.

webdev,Is This Login/Signup System Secure and Efficient? Looking for Feedback,"Hi, I‚Äôve built a login/signup system for my website and would love your feedback. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sign-Up Flow**

* User fills out name, email, password (validated for strength) and completes hCaptcha.
* Frontend sends a POST request to /api/auth/register with user data and hCaptcha token.
* Server validates data, verifies hCaptcha, and creates a ""pending user"" with:
   * Hashed password, 6-digit OTP (valid 5 mins), and expiration (30 mins).
* OTP is emailed to the user for verification.
* On valid OTP, a user account is created, and the pending entry is removed.

**2. Sign-In Flow**

* User enters email/password.
* Server verifies credentials and creates a session via NextAuth.
* On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

**3. Additional Security**

* Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
* Failed logins tracked for account lockout.
* Background task clears expired pending users every 5 minutes.
* Password resets use the same OTP process as registration.

**4. Session Management**

* Handled by NextAuth with token storage in cookies.

**Questions:**

* Is this secure enough?
* Any improvements to the email verification or overall flow?
* Other tips for a better user experience or security?

webdev,News Article Content without JavaScript,"Curiosity question. I noticed this with Bloomberg but I've seen it with several others: the article content is unloaded if JavaScript is disabled, and not to be found in the HTML or DOM.

A lot of news websites (paywalled or otherwise) still load the article content, sometimes hidden, in the HTML with JavaScript disabled. I've noticed lots don't. 

Is this because Google has gotten better at loading the articles when it crawls so gating it behind a paywall doesn't matter anymore for SEO?

There are a couple of different websites I use for virtual activities, but I have my own idea for a very unique platform that I would like to develop over the next couple of years.  The site would be primarily simple games with and graphics drawn cutely, but poorly by me in Procreate.

I have practically no experience in this arena so forgive if I ask a stupid question(s).

I've learned so far I can make a lot with HTML and CSS, and I've played around with Scratch. I think I will be able to figure out the game-making.  However, a feature of this website would be for the user to be able to draw a card/picture/.gif in between turns of a game, or there to be a stop point before you can continue with a game.  My goal is to have potentially hundreds of decks/libraries available for a user to select as their question set prior to playing the game (for example - a deck with R sounds, a deck with action .gifs for expressive language tasks, a short video clip, etc)

Would I be able to have a library within HTML/CSS, or should I look at using a different language?  Eventually, if it goes well, I would also want the option for people to create accounts and subscribe to the website, so I would need to be able to store that information too.  This is a years from now goal, but if I can get learning now it will only help me later.

webdev,Is it overkill to learn this tech stack for an MVP?,"I'm new to web dev, with a couple simple projects under my belt, but my next project is aiming to be more ambitious creating a social media / blogging platform.

I've done some research and the tech stack that seems to make most sense is:

Backend: Node.js (Express), Supabase (as includes auth)  
Frontend: React (+ React Query), Tailwind CSS  
Hosting: Railway (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), S3 (Images)

However I have no experience with React, Tailwind, Vercel or Supabase (just vanilla CSS + JS, HTML/EJS, PostrgreSQL, hosting on Railway)

So really I want some help understanding:

1. Over the next 3 months, am I likely to have saved more time by learning React + Tailwind + Supabase or is it better to stick with my vanilla stack if I'm aiming to maximise progress in 3 months?
2. If I were to create my MVP using my current ""vanilla"" stack and hire a software dev in 3 months, would there likely be lots of technical debt to overcome or would converting to the new stack be relatively easy?

React seems to be the really big one to learn, so I'm also considering just learning tailwind + supabase, and leaving React for later.

I just wanted to share my not-short but not-long journey. I have been doing freelancing on the side as a full-time developer for some time. I noticed that the competition is too high to get jobs on Upwork and make money.

Building does not mean anything. If I were to build a website/app that does quantum calculations. It will remain as a hidden gem. It will be useless. Marketing is hard.

webdev,I've created a sports competitions draw simulator,"Hey guys!

I'd like to introduce you to **DICEDRAW**, a web project that I've been developing with great pleasure recently. It's a website dedicated to **simulating draws for sports competitions**, currently focused on soccer. It already has draws for the Champions League, Europa League and, more recently, the new Club World Cup. The latter deserves a special mention because we're only a few days away from the official draw, and we can see how things might end up lining up.

The idea is that each draw respects the specific rules of each competition. In other words, nothing will be seen that goes against the rules of the entities. I've also included the new league stages of UEFA competitions, such as the Champions League, which has replaced the group stage.

If you have any suggestions or even ideas for other competitions you'd like to see there, let me know! I'm also accepting contributions to the project's repository, in case you want to get your hands on the code. And if you find it useful, leave a star there, it always gives you a boost of motivation.

I intend to continue evolving the project, and it would be great to have your feedback to make it even better!

* Drag-and-drop simplicity.
* Automatic folder organization for iOS (`Assets.xcassets`) and Android (`drawable`).
* Customizable sizes for additional use cases.

webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,132,0.82,132,0,184,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

So I thought myself front end development‚Ä¶


I‚Äôve had this idea for a job board for forever.  But everyone was way too expensive to hire. So I started teaching myself coding at the middle of last year.   The journey had been up and down, but now I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm comfortable with front end development.  The problem is, now I need to learn the back end, and I am very burnt out after spending all my nights and some weekends to get to where I‚Äôm at now.  So I‚Äôve been looking at different options, here they are:

1. Pay $10,000 for someone to start my project and hopefully have a mvp by the end of it.  I have a better job now, so I can save the money in probably a few months
2. Continue to learn, whether it be self learning or taking a class.  Self learning is cool, but I have no one to ask questions to.  And taking a class would take far too long.  

Those both are a little far away for my liking.  So, I thought of a new idea today!  I thought about just hiring a backend developer.  I could build the front, which would save me lots of money, and someone could do the backend.  The only issue is, I have no idea on how to hire a backend developer.  Do I hire a company?  Do I try and get a freelancer?  If so from where?  I‚Äôve looked at fivver and that option doesn‚Äôt work for me because I need someone I can have a conversation with and I don‚Äôt understand accents very well in learning environments.

      },
      payload: {
        events: digestResult.events,
        totalCount: digestResult.events.length

2. **Look-Back Pattern:**

    const shouldDigest = async (userId, eventType) =&gt; {
      const recentNotification = await novu.getNotificationHistory({
        subscriberId: userId,
        type: eventType
      });
      return Date.now() - recentNotification.timestamp &lt; ONE_DAY;
    };

Here is a visual representation I'm referring to - but with much smaller batching time window:

[Digest \/ Event Aggregation ](https://preview.redd.it/qozoe9akbf4e1.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301cfb85c68526175d084b86374fa8f3c29a3c21)

**Interesting Discovery -** [OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/journeys#time-window)**'s Time Window Approach:** While researching this, I found OneSignal's implementation of time windows interesting.   
  
They use a different approach where you can:

* Define specific allowed time periods (e.g., Tuesday 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST)
* Set intelligent delivery delays that randomly distribute notifications within allowed windows
* Handle out-of-window notifications by scheduling them for the next available window

For example, if you set a notification to trigger outside of Tuesday 1-6 PM PST, their system automatically schedules it for a random time within next Tuesday's window. This helps prevent notification clustering at window boundaries.

**Technical Challenges I'm Working Through:**

1. Race conditions when multiple events occur simultaneously
2. Handling failed notification deliveries within digest groups
3. Database schema optimization for efficient event aggregation
4. Coordinating time windows across multiple time zones
5. Implementing similar time-window functionality as OneSignal within Novu

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. What indexing strategies work best for quick digest compilation in Novu?
2. How do you handle digest delivery failures and retries?
3. Has anyone implemented custom time window logic similar to OneSignal's approach in Novu?
4. What's your approach to testing digest timing across different time zones?

If you've implemented similar systems with Novu or other notification services, I'd appreciate insights on handling these technical aspects efficiently.",Sudden_Profit_2840,1h4t9jv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,2024-12-02 11:53:39,37,0.95,37,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/S_ZmR_1cU5aKbwzfea80L7OQ7oKBdb43DuJDAxM8-xM.jpg,t3_1h4t9jv

Sometimes it takes about a minute to load, sometimes it gives an error page. I am using Namecheap domains, and this is what the redirect widget looks like:

The reason for the last one is a recurring problem where different browsers will add the ""https://"" automatically.

Is there an easy way to link an easy URL like ""bongable.cc"" to the Github.io address so that it loads faster and has less errors?

Also, I'm testing out the website on different browsers in their respective ""Private"" modes to avoid loading from the cache. Is this method of testing flawed? I might be tripping a little, but I foresee some customers quitting if the site doesn't load quick enough :/

Do I have to buy actual webhosting to get this to load correctly? All I'm really trying for right now is a simple site with a discord link and links to some documents that are also on Github.io.

webdev,Optimal Oauth flow?,"My web app has react frontend and java backend.
Will be using keycloak on the backend eventually.

Here's how the oauth flow would go: 
1. On the frontend user clicks authenticate which calls an auth endpoint on backend.

2. On the backend, a random state param is generated and what not. 
Then auth url is formed (with query params: state, clientId etc, and sent to auth provider for authentication code.
Redirection url is set as a backend endpoint.
The backend sends/redirects this url to the front end.

3. On the frontend the resource owner would be on the auth provider's auth page to either allow or decline the requested scopes.

4. Assuming the resource owner accepts, the auth code would be sent as query params with the backend redirect url. 

5. The backend endpoint verifies state param, auth code and obtains an auth token. Stores the auth token in db.

At this point, what does the frontend do to check if step 5 has been successfully executed since at step 4, the redirect url calls the backend endpoint and not the frontend endpoint.

I'm at a loss as how the flow should go after step 5.

webdev,Authentication with jwt,"Im learning about authentication with jwt on a nest backend and next front end.

Im a bit confused though and looking for guidance:

3). Backend sends token to frontend via response 
4). Front end stores token in cookies for authenticating with backend for future requests / private route access
5).  Front end decodes jwt for user ID at what point and why???

I've also read you shouldn't pass username and info through jwt because it's a security risk, but I also read so is passing it through the response object.... So how exactly does one securely move user data from DB to frontend without exposing it unnecessarily???

I'm using Docker Compose + Dozzle for such purposes to run batch of services and watch logs, but with this approach the file system can slow down a lot when live reload is enabled.

Recently I found out that there are Procfile and overmind, which allow to conveniently run several services at once with one command without virtualization. But logs are shown in a single console and it is not convenient to see what is going on (my application has a large business logic and a lot of communication back and forth, so a lot of logs).

UPD:

Combining [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) (Procfile launcher) and [logdy](https://logdy.dev/) (logs viewer from pipe to browser) can be working

webdev,How would Google selling Chrome stop its monopoly?,"Might be off-topic to this sub, but I don't know what other sub would have redditors with enough knowledge about the web to answer this correctly.

My understanding is that Google has tried to maintain a monopoly over the search engine market by making other companies use Google as the main search engine for their browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).

If that's the case, what's the point of having Google sell Chrome, the browser? There are plenty of other browsers out there -- Google doesn't hold a monopoly over the browser market. Chromium is a thing, yes, but neither Firefox nor Safari is Chromium based, and Chromium is open source anyway. The problem here is the ubiquity of 'Google' the search engine, not Chrome the browser.

TLDR: if what Google holds a monopoly over is the search engine that browsers use and not over browsers themselves, how does selling Chrome stop their monopoly?",cachehit_,1h491sj,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,2024-12-01 17:55:57,82,0.83,82,0,92,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h491sj

\- Search for images based on Title and search/sort based on tag(s)  
\- Roughly have similar interface shown for when I search and when I select an image

webdev,Scraping keywords from webpages - method suggestions wanted,"Hi All,

I'm making a keyword scraper in order to do some competitor research on the top google search results. I've come here to ask for your ideas on the best ways to extract the most important keywords from a page I'll detail what I'm currently doing below.

This is all done in python using Selenium and BeautifulSoup

1. Get the text from all visible elements
2. Delete the first header and all of the following elements: footers, navs and elements with ""aria-hidden=True""
3. Flattens all inline elements so that the text is all in block level elements -&gt; just done for ease of parsing
4. Then it creates 8 lists
   1. A list where each of the h1-6 elements are collected
   2. A list for roughly the first 200 words measured from the start of the first h1
   3. A list for all elements after the start of the first h1
5. I then return a dictionary to my keyword scraper which has all of the lists above plus the title, url and meta description

Then I run my langauge processing which is a combo of SciKit learn and SpaCy.

I have three methods currently working to extract keywords:

* TF-IDF -&gt; TfidfVectorizer from sklearn
* Noun-Phrase extraction -&gt; I'll post my matcher below but this is a custom pipeline for spaCy
* Named entity extraction -&gt; spaCy as well, super basic just collecting important types of named entities like person, product etc...

Here is my matcher:

    patterns = [
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Optional Adverb(s) + Adjective(s) + Noun(s)
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': 'ADV', 'OP': '*'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '+'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Nouns joined by coordinating conjunction
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'CCONJ'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Gerund + Noun
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': 'VERB', 'TAG': 'VBG'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Noun + Preposition + Optional Adjective + Noun
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'ADP'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '*'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # ¬†Noun + Hyphen + Verb/Noun

This collects a decent amount of keywords but I feel like it could be improved. Has anyone else approached this problem and has any advice on new methods I can try I'd love to hear about.

webdev,How I solved common Prisma ORM errors,"I have been using Prisma ORM for the last 2 years, and I have experience with troubleshooting different types of error.

In this post, I want to share it with you, so you don‚Äôt have to spend hours figuring out what I‚Äôve already learned.

**Why Prisma?**

I have been using Prisma to interact with the database for all my SaaS products. So far, I‚Äôve built six SaaS products, and I hope to build more in the future (some of them are [BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app), [Wuf](https://usewuf.com), [Userdesk](https://userdesk.io), [Inboxs](https://inboxs.io), [Hivoe](https://hivoe.com)).

I've used Prisma in Next.js web apps, node.js servers, and cron jobs.

The key goals of using Prisma are:

* keep under control your database schema
   * define tables and types
   * apply migrations
   * query your database with type safety
   * avoid typing errors
* protect from SQL injection
* leverage pooling

**Common issues**

Despite being a stable product, sometimes you can encounter some issues.

Below I describe two common errors:

* migration errors
* query errors

Let‚Äôs start with the first one.

**Error with data migrations**

Sometimes your migrations emit an error, that‚Äôs not very simple to debug, like this one.

    Error: ERROR: prepared statement ""s2"" does not exist

You usually get this error when you run `npx prisma db push` (apply your schema changes to the database) or `npx prisma generate` (generate the types from your schema).

But what does this mean?

This error happens when using a relational database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (one of the most popular, and advanced open-source SQL databases on the market).

Specifically, a prepared statement in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows you to execute a query plan that is prepared and stored by the database server for reuse. It improves performance and security, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values.

Prisma ORM leverages the prepared statements as part of its database query execution process, under the hood (but you don‚Äôt have to know or master prepared statements to use Prisma).

The main issues arise with the confusion between the different database connections string configurations, pooling and PgBouncer.

Let me go straight to the solution, then I explain you the different parts.

The main solution I‚Äôve found is to use two connection strings, one to run the migrations and the second for the execution of your web application / node.js server.

First, identify the correct connection strings for your database.

The connection string to run the migrations is the direct access to the database (no pooling or PgBouncer), like for instance

    postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

Save this connection string as an environment variable called `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.

    DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=""postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

Secondly, get the connection string with the pool, for instance:

    postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName

Get this connection string from your database hosting provider, the parameters might be different.

Save this connection string as an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL`.

    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

The second step is to update the Prisma configuration to use these two environment variables.

Open the file `schema.prisma` and update the section `datasource db` to include this:

    datasource db {
      provider  = ""postgresql""
      url       = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
      directUrl = env(""DATABASE_DIRECT_URL"")
    }

Now, run the usual commands like `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate` locally to ensure that everything is working correctly, and run your application locally.

If all is good, push the modifications to your hosting service and trigger a new deployment for the modifications to take effect.

Prisma is now correctly configured and you should not have the same issue again.

**Query performance issues**

Recently, I got the ""stack depth limit exceeded"" error message.

    PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid `prisma.table.findMany()` invocation: Error occurred during query execution: ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: ""54001"", message: ""stack depth limit exceeded"", severity: ""ERROR"", detail: None, column: None, hint: Some(""Increase the configuration parameter \""max_stack_depth\"" (currently 2048kB), after ensuring the platform's stack depth limit is adequate."") }), transient: false })

This means that the usage of memory exceeds the database configuration for a specific query.

I ran this SQL command on my database and found this value:

    SHOW max_stack_depth;
    ---
    2MB

I had a query that was returning 1900+ records to aggregate some values.

For each record I have to recalculate the sum of certain values.

When this happens you have two options:

* increase the `max_stack_depth` value in your database
* refactor the logic in the code to avoid to run that big query
* optimize the query

I tried to increase `max_stack_depth` because it was the quickest solution (not the best one), but my database is hosted on DigitalOcean and I didn‚Äôt have the permissions to run the `ALTER` command:

    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_stack_depth = '4MB';
    ---
    permission denied to set parameter ""max_stack_depth""

(I contacted DigitalOcean via a support ticket and they promptly provided a solution, I can alter the value using their web API).

Then, I started to analyze the problem.

The first thing I tried was to run the same query as plain SQL against the database using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and it perfectly worked.

This was suspicious, it means that probably Prisma was executing a query too complex and expensive.

Then, I refactored the code, using the Prisma method `$queryRaw` to run the same query, and it worked!

At this point, I didn‚Äôt want to manually define all the type for the values returned by the query, and I thought of using a new cool feature of Prisma called [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

This way I can run a Raw Query against the database with the types automatically generated by Prisma for me.

So, in the end, I refactored to code, and avoided to increase the value `max_stack_depth` that would have increased the memory consumption in general.

**Conclusion**

I hope that this post was useful, and it avoids you from spending hours on troubleshooting these kind of errors with Prisma.

Overall my experience with the tool has been very good and exciting, and I see how they are releasing new versions, features, and improvements.

You can find the [documentation of Prisma at this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs).

As a side note, I‚Äôm not affiliated with Prisma in any way, I‚Äôm just a happy user of the product.

webdev,Advice needed: Looking for a Freelancer to Build an AI-Powered LL.M.-Matching Website ‚Äì What Should I Look For?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently planning a website that helps users find the perfect matching offer on my site. The idea is to provide general information on the landing page, and then users can input their preferences via an AI chatbot (the best example i can find is Fiverr Neo). Based on their answers, the bot will suggest matching offers from a database. The rest of the site will offer detailed information about the individual offers.

I've already set up a WordPress site on google cloud and have a rough idea of how this could work technically. Now, I‚Äôm looking to hire a freelancer to bring this project to life. Before I proceed, I need some advice as i have never worked with freelancer before.

What should I look for in a freelancer?

What skills should they have? (e.g., WordPress, Dialogflow/OpenAI API, database integration, UX/UI design)

Are there specific certifications or portfolios I should check?

Should I hire someone specialized in AI, or will a skilled web developer suffice?



Budget and Timeline:

What‚Äôs a realistic budget for a project like this?

How long would it typically take to build, assuming the requirements are clear?



# Communication and Collaboration:

How can I ensure the freelancer understands my vision?

Should I prepare a detailed question catalog and database structure beforehand, or can they help me with that?



Technology and Maintenance:

What should I set up technically to ensure the site is easy to maintain in the long run?

Should I plan for ongoing collaboration with the freelancer for updates and maintenance?

How to stay safe and handle rules or password? 

I plan to run the project on WordPress , hosted on google cloud and integrate the AI chatbot (Dialogflow or OpenAI API), but I‚Äôm open to better alternatives if suggested.

Few days ago I had a talk with my dad; He asked me what happens with all the things I host once I am gone.

It's not a stupid question at all, I am young but anything can happen whether it's an accident or illness. I host several websites, a big app for a few companies and few other things which add up to a pretty big set. I have a VPS, and all the code is on my private github account. 

How do you folks make sure that everything can keep going smoothly if something were to happen to you? In my case, I am a solo dev and I have nobody else to take care of all that - do you have a private document with instructions on how to access things? Do you just share your github credentials with somebody? Do you even thing about such things?

webdev,I want to publish an Azure function from a Monorepo,"I am a long term Azure functions user and I have properly created, published, and maintained infrastructure that relied on Azure functions. My process is usually very similar.

I scaffold a basic Azure function (version 4, typescript, http trigger) from the Visual Studio Code Azure extension, I modify the default function with my code, build it with npm run build which is just a tsc command, run it with func start, test it by hitting the API with Postman, and then it's time to publish it to my Azure dashboard on my Azure account.

To publish this correctly functioning Azure function, I run a command like this that actually creates the function instance `az functionapp create --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --consumption-plan-location LOCATION_CODE --runtime node --name FUNCTION_AZURE_NAME --storage-account STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --os-type Linux` , then I run something like `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the root directory of the function repo to actually push up the function to my Azure account.

I recently decided that it would be more convenient to start putting all of my Azure functions into 1 monorepo. It was getting hard to keep track of all of the Github repos of single purpose Azure functions. I used NX to make this monorepo.

I found this project [https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure](https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure) , which allows you to scaffold Azure functions into an NX repo. I ran `npx create-nx-workspace@latest` to create the repo and followed the prompts to make a blank repo.

I made the Azure function in question with these commands:

    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:init FUNCTION_DIRECTORY
    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:new FUNCTION_NAME --project=FUNCTION_DIRECTORY --template=""HTTP trigger""

The function works great locally and I'm able to run it just fine with the NX supplied build and run commands. I can hit the APIs locally with Postman, just like when I scaffolded the functions with the Visual Studio Code extension. The problem is that when it comes time to publish the function to my Azure account, the NX supplied publish command does nothing. It doesn't even error, it succeeds with 0 functions uploaded to Azure.

My best theory on why this is happening lies in the build output structure for @ nxazure/func as opposed to the build structure of the Visual Studio Code extension. The Visual Studio Code build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsrc
        ‚îÇ   index.js
        ‚îÇ   index.js.map
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄfunctions
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

But the @ nxazure/func build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\packages\MYFUNCTIONDIRECTORYNAME\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    ‚îÇ   tsconfig.base.json
    ‚îÇ   
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄpackages
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄbTSOrdAddrsCreate
            ‚îÇ   _registerPaths.js
            ‚îÇ   _registerPaths.js.map        
            ‚îÇ   
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsrc
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄfunctions
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js    
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

With the `func` command, you only need to run `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the same directory as the dist folder and the function will be automatically uploaded to your Azure dashboard/account. Maybe that command expects the `dist` folder to have an `index.js` file within the first level of the folder? I'm not quite sure what the publish command is actually doing under the hood.

In short, how do I successfully execute a publish command for a function build in an NX monorepo that was scaffolded with @ nxazure/func? If there is no way to do it via a simple command from the parent directory of the function or at the root of the monorepo, is there a roundabout way to compile the function to a zip and use some command to upload that to my Azure account/dashboard?",warpanomaly,1h3y2eb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,2024-12-01 07:31:58,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3y2eb

webdev,"Tried building a critical and complex home page using several AI autocomplete tools, and here are my findings","( i am hoping, this is useful for this group, and if its not , i am happy to take it down )

I used BlackBox AI, V0, and Claude simultaneously. I have paid subscriptions for V0, Claude, and ChatGPT, while BlackBox seems to use ChatGPT by default without linking it to my chat gpt account.

**Winner:**¬†For me, Claude was the clear winner, though it‚Äôs missing a few features compared to the others.

**What I learned about time savings:**¬†I‚Äôm not great at creative coding from scratch, so using these tools made things much easier. It would have taken me 3 workdays to achieve what I did in a 4-hour session split between the tools. Although AI-generated code still needs review‚ÄîI wouldn't fully trust it‚Äîmaking things responsive using AI saved significant time compared to if I had written everything manually or cleaned up an HTML template. Going forward, I think I can be 3x more productive with Claude, especially now that it understands my project context.

**BlackBox AI:**¬†The main reason to explore BlackBox AI was its VS Code integration, which the others don‚Äôt offer. I started generating code on the website, then moved to the VS Code extension. Unfortunately, even with the extension, the improvement process was slow, and ultimately it delivered about 1/10th of the results of Claude or V0.

**Advantages:**¬†Easy code export, since everything‚Äôs already local.

**V0:**¬†V0 feels like me‚Äîit gets overwhelmed and forgets past discussions. Fixing a bug at one step only to see it return after another adjustment was a common frustration. The interface is clean, and the ability to resize the screen was useful for comparing mobile vs. desktop views. However, some persistent issues included:

* Compilation errors were frequent, though reporting them usually led to fixes. Ideally, it should self-correct.
* Filters would sometimes render incorrectly after a few more feature additions.
* Exporting code is made unnecessarily difficult. It‚Äôs not much better in Claude, but with V0 it seems intentional.
* Deployment is easy but seems intended to lock users into the V0 ecosystem, which becomes problematic when scaling to 100-200 files, no more easy way to export except 1 file at a time.

**Claude:**¬†Claude‚Äôs UI is cleaner, and it understands my requests better, making adjustments seamless. There were no compilation errors, and changes were stable. The output was visually clearer, and I'm starting to trust the quality of the changes it makes. Although export isn‚Äôt straightforward.

Overall, Claude‚Äôs consistency and quality make it my preferred tool. It‚Äôs stable, efficient, and I think I can use it to be significantly more productive moving forward.",HurryFormal7067,1h3webg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,2024-12-01 05:41:26,0,0.47,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3webg

Bonsai-CLI will streamline web development for agencies or solo developers. I think it will truly 10-100x my development speed, for websites or web apps.

Demo + live-stream: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM1V1IjR96E&amp;ab\_channel=JackalopeLabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM1V1IjR96E&amp;ab_channel=JackalopeLabs)

Bonsai-CLI allows you to generate a beautiful web app in seconds, using pre-built and designed Tailwind/Alpine components. All the copy, images, layouts, components, templates, styles can be configured by AI in a matter of seconds.

It‚Äôs built specifically for Roots WP stack at the moment, in the future it could support more stacks.

Once you have a [Roots.io](http://Roots.io) site up running, you can run two commands to create a new landing page‚Äì

`wp acorn bonsai:init`

webdev,"Constructively criticize my CV, please.","Hi, everyone.

I just permanently moved to the US and getting ready to apply for Mid Frontend developer positions (React).  
I would like hear your honest opinion on my CV

[Resume | CV](https://preview.redd.it/jwftnyeor34e1.jpg?width=1224&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7ef758fa294f3521f7acfae5b12f2cd2c0ea1ca)

**Here is what I did:**  
\- I tried following convention of telling ""What I did"" and ""how did if affect company I work for"".  
\- English is not my first language, so ChatGPT was involved to ""sound professional"".  
\- I've Ignored the education section, since my Bachelor is in music, and that's not related to IT.

**What I am curious about:**

1. For me it looks like too many bullet point given, but all took important place in the job, would you get rid of something?
2. I listed things like setting up VPS and NginX, does that have any influence for a frontend position?
3. Since ChatGPT was used, is it obvious for a native? Would you change wordings?
4. I finished CS50x course by Harvard a year ago and I have their free certificate, does it count as a proper education and will it be best to include it in this CV?
5. Skills section, some of the things look funny to me, should I keep simple things like CSS and HTML in it or remove them, anything big missing?
6. I don't have any pet projects to show off on my github, do they look for it for a Middle position, if yes, then what kind of projects would that be?
7.

webdev,Not another Slack Git integration,"While there are plenty of Slack-GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab integrations out there, many miss one important aspect.

They act as notification channels (like emails)‚Äîwhich is helpful for many teams‚Äîbut they still leave a lot for teams to figure out themselves, such as fair code review distribution, back-and-forth communication (like I left new comments - I replied to your comments) and reminders.

This is what ReviewNudgeBot offers on top of very convenient and noise-free notifications:

* **Reminders for reviewers blocking PR progress**: When a PR is left without a review, reviewers‚Äô comments are replied to, or a new commit is pushed to the PR, reviewers are reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Reminders for authors blocking PR progress**: When reviewers request changes, new comments are added to a PR, or a build fails, the author is reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Auto-assign reviewer**: After a few team reminders to review a PR, the bot selects specific reviewers and reminds them to review the PR. This helps resolve the bystander effect.
* **Escalate notification**: The bot can be configured to notify a manager if a PR sits for too long without reviews.

And there are more features!

webdev,Is it fine to find your own way of a ‚Äòworkaround‚Äô?,"Hey guys,

I am currently developing a next js website where it has some forms using shadcn/ui

So one of the form fields has countries list, which are over 170 elements in an array. While creating them with shadcn combobox or select, the website lags for a second because of the number of the html elements loaded for each country, but doesn‚Äôt lag on normal &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;, however I need to have custom styling for it.

I did some research and came across something called virtualization with tanstack or react-window, but applying them threw many errors and it was just a headache

So what I did is, stored the array in a state with a slice(0,10) and once opened, I set the state to fill all of the countries.

Now this method works well, the combobox doesn‚Äôt lag, and everything is smooth, but is this fine to do?

I mean definitely there are better practices than what I did, but is this fine to continue with or should I reconsider my approach?

Sometimes things work smoothly this way, but makes me feel stupid in a world full of genius developers.

webdev,[Project Showcase] No Code Modular Web Page Creator,"Hello all,

I create a platform slatesource.com which allows users to create web pages easily by using modules.

It took a long time to develop the concept and tweak the foundations to get to a point where managing those modules are quite easy. Currently only simple tabs are developed in the prototype such as Overview, Tasks or Timeline but in the future I plan to release more complex tabs such as Transactions, Shop, Teams, etc.. 

Imagine a website being built as easily as going grocery shopping and just grabbing the tabs you need. Building a non profit organisation? Get some Overview and Goals. Startup? Roadmap + Team. Photography Portfolio? Gallery + Links. Etc..

If you would like to follow the project please checkout Slatesource here on reddit or Youtube, Tiktok or Instagram!

PS: a good example I like to share is my photography portfolio: https://slatesource.com/s/111

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I made a simple blindfold chess app,"Hi everyone, I'd like to share a side project I've been working on: [Blindfold Chess](http://playblindfoldchess.com).

**What is this app?**

It's a chess app that doesn't have a board! Play chess against the AI (driven by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)), but you must visualize the board in your head. The app provides menu-like inputs to select what pieces to move and where to move them, but it doesn't give any hints as to where the pieces are or what moves they can make. When the game's over, you can copy the moves to the clipboard and open them in an app that lets you visualize chess games.

**Why I made this app**

I learned how to play chess as a child, but I only started actually playing about two years ago. I studied a few openings back then and read two introductory books, but I've mainly just been playing casually. After a few months of playing, I challenged chat gpt to play a game of chess, and instead of showing a chessboard, it just said ""e4"". That was my first introduction to blindfold chess, and I found it highly challenging but not impossible to visualize the board, so I was interested in improving that skill. Unfortunately, chat gpt wasn't able to play coherent games and would inevitably begin making illegal moves as a game progresses.

I made my own chess AI a while back after and used that to play blindfold chess, but I've abandoned that project. Recently, after about a year or so since that last project, I began this. I'm a bit out of practice at the moment, but I expect that I'll improve over time so long as I play a game every day or so.

Surprisingly, I haven't found any apps that do what this does: provide a simple interface for playing blindfold chess. It's certainly niche, but I don't think it's so niche to the point that nobody would have made this simply for that reason. In any case, I'm curious to see if it actually gains adoption, or if I'm the only one who will actually use this on a regular basis.

**Future plans**

First and foremost, once the app has matured a bit, I'm going to make an Android app, then work to make an Android smartwatch app. I've done some preliminary performance tests and have determined that, if nothing else, a Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartwatch can handle the game in easy mode without taking too long to make moves.

After I improve my ability to play blindfold chess, I'd like to write up an article or two that discusses tactics and strategies to help you visualize the board. If there's interest, I might add a feature to play another human locally (i.e., you'd pass them the phone and they'd input their move). Technically, if two people are playing blindfold chess, they wouldn't need the phone at all, but if they disagree about where certain pieces are, the phone would provide an answer to that. I don't think I'll implement a capability to play online because of how easy it would be to cheat, but if people actually play on this app and request it, I'd consider adding it.

I'd also like to add a feature to speak moves and have the system recognize and execute them, but that's a lower priority.",brandon-quinn-author,1h3e04o,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,2024-11-30 14:44:15,4,0.83,4,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1h3e04o
webdev,PSA: You are good enough !,"I am not sure why I felt compelled to write this post.

Perhaps it is the long unemployment stint I have been on and the rough interview loops I've been enduring or maybe I just needed the cathartic release.

Either way, I want to take those who are interested down memory lane with me and reflect on a past experience of mine that helps me through tough times like these.

It all started many years ago when I worked at a company with another developer. Lets call him Robert. Robert was by no means a super star developer but he was an amazingly nice person and was a pleasure to work with.

However, he did not show qualities I would expect of a top developer.  No great understanding of CS. Not an algorithmic god. Minimal knowledge of craftmanship aspects in software. No extensive knowledge of building systems. He was just an everyday developer.

One day Robert gets called by a FANG adjacent recruiter telling him that a team is interested in hiring him.

What was different about this situation was the recruiter did not send him through the front door.  His interview loop consisted of 3 calls. 1 recruiter screen, 1 call with the hiring manager, 1 call with the wider team.

He did not have to endure a single technical round (I don't want to go into the circumstances of why as I don't want to dox myself)

He of course takes this offer and starts a month later. I was very happy for him and wished him the best and that was that.

Fast forward to today. I am sitting here going through the trenches. 6 round loops. OA, code, system design, behavioural. The whole sh\*t fest.

Occasionally, the doubts creep in. Am I good enough ? should I throw in the towel and go into the #trades ? is my experience worthless ?

Then I always think back to our boy Robert.

Roberts rare and unique story showed me that a vast number of developers can likely excel in any position given the chance (even big tech).

I just wanted to say that you are good enough.

The interview practices we endure are nothing more than a filter to whittle down the demand.

When you fail an interview you are doing just that, failing a filter. It has no bearing on you, your ability, or your identity. Like Robert, if you could jump past all the interview mess you would be just fine (As an aside, I believe that Robert would likely not have made it through the traditional interview loop for the same position.)

Anyways, I hope you liked my story and wish you all the best if you are going through it also.

Lastly, I realise this post comes across bitter and jealous. It is not my intention (although perhaps I am a little). I am just a beaten-down dev struggling through it. I wish Robert the best and hope he is happy and killing it.",Invisible_Wetface,1h3deuo,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,2024-11-30 14:13:55,48,0.79,48,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3deuo

webdev,New technology in prod fears,"I'm wondering if anyone else has fears of trying new tech in prod. I'm not just talking about trying out a new library. I'm talking about standing up stuff that you've never really used in prod before.

I feel like I can play around with new tech locally but I always fear that there must be some prod specific stuff that I'm missing. Extra load revealing issues, incorrect assumptions made, config stuff that I'm expected to know but don't, etc. I tend to use stuff I'm familiar with just because there are some bugs that have been really hard to figure out. Managers have asked before *how* a bug could ***possibly*** be introduced, and the thought of saying, ""eh, this is just my first time using it and I'm learning"" sounds like a good way to get on someone's shitty developer list. Most managers that I've had seem to think that any bug is just completely unacceptable, so the thought of admitting to incompetence or ignorance seems like out of the question.

Do most of you just stick with shit you know, or do you take the plunge if you think something might be better? Or go with something new that might work just as well but also save some paint points from existing tech? I'm not talking about going with new stuff just because it's new.

  
**Example**

I used to work at a place with multiple applications. I was talking to someone on another team in the enterprise one day about their architecture. This team literally didn't use a load balancer to load balance between different servers. They literally made separate URLs for the internal team to use. If one server went down, they would launch up the other and tell the internal customers to go the other URL. Load balancing is SO basic and it used to strike me as extremely weird that they wouldn't just add that in. I can imagine that it might be really scary for them though because of how critical the app was, and you could really screw up production if you messed up your session management setup. You might set up the load balancer and show that you're hitting the servers and that the website is working well, and then totally not do anything about session management. It hits production and then it's a disaster! Ok - you see errors and then you just shut down the other servers and you're pretty much back where you started.

webdev,Common data fetching in a layout and a page in ReactJS,"I have been thinking about data fetching of front end. Suppose you have

\- Layout: it resource A to render a sidebar

\- Page: it is in the layout. It needs resource A and B

Resource is stored globally in an app (with whatever, Redux or Context). Resource A may be fetched again on a user event like when \`userId\` changes.  
Page A should not know what layout fetches, vice versa. They should care only data they need.

How is it possible to fetch resource A only once?

If you put this \`useEffect\` in a layout and a page, it fetches when \`userId\` changes. A problem is that they may race in a layout and a page. They may run simultaneously.

\`\`\`  
useEffect(() =&gt; {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}, \[dispatch, userId\]);

\`\`\`

Putting another \`useEffect \` does not seem to solve a problem. You will not know when \`useEffect\` runs, no matter it is in a layout or in a page. If only a page waits until layout finishes loading, it would work, but it does not.

\`\`\`

useEffect(() =&gt; {

if (resourceAStatus === 'idle') {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}

}, \[dispatch, resourceAStatus \]);

\`\`\`

**Income Proof** \- Just wanted to post a proof of income, cause i know people can make things up, don't want anyone to feel like they are waisting their time. This is a screen shot from one of my accounts that shows a few sources of income, but I have others. All from software development:

**Repost Story:**

Back in 2017, I was fresh out of highschool, not a dollar to my name. I had just signed up for the first semester of college as a CS student when disaster struck my family. Mom and dad both lost their jobs and became deathly sick to the point that they were unable to work. As a result, we became homeless and had to move in with some family friends.

I was working at a barista at Dunkin Doughnuts at the time, my day would consist of waking up at unglodly hours of the morning to catch the bus before the sun came up for my morning shift. After work I would study coding online and work on my college classes.¬†

One day I came home and got the call that my mom had been admitted to the hospital because she was minutes away from having a stroke and her lungs were filled with blood clots. I knew it was either make money or bust, so I started applying to hundreds of coding jobs while studying on sites like pluralsight to prepare. After hundreds of submissions, I finally got a callback for an interview.

I was nervous, stumbling my words, After an hour of coding, I got it to work. I went home, and recieved a callback the next day with an offer for the job.

There I was, a 19 year old homeless broke kid who had just landed his first real job in tech.

Since them I've mannaged to work for some big name companies like Hulu+, Disney, and Warner bros and launched a successful software business, I dropped out of college when I got the first job offer as a sophmore in college. I don't have a degree, or any special certifications, parents didn't give me any money.

I found that when I talk with people about my story in person they are very interested, so I figured I'd post online to see if my expereince can help anyone else learn from it so ask away.

webdev,"Is front end development dying [NOT duplicate, serious topic]","I'm sure there are lots of more exprienced developers out there, since I was professionally in the industry for 3 years now and I was working freelance before but things have gone much worse from my perspective. 

I'm not going to start AI will make us homeless stuff, but the way is front end viewed is the problem.

I think it is a nail in the coffin for this field. imagine this. so, we have backend colleagues. they are getting paid more than us and more important than that, they have PRESTIGE. 

even if they write a simple SELECT query, the employer and others think that it is a rocket science or something, but for a front end developers... "" it is just a simple button bro "". 

it almost took me 2 months to optimize the prescription section of our medical web app. we've had heavy lists and extremely dynamic forms and technical challenges.. but we've done something extremely good. 

and now after 2 months the only thing I heard from my boss was "" this was the least you can do, it is just a simple button "" 

and I don't blame him to be fair. this is what most of the industry thinks. 

  
I feel like the blue collar part of the developer society. you took the most effort, get paid less and no one values your job. 

and even worse than that, compared to Java or C# (Scala or .NET Core), front end is just a shit party! no rules, no strong foundation and god forbid for example if Vercel rolls out a new update and changes the whole structure of the framework! 

on the other hand, from my personal experience, I really enjoy reading .NET core documents. everything is very well structured and you don't have to give blow job  for AI or Stackoverflow developers to get your answer.

just a great Microsoft community. 

  
so, my question is... is it worth it? really after 3 years and couple years of freelance, I just started to regret my choice. 

it was like that in 2016 let's say...

webdev,Issue with vertically centered content shifting on wrap,"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm stuck and was hoping someone could help. Essentially, I have a splash/landing page with a logo. The logo is an SVG, it's vertically and horizontally centered. That all works great.

I have a little JavaScript that types in a byline type description under it. It's short. But on mobile screens, it wraps to the next line, which is fine. Only issue is that when it wraps, the element (H1) then shifts the logo above it upwards so the image, and now two lines of text are all vertically centered.

I'd like the text to just go downwards when wrapping without pushing the group of the content upwards.

Here's what I have currently. We're using Bootstrap 5.

Edit: I can see that putting the JS inside the section groups it with the logo to be centered, but we've tried it outside as well and same.

    .landing .landing-logo {

webdev,New company has clients point by nameserver instead of A record? There has to be a better way.,"Hey everyone, I recently started working at a website development company and ran into something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Here‚Äôs the situation:

When we build a website for a client, we ask them to point their domain to our **nameservers** so the website can go live. This means we end up managing their entire DNS, even though we‚Äôre just the website provider. It's an extra burden, especially when clients request changes for things like email or subdomains.

I asked why we don‚Äôt just have clients point their domain to our server using an **A record**, and here‚Äôs the explanation I got:

‚ÄúIf we ever need to change our server‚Äôs IP address (which has happened a couple of times), all clients would need to update their A record to the new IP. That‚Äôs impractical with thousands of clients. Nameservers avoid this issue because we can make IP changes behind the scenes without involving the client.‚Äù

webdev,Trying to break out of the field while simultaneously unemployed. Advise?,"I am a senior web dev (NodeJS, RoR) that has recently lost their job unexpectedly for the first time in forever. I live in the EU, in a country that does not have a lot of jobs, and what little can be found has a lot of competition, is underpaid, and you get worked to the bone. Up until this point I was working fully remote for other EU companies and was starting to make a decent living as an EM. When I lost my job I tried to keep that momentum going, but long story short, it's quite difficult and there is higher need for developers than there is for other roles.

I used my unemployment time to pick up Python which turned out great, successfully acing two different coding challenges and reaching the next stage in the pipeline. However, it seems that growing into Python further would involve delving into pretty specific and uninteresting libraries (django, or numpy or pandas).

Context over, now to the matter at hand. I am quite tired of web dev. It's why I ventured into Python in the first place. With time on my hands, I have it in me to pick up another language. To spare you the details, I believe these are the two avenues that might make sense:

\- Refresh in-demand, web only languages. This obviously snuffs out what little soul I have left. Refresh PHP. Or refresh NodeJS/TypeScript. Much better than PHP, but still quite boring. There are a lot of PHP, NodeJS, RoR jobs, but there are also a lot of candidates.

\- Try my hand at C#. Interesting, can think of very enticing projects! I am confident I could pick it up. Potentially moves me away from web dev. But my CV has no single a single speck of C#, so I would not be looked as a solid candidate.

Here‚Äôs my current approach: I separate a quantity/time bar chart into two components: quantity and time. Each component is tied to its own plugin for different data sources (SQL, API, IoT).

webdev,Which CMS to use?,"Hi, I'm seeking advice on which CMS to use.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Background**


I am a content creator and have limited knowledge on HTML and CSS.


&amp;nbsp;
 

I currently have a website built by myself from scratch using Wordpress. I wish to use other CMS as Wordpress seems too cluttered and messy with so many 3rd-party plugins being installed. There is lack of cohesiveness in design and operations.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Needs**


The website will be mainly an educational website with articles, videos and podcasts. Events will also be shown on the website for people to register.


&amp;nbsp;
 

Will be good if as many of the following items are built-in as possible instead of having to install plugin after plugin.


&amp;nbsp;
 

1) Native SEO


Don't want to wade through tons of SEO plugins, with each professing their way is the best way, just to get basic SEO done.


&amp;nbsp;
 

2) Forms


Built-in form functionality to collect feedback and to sign up for newsletters and memberships.


&amp;nbsp;
 

3) Memberships


I did not create memberships for the current website and would like to do so for the new website as I want to differentiate content between registered members and public.


&amp;nbsp;
 

4) Newsletters


For sending regular newsletters to members and people who sign up for them.


&amp;nbsp;
 

5) Integrations


Be able to integrate easily with other services like Nextcloud (for external storage, linking of videos, audio files &amp; images), Eventbrite (for booking of events created on Eventbrite) and social media platforms like Youtube, Instagram &amp; Tiktok (to showcase my videos and playlists posted on these platforms).


&amp;nbsp;
 

6) Localization


Able to have a multilingual website in English &amp; Chinese.


&amp;nbsp;
 

7) Mobile apps


Able to create mobile version of the website for Android &amp; iOS. Not going to do Native apps as they are too costly. So, I'm guessing I need to use headless CMS for this. However, I have read that Drupal can be Progressively Decoupled to allow for more Editoral needs and less Developer needs. Are there other CMS that can done this way? ([Source](https://medium.com/@opensenselabs/a-complete-guide-on-fully-decoupled-drupal-56fd283fcd60))



&amp;nbsp;
 

Any programming language is fine so long as the CMS can fulfill as many of the above items as possible.

webdev,A Browser-Based Solution for Reusable Libraries and Frameworks?,"Hey, I‚Äôm no expert, but I think I‚Äôve stumbled on a genius idea:

What if browsers offered to store commonly used libraries and frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) locally instead of downloading them repeatedly for each website?

Here‚Äôs the idea:

* The browser could cache reusable libraries, especially popular ones like CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries.
* If a website uses modified or custom classes, the browser could detect this and ensure they aren't overridden. (web devs should notify the browser in headers or something to not override)
* For JavaScript, core functions of libraries could be stored in the browser, while any additional custom code gets bundled and served as usual. ( again, devs should notify the browser, and split their code too for this purpose)

This could save tons of bandwidth and improve loading speeds, with only small updates needed for library changes, and I believe that this is the future of web dev speed.

As you see. The problem here is Dev is the source of truth but at any given time it can have a multitude of projects/bug fixes etc that haven't been validated by QA.

So, when releasing into Prod, you have to pick a Dev PR that was approved by QA... but then that build still could have items unapproved in it.

It's a mess.

It was setup before I came. So whatever the reason, it's lost in time.

Because of costs, I think setting up another environment is not possible.

What is your process using github action?

webdev,"Switching from BootstrapVue (Bootstrap v4): Suggestions for a Modern, Lightweight UI Library?","Hey everyone!

We're looking to replace our current component library, which is built with **BootstrapVue**. The main reasons for the switch are:

1. **Incompatibility with Vue3**
2. BootstrapVue uses **Bootstrap v4** under the hood which is very heavy-weight as it still uses jQuery.

We already use **TailwindCSS** and **SCSS** in our development, so we're considering **shadcn** as a potential replacement. One key requirement is that the new library must be **heavily customizable** to help us maintain the look and feel of the Bootstrap components we're currently using.

We also need it to support:

* Accessible components
* Responsive design
* Vue3 compatibility
* Interactive Components (Modals, Dropdowns, etc.)
* Animations and Transitions
* Comprehensive Documentation and Active Community
* Potentially Dark Mode Support

Does anyone have experience using shadcn in a Vue3 + Tailwind environment? Are there other UI libraries or frameworks you'd recommend that offer a good balance between performance, customization, and accessibility?

webdev,Question about GDPR and CCPA and cookie banners,"I'm making an startup that collects analytics and marketing data, [https://storyteller.so](https://storyteller.so)

The whole point of the app is to collect that data in-house, not using 3rd party tools or sending it to different providers.

From my understanding, the fact that the app is collecting information it requires to function, and isn't using 3rd party collection, it should be compliant to both laws without the need for a bunch of ""accept cookie"" banners.

It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.

I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in  California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.



EDIT::: So I asked chatGPT but I dont knwo if I can trust it's answer, but it seems reasonable.

If your site and app use cookies **only for essential purposes**, such as maintaining user sessions and tracking which A/B testing version a user is seeing, and you gather analytics directly on your own backend without setting additional cookies for these purposes, your GDPR and CCPA obligations may differ:

# GDPR Considerations

1. **Essential Cookies**: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations) are generally considered ""strictly necessary."" Under GDPR, **strictly necessary cookies do not require user consent**. However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.
2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:
   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).
   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.
   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.
3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).

# CCPA Considerations

1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:
   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.
   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.
2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.

# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?

* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.
* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:
   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).
   * The purposes for which the data is processed.
   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).

# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance

1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:
   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).
   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).
   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).
2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don‚Äôt use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.
3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.

By sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",IAmRules,1h21jfl,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,2024-11-28 17:49:14,0,0.5,0,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h21jfl

So your marketing effort does everything about building your brand image and awareness. You don't need a site to present your business informations. And you can sell through chat.

How would a company, after a transaction (assuming that is the point of the 30 days), handle providing receipts to the end user beyond 30 days? I would assume an end user would still want to be able to verify what address a product was sent to beyond that time frame and a company probably would want to store that address longer to deal with incorrect sending/re-sending reppacements/etc. so how do they accomplish this?

Or are the storage terms there to prevent people from requesting all addresses in the platform and storing a copy of them all indefinitely (alleviating the need to use the platform) - more of a gotcha if needed?

I immediately lost the motivation to code it again. Still, I coded it with some minor improvements (not noticeable at first glance). Then the client insisted that they wanted it *exactly* like the new Figma design. I did that too, but replicating it was nearly impossible because of how poorly structured the Figma file was.

Edit:
I've been building websites mainly for a major public institution. Most of my experience is with php and JavaScript, and I've dabbled with many other languages and techniques.

EDIT 2:
Wow, thanks everyone! There's some sound advice and useful wisdom here. I really appreciate your thoughtful and useful responses.

And thanks to everyone who validated that it's possible to have deep experience in the field and not having experience with one of the gazzillion tools and techniques that are out there.

As an aside: a few years after I got into this field, the browser wars happened. Things got really messy for awhile. We had to deal with variations in browsers that were pretty confusing. New tools were rising that were helpful. But it was a hard time to know whether any path was a good one. I assumed things would get simpler with time. But they didn't. Web development is much more complex now than ever. Not so much in terms of code, but in the vast array of tools, options, techniques, vendors and so on. It's an exciting time, but also one of peril and pressure. Burnout is real. It has specific symptoms. Take care of yourselves. Be kind to yourself. Get some rest. Hang in there.

webdev,Misleading salary offers in job opportunities,"I've been looking for a new job for the past month. I finally found the perfect match, but on the way there, I couldn't help but notice something that is increasingly used by firms/recruiters: huge salary offers, that lead nowhere.

A bit of context: I'm currently applying as a lead Dev in France/Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I saw a job offer in Paris, for an American company.

Remote 1 day/week. Fine by me, I like being onsite.

Salary ? 72k to 150k, based on experience.

Their stack is interesting, the product looks nice, I give it a go. 

It's a five step process, with 3 interviews, a peer coding session, and at-home assignment that took me roughly 5 hours. Last Friday, they came back to me: they want me on the team. So, 4th interview with my future manager and HR. Manager tells me that I aced the tests, and they'd like to start ASAP. 

Their offer ? 75K.

This is not the first time I see this kind of behaviour, so I asked frankly: I aced all tests, and showed interest in your product, and had a great human fit with everyone I talked to. We share the same values when it comes to both human and professional responsibilities. So, how comes I'm not getting the 150k salary ?

To which they answered that ""This salary is only for applicants who live in the bay area, since the cost of living is way higher there"". So, I turned down the job, because the offer they gave me was lower than my current salary. Plus, I felt like after showing so much investment in their process, this was basically a huge red flag.

Has anyone ever faced this ?

webdev,How to reduce LCP,"Hello,

I am stuck at 92/100 performance score on mobile devices for my website [nextbestai.com](http://nextbestai.com)

To get to this score was rough, and I have done all I can think of in terms of cache and using lightweight builders like elementor and blocksy. 

Now from the pagespeed insights it seems the issue comes from LCP , more specifically the H1 which covers quite a big chunk of space over the fold. I have tried editing, simplifying it, but it still won't get my score higher / lower the LCP.

What am I missing? 

Any tips are appreciated.

webdev,How to Handle Currency Conversion and Rounding Issues on a Global Platform?,"`To Be fair i am not a native English speaker so took some help from chat gpt for rewirting my problem to make it less painfull for you guys to read. my apologies` 

  
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm working on a platform where service providers can list their offerings, and users from around the world can book them. We support multiple currencies, but our backend stores everything in USD for consistency. I‚Äôm facing a few challenges with pricing, conversion, and rounding, and I‚Äôm curious how others handle similar issues.

Here‚Äôs the setup:

1. A service provider creates a package with an hourly rate in their local currency (e.g., 100 GBP).
2. The backend converts the price to USD using the current exchange rate (e.g., 100 GBP ‚Üí 124.56 USD).
3. Users see the price in their local currency, rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 125 USD).

Now the issues:

1. **Rounding Discrepancies**:
   * If the user books a package for 3 hours, they see¬†`125 * 3 = 375 USD`. But the backend calculates¬†`124.56 * 3 = 373.68 USD`. This mismatch confuses users.
   * If I always round on the frontend, the service provider might receive less than they expected.
2. **Currency Volatility**:
   * Exchange rates change over time. Locking the rate at the time of booking solves this for transactions, but I‚Äôm unsure how to handle edge cases, like refunds after months of exchange rate changes.
3. **Adding New Currencies**:
   * Storing prices in every currency a user might use isn‚Äôt scalable. If we add a new currency later, recalculating and storing all previous package prices in the new currency seems impractical.

**Questions for the Community**:

1. How do platforms like Airbnb or Fiverr handle pricing and rounding across currencies?
2. Is there a better way to deal with rounding discrepancies without overpaying/underpaying either party?
3. Are there efficient ways to handle refunds in multi-currency setups when exchange rates fluctuate?
4. Any scalable strategies for introducing new currencies without recalculating older data?

Would love to hear how you‚Äôve tackled similar issues or any creative ideas you might have!

webdev,"Quit to build WebDev freelancing, where is my actual value?","Apologies if you see my rant in different subreddits, I‚Äôve cross checked and ensured that my post obey‚Äôs all guidelines.¬†

I‚Äôll preface by saying I like to think I‚Äôm realistic not optimistic nor pessimistic and not coming on here to say some bs like time to make $5k a week off converting a client.



**Background:**¬†

(Pre) Background Summary: Boss made a comment so vulgar about my personal life I quit on the spot. Time to take a risk.¬†



Been scheming on starting freelance Web Design for 6 months now learning the ins and outs of Elementor and overall web design. Had a rude awakening realising that I‚Äôm essentially making life 6x as hard for me as I look now and my websites are Webflow websites created in Elementor when it comes to animation and overall feeling. Been researching and seems smart enough to switch over to Webflow and learning curve should be doable as I‚Äôll be rebuilding a portfolio and own website in Webflow and taking Christmas period whilst businesses sleep to understand everything about where I need to be. Decided I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be touching E-Commerce clients as that‚Äôs asking for trouble and in terms of restrictions for what I can provide with websites. Nothing with user accounts/logins and essentially just have a CTA and booking components.¬†



**Problem:**¬†

A pretty website doesn‚Äôt sell‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt consider this endeavour if I didn‚Äôt currently work in corporate sales handling anywhere from $2000 to $50,000 deals from straight cold calling. My point is I understand you‚Äôre never in the business of selling a product to a company, you‚Äôre selling a tool that provides value and generates them new revenue.

So whether I like it or not I‚Äôm essentially selling a form of marketing. At the end of the day my passion is web design and I want to keep as close to that as possible as I can without locking myself out of the profit party filled with web designers that sell a website as part of a digital marketing package.¬†

I understand Webflow has SEO embedded but I can already see the clients face when they‚Äôve heard SEO SEO SEO SEO SEO a dozen times and that is my only bullet for how investing in me building them a new website generates them more revenue.¬†



**Question:**¬†

My question is what angle for SMBs should I take to ensure I can confidently say they‚Äôre investment is going to pay itself off that isn‚Äôt shying too far away from designing on Webflow and entering the ‚ÄòaLL iN OnE DiGiTaL MaRkEtiNg sPeCiAl‚Äô where I‚Äôm handling their google and meta ads etc. Just super intrigued as to how delusional I‚Äôm being or if there are people converting half decent clients essentially off straight web design as I more than understand the $500-1000 website motto is asking for trouble and headaches from cheapskate customers.¬†



Greatly appreciate any advice as I am as far as I can get in terms of throwing myself into the deep end and have no option but to go out and go get it.¬†",maxo6k,1h0yyro,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,2024-11-27 07:32:36,9,0.66,9,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0yyro

With many years of desktop application development, this is my first time working with web development and specifically ==&gt; deploying a web app. I'm unfamiliar with the process and which hosting services are the most reliable.

I'm trying to figure out the most practical hosting for a 'low-traffic app'.

webdev,Is there a catch here? Why choose DigitalOcean when Hosting*r offers so much more?,"I‚Äôve been comparing hosting options for the early stages of a social network project. I came across two options that seem wildly different in terms of the resources they offer:

|**Specification**|**DigitalOcean Basic (2 vCPUs, 2GB)**|Hosting\*r KVM8 (8 vCPUs, 32GB)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**vCPUs**|2|8|

|**Disk Space**|60 GB SSD|400 GB NVMe SSD|
|**Bandwidth**|3 TB/month|32 TB/month|
|**Cost**|$18/month|$20/month|

The resources offered by Hosting&amp;r are so much higher that it seems too good to be true. I get that there‚Äôs likely a difference in quality.

webdev,Asking for a webdev role sanity check,"I was hoping I could get some thoughts and observations about my current position and role. It doesn't make sense to me that my company is run this way, but here I am. 

We are an e-Commerce company (with a couple physical retail locations) that does about $15m a year through our Shopify website. We also do almost that much through Amazon. We have maybe 110 employees, most of which are in product development and fulfillment. 

I am the sole developer in the company. We have 1 IT guy, who helps run Netsuite as well as all IT functions. We have a Tech Manager who just started and is the 3rd one we've had in a year, who will mostly own Netsuite. I seldom speak with these people as our roles don't overlap.

I do *everything* regarding the website. I am a Front End Dev by training with 18 years experience (both in agencies and ecommerce). So, obviously I manage the functionality and look/feel of our site. I also build &amp; launch all of our products in Shopify (800+ SKUs), as well as maintain all of their information/images. I build all of the themes to swap for different site changes, promos or product launches. I build all of the discounts and promotions and upsells.  I own probably 25 of the 3rd party apps we have installed in our store to add functionality, meaning I am the point of contact if any of them have an issue. Search, cart, bundles, reviews, subscriptions, Klaviyo, etc. 

Our Shopify store was built by an agency 2 years ago, yet somehow I was not involved in that process. I was tasked with keeping our previous store running. The agency customized a ton of code because the our people involved *had* to have this or that functionality (most of which are no longer with the company anyway). There are no code comments or documentation of what they did or changed. This is my first Shopify experience, and I am trying to pick up Liquid as I go. 

Speaking of customized solutions... we are also running both a B2B and D2C solution off of the same platform that was NOT designed to do that natively. We have custom scripts running to calculate prices and shipping rules that don't play nice with other things we try to accomplish. 

I am also the point of contact for all of our employees for any issue with Shopify via Slack. I am 2nd layer support for any of our customers who have store issues our CS team cannot solve. 

I report to the marketing manager. She is not very technical. I make just over 90k. I work remote from home. Luckily, I don't touch anything order related, nor Amazon or Netsuite.

I have to ask... This isn't normal, right? 

I am barely keeping my head above water. I don't have any actual QA. I don't have any technical support (beyond Shopify support). I don't have any back up. I work on a non-technical marketing team. We are in the depths of holiday, and as you can imagine, it is unbelievably crazy. 

Do other $30m a year companies run like this? 

I often get approached from our VP of marketing with some idea that GAP or Sephora are doing on their website. Sure, that's a cool feature. I'm going to assume those places don't have a single developer who spends half his day context-switching. 

I've been here 6 years. When I started, we had 3 back end devs and myself. Slowly, they left and were never replaced. Which was why we went to Shopify. I guess this has been a 'slowly boil the frog' situation. 

I know I should probably find another job, but I live in a place that doesn't have a ton of jobs, and every remote job listing I see has 100+ applicants before I've even read it. I'm burnt out, looking for a sanity check.

webdev,Another unprepared project,"Seeing this stuff more and more at my agency as well as when multiple LARGE companies even come with work they would like done...

It gets to Dev to build and much of the project to date with scope, functionality etc is just not there.

Recently had a new landing page system requirement, these differer from the website. All ready to build.  
I sit with the project manager to go over it.

\- Design is done, ready to build!  
\- First off there are 3 enquire buttons in the top area next to the enquire form itself which made me laugh.  
\- I did not say anything but the flow of the page was all wrong, made no sense and to me did not seem to match what they said the goal was, but oh well  
\- They changed what the form did mid conversation to go to another page with more complete form and a part submission step... OK BUT - No idea what was on the page and what the other part of the form was going to be and no idea on what fields would come across pre-populate etc.

Few other things.  
I am the lead developer, I work with all the departments and managers and across everything. Rather than giving it to one of the team as it was a mess I took it on as I am also a designer so I could fill in a lot of the blanks there as well as it does not have a huge budget.

Did what I could and hand over with clear requirements on all the things still needed and missing.

1 week later and they have some back and forward with the client and I am asked to change a graphic (which should be the designers job) and some text changes.

4 days later I am being asked if it is live yet  
I just had to email all parties with the bullet list of the actual important stuff again.

It amazes  me that across several people including the client they have not mapped out the key flow and functionality of the project, want it live and STILL do not know what it is supposed to do and where the data goes and how they will use it.

webdev,How to remove Laravel Routes case sensitivity?,"Hi all, I have a laravel app running locally using Herd and deployed in prod on DigitalOcean. It is working fine so far. But one issue I'm having is that routes are not case insensitive so \`&lt;host&gt;/hello\` works but \`&lt;host&gt;/hellO\` doesn't. I get a 404.

How can I fix this behavior? I'd like for all routes to be lower cased.

I tried creating a middleware and apply it at the route level, at a group level, and globally by adding it to the list of middleware applied to \`$middleware-&gt;api(append: \[NormalizeRouteCasing::class\]\` but none of these works. I added debug statements in the middleware and is as if the execution never even gets to the middleware. When I remove the capital letter form the route it does reach it and I see the debug statements. So even before the middleware layer the upper cased routes are being rejected

Appreciate the help. Thank you.

UPDATE:

I Just want to give an update and say that the only thing I have been able to do that actually works (but it's ugly) is this:

In the public/index.php file, right before `(require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php')-&gt;handleRequest(Request::capture());` is called I'm doing this:

$requestUri = $\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\];  
$parsedUrl = parse\_url($requestUri);  
$path = isset($parsedUrl\['path'\]) ? strtolower($parsedUrl\['path'\]) : '';  
$query = isset($parsedUrl\['query'\]) ? '?'.$parsedUrl\['query'\] : '';  
$lowercaseUri = $path.$query;  
$\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\] = $lowercaseUri;

But please let know if there is a better approach or if there would be any downsides with this approach.

webdev,Can't Get HTTPS Working on Netlify with GoDaddy DNS ‚Äì Stuck and Need Help!,"Hey everyone,

I'm really struggling to get HTTPS set up for my site hosted on Netlify while my domain is registered on GoDaddy. I've been going back and forth switching nameservers, tweaking DNS settings, and retrying verification, but I just can't get Netlify to provision the SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.

Here's the situation:

Domain: Registered with GoDaddy.

Hosting: Netlify (pulling from GitHub).

Nameservers: Currently using GoDaddy's default (ns55.domaincontrol.com and ns56.domaincontrol.com), since they don‚Äôt seem deletable or changeable in the DNS zone.

DNS Records in GoDaddy:

A Records: Pointing to Netlify's IPs (75.2.60.5 and 99.83.229.76).

CNAME for www: Points to sitename.netlify.app.


Netlify Settings:

Custom domain added (sitename.com as primary, www.sitename.com redirects to it).



The problem is that Netlify keeps giving me a ""DNS verification failed"" error when I try to enable HTTPS. I‚Äôve tried:

1. Switching to Netlify‚Äôs nameservers (but GoDaddy doesn‚Äôt allow me to remove its NS records within the DNS zone).


2. Sticking with GoDaddy‚Äôs default nameservers and ensuring A and CNAME records are configured as Netlify recommends.


3. Retrying DNS verification after waiting for propagation (24+ hours).



No matter what I try, I‚Äôm stuck in the same spot. It‚Äôs frustrating because I can‚Äôt seem to delete or override those default NS records in GoDaddy either.


---

Has anyone dealt with this before or has advice on how to fix it? Should I fully switch to Netlify‚Äôs DNS and manage everything there, or is there a workaround for the NS records in GoDaddy? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

webdev,I don't understand how they build apps with AI,"To keep it short. I am modifying an app that uses python flask for backend, and I used SQLAlchemy as an ORM layer to work with my database. I had a model that is already in the db and I needed to add new boolean not nullable field to it. I know how to do it, but decided to test chatGPT. Yes, it was great at correcting auto-migration, as you need to pupulate this new field somehow to create it not nullable. But then things got tricky. I needed to add this field to my admin panel, and I wanted it to be 'read-only', so when user can see it but cannot edit it. And it tried to do it, he added it to list view and edit view, disabled the field, removed it from create view, added logic to assign value when the model is created in admin panel, BUT it cannot solve the issue, that when I start editing sexisting model where this disabled field is equal to True and save it, it gets saved to the DB as false, as disabled fields are not part of the form and then ORM treats it like False value. I gave it a chance, tried different promts but it couldn't correct this behaviour. 

So my thought is, I don't know how people are able to develop somethig complex with it. Sure, it helps me with snippents (like with migration), but when you try to get some even simple looking functionality it may introduce bugs and you are lucky if it is you who catches them, not the end-user. Also I get more satisfaction by researching and writing code myself, not writing instructions for who knows how long to get what I need. 

I just needed to put my thouths here as this situation got me a bit angry.

1. The **main idea** of the passage.
2. The **mood** the author is trying to convey.

Both would be multiple-choice questions.

The idea is that it would be easy for humans to identify the emotion or central theme, but much harder for bots to interpret the subtleties of human expression.

webdev,About React,"hey chat

please help me understand. i've been programming for a long time and I started with web dev, for any project I always used vanilla JS, and in the past maybe something like bootstrap. But today React is absolutely everywhere. I can't find a single modern UI library that isn't dependent on it in some way. Every web project guide involves NextJS or React in some way, it's everywhere. Does nobody teach vanilla anymore? When did this shift happen?

I'm not a hater but I'm so surprised that I can't find much discussion on it.

Awhile ago I participated in a hackathon, and the winning project was a single-page react app that displayed a number pulled from a rest api. The fact that the app needed to be built and bundled, before deploying on an overcomplicated cloud saas platform, was crazy to me. That app would need 10 lines of JS max! I don't understand the react-ification of everything and I rarely see discussion on it. I'm sure it's great for apps that need a component library to function, but I don't see why it's absolutely everywhere. Is it like the modern jQuery? Everywhere for a few years and suddenly gone?

webdev,Image Hosting Approach for Small Web Site on Github Pages,"Hi all, I have a GitHub Pages site that I use for my portfolio and I'm working on expanding some of the functionality to support an online scorecard for a hobby league I'm part of. For context, the group paints Warhammer miniatures and submits a completion log to earn points based on certain submission criteria.

Thus far, this project is a fairly small repo (1.4mb because it has the entire Tabulator JS package in it) and I would like to keep it that way. However, I want to introduce an image gallery to the site and there are currently 45-50 images of varying sizes (not in the repo yet). I also expect that count to grow, especially after this site is released because I suspect participation will increase when users can see their submissions online alongside their friends'.

I know that hosting images on Github is bad practice, especially if those images change or change names over time, so I'd like to avoid doing so. Are there any recommended approaches to image hosting for a project like this?

Since this site is hosted freely on GitHub and I'm only paying for my domain, I'd like to keep it free *if* *possible*. I've seen CloudFlare suggested so that's first on my list to explore, but I'm curious if others have thoughts on image hosting for any similar smallish projects.

webdev,"What's the hype around Cursor? I see so many people saying it's great, but it actually made me laugh out loud how bad it was. Are they shills or am I using it wrong?","I've used Claude and Chad Jupiter before, and I find them useful for a few specific things. 

1. If there's some algorithm I'm pretty sure exists, but I don't know what it's called. 

2. If I'm trying to do something that's way out of my element, like say I want to try to train a model to do something. I don't really know shit about ML beyond surface level stuff, and even though the AIs spit out code that doesn't quite work, I do find it more useful than opening a book to the first page, as I learn best by building something, and they can at least lay out some sort of path for me to follow even if it's not the optimal one. 

For everything else I think they're a waste of time, because it takes me more brain power to code review their code than to write it myself.

More than a few times I've seen the name ""Cursor"" come up as being the cream of the crop, so I downloaded it, tried the free trial, and it turned out the be the sloppiest of the slop.

Here's an example of a prompt I put in. 

    # I need some Elixir code that align characters or groups of characters in pairs of strings. 
    # Here's an example of what the data might look like.
    # 
    # Input:
    # ```
    # abc,LlmNN
    # ccb,NNNNm
    # ac,LlNN
    # bab,mim
    # ```
    # Output:
    # ```
    # a b c,Ll m NN
    # c c b,NN NN m
    # a c,Ll NN
    # b a b,m i m
    # ```
    # So it will look at all the lines to figure out how it can group the letters. 
    # As you can see from the last example, `a` in this case is no longer `Ll`, but we still can figure out where to split it because the `b`-`m` pairing is something we've seen before.

I didn't spend much time on writing the perfect prompt, and maybe it could be improved, but for comparison Claude spit out runnable code, however it didn't actually solve the task as requested. Chad Jupiter started to write code, but spazzed out at the end. I didn't bother reviewing the code to see if it was on the right track, but it at least made an attempt. Cursor? ...?

    I'm not sure how to approach this. Any ideas?

Do I have any ideas?! If I have to come up with all the ideas what are you here for? At one point while adjusting the formatting on the prompt it did spit out some code, but it was just a function that read from a file and split at new lines. Literally not even required based on the prompt. Is Cursor just this shit, or am I using it wrong?

[Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/UmopPBE)

Here's Claude's code. It doesn't solve the problem and just seems to zip each line of characters together, so still pretty useless, but at least it's ~150 lines of running code, which is still, ever so slightly better than asking me for ideas about what to do.

webdev,Artstation embedding via RSS/API? ,"Hey all, I'm looking for ways i can embed my artstation projects onto my squarespace website.  
I'm not looking to embed it via IFrame, but i want specifically an area of my site to function as a responsive gallery and just display my posts from my artstation, with nothing else, and when clicked on it takes me to the original post.

**the caveat being; i need a FREE solution.**¬†I am tight on income right now and just cannot justify the cost. So my ideal solution is free/open source, and easy for someone with little coding/IT knowledge to use.

thus far, i have tried RSS feeds, but artstation has low compatibility with them, the native RSS feed for artstation shows the wrong thumbnails for my posts, or doesn't display a thumbnail at all. something like¬†[RSS.app](http://rss.app/)¬†and their widgets is EXACTLY what i am looking for, but is not a free solution. I COULD use¬†[OpenRSS.org](http://openrss.org/)¬†and make an RSS through them, but i am limited to 10 items, when i have more than 10 items in my portfolio, and my goal is to display my full portfolio.

Can someone please help? i have been racking my brain over this for days. Anything is appreciated

I created this as its always something that i've wanted to try and build. I came across lots of hiccups along the way but i got there in the end. This is simply for a portfolio project as i can only imagine the costs to scale this and make it stable for release.

\## Frontend:

\- \*\*Next.js 14\*\*

\- \*\*TypeScript\*\*

\- \*\*Tailwind CSS\*\*

\- \*\*Lucide Icons\*\*

\## Backend:

\- \*\*Next.js API Routes\*\*

\- \*\*Prisma\*\*

\- \*\*PostgreSQL (Neon)\*\*

\- \*\*Docker\*\*

\- \*\*NextAuth.js\*\*

\## Key Features:

\- GitHub integration for importing repositories

\- Environment variable management

\- Automatic deployments

\- Container management

\- Real-time deployment logs

\- Branch-based deployments

\## Infrastructure:

\- Docker containers for each deployment

\- Automated build process

\- Container orchestration

\- Environment isolation

\## Security:

\- JWT-based authentication

\- Secure environment variable handling

\- User-scoped resources

\- Docker container isolation

The most interesting part was implementing the deployment system using Docker. Each project gets its own isolated container, and the platform handles building, deploying, and managing these containers automatically.

I'm currently developing my portfolio, and I have a section with multiple cards that can open. While a card is open I need the scroll to be disabled, but because of this the layout of my page shifts, and it's really unpleasant to see.

I found that ""overflow: overlay"" is deprecated and no longer supported, so I was searching for a replacement, I need your help :(

I tried to use ""scrollbar-gutter"" but I really don't like to see the empty space that the scrollbar requires normally due to the fact that the main background has multiple color in it, the ideal result would be to have the scrollbar on top of the content.

Thank you to everyone that will help me :))))

Have you guys tested the impact of using `rem` layouts these days? It really doesn't have many cases where it matters. I tested the following scenarios:

* Browser zoom (Ctrl + scroll)
* OS interface zoom
* Microsoft Edge font-size configuration

Edge's font-size configuration was the only test where `rem` scaled. The final question is: do the small percentage of users who need accessibility tools use font-size configuration or simply interface zoom? If interface zoom doesn't trigger `rem` scaling, is there any point in using it?

Ok, ok, I lied. There's one more question: should I use `rem` only for fonts or for spacing as well?

webdev,TIL - Why is the terminal called that,"I was listening to lecture on linux -this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gojeTqXdBH0), but it's in Arabic- and the lecturer talked about the first time the terminal was used, which was interesting and worth sharing, so I asked Claude to talk about the point he mentioned in more details so I can share it here:

The term ""terminal"" in computing comes from its literal meaning as an ""endpoint,"" rooted in the Latin ""terminus"" (meaning boundary or end). In early computing, terminals were physical endpoints - devices with just a screen and keyboard that connected to massive mainframe computers. Unlike other input methods like punch cards (which were more like dropping off mail and waiting), terminals were special because they were interactive endpoints where users could have real-time, two-way conversations with the computer.

Picture a mainframe computer in a room with cables running out to multiple terminals - each terminal was literally at the ""end"" of a connection, where the computer system met the human user. When you typed on your terminal, your input would travel up to the mainframe, get processed, and the results would immediately come back to your screen. This was revolutionary compared to punch cards, which required you to submit your entire program at once and wait hours or days for results.

Today's ""terminal"" or command-line interface isn't a physical device anymore, but we keep the name because it serves the same purpose: it's your direct, interactive conversation point with the computer, where you can type commands and get immediate responses. Modern terminals are actually programs (like Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows) that simulate those old physical terminals, carrying on that legacy of being the ""endpoint"" where human and computer meet for direct communication.",Mohammed_MAn,1gzhqp7,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,2024-11-25 12:30:35,0,0.41,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gzhqp7

webdev,Recommendations for a framework/architecture for an embedded application with maps and video,"I need some help with a web application stack/framework. The application is an autonomous ship, similar to a drone. The ship is the server and the application is the client. There may be multiple clients connected to the ship/server (probably fewer than a dozen clients per server). 

The ship/server will send GPS truth coordinates, weather data, and multiple video feeds. The client(s) will need to display all this data and have the ability to create routes for the ship, then upload those routes to the ship/server. The client needs to be extremely responsive (30 FPS, no lag kind of deal).

The client and server communicate over a closed network which may or may not have Internet access. Because of that and speed, I assume we must store the maps (nautical charts) locally to the client. The application/client hardware will likely be a commodity laptop, but may be as low-end as a Raspberry Pi for a remote control station (still a client). 

We're currently using websockets on the server side and the client uses pyside2 via Python. The existing application is very much an engineering GUI. We need to hire someone with real UI/UX experience and embedded web experience so that we have something more polished to show clients. But of course, I need to know what to write for the job description. 

Can anyone recommend a good framework/architecture with this in mind, and what you would write for the job description?

webdev,Need Advice: Integrating Stripe for SaaS Subscriptions with Supabase and Next.js,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm building a SaaS app where users can subscribe to plans that provide monthly credits (e.g., for generating content) and access to specific functionalities. Here‚Äôs the flow I‚Äôm aiming for:

1. Users subscribe to a plan via Stripe.
2. Based on their plan, they receive monthly credits and access to features.
3. Credits reset or roll over (depending on the plan) each month.
4. Users should be able to switch plans seamlessly.

I‚Äôm using **Supabase** for my database and **Next.js** for the front end. My app was built using **Cursor**, so I‚Äôm comfortable coding whatever is needed. However, I‚Äôd love to streamline this to speed up my time to market.

**Main Question:**  
Do I need to manually retrieve payment info for every user from Stripe each time to update the dashboard (e.g., plan details, payment status, etc.), or is there an easier integration method?

**What I‚Äôve Considered:**

* Using Stripe‚Äôs **webhooks** for real-time updates.
* Storing subscription and plan info in Supabase and syncing it with Stripe as needed.
* Some libraries for Next.js (e.g., `stripe-node`), but not sure how well they integrate with Supabase.

Now I can offer pre cut products which are fine, however alot of things are unique size wise and I want to offer replacement services. 

This would require around 20-30 pages I think. As each shape would need it's own page description and dedicated calculator. 

I've had a go on squarespace and built a decent concept, however I can't figure out how to link my code I made using ai (and it works haha which is a shock) to their checkout. Which I think is a limitation of Squarespace or me. 

I am also a factory worker who had an idea however as I'm just starting out I have no idea about any of this other than time in the evenings to try and learn,. I do not know what is good and what is not so don't want to be ripped off I guess, but also what is fair for both me and them. 

Do I find a local agency and go with them? Or do I go on fiverr and try to find someone on there?

webdev,Trying to figure out how to better avoid this client situation,"**TL;DR: When to know when to cut your losses on a new ricocheting client?**

Someone I knew tangentially from a business transaction was struggling to make ends meet with her new business, so I offered to help with my skills and interests, some of which I was learning.

Things were progressing nicely, though she struggled understanding some necessary things with marketing and management. I can't call myself a pro with those things but I knew enough tangentially to make things work. I offered the services free to a certain point because I wanted the project on my portfolio and we got along well.

However, when it came down to images, I mentioned that I'm not a designer. She didn't like that answer, and said the previous team (which she said she couldn't afford) did that. I offered to do the free parts and they could send me the images. She didn't want separate entities working on the project. I later learned they also wrote all of the content, and a lot of it looked AI-generated. I generally don't write content, though AI makes things easier, which she at least understood.

Maybe this is the point where I should have cut ties: she said she has no money to spend, but insisted on a professional designer. Since I saw her just pay for something necessary for business management (not a big expense), I couldn't tell if she was being hyperbolic or not. I said, look, I don't know everything, but I'm offering you free marketing recommended by the hosting platform that the pros you paid didn't try. She kept going back and forth, eventually left on a ""let me talk to the other team"" note, and I figured why not see if I could just make the free marketing work.

She texted me some time later, saying she really needed bookings (she didn't have a scheduler set up, oddly), and I tried what I could, but after suggesting some shortcuts, she removed my access to the marketing page and ignored my texts.

So, while I learned some things about the tech/marketing stack, ultimately I couldn't even try what looked like would work quickly and cheaply for her situation.

**Anyway, is it better to be more skeptical than this with new clients?** I'm sort of new at consulting in the wild world myself, and I don't want to insult anyone or lose good leads, but the ping-ponging and apparent mixed messaging surprised me near the end.

Previously, I outputted the report as a giant PDF and stored it on OneDrive, sharing a link to disseminate it. However, the missing assignments feature is dynamic and can't be captured in a static PDF.

I've been searching for a way to host the web page while restricting access to certain users within our domain. I stumbled upon Power Pages and thought it might be a solution.

My goal is to upload the fully formed page and its assets, using Power Pages solely for secure storage behind an Azure AD login. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to achieve this. Ideally, there would be an FTP-like mechanism to simply upload the folder and be done.

Right now I can't even figure out how to upload the image assets, each student's attendance is represented by 2 graphs for YTD attendance and 5 day attendance.

I work for an education federation. Most of our updates end up on our Instagram, so I thought it'd make sense to mount that on our federation website instead of reuploading everything manually.

We have different story highlights for certain areas of the federation - ""Enrichment"", ""Early Years"", ""Training"" etc - where content gets grouped. I'd like similar buttons to appear on our website so that when they're pressed, people can easily look through the images without being redirected to Instagram itself. 

I've tried a widget by SociableKIT, and it was nearly what we needed, but it didn't pull through the titles, on the circular buttons. 

Any thoughts about how this could be achieved? 

Many thanks!

webdev,"Built beautiful, dead-simple api yet highly customizable interactive file-tree renderer for documentation | One command to generate, tons of props to customize, and a beautiful UI üå≥","edit: holy smokes the images are awful @ 3840 x 1600 on 100%. Zoom in or view the links.



I am rolling my own auth system, for me to usje and  to prove it doesn't have to be complicated, and probably easier then solutions like NextAuth. Have to make docs, Firstly I created this [beautiful code block renderer ](https://beautiful-code-block.remcostoeten.com/)

[My own copy-able code block. Lovely imo](https://preview.redd.it/94a8msyhtt2e1.png?width=1873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cc31a00e89c9ae82706bc0e94f985920ab35552)

and then I got carried away and created[ this interactive file-tree ](https://interactive-tree.remcostoeten.com/)component.

[aspect ratio is a bit off. Had a settings menu allowing changing of space\/font\/settings but rebase dungoofed me.](https://preview.redd.it/j5wm0y9utt2e1.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcd6719c37e9da1a274e048117792a2c0789b5cb)

Comes with a CLI that generates your entire tree + file contents in one command. Super customizable with tons of props, and (if I do say so myself) looks pretty damn good. It's not perfect, but it might be useful for someone else's docs or whatever use-case.

Cheers,

webdev,How to avoid duplicating html page in a static site ?,"I'm not a web dev. I have built a static website with two html pages so far

a) home page shows 6 products in a grid, each product image is a link.

b) a second html page shows details about first product.

My problem is that I found my self needing to duplicate the product.html page 6 times for each product.

All product pages have same structure and look and feel , except product name, description, and image.

what tool / technology / keyword do I need to look for to achieve this ?

I don't need dynamic/server, I have a static small list of products.

\----------------------

Update, I went with this solution:

* page 1 links to page2.html?someValue=ABC
* Page 2 can then read the query string and the key 'someValue'

Page 2 have in java script array list of products ( name, description, image )

Page 2 access the array based on the parameter.

Though static site generator like Jekyll and Astro looks cool and better.

Second Edit: Script kitties must be proud right now! So yeah someone is sending requests programmatically and is trying to overwhelm the service or perhaps deplete the API credits in minutes just to prove us wrong. This behaviour is beyond understanding. We really want to apologise to anyone who might experience service interruptions. I am the only one with access to the server and I am currently on holiday for a week, we might have to implement authentication once I get back. Sorry again guys

Third Edit: To whoever did this, I will keep this in my heart until judgement day. You are a troll that destroys what others are trying to build. You are a cockroach and if you have one once of courage, come forward and show us that you are the man by not hiding behind your screen. You did cost us some money but not enough to bring this thing to its knees. You are only makng it harder for others, as we now will have to implement auth and rate limiting restrictions.

Here Drizzle comes in. They stated that Drizzle is still not compatible with MariaDB: [Drizzle ORM - v1 Roadmap](https://orm.drizzle.team/roadmap). 

How is it possible that it is compatible with MySQL but not with MariaDB, if MariaDB is designed to be *drop-in* replacement for MySQL?

webdev,How to deal as a developer with large-ish json files embedded inside of an angular app?,"Context:

I have to maintain an angular 16 application, it is purely front-end.

The application has several large configuration files acting more like tables in a database which it gets it's data from.

Each file has an array of aprox 50 objects, which might not seem much but every object is very embedded with objects within objects within objects.

***I cannot change this, I tried asking, I tried offering other solutions (keep data on server in mongo or sql or etc and the FE app gets it via calls) it's not happening. The files are here to stay.***

A large part of my tasks ends up with me doing changes in these files by hand.

I know it doesn't sound like much but we're talking about large embedded objects without schemas, sometimes I need to only edit one sometimes I need to basically do a manual query to see some field from everything, sometimes I need to change in just 3 out of 50 objects.

My point is the work is very error prone because it's by hand and by me reading the files again and again to understand them.

***I cannot change this structure.***

webdev,Do I need to use a context provider if I'm storing JWTs in a cookie anyway?,"I'm trying to implement JWT for my react/node.js app, but there are some parts that I'm confused about.

From my understanding: Client makes request to the backend -&gt; backend generates a token -&gt; sends it to the frontend -&gt; frontend stores the token on the client side(eg. cookie) so that you don't need to make a request to the server every time you want to access content.

However, I see people using React context providers to handle authentication as well.

Isn't the point of a context provider to pass down information down to children components, in this case, the authentication status?

Or are you meant to store the JWT token itself in the cookie, and use the context state to store information like ""{userAuth: true, favoriteColor: blue}""?

* Dynamic leveling system with milestone notifications &amp; streak tracking
* Tasks can have deadlines with bonus XP for early completion and penalty for overdue tasks
* Global leaderboard for competitive motivation (completely optional and you can ""opt-in"" and ""opt-out"" anytime). Privacy is respected.
* Google OAuth integration
* Cross-device synchronization (Data persists across devices)
* Guest users (data saves to local storage) and authenticated users (allows data sync)

# How are you awarded points?

Although at the base level, you get to decide the difficulty level and importance level of tasks, XP is also awarded by things like completing a task earlier than a set deadline, and how many days earlier you completed it. If a task is past the deadline, then there is an overdue penalty applied to your total points as well.

webdev,Is this a good solution?,"So I have to write a function that basically accepts an object, then returns a link with the properties in the object as url params. The object can have from 2 to 5 properties. So let's say the object is 

`{`  
`type: ""someType"",`  
`colour: ""someColour,`  
`size: ""someSize""`  
`}`

It returns ""link?type=someType&amp;colour=&amp;someColour&amp;size=someSize.

But the object can have 2, 3, 4 0r 5 properties.

So I opted to loop and push to an array, like so:

    const
     makeLink = (
    obj
    ) 
    =&gt;
     {

webdev,Failed Web App (Can you share some thoughts on this or the AIGC/webapp markets?),"My Background:

My full-time job has been mainly a product designer, and I didn't program much, but I wanted to make a webapp by myself.

I thought about what product I could make myself, or with minimum paid help, and given my limited programming speed, I made a website: fanserviceai.com, which could generate images of specific anime characters etc.

The Market:

At the time, the AIGC market was already very saturated with the likes of Midjourney and many AI porn generators. However, few touches IP characters, - like none of them could generate Sakura Haruno well for example as the platforms avoid doing it. None of the debit card payment processors deal with such content either - thus for this website, I had to connect a crypto payment processor to the page, and thought that maybe there's a small, niche, grey market.

The Webiste:

Fanservice AI is a website that could generate anime characters, like the one piece, or naruto's characters etc closely resembling the original drawings. I thought that, as some generic AI porn generators could have subscribers, a generator that could generate specific characters would probably be better, and I made this MVP (searchable on Google) and tried to test it out with people. But that assumption was wrong, I posted on social media and then, nothing happens.

Question:

What are your thoughts about maybe side projects in general or like this? About the webapp market? About making money developing actually profitable websites or apps in the current era? I think I might be in the wrong career path and I don't know how I could make enough more money atm.",vistql,1gxy5h9,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gxy5h9/failed_web_app_can_you_share_some_thoughts_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gxy5h9/failed_web_app_can_you_share_some_thoughts_on/,2024-11-23 12:03:41,1,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1gxy5h9

In order to make this work, I need an anonymous id to be able to identify the user as they move around the site, so if they go to a different page, I can look up the past views according to that anonymous id and display the recent items.

What methods are available to identify a user in this way which are also widely legally compliant (e.g. GDPR) and preferably don't require a cookie consent, and will not be blocked by most browsers?

Why you should build a waitlist before you launch your product? Because,

* it'll help you validate your idea before spending too much time on building,
* get first users that will potentially convert/sign up as soon as you launch,
* and you can generate more buzz for your launch than you could without one.

How does Waitlister help you with this? With it, you can:

* create a hosted landing page,
* create an embeddable waitlist form,

* send email broadcasts to keep subscribers engaged,
* incentivize virality with referrals,

Presumably, because of this, I cannot just host this new site on something that serves just static HTML, and I will need some kind of server code to at least support this contact us form. Presumably, this would mean migrating to a server with a similar setup as the existing one.

From what I can tell, this old page was based off of CakePHP 2.0, so I assume that whatever is supporting this contact form is written under this framework. But I see that CakePHP 2.0 has long ago been deprecated.

webdev,Need Advice: Working with a Freelancer on WordPress + BricksBuilder,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm working on building my website and could really use some advice from people who‚Äôve been in a similar situation. Here‚Äôs a bit of background:

* I‚Äôve designed the site myself in Figma and provided the freelancer with all the on-page SEO details (like meta tags, alt text, and header structures).
* While I do have some experience with HTML and CSS, I‚Äôve hired a freelancer to help with the development side because of personal time constraints.
* We‚Äôve agreed to test and audit the site using tools like SEMrush, Google Search Console, and Google Analytics to make sure everything is running smoothly.

The website is being built on WordPress using **BricksBuilder**. The freelancer has a lifetime unlimited license for Bricks and plans to use it during development. My hosting is set up with SiteGround, and I‚Äôve already got WordPress installed.

Here‚Äôs where I could use some advice:

1. **WordPress Access:** What‚Äôs the best way to give the freelancer access to my WordPress account? Should I make them an admin temporarily, or is there a more secure way to handle this?
2. **BricksBuilder License:** Since the freelancer has their own lifetime license for Bricks, I‚Äôm wondering how that works in terms of ownership. Can their license be transferred to my site after the project is done, or would it be better for me to buy my own Bricks license to ensure I have full control in the future (especially if I lose contact with them)?
3. **General Tips:** Are there any other precautions I should take or things I should keep in mind with regards to the above or any further advice you have? thanks. 

I want to make sure I approach this the right way, especially when it comes to access and ownership. Any insights or recommendations would be super helpful.

webdev,My Restaurant's Website Has Been Hacked,"I've been tasked with building a website for my restaurant. I have some knowledge in web development but mostly I've just been learning as I go. The website is coming along nicely but recently I've been having issues with the DNS records being changed or deleted which resulted in us losing access to our email for a day because a txt dns record was somehow deleted, and then also the website went down for a few hours because of a missing ""A"" record I was using to redirect the website because it was originally hosted through GoDaddy, and am now using BlueHost.

Today I decided to use virustotal to scan my website for any malware, and this popped up.

https://preview.redd.it/d427z3oiaj2e1.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb8792e2e1f8d96750888886e74548f0ea50e984

I contacted Bluehost and they confirmed that the website was hacked and has malware. They're suggesting that I pay the $300+ to SiteLock to come in and manually remove and close any backdoors these hackers might have created. The person I spoke with did seem genuine enough, but I'm also under the assumption that they receive compensation for selling these sorts of packages to customers. Is this necessary? I signed up for the basic plan of SiteLock for free scans and hopefully free malware removal to get us through the weekend while I continue to monitor the situation.

Also, is this my fault? Was it because of my inexperience as a Web Developer that maybe they got in through some poorly written javascript code that I included on the website? I don't thinkthey got in through the login credentials as I have two step authentication and a really strong password.

webdev,How should I go about making a static site that may need to be upgraded to a Shopify site later? ,"Hi everyone. Relative beginner here. I've been learning CS and webdev parttime on my own for about 2.5 years. I've gotten pretty decent at making fullstack hobby-type projects (see my post history to check out my copyediting with AI project). And I've been updating a couple of WordPress sites for friends.

One of these WordPress sites is for a small indy publisher. When I started working on it, it was really bad. Like, it looked like a blog from 2008. So I've just been updating the template and posts, and creating a few custom pages. We're looking to rebuild it from the ground up, and maybe toward the end of next year be selling books through Shopify. But for now it's just a site that showcases the books and authors. No reviews or shopping cart, etc. Everything just links straight to Amazon if people want to buy a title.

How should I go about rebuilding? (I don't want to go deep into WordPress. I want to learn modern frameworks.) I could pretty easily build something in Django, just using Django templates and a lot of CSS, and I think that would be fine. But say we wanted to eventually move to Shopify, how much of a headache am I in for? Would any of it be portable?

I could also build the static site as a single page application in React, and just use Django to serve up data...not sure if that makes sense. Like I said, I am still n00b. 

I am doing this for free, to build a portfolio, to learn, and because I really want to help the business succeed. Timeline is not much of an issue, but generally hoping I can get the static site done in three months.

Any tips would be appreciated.

         &lt;button class=""submit"" type=""submit""&gt; Sing In&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    

In my application, I have a button that calls ""logoutUser""

    protected logoutUser() {
       this.http.post('/foo/logout', {}).subscribe ({
         next: () =&gt; {
            location.reload(); //reloads the page after the post call invalidates the session
         }});}
    

the Java backend i have:

     u/jakarta.ws.rs.POST
      @operation(responses = {@ApiResponse(responseCode=""200"", content=@Content(schema = 
      @Schema(implementation = Void.class))),})
      public Response signout(@Context final HttpServletRequest request, @Context final 
          SecurityContext securityContext) {
        
              request.getSession().invalidate();
              return Response.ok().build();
          }
      }
    

I can login and logout and log back in FINE. However, if I do the following: 1. Login 2. logout 3. wait \~5 mins 4. login 5.¬†I receive 408 on my POST to .../j\_security\_check which is a Request Timeout.

I notice that when I login, i have 2 cookies - JSESSIONIDSSO and JSESSIONID. the JSESSIONIDSSO is set to ""REMOVE"" when I logout. I also noticed that the console has a warning that cookie ""JSESSIONIDSSO"" has been rejected because it is already expired. However, if I login within the 5 minutes or so, i still can.

From the login action, i see a POST (return 303) j\_security\_check where it sends JSESSIONID cookie and the response has the cookies JESSIONID and JSESSIONIDSSO

If I logout and the page refreshes, I see a GET on my current login page and I see the Response with set-cookie on JSESSIONIDSSO=REMOVE, Expires =Thu,01 jan 1970... and JSESSIONID = 123531....

I want the ""path of least resistance"" to get the login to work. If I can refresh cookie or clear cookie/cache when I logout that would be great. or if I can fix in backend that be great too. I think for now I just need to be able to 1. login. 2.logout. 3. after periods of time 4. login success.

Any ideas that could help? thanks

webdev,I tried AI IDEs Cursor and Windsurf with a medium sized ASP.NET + React Vite Codebase and...,"I tried out both VS Code forks side by side with an existing codebase here:¬†[https://youtu.be/duLRNDa-CR0](https://youtu.be/duLRNDa-CR0)

Here's what I noted in the review:

\- Windsurf edged out better with a medium to big codebase - it understood the context better  
\- Cursor Tab is still better than Supercomplete, but the feature didn't play an extremely big role in adding new features, just in refactoring  
\- I saw some Windsurf bugs, so it needs some polishing  
\- I saw some Cursor prompt flaws, where it removed code and put placeholders - too much reliance on the LLM and not enough sanity checks. Many people noticed this and it should be fixed since we are paying for it (were)  
\- Windsurf produced a more professional product

Miscellaneous:  
\- I'm temporarily moving to Windsurf but I'll be keeping an eye on both for updates  
\- I think we all agree that they both won't be able to sustain the $20 (Cursor) and $10 (Windsurf) p/m pricing as that's too cheap  
\- Aider, Cline and other API-based AI coders are great, but are too expensive for medium to large codebases  
\- I tested LLM models like Deepseek 2.5 and Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B with Aider, and they're great! They are just currently slow, with my preference for long session coding being Deepseek 2.5 + Aider on architect mode

webdev, Chrome extension and WordPress migration,"How can I achieve the following goals for my Chrome extension and WordPress migration?

I am currently developing a Chrome extension but am unsure how to migrate login and payment systems already set up on my WordPress site. Here's my current setup and what I want to achieve:

1. Current Setup:

On my WordPress site, I‚Äôve implemented a login and monthly subscription payment system using LemonSqueezy, which works seamlessly.

Users can sign up and manage their subscriptions directly on the WordPress site.



2. Goals:

A) Allow users to sign up and pay via my WordPress site, similar to how services like Grammarly direct users to their website for account creation and payments.

B) Enable the Chrome extension to verify payment status through the LemonSqueezy API. If the user is verified as having an active subscription, the extension should grant access to its features.



3. Experience and Challenges:

I‚Äôm relatively new to web development.

I‚Äôve dabbled with React and have basic experience using Stripe, LemonSqueezy, and Firebase.

I‚Äôve come across Next.js during research and understand it can handle server-side functionality, but I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs the right tool for this project.

My primary challenges are:

Integrating the Chrome extension with the LemonSqueezy API for payment verification.

Creating a seamless flow between WordPress and the Chrome extension.




4. Questions:

What tools, frameworks, or software should I use to implement this system?

Should I consider migrating away from WordPress to something like Next.js for better flexibility and integration with the Chrome extension?

What specific areas of web development should I focus on studying over the next few months to achieve this goal?

webdev,Does such a testing tool/strategy test? Probabilistic testing. ,"In my experience, in the context of web development, we're either doing some kind of unit test/component test, where we'll mock our API interactions with a tool like MSW, or there's e2e tests where you'll deploy some kind of real application and run it cypress/playwright tests against it. 

The problem that these strategies run into is that: 

1. Defining API mocks particularly becomes quite cumbersome, particularly for things CRUD like operations where you create a todo, now refresh the page and expect to see the new todo there. We end up having to reimplement our API in our tests. 

2. For e2e style tests, we either deal with an unreliable system, or a _too_ reliable system, that isn't going to be testing our error cases, or our tests are brittle and break when the data on the system changes. 

What both of these styles of test have in common that they make an assumption that 'when I go to this page, the application is going to be in this state'. 

What I'm wondering is if there's a style of test that is: 

- Go to X page. 
- These are the possible options: 
   - I see an error. 
   - I see a log in screen. 
   - I see products [A, B, C]
   - I see products [D, E, F] 

Now for each of these paths write test behaviour. 

We end up writing a tree of possibilities.

Then to run the test, we can either run this against a real deployment and our tests can navigate it fine. Or there's some kind of mocking behaviour, that observes the kinds of responses that typically occur and probabilistically returns responses of that type.

webdev,Ecommerce for Print on Demand - a simple setup for an intermediate developer without too many catches?,"I am working on setting up a site for a print-on-demand shop. I am planning to use Printify for the supplier, but am happy to use something else like Printful, etc. if that makes it smoother.

All the suggestions I read, though, are either very complicated, or overly reliant on a specific system. For instance, I was going to go with Shopify, as that is almost always what I see recommended. They terminated my shop while I was still setting it up, with no explanation as to why. As far as I know I am not doing anything that could possibly be against their terms. I tried to dispute it, but the form they provide for this gives an error upon submission. I chatted with someone to see if they could fix this another way, but Shopify seems to be in no rush to help, and now I am hesitant to even rely on them at all.

WooCommerce appears to be the next most popular, but it seems convoluted, and relies on WordPress. I am OK with using WordPress if I HAVE to, but I prefer to work with something more developer-friendly - frameworks like Django or Rails or Laravel. Like, to set up WooCommerce, the standard way is to install it through the WordPress interface. This is not very reproduceable. You can automate some of it with the WordPress CLI, but that seems like a hack. I much prefer having a .env file I can put the configuration in, or at least coding things in a reproduceable way.

Medusa.js looks incredible, but I cannot for the life of me tell how much will ""just work,"" versus how much I will have to write custom code for. I do not mind doing some development to get things working, but I would like the stuff that would be very bad to fail, like order management, billing, etc. to work without having to trust myself to implement it all correctly from scratch. I assume I would use Stripe with this for payment processing, but I am not clear on how many other services I would need to rely on.

Are there any solutions that just kind of work? Shopify was the most hopeful, but they have quickly proven unreliable. WooCommerce would be good if it was not designed for manual setup, but maybe I am wrong and assuming that based on lack of knowledge? Medusa.js is promoted as a replacement for these, but I cannot tell how much more would be required.

I am open to any other options. I just thought that, with Ecommerce being so common, there would be some options besides Shopify that were relatively simple to set up, so I could focus on developing the site itself.

Thank you in advance to anyone who even bothers to read this overly-long post.

  
Edit: I know there are other services, like BigCommerce for instance, but none of them seem to have nearly as much information out there about integrating them with your tools. I get the impression that the Shopify DX is much better than most others, but would like to be told otherwise. If there is something that provides just their basic functionality - shopping cart, order management (including automating sending orders to POD service), billing.

webdev,Development laptop,"Hi, I'm looking to buy a laptop for web development mostly NodeJS, Adobe Photoshop, Figma and so on ; although I would like to also run Android Studio smoothly.  
Problem is my budget, I have at most $500 dollars to spent  
Most people vouch for Macs, for the Apple Silicone and whatnot.  
But their too expensive and I don't know if a 2015 Mac is gonna do it...

I also saw people talking bad about the Ryzen when used on laptops, and quirky optimizations, because they are fast to get hot, over 101 C.

Suggestions pls? Thanks in advance

Edit: Thanks for the insight, really! I'm kind of lost on what is mainstream nowdays.  
My last pc was a desktop one, but it got broken. it had an A6-7470k(dualcore) and a R5 integrated in the cpu. So, I always have been using the options at the low end of the spectrum.  
Most people recommended me a MacBook or mini for web development, if possible from 2015/2017. I'm sure that as of today, that is kinda trash-ish, since there are great options.

webdev,Is there any powerful and modern FOSS alternative to WordPress?,"After searching for a while, I was lured by Statamic, which seemed to be brutal on paper. But then I realized that they are not FOSS to a great deception. :(

They definitely felt like the exact thing I was looking for (\*)

So I've ended with all the prehistoric or non-FOSS alternatives to WP, which happen to be a ton, but not amazing.

Generally, as a red flag, if they have a main website, which is a .com then it's a bad idea

They could be FOSS, but if they are selling straight their  CLOUD services on their homepage, bad idea also

I always thought that even that the wordpress . com (the for-profit option) was a terrible idea, but at least was a different domain to the .org version.

In an ideal world, something by the community, for the community. The idea is not only to consume it, but to contribute.

Maybe it's an impossible.

webdev,How to Reliably Collect Serial Port Data with Flask and React on a Dockerized Raspberry Pi?,"I have a Flask server and a React frontend designed to run experiments where data is collected from a serial port. Here‚Äôs the setup:

The full application is dockerized and hosted on Raspberry Pi.

# React Frontend Features:

* **Start Timer Button**: Begins data collection for an experiment. Triggers backend API endpoint, which starts storing data in a buffer array.
* **End Timer Button**: Stops data collection. Triggers the backend API endpoint which stops storing the data in the buffer and returns that to the frontend.

# Requirements:

1. Only one user at a time.
2. Only one experiment at a time.
3. Only one timer should be active on the server.
4. Delay for the data to show on frontend is accepted.

# Problems Faced:

* The serial port sometimes disconnects, leading to data loss.
* Socket connections occasionally drop, also resulting in data loss.

# Proposed Solution:

1. Use¬†**TimescaleDB**¬†to store the collected data.
2. Forward the stored data from TimescaleDB to the frontend.

# Question:

1. What‚Äôs the best way to address these issues and improve the overall setup?
2.
