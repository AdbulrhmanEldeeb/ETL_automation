math,The unmatched beauty of logarithms,"Out of all the math I’ve learned, logarithms have been the ones I’ve been most fascinated by.

Logarithms very plainly serve as the inverse of exponentiation, which lays the foundation for understanding growth of quantities such as investments or population growth. But beyond that, logarithms represent the quantification of the impossibly large. To understand logarithms means to be able to multiply and divide impossibly large quantities given logarithmic rules. This concept seems given and simple but it was always interesting to me. It’s an elegant solution to understanding simple ROC and growth, which creates the foundation for transformation, and we see those absolutely everywhere. It can be applied for sorting and searching algorithms, statistical variance stabilizing, power law linearization of obscured data, even observed natural phenomenon like sound intensity finds its base in the decibel system (which, of course, is logarithmic). The nature of these large quantities are put into scale using logarithms, and that expands the scope of applied math.

All of this just is achieved just by understanding logarithms, which I find fascinating.",Mountain-Winter-9564,1ha4tdg,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ha4tdg/the_unmatched_beauty_of_logarithms/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ha4tdg/the_unmatched_beauty_of_logarithms/,2024-12-09 07:53:37,0,0.36,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ha4tdg

math,Point-Set Topology definition vs. intuition,"*This is an edited repost of a question I asked in a thread a little while ago, that went unanswered.*

I have read popularization articles about topology, things about continuous transformations of strings on torii, looping (or not) around the hole, going on to multiple holes and ways of looping, etc and found it exciting.

But when I picked an actual point-set topology textbook, it began with a set-theoretic definition of topological space, open/closed sets and neighborhood than seemed to me unrelatable to those ideas.

math,"Bashar Al-Assad's son Hafez has recently defended his doctoral thesis, can someone explain in laymans terms what exactly he did?","Given recent developments in Syria, I was surprised to learn after a bit of reading that the oldest son of now ex-president Assad is a mathematician. He studies at Lomonosov State University in Moscow.

In a bit of an ironic twist, he recently (like two weeks ago) defended his doctoral dissertation while the Syrian opposition was about to start their offense. I dug up a summary of his thesis although I can't actually find the full text. I'm not a mathematician so as I'm trying to read the translated summary, I'm still not sure what exactly he did.

The title is ""Arithmetic questions of polynomials in algebraic number fields "" and this is the summary translated from Russian:

The first topic we will consider is the representation of two rational integers as sums of three rational squares having a common square. Representations of rational integers as polynomials have always been of interest to mathematics. Many well-known theorems and results, such as Legendre's three-square theorem, Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorems, the Hilbert-Gamke problem and many others, are devoted to this issue. In particular, Legendre's three-square theorem completely solves the problem of representing a rational integer as a sum of three rational squares. For representing an integer by a homogeneous polynomial of degree two, the local-global Hasse principle reduces the problem to representability modulo all powers of primes and representability in real numbers. In 1980, D.L. Colliot-Thelen and D. Core generalized Hasse's principle to two homogeneous polynomials under certain conditions. Our study is aimed at generalizing the above-mentioned Legendre theorem, and exploits this generalization.

The second topic we consider is estimates of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. Trigonometric sums have long been of interest because of their deep connection with modular arithmetic in the residue ring modulo q. In particular, they arise in the Hardy-Littlewood-Ramanujan circle method in the form of I.M. Vinogradov's trigonometric sums for estimating the number of solutions of Diophantine equations. In particular, the solvability of a given equation is considered, first, in the real numbers, and second, modulo any rational integer q. The latter part is usually deeper and more difficult, and rational trigonometric sums play an essential role in it; they are effectively responsible for the solvability modulo q. In 1940, Hua Lo-keng found a nontrivial estimate for trigonometric sums in the field of rational numbers. Subsequent work by Chen Junrun and V. I. Nechaev improved the estimate. In 1984, Qi Mingao and Ding Ping found a constant in Hua Luo-ken's estimate. In 1949, Hua Luo-ken generalized his estimate to the case of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. The first part of our study on this topic is aimed at strengthening this estimate. The second part of our study on this topic is aimed at generalizing Hua Luo-ken's tree method for constructing solutions of polynomial congruences modulo a rational prime, used in solving the convergence problem of a singular series in the Prouet-Terry-Ascot problem, to the case of algebraic number fields.

The third topic we consider is the representations of Dirichlet characters. Dirichlet characters, first introduced by P. L. Dirichlet in 1837, play a central role in multiplicative number theory. They were originally used by him to prove a theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.Many important questions of the analytical number theory were developed on the basis of Dirichlet characters and the theory of Dirichlet L-functions. In the modern theory of L-functions, estimates of character sums are of great importance. A.G. Postnikov's formula, proved by him in 1955, expresses Dirichlet characters modulo a power of an odd prime number through exponentials of polynomials with rational coefficients. Thus, the problem of estimating the sums of such Dirichlet characters is reduced to I.M. Vinogradov's method of trigonometric sums. Our study on this topic is connected with the generalization of A.G. Postnikov's formula to the case of a Dirichlet character modulo a power of 2 and the application of both the original and the generalized formula of A.G. Postnikov to estimate the sums of characters in algebraic number fields.

math,Help Distributing Matrices within  Expansion of Linear Maps vs. Bilinear Forms?,"I’m struggling to understand a discrepancy between how what I think are Jacobian matrices (referred to in the video as forward and backward transforms) are being distributed in the expansions shown.

This video shows a linear map, L, written in a new coordinate basis in terms of the old basis as:

L(new) = (B)(L(old))(F) 

Where B and F are would represent an inverse Jacobian and Jacobian respectfully. 


Similarly, it also shows a bilinear form, B, written in a new basis in terms of an old as:

B(new) = (F)(F)(B(old))

I’m sure this notation I’ve typed out isn’t great.

math,How do I figure out what I like in algebra ?,"I am a final-year undergraduate student in mathematics, and I’ve taken a variety of courses that have helped me realize my general interest in algebra. So far, I’ve studied Representation Theory, Commutative Algebra, and Algebraic Number Theory, all of which I enjoyed and performed well in. However, I’m still unsure about which specific area within algebra excites me the most. 

I want to apply for masters and PhD programs in Europe and US (respectively). I want to figure out what I like before that (i.e. in about a month)  because I want a strong personal statement surrounding what I like and why I like it. Next semester, I’ll be taking courses in Algebraic Geometry, Lie Groups and Algebras, and Modular Forms. I’m concerned that I might end up liking these new topics just as much as or even more than my current interests, which could further complicate my decision-making process. 

Also, figuring out what I like is also essential before I choose any advisor anywhere. I’ve spoken to professors in my department, and each has emphasized the merits of studying their respective fields—whether it’s Commutative Algebra, Representation Theory, or Algebraic Number Theory. I’ve considered focusing on areas that are currently active or popular in the field, but I worry this might lead to dissatisfaction later if my interests don’t align with those trends.

Have any of you faced similar dilemmas before and what did you do to solve them ? I would appreciate any and all advice/comments from anyone who has been through this before. I think this should be a fairly common problem given how vast mathematics is.
