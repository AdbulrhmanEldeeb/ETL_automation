datascience,Timeseries pattern detection problem,"I've never dealt with any time series data - please help me understand if I'm reinventing the wheel or on the right track.

I'm building a little hobby app, which is a habit tracker of sorts. The idea is that it lets the user record things they've done, on a daily basis, like ""brush teeth"", ""walk the dog"", ""go for a run"", ""meet with friends"" etc, and then tracks the frequency of those and helps do certain things more or less often.

Now I want to add a feature that would suggest some cadence for each individual habit based on past data - e.g. ""2 times a day"", ""once a week"", ""every Tuesday and Thursday"", ""once a month"", etc.

My first thought here is to create some number of parametrized ""templates"" and then infer parameters and rank them via MLE, and suggest the top one(s).

Is this how that's commonly done? Is there a standard name for this, or even some standard method/implementation I could use?",ilyanekhay,1h9o1r5,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h9o1r5/timeseries_pattern_detection_problem/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h9o1r5/timeseries_pattern_detection_problem/,2024-12-08 17:36:09,10,0.86,10,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,ML,self,t3_1h9o1r5
datascience,Is your org treating the rollout of LLMs as an IT or data science problem? ,"Our org has given all resource (and limited all API access) to LLMs to a dedicated team in the IT department, which has no prior data experience. So far no data scientist has been engaged for feedback on design or practicality of use-cases. I'm wondering is this standard in other orgs?

datascience,Are certifications even worth it these days?,"So, I’m a cs major stats minor undergrad, and I’ve done a couple of certifications—AWS Cloud Practitioner and IBM Data Science. Honestly, I’m not sure if they added much value. In one interview, I mentioned my certifications right at the end, and they didn’t even seem to notice.

From what I’ve seen, well-defined projects seem to carry more weight than a cert. Projects show real skills, while certs sometimes feel like just ticking a box.

What’s your take? Are there any certs you’ve done that actually helped you stand out, or do you think the focus should shift more toward solid project work?

Also, which one is more valuable or more worth it, AWS, Azure, GCP or Databricks for Data Science/ML??",No-Brilliant6770,1h9m492,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h9m492/are_certifications_even_worth_it_these_days/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h9m492/are_certifications_even_worth_it_these_days/,2024-12-08 16:10:30,113,0.96,113,0,53,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9m492
