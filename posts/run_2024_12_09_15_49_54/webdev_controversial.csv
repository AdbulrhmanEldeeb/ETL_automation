webdev,Offering financing to clients,"Own a digital agency and IT consultancy. 

Something I've thought about for a while is offering finance options to clients. For example, if an ecommerce site costs ¬£30,000, they could put down a deposit and spread the cost, say ¬£1000 a month for 36 months (subject to credit check). Clients wouldn't gain ownership of anything until it is paid off entirely.

Another alternative is potentially leasing whereby we include maintenance and hosting but the monthly is indefinite. They'd commit to a minimum time period and keep paying after this to keep the site active or start again and rebuild. 

Changes outside of the agreement would be billed at ""x"" amount extra for the remaining agreement months. 

Could offer this by partnering with a bank/broker potentially. Contracts would have to be watertight. 

Drawback - debts die with the company if it folds unless we enforce a personal guarantee. 

Thoughts?

webdev,Help needed - Embassy Appointment ,"Need help

Hello,
I have been trying to get a germany study visa appointment for the last six months. All the appointments get taken in a few seconds. I have tried everything. I had to defer my semester and now the deadline is going to pass again. 
The problem is that there is a server side limit of 3 seconds before which you can't submit the captcha and appointment form. Considering this limit, the earliest you can submit the form after the appointments are open is 4 seconds (one second to click the appointment slot, open the form and fill it; and 3 seconds wait before the submission). I have many a times clicked the submit button at exactly the 4 second mark, but still no luck . 
I was told that there are some people who have somehow bypassed this limit and they can submit the form and captcha from the client side before the 3 second limit. They book all the appointments. 
I don't know if this is true. But if someone can confirm this or help me, i would be eternally grateful.

webdev,I created this all-in-one JSON Toolkit,"This post might come across as a bit self-promotional, but I created this tool for personal use, and some of my colleagues have found it helpful. It's mainly for developers and testers, so I think r/webdev is a good place to share it, and I hope it will be useful to others too.

This tool addresses some pain points I face when developing, debugging, or testing features that involve JSON data.

* I often need to search for each key whenever I get the data, so I built a way to query multiple keys at once.
* It's difficult to remember deep paths to locate my data, so I built a JSON viewer that lets me extract any path by simply clicking on the key.

Some might argue that I should use Postman test scripts or Postgres' `json_extract_path`. But I find these solutions better suited for stable APIs or data. When I‚Äôm developing a new feature or debugging an issue, the target field can pop into my mind at any moment. So I prefer to quickly access the field and the data directly, rather than having to write a Postman script or SQL query.

webdev,update on my open-source social media scheduler,"Hi everyone, I built a little bit more into my open-source free scheduler :)

Postiz is an open-source social media scheduling tool that offers scheduling on the following:

Instagram, YouTube, Dribbble, LinkedIn, Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, Threads, X, Slack, Discord, Mastodon and BlueSky.

[https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app)

There are some cool new features:

* Option to add stories to Instagram and tag people for collaboration.
* Customer separation - you can group accounts per customer, and when you schedule, you can filter by customer.
* Option to tag companies on LinkedIn (I wanted to tag people also, but it was not possible)
* Fixes for different social media posts failing.
* **Introducing Plugs!** This is a concept you can find in other tools that can boost your engagement for your current posts. Here are some examples:
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, repost it (to regain visibility to it)
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, add another message to it (all your existing commenters will get a notification)

**What's next:**

* Public API - I have been too lazy to make it, I have to push more :)
* One Inbox - so you can reply to all your messages from one place.
* Google My Business provider
* AI Agents - I am still trying to figure out what to do with it, but it looks interesting.

webdev,Full-stack dev looking to go solo - advice needed,"Hey fellow developers! üëã

I'm a technical lead with 5 years of experience building financial software and enterprise applications. I love turning complex business problems into elegant solutions, and I'm looking to branch out on my own.

My stack:

* Backend: Symfony/Laravel (built multiple enterprise apps)
* Frontend: NextJS/React (created dynamic form systems)
* Plus the usual suspects: Docker, AWS, Git, etc.

I'm particularly good at:

* Building smart form systems that adapt based on user input
* Integrating with external APIs and services
* Modernizing legacy systems
* Making complex processes simple and user-friendly

Instead of just looking for regular contract work, I'm interested in:

1. Finding companies whose problems I can solve (and potentially turn solutions into products)
2. Building relationships with businesses that need ongoing development support
3. Creating systems that can be repurposed for similar companies

I've already built a solid Symfony/NextJS starter template to hit the ground running. What I need now is to find the right companies to work with.

For those who've gone solo: How did you find your first real clients? Any specific industries or approaches you'd recommend?

What I've come across:

Many of the devs on these projects are obviously jr. trying to get real world experience under their belt. The problem is, most of these non-profit folks can't see how over their head these devs are. They lack problem solving skills, systems thinking abilities, and professionalism. Often deadlines are missed, they're late or no-show meetings, and they have basic technical problems they struggle to resolve. I try my best to help where I can, but I just don't have the desire to overstep beyond my commitment.

webdev,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6sm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:46,3,1.0,3,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9l6sm
