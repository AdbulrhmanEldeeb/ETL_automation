gaming,Why people act like every Xbox game is on PlayStation right now?,"Dont get me wrong guys, i get all the talk and i especially get the doubt (now everything is an ""what if this goes to PS at some point, and i get it)

And i also dont really care about esclusivity at all, im a all platform owner and i would like to own just one lol.

But recently, especially when people ask what console to buy, i've noticed that people tend to say like ""PlayStation since it has Xbox games anyway""

Now, it is true that they've ported some games here and there, and we have some future games confirmed, but as it is now is **far** from having any decente number to say ""all"". 

Just looking at this year, Xbox released 5 fp games (not counting Ara on PC). Of these, only 1 is multiplatform. And is Cod, a game that was always multiplatform. Indiana Jones will be multiplatform but is a 4-6 months exclusive, still i can see the point.

But also looking at next year, out of 6 announced fp games, only 2 are confirmed for PlayStation and yet again they where always multiplatform. Cod and Doom.

I think is kind of dishonest to push people to a console with the promise of playng everything when is clearly not true. You cant play Starfield on PlayStation, you cant play Halo, you cant play Gears, Flight Sim, Age of Mythology, Hellblade 2, Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, Towerborne ecc.

I get that they might get ported in the future, but that's a theory and not a fact.

Anyway, enjoy gaming on all platform!

The game's cleverness and great storyline (so far) have me feel like I'm in the midst of a real Indiana Jones movie, and it's easily the best Indy content of the 2000s. I'm enjoying it so much that it got me thinking of another movie franchise that I have been wishing could return to the glory days..... 007.

  
GoldenEye is obviously considered a high mark of the series and the N64 era, but I, as a fan of the series, even enjoyed the Nightfire, Agent Under Fire and even the terrible multiplayer of Quantum of Solace on the 360. Bond, like Indiana Jones, is a great protagonist/seires that when written well, could have an amazing return to console. While movie licensing has typically meant awful games for the past few decades, this launch is giving me hope that out there is an opportunity to ""be"" James Bond in a well-developed and modern adaptation that I think is sorely missing from our current gaming world. Ideally, if we could see something that grabs a little inspiration from the Hitman games as well, I could die a happy man!

gaming,Easy open world games like Mario Odyssey?,"My five year old son loves video games and while I’ve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I’ve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There’s basically no way to play that game wrong. It’s a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There’s a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.

We’ve tried some other games to varying success, but I’m looking for more options. We are also somewhat system agnostic as I have the means to provide him with different systems.

1. Kirby and the forgotten lands: probably his second favorite. Very youngster friendly. However, it’s not a sandbox and the linear nature frustrated him sometimes (no going backwards, game forces you in a certain direction).

2. Super Mario world 3d and bowser’s fury: the difficulty was a bit too high for 3d world after the first world and suffers the same linear design issue. Bowsers fury was great but ultimately short for him.

3. Animal crossing new horizons: youngster friendly art and design but honestly not in game play. It seems simple, but is heavy on reading and understanding the motivations of progression (paying off your house, earning money, etc.) it also has the issue of not being able to start from scratch and my island is already pretty decked out. He can start his own tent but the island is still the same as my decked out one.

4. Yoshi’s crafted world: great difficulty for kids but again… not open world

5. Captain Toad Tracker: fun bit too difficult as the puzzles get harder

6. Sonic frontiers: way to clunky. He lost interest pretty much right away because of terrible controls.

7. Zelda: breath of the wild: too difficult for him for progression

8. Pokémon: his reading needs to be polished a bit more for him to really get it.

9. Spider-Man: Miles Morales: hilariously is super fun for him to just swing around the city. He even started getting good at fighting, but the puzzles grind him to a halt and then I have to play all those parts.

Anybody have any suggestions that I’ve missed?

But, I am sick of the sweat. The skill ceilings and the absurd amount of stress they can sometimes bring about instead of joy. I work a full-time job and have fully accepted I will never be on the same level as someone who's either naturally gifted (which I am not), or has the majority of their day to practice (which I do not). So, I ask in hopes that some of you might have some amazing recs!

When I say MP Teamwork, I mean things like Vermintide 2. Deep Rock. Ready or Not. Phasmophobia. The list goes on forever, but I hope you get what I mean. The mission of the game is not ""Kill the other people!"" It is ""All of you are on the same team, working towards the same goal."" Or hell, the examples I listed were just violent (for a lack of a better word) games. Chill games like Party Animals, or other ""minigame"" style experiences are also welcome!

Multiplayer is my favorite type of game to play. I am incredibly anti-social in real life despite wanting social interaction, so it's nice to sit back and play games with other people. It creates this sphere where I am interacting and hanging out with others, but there's really no pressure, and it's a bubble I like to exist in. Thus my preference for it over singleplayer games. But, trying to find games like the ones I'm searching for-outside of the ones I already listed-feels like pulling teeth.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

For me this game was as marking as Outer Wilds, or Subnautica. Two games with surprising aspects you shouldn't know about prior to playing them.

gaming,"I feel sad when i see all the yelling at UbiSoft, because it isn't their fault. ","The loude minority is after UbiSoft yet again for not producing a new masterpiece, but just a good one. Yes they have screwed up a couple of times over the last year chasing trends in the free to play marked, trying to be both the new trendsetters with Roller Champions and BattleCore Arena while still trying to take players from Fortnite and Warzone with Xdefiant.   
  
But besides that, they have also released a bunch of good and great games in form of Assassins Creed: Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla and Mirage, Far Cry 5 and 6, Rainbow Six Siege, The Crew 2 and Motorfest, Riders Republic, Anno 1800, Prince of Persia, TrackMania, Settlers, Star Wars Outlaws and more. Yes, not all aspects with Outlaws was great, but in the end it was a good game, that has gotten better with the latest patches. 

And there lies the flaws with UbiSoft today, their shareholders demanding a quick return on their investment, not allowing the devs to actually do their job and create something and finish it, but half ass it out the pipeline, just as the majority of AAA have been doing the last couple of years. Because when we all got house arrest during the pandemic, and start buying games along with new generation of consoles, wall street suddenly understood that it might be some money to earn on us geeks out here. 

But what they failed to understand is that quality and art takes time, unlike Ford and Apple who can crounch out x amount of cars and phones each hour. So when they investment didnt return a profit the next morning, they started to push on the companies, that again started to push their devs, who in return needed to push unfinished builds to marked. So when we yell at AAA devs creating bad products, we should instead yell at the finance in the background for not having the patient too wait for a complete product.

This false narrative is being abused more than ever by industry leaders.

So this video about how most game studios are offloading development costs onto your GPUs and I wanted to spread the word about it.
I'd like to hear from some people about why this could not be true, but specifically from Design oriented background individuals who deal with graphics design. 

TAA in my opinion is the worst looking one and always made my PC lose a ton of frames instead of using fxaa or something but the visual quality and detail games have done according to this video is that extreme TAA is almost necessary due to it being relied on entirely to mask how badly rendered things are. Other than that, the optimization standard is for 30 fps so that is mainly what games apparently are optimization for as a standard in the industry buy mainly if those games are on console.

I lost 2 1/2 hours of gameplay lol. First time in a long time I've lost that much gameplay it nearly brought tears to my eyes lol. I had gathered so many demons and leveled them. *sigh*

I know SMTV Vengeance adds some new stuff so I don't know if these red enemies are new or not, it's been so long I forgot most of the original game.

Anyway...make sure to regularly save. What's making me kick myself is I recently had passed a save point and I'm in hindsight mode of WHY DIDNT I SAVE?!

gaming,Nintendo Switch Lite or Xbox Series S for my kids' Christmas ,"I have three kids(9, 6, 6), one already has a Switch lite.  
I went to a pawn shop and they have two Switch Lites going for $75 each or an Xbox Series S going for $149.

Our household uses both Gamepass and Nintendo online subscriptions.  
I already personally have a Switch and Xbox Series X, so the kids could use my Gamepass subscription or even play on my Xbox maybe, but I want to get them something they can play whenever they want.

My kids mostly play Minecraft on their Amazon tablets.

Which one should I get? My wife is worried our oldest would take over the Xbox, but there are tons of Gamepass games on there. All three seemed to work fine when I tested them, one of the Switches had some cosmetic damage(like a bite or indention in the corner??) and the Xbox seemed a bit dusty in the vents, but I'm sure I can clean that and put a case on the Switch.

I feel odd buying used stuff for Christmas presents, but these seem like really good deals.

Should I even get either option? I'm a bit worried something could be wrong with either system.  
There was something sticky on one of the switches, but I was going to clean it up real good if I got it.

The Xbox I also don't know how to check if it's banned already and I would have to get controllers.

But it looked similar maybe, but I played it in like 2010, and I assume cause of the way he installed it then that it was already a ""dead"" game, tho lots of people seemed to play it at the time.

gaming,Game console just for LAN?,"EDIT: Some people keep saying other companies CAN do this already. Yes they CAN but they aren't. There are many reasons why they don't but that is a different discussion. 

Also, to reiterate, I'm talking about a game console, not a PC. This means a curated OS specifically engineering for local play, controller driven, self contained system. 

The difference here isn't just the console but the licensing relationships and inhouse development studios that enable this console to function as intended. 

=================

Would you be interested in a game console that was specifically marketed for local multiplayer?

priced similar to a switch, and whose games are specifically made with couch co-op, local system link multiplayer, and LAN parties in mind. 

This specific market segment has been long abandoned and I believe there is a desire, especially among older and much younger gamers, to play games together. 

The system would leverage existing local multiplayer title licenses along with building a strong portfolio of purpose developed games. The idea would be to leverage inhouse studio licensing at higher rate fees for 2nd party systems to help cover the cost of the console. The inhouse studios would also help ensure continuity of local multiplayer cross-console play.

Player hit Goblin with a heavy attack inflicting 10 damage

gaming,Choices matter hell...,"I have a very big issue with this type of games.

It's not a rule, but more often than not it completely breaks the game for me.

My problem with those games, is that in most cases you get locked out of part of the content, based on the decisions you made.

In my opinion this is a very poor game design, artificially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs, if you want to see complete content.

As I never do more than one playthrough of any single player game, I feel somewhat robbed of a full experience.

Another complaint that I could log, is that at their launch many of these games are not balanced well enough, meaning if you pick a ""wrong"" side, you might be underpowered, compared to others.

This inherently leads me to not playing them until at least one or two major patches land, or I might skip them completely, if they fall off my radar.

If I am being completely honest, I would also have to blame my OCD, for wanting to see, and do, everything there is in every game I play, and wanting to min-max my character(s) each time.

Anyone else out there, with similar issues?   

Edit: based on early comments, I want to elaborate.

I have a group of 2 fellows and the 3 of us like to play games together. We have recently played Divinity Original Sin2, and are wrapping up our 2nd playtrhu in BG3 after a brief stint in Diablo 4 VoH.

Up next on the roster is Warhammer 40k Roguetrader, which is a lot like BG3 I think - story, strategy, and RPG elements, but misses that one itch to scrath of PvP.

gaming,Bring Back Good Co-Op Games,"Marvel Rivals came out. Was pretty cool for like 15 minutes and then I just felt kinda bored and a little sad. 

I’ve been playing games since the 80s and idk, I’m just tired of PvP stuff. Really missing the cooperative games of old.

I remember stuff like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or Left 4 Dead or Gauntlet Legends or Halo or even Destiny or the arcade beat em ups like X-men or the Simpsons or Turtles game when it first came out and these games were just so epic and fostered such great teamwork and camaraderie. Helluva dope feeling and rush having to work together to win. Especially back in the days of arcades, nothing cooler than actually assembling 4 people dedicated to pulling it off.

Idk. Everything just feels so competitive, battle royale, hero shootery, and it’s just beginning to feel unnecessary and kinda forced and stale.

Maybe I’m just feeling nostalgic and outta touch lol but I feel like bringing these kinds of great co-op games back in a modern sense in actual abundance would really inject some love and positive vibes back into the community while also, bringing in a whole new demographic of gamers looking for something less demanding and stressful than PvP gaming which I feel like is just low key bloating the market at this point.

P.S. this is no dig Marvel Rivals or to gamers that enjoy these games, I’m just getting this off my chest lol sorry it’s late, I’m high, rant over.

lol nope just a husband, father, business owner and student. I’ve been playing games since the 80s. I know major titles and indie games exist guys no offense lol. Mostly all the ones that have been named so far are not new names to me or games I haven’t tried at some point that just didn’t capture my interest.

Edit: Idk why I’m getting downvoted so much lmao are you taking offense to the fact that I just don’t like the games you’re suggesting as much as you or others do or haven’t played them? 

Idk I think I’ve been pretty respectful about the games I have talked about, even the ones I may not care for as well but idk. Either way, I’ve played Indie game guys. I’ve played games like stardew valley (well technically my wife played and I watched) or warhammer (specifically the vermintide one) and that was honestly years ago. Maybe I’m wrong but, those I don’t feel like are recent games (came out this year) and when I did watch/play them, they weren’t my cup of tea. I guess I should have been specific (like when I mentioned Destiny, I meant specifically the first one as I played 2 and did not care for it as much).

I’m almost 40 and a pretty avid gamer blessed to be able to play a PLETHORA of games over the last few years through different means (work, personal life, events), with 2 kids and a wife who are all also gamers either various taste whether that be in console (we have most past and present) or game type. I do not live under a rock, maybe a more a pineapple under the sea and my only burden is the business of life but, I’ve still found time to do my gaming and follow my hobbies (for business/pleasure) so I’m not completely out the loop.

I’ve had some great suggestion here to help solidify the push to try certain titles (maybe the art style has been putting me off or mechanics or story didn’t capture me) that I have been putting off or stayed away from. And I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and even opinions but let’s not trip on each other off of video games. The post was meant to just be light hearted and random, not this deep dive into my personal gaming preferences or an attack on others interest lol.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs.

gaming,What are some sleeper hit games that people should give more attention to?,"For me, it’s probably Teardown and Children of the Sun.

Teardown is a game where you can destroy anything and everything. It’s the perfect vandalism/heist game too. But I do not recommend the DLC’s. Most are hit or miss. But there is a modding community that frequently makes new content for others to play.

As for Children of the Sun. It’s a game where you have one single Sniper Rifle bullet, and you must make the bullet change trajectory to kill multiple enemies. 

Think of it like the Sniper Elite games, but it’s also a puzzle as well. You have to find out the best path and use shortcuts to your advantage.

gaming,Ghost of Yotei pushback,"So, the latest anti-woke controversy is brewing, and it's giving me a lot of amusement, honestly.

Not gonna delve too far into Ghost of Tsushima because I haven't personally played it, so I'm not able to offer my own opinion on its gameplay or quality, but it was generally highly acclaimed.

Now, following the successful launch of a new IP, the obvious goal for gaming companies is to turn it into a franchise, so a sequel started getting discussed almost before the ink dried on the sales reports. 

Sony just had their - otherwise honestly lackluster - press event to announce upcoming products. 

One of those products was the intended sequel, Ghost of Yotei. As opposed to a direct sequel to the first game, continuing the story specifically of the male protagonist of the first game, Jin Sakai, Sony opted to turn the Ghost series into more of a related anthology apparently; Yotei follows a new character, a female samurai named Atsu.

And there was considerable backlash about that sequel, which Sony apparently didn't expect. 

That backlash has split into three slightly overlapping camps; I'll discuss two before zoning in on one specifically.

The first, and honestly the most reasonable and valid of them, is the gamers who were specifically looking for a continuation of Jin's story. Disappointment there is totally understandable; regardless of how complete a story is, if you are invested in the character, you want there to be more. More time with them, more insight into them, more story about them, more interaction with them, more. 

Since Yotei is still in development, we don't know how much of that there is. It's entirely possible that Sony is taking a page from Mad Max here and using the first game as an origin story for someone who then appears as a recurring character in other people's stories; we *do not know.*

But that viewpoint, that **""we wanted more Jin and this isn't that, wtf""** is the sane people objection to the announcement.

Second is objection to the voice actress. This is less reasonable but comprehensible, because Erika Ishii is a known and outspoken activist. This doesn't affect their voicework in the game one tiny bit - and the people who have discussed it so far have said it is absolutely top notch - but if you disagree with someone's personal stances, disapproving of their choice for your media is understandable.

For me, Erika is a fantastic choice; if you're not familiar, they are on Dimension 20 and a lot of other Dropout network stuff, and is a fairly prominent activist for LQBTQIA+ rights, but they're also immensely talented, creative, and funny. Especially on Dimension 20 you can see this; their characters are usually only second to Emily Axford's routinely game breaking creativity in terms of their impact, and despite their often super extra appearance on the show, they are very very good at submerging herself into the character, which is honestly literally the entire goal of voice acting for video games.

So, the people who are objecting to the game based on Erika have, you know, no taste and are also bigots, but at least it's a comprehensible sort of consistent bigotry.

The third group of objectors, however, is the one I think is funniest.

Now, I'm gonna reveal something totally unimportant that actually I promise will be sort of relevant: in video games, I almost always play a female character. *(In fact, one of my very few actual gaming regrets involves this; right after launch, I decided to play Genshin Impact with two accounts, one for each Traveler, and the account playing as Aether, the male Traveler, got so much luckier in the gacha that I ultimately ended up with that as my main account, and I'd frankly much rather be playing as Lumine.)*

My reasoning is, maybe silly, but very simple: I think girls are pretty. If I'm gonna be playing a game for hours on end and staring at a single character the whole time, I'd rather be looking at a girl. Not because I identify as a girl, but because I think looking at girls is a lot more fun than looking at other guys.

So, the third group of people who are objecting to Ghost of Yotei is entirely made up of guys, who are objecting on the exclusive grounds that they don't want to play a female character.

Unlike the other two reasons for objecting to the game, which while not necessarily reasonable are at least based on something that's a real thing, these guys are objecting based on the fact that a virtual avatar - an inherently unreal, sexless thing made of pixels - is shaped with slightly more curves. 

In other words, they're so utterly dedicated to staring at male bodies that the idea of looking at a female body makes them utterly revolted.

Now, as a guy who likes looking at girls, I gotta say, even as heterosexual as I am, I can't imagine being *offended* that I had to look at a guy; the most I can muster would be *disinterest.*

And that's what makes this so funny for me.

Can you even imagine *how* gay you have to be, to be willing to start a huge flame war online over the idea that you might have to *not* stare at a male for hours and hours on end for the entire duration of your gameplay?

That's way gayer than I am straight, man.

They keep saying it's ""woke"" or ""DEI"" as cover.

But y'all.

They're really saying that they *hunger* for those tasty man butts.

That's fucking funny.

As the title says, I'm not looking for a game with a ""sad story"", but rather an open world game where the world, music, overall atmosphere, and the protagonist just feel drenched in a deep sense of melancholy/sadness. I think a good example of what I'm looking for is Red Dead Redemption 1... despite what happens in the end, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a ""sad story"", but rather a story that gives this overwhelming sense that the world is changing, the old ways are dying, and you are powerless to stop it. Just simply stopping to stand somewhere in the middle of the desert plains, and hearing the haunting music in RDR1 gives this feeling, like the whole game just has this constant, overhanging thick layer of melancholy, no matter where you go.

gaming,Quick review of (almost) all current mini bluetooth controllers!,"Images here: https://imgur.com/a/SZ3VbEy


I love local multiplayer and the easiest way to find people for it is on the go. Lugging around proper full size controllers* would be a chore, and with micro size I can always have even 4 without thinking.

So for starters: my use case is quick plays, 30-90 minutes. Using these regularly for long time would get uncomfortable (and carpal-tunnely I suppose).

The landscape of small controllers is pretty dire to be honest: 8BitDo (for a long time the only option) and rando chinese suppliers.



**8BitDo Lite 2**

It has every button from a classic PS/Xbox layout - including stick click/L3+R3. High quality plastics. Shoulder and trigger button placement is genius and usable. Joystick has a good movement area. Clicks and presses are exquisite. Size is great for the hand, and still light. This is the one controller I could imagine being usable in daily gaming even.

This would be my dream controller. IF it had XInput. Unrelated, but I'm mighty pissed at 8BitDo for not including this with newer models. Yes, these are all aimed for the Switch, but it would have costed next to nothing to add one more mode. Vibration also only works in Switch mode. Yes you can remap with XOutput and the like, but it's a hassle and strangely does not work in every game.

Modes: Switch, Android
Verdict: so close to be perfect, but not reaching it


**8BitDo Zero 2**

My current go-to mini controller. Has XInput. Sadly charges via micro usb (all other are usb-c). No vibration. Buttons feel right. The L/R button is clickable from all directions despite the length, but not really comfortable - which isn't a problem, this size is only used for simple layout games anyway. I wish it would have toggle for modes, there is no visible sign in which it is (toggle is via shortcut combinations).

There is now also a Micro with the same layout as the Q36 below - not ordered becaus missing XInput and I had enough of that after Lite 2)

Modes: Switch, Android, Windows
Verdict: ol' trusty working horse, shows it's age

**LinYuvo Meteor**

Now this is an interesting animal. You can order it for less than half the zero. It has bajillions of color options - I suggest ordering the covered ones, as the LEDs are so bright that you wouldn't want to use them on transparent versions, despite them looking cool as well. It has a circular dpad which I'm neutral about. For some it's easier to hit corners, but it's not as easy as eg. XBox controller's circular one. But it's really clicky, and a bit hard to press, as you can read in the few reviews it has. So dpad is certainly it's biggest drawback. Has vibration. It has a really interesting feature, you can replace keys - dpad with joystick directions and L/R buttons with trigger - without any software, just shortcuts! You can also toggle the light effects and colors, there are quite a few, as gimmick, or turn it off completely (will be remembered).

Verdict: price/features orders of magnitude better than the Zero 2, even Micro. Buttons just don't feel that good, but it's a close call.

**ShanWan Q37**

There exists a version with horizontal and cross (PS and XBox style) joystick placement. You can tell they used CADs from 8BitDo, the inputs have the same appearance - albeit with a very, very cheap plastic. The rounded off body is a bit smaller but thicker and overall harder to hold. But the presses feel ok. There is vibration - both sides even. It has a weird gyro mode in non-switch mode as well where gyro controls the joystick. Can be accidentally triggered and a useless gimmick. But a very welcomed feature is that every single key can be remapped (including this shortcut). It needs a seemingly unrelated mobile app (""GamepadSpace"") - connecting is hacky as you need to enter firmware upload mode - but once done, you are free to customize, even sensitivity, and everything is saved to the controller. This is great, especially since very stupidly in XInput mode the buttons match the switch layout (eg A is B) by default. Until now you would think this is in the endvery ok controller, but you'd be mistaken. Sadly it all falls apart by how incredibly bad quality this controller is. You will get constant disconnects, lag, ghost presses and stuck input. It's just bad, and generic QC issue. I had multiple controllers showing the same sign.

Verdict: It could be the ""good version"" rip-off of 8BitDo, but sadly it's just a mess, and costs the same as 8BitDo.


Modes: Windows/Android, Switch, Playstation

**ShanWan Q36**

The same as Q37, just with copying the 8BitDo Micro form and layout - which makes it even more sad that it's bad.

**Keychain controller**

Being available for 8+ years this is more like an afterthought rather than a serious contender, I included it only for fun. But it's by far the smallest you can go! It only has Android and keyboard function. The ""joystick"" is actually moving only on a 2D plane. Very practical and interesting, but a bit hard to move. Buttons are too mushy. But it is useful as a remote, eg. A is mapped to take a photo in Android.

gaming,I've become a demotivated gamer,"I often get into a new game that I've looked forward to, either at launch or because of discounts on Steam, but then I play for maybe 2-3 hours, a would-be normal session which I would naturally resume the next day or later in the week except... I don't.

I feel like in 2024 I've started so many games that I intended to play through but as soon as I get the first break from them the thought of booting them up again a day later, or the week after declines completely. FTR I don't actually ""game"". I never played League or CS or anything, and even my WoW days clocked in at lvl 50 during the Lich King stuff.

But I always had an affinity for single-player games that are anywhere between 12 hours or 100 hours long. I would get hooked on them, love them and obviously play them until the credits roll, especially RPGs. But now it's weird. I love it, I really have nothing negative to say but I just can't get myself to play it again. For example, I made it to Chapter 3 in Half Life Alyx, finally playing a VR game -- loving it. I don't feel like playing it at all right now. I made it almost to the end of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and I'm like bruh... I don't even hate it like all the haters do, why am I suddenly not playing it anymore?

I’m looking for suggestions considering the following points.

1) I love RPG games with deep mechanics, especially turn based combat.

2) Graphics aren’t an issue.

3) Strategy games are a good shout if they aren’t overwhelming.

4) Need something I can pick up and put down as and when I’ve got 5 minutes.

5) Need to have a story behind them to some degree.

6) Love to grind levels/stats/materials anything but need to have a reason for the grind, grinding for the sake of grinding is a no go.

7) This may be controversial but I love open world/survival/crafting games

Games I’ve played and completed/got bored of recently and don’t want to go back to are as follows.

BG3
Elden Ring
Total war warhammer 3
Final Fantasy 7/9/10/7R
Satisfactory
Rimworld
Subnautica (survived 3hrs)
Graveyard keeper
Rust (might jump on for a few weeks)

I still knew I was being charged $65 for what should be a patch I waited too long for, but I had fun.

I didn't even realize playing BO6 that its FIVE! (FIVE!!!!) games after MW19 and the only change was omni movement? Omni movement affects and helps my playstyle more than most and I still don't care.

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't buy weapons or armor. Like its predecessors, you also heal out of combat, KOed characters revive after a fight, and in this game, your healers can be revived KOed characters an unlimited number of times during a fight. As a result, a lot of commonly seen RPG items aren't in this game removing a lot you can spend money on.

There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.

Nothing makes me happier than having a game with a sense of long-term progress, like I’ve built something and have something to show for it.

I have loved games such as The Last of Us, Days Gone, Zelda and so many more and I played almost every day especially since the ps3 days.
Recently my hands and wrists have gotten a little painful so I haven’t played in a few weeks. The thing is I don’t miss it. Right now as it stands if I never played again it wouldn’t kill me.
It made me wonder how many of us are playing for the love of gaming or because it’s become an easy habit to fall into.
When was the last time any of us stopped playing for a week just to catch our breath so to speak?
This is a hobby that can consume thousands of hours.Maybe we should set aside some of those hours in levelling ourselves up rather than our avatars.

The second the title screen appeared, I felt like I was a kid again. That familiar music, Mario’s face, the vibrant world - it all came rushing back. After a few minutes of gameplay I was literally hooked. Running around, hearing the old sound effects and all that stuff - everything felt so nostalgic

Then suddenly memories started flooding in. I remembered where I was when I first played it - the old couch in my living room, the excitement of my first time exploring the game, the friends I used to play it with after school.

gaming,I actually found a good mobile game and I want to talk about it. ,"The name of the game is Arcane Rush Battlegrounds. 

It’s a battleroyale card game that’s perfect for folks looking for a TFT like experience but something more casual. 

The game starts with 2 groups of 8, the top 4 players of each group then duke it out to find the top player. The original group stage is based on points and the second stage everyone gets 3 life and last one standing wins. 

The cool thing with this is that you’re playing against offline players. So there is no time pressure if something comes up which is great. I found that in the beginning it was very easy to score first place as I am getting to higher ranks I do take some losses against the AI. You earn gold for each elimination you achieve while offline. 

There is also an arena that takes your top builds from the battleroyale to test them against other players and I have found this to be very challenging. 

The game has dealers that have their own cards, and a hero collection they can draft from every game. On top of their being a number of unique races to play while in game each with their own strategy. My personal favourite race are demons and the discard strategy they play with. 

The only time the game pushes ads is to gain extra gold rewards or arena battle chances. Otherwise there are no ads. 

The negative, each of the races are kind of insular, there isn’t many combos to be found. If you start building a race your only real option is to fully build that race since they are all designed to work with themselves. Also the cost of upgrading your dealers is high,300 gold a shot where dailies may not give you enough to enough gold for an upgrade. There are currently 2 dealers with a third on the way and I hope they make some changes to upgrade costs or the amount of gold you can get. 

Well that’s the long and short of it. I hope you all check it out because I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the game. 

Thank you.

Wouldnt a gaming laptop give me the best of both worlds? Smaller size but stlll has a keyboard.

I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004).  Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.

The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I'll play that now for online multiplayer.  I'm curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?

Also, I think it's cool that the original Unreal Tournament (a game from 1999, which I originally played on Windows 98) still runs without a problem on modern PCs (I have it on my current PC, which has Windows 11 and an Intel i9-9900k and an Nvidia 3080 TI).  I have the Game Of The Year edition from Steam though, so I think it was pre-packaged to work on modern PCs.

gaming,"It might sound weird, but I really like when the corpses are done well and remain instead of magically disappearing","TES has probably my favorite approach to this. When you kill an NPC, their body and gore remain for a while before they disappear. You can not only loot their corpses but move them around. After a big battle you look around and see how many lives were lost, how terrible was the encounter, and it feels nice and realistic.

Games where enemies get Thanos snapped like in Elden Ring or turn into a puddle of blood and few random ribs Dragon Age: Origins style or turn into a lootable pouch like in Witcher 3 kind of lack that magical feeling of realism.

gaming,Is a PS5 or a higher refresh rate monitor worth it? (Maybe OLED),"Let’s say for example I have a 165hz 1440p monitor, but can push well over 200fps and then some as it is. Is it truly worth investing in a monitor that can handle that and then some? Potentially OLED too?

Or would it make more sense to invest in a PS5 to have as a system to play older games that are basically dead on PC, but very much alive on Series X/PS5. I know gamepass exists, but I’m not exactly interested in that. 

Kinda curious on feedback of what everyone thinks. I’ve only experienced an OLED TV, and it was incredible, and I don’t necessarily need a console but….i really only prefer the PC for things like MMOs where it really shines.

gaming,"Witcher 3 is almost a decade old, RDR2 is 6 years old. How are these still just about the best graphics? Are there no graphically stunning “show stopper” titles in the last 6 years to compete with them? Have video game graphic advances slowed to a crawl now?","**EDIT** I thought this was clear in my post, but maybe not. I am not saying there aren't better graphics to be found into today's games. I am saying they don't look a Decade better, they don't look 6 years better. For example, Legend of Zelda OOO came out in 1998, Crysis came out in 2007, that's the same gap between the release of Wild Hunt 3 and now. Skyrim came out in 2011, and 6 years prior to that, same gap as between RDR2 and now, the most graphically amazing game just released was the King King movie tie game. There is an ocean of difference, graphically, between Ocarina of Time and Crysis, between King Kong and Skyrim. You could show your grandma a picture of the two and she'd be able to easily point to the one with better graphics. But if you showed Wild Hunt 3 or RDR2 or Battlefield One next to many or even most big budget graphically cutting edge titles of the day, your gran probably couldn't say which have better graphics. The gulf is REALLY narrow compared to the same time span in the past. And if you look up just about any listing of the most graphically impressive games, RDR2, a 6 year old game, is still near the top of basically every list.

Was recently doing an RDR2 play though and was blown away coming back to it, just how damn good it looks. I remember it looked good, but I mean it looks GOOD. And I remember thinking the same about a year ago when I picked Witcher 3 back up. 

Hell star wars battlefront 2 was released in 2017, battlefield 1 was released in 2016, and you’d be hard pressed to find games in their genres released this year that look any better. 

I’m not saying games now look bad, they just don’t look a decade better than Witcher 3. I feel like for most of my life video game graphics have been making continuous leaps. I can’t think of any other time since, hell, the N64, when you’d go damn near a decade with the top tier most graphically impressive cutting edge game not really looking much better than those from 6, 7, 9 years prior. 

Are there graphical powerhouses out there I’m just not aware of?

Control is the only one I can really think of, and control looks great, I just don’t think it looks that much better than say rdr2, maybe slightly better lighting system? But it’s hard to compare since almost all of control takes place indoors.

You can customize the controls to whatever you like. If you want to hold down a button, tap it, or just press it to do a certain action for instance.  In other games changing the controls can be more difficult than it needs to be but Ubisoft just gives you the power to do what works best for you.

I noticed Ubisoft really puts a lot of controls in the players hands when it comes to the gameplay as well.

In star wars outlaws you can change little things like turning on or off the mini puzzles when working on terminals or unlocking doors. You can change the text on the cards in the card games so it's easier to read among other things. I love this especially as you can turn off whatever you want so it doesn't hurt the flow of the game.

gaming,Deep Rock Galactic made me appreciate Indie games more,"Now to be honest, I'm still not that much of an Indie fan. I prefer my games to have a realistic artstyle, to have high visual fidelity, to have hollywood like moments and real time cutscenes and overall the polish only a AAA game can provide. Really, you couldn't bring me to touch an Indie game, because I got burned badly by some and after those experiences, they all looked so cheap and not worth the money.

That said, after a friend finally persuaded me to give DRG a chance and after I played it for a while, both with him and alone, I realized that indie games do can be fun and that stylized graphics can look good. I was really surprised at how fun the game is and over time, my mindset changed to:"" If this Indie game is fun, maybe others are as well."". 

And so I did try them and while most of them still aren't to my liking, I did find a few that I enjoyed (Ready or Not, Executive Assault 2, Cavern of Dreams or Eternal Evil to name a few). It also helps that Indie games become better and better and can reach AA quality levels nowadays, while also having a realistic artstyle.

That said, my tolerance still has limits. If I see any pixelart or cell shading in a game, I still instantly lose any interest, same with obvious pre made assets. And for stylized graphics, it really is a case by case situation. While I tolerate Running with Rifles for example, you can hunt me to the end of the world with Battle Bits Remastered or anything made with Synthy.

However, when you have a game like Ready or Not or SCP 5K, where you can show me ""Here, look. This game looks realistic, this game is dark and gritty and looks like a AAA title on the surface"", then you have my interest and usually a buy as well, if the end product is well made.",Nino_Chaosdrache,1h4elho,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,2024-12-01 21:51:06,0,0.19,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4elho

gaming,Buying games on PS5 Pro vs Series X?,"So, one of the main difference of this generation (PS5 Pro apart) was the PS5 controller, and a few games use the specificities of its controller.

A couple of Qs from that:
- Which games use the dual sense feature?
- Do you know any reviewer at least touching on that? Nowadays it’s never really mentioned when a game is available on both platforms for there’s anything specific for the PS controller
- For those of you having the luxury to have both consoles, where do you decide where to buy your games? I’m looking at The Plucky Squire for example, I want to buy it but no idea of the PS5 dualsense adds something to the experience or not, it’s kind of weird really developers don’t really take the time to mention it. Given Xbox tends to be better with back compat and allows for Play Anywhere (thus PC or handheld) it seems safer to buy on that platform, unless I’m missing something.

gaming,Horses no longer gallop in Red Dead Redemption 2,"
Just as the title says, my horses will no longer gallop or even stride at a decent pace.  My horses only trot at the slowest speed, just happened out of nowhere today while playing on my Xbox Series X.  Even horses I steal from NPCs will stop and just walk.  I only just got the game a couple weeks ago, too.  I have tried every possible solution I could come across:

* I fed the horse
* groomed it over and over
* patted the horse
* removed the saddle and put it back on
* rode without a saddle
* switched to different horses at stables
* reloaded the most previous save
* reloaded old saves
* changed controllers
* closed the game and removed it from Quick Resume, waited a minute to relaunch
* did a hard restart on the XSX console
* I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it

All those things and my horse(s) will not move any faster than a walking stride.  This has affected every single horse across all my saves.  I have already put plenty of progress into the game, but now I either have to go without a horse or play at a snail’s pace

What is your experience? Do they last longer than a year? Arrive broken? What broke first?

**EDIT:**

F\*ck my inbox. Thanks for the replies!

Will the haters please stop down-voting any neutral/positive comments? This kinda shit is just going to make me &amp; others think it's loudness bias instead of objective truth.

gaming,When was the last time a game made your jaw drop in awe?,"I had been running an older PC that was using a 3070ti but unfortunately, the computer had actually been dropped a few feet from my desk during one of my seizures. Still worked fortunately but it had like a weird effect on the graphic card, tried everything from disconnecting it from mobo and reconnecting it making sure it was synchronized correctly. With luck it kept working but when I would try to run games, especially games with more intense graphics you could really notice it so I wouldn't buy new games. Latest game I was playing was deadlock beta but you really noticed it even at the lowest of settings and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

Finally decided it was time to get a new computer so I built myself a new one and gifted it to myself as an early Christmas present (Dec 11) and got it up last week after building it myself. Currently running an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU, 4080 Super GPU, 64gb of memory.

The first game I bought and tried playing was Warhammer 40k Spacemarine 2 and immediately upon loading the initial load video, I was just in awe and my jaw dropped as I couldn't believe it. It felt like I was actually there and even more in-depth than ever before. Reminded me why I loved gaming on a computer so much and what it felt like when it was working in sync perfectly.

Instead of tossing it, I grabbed my soldering iron, bypassed the fuse in about 5 minutes, and gave it new life. Fast forward to today, and this controller is STILL alive!

I get that casual players make up the vast majority of the player base, but they still don't really know what they're talking about when it comes to what is good and bad in a video game.

For example, a casual Smash Bros Ultimate player might think Ganondorf is overpowered because his attacks all deal a ton of damage and have high knockback. In reality though, Ganondorf has been bottom tier in every game post-Melee, including Ultimate where he is the single worst character in the game. His atrocious mobility, frame data, neutral game, and recovery all make him one of the few characters that are borderline unusable against anyone that knows what they're doing.

The casual player in that circumstance may want Ganondorf nerfed even though he's already terrible, further crippling an already weak character. Their issues with Ganondorf can be solved if they just improve at the game, but they want him kneecapped instead.

gaming,What are some good CRPGs for a BG3 fan new to the genre?,"I generally play action combat games and haven't played many CRPGs. I even struggled to get into Dragon Age origins, but ended up liking it and then I played DA2 and DAI which got me interested in BG3 and I absolutely loved it.

So now I want more of that experience, but I'm worried that most CRPGs would bore me as I'm not a fan of D&amp;D and the thing about BG3 that makes me love it so much is the fact that characters are likable, combat is fun, graphics are great, you get those immersive closeups during conversations, and everything is voiced.

I saw some gameplay of a few CRPGs on YT and I noticed they're usually not fully voiced, the graphics are outdated, and there are no closeups on characters during conversations, which makes the game not feel immersive to me.

There's a sale on Steam and I was looking at these games: Rogue Trader, Pillars of Eternity (1 &amp; 2), Divinity Original Sin (1 &amp; 2), and Pathfinder (Kingmaker &amp; PotW).

I know they're all good, but is any of them friendly for CRPG noobs like me?

gaming,What are some of the better purposes for coins and collectables in modern platformers?,"Coins and 1-Ups were a precious commodity in games like the SNES Donkey Kong Country series, but these days many find the whole lives system antiquated, and more demoralizing than it's worth.

So, in a modern context where checkpoints are plentiful and there's no Game Over screen, do you think many games have figured out a strong alternative benefit to coins?

I don't think RPG elements work in something as simple as a platformer, so I tend not to consider them.

Games like Mario Galaxy wanted to keep 1-Ups, tho the game wasn't challenging and the checkpoints were forgiving enough that they made minimal difference.

Mario Odyssey has Skins purchasable with coins which is fine, but less interesting from a mechanics perspective.

Buying Power-Ups could still be fun.

gaming,Q: Is there any game award show you have some respect for?,"We all know The Game Awards featuring Geoff ""I host everything in gaming"" Keighley is considered, at least to the majority of gamers, as the be-all end-all of gaming award shows but that's mainly because he went to so much effort to make it like movie and television award shows which equally have been garnering disdain for being propped up ""buy your own award"" venues for companies.

TGA isn't the only one out there, and some of the others have a decent reputation because of their more rigorous voting processes or blind nomination selection. **With that in mind, do you have any kind of respect towards any on this list or do you just hate all award shows regardless of ethics or dignity?**

* **The Game Awards** \- votes made by games journalists (90%) and general audiences (10%), note that it's not confirmed if that means individual journalists or the publications themselves via a series of internal voting processes
* **D.I.C.E. Awards** \- votes made by members of the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, made up of studios and publishers (similar to the Academy Awards)
* **Famitsu Awards** \- votes made by magazine readers, primarily a Japanese audience
* **Game Developers Choice Awards** \- nominations are made via an invite-only 500 member committee called the International Choice Awards Network with additional nominations made by Gamasutra journalists, then votes are made by the entirety of ICAN at the start of the Game Developers Conference
* **The Golden Joystick Awards** \- the oldest continuously running award show (1983), originally voted on by the British public but now an international public vote
* **Japan Game Awards (formerly CESA Awards)** \- winners determined by a combination of a CESA panel of juries, public votes, and sales figures
* **SXSW Gaming Awards** \- nominations submitted by the general public then narrowed down to 5 per category by the 40 member SXSW Gaming Advisory Board, votes made by the general public

**Personally I'm not a fan of award shows** as I think they demean gaming as an art and don't recognise the work of the individuals behind them in a lot of cases. It's a similar issue with how the Oscars recognise the actors and directors, then every other category just credits the work but not the people or lead in charge of that team.

But out of the main gaming awards shows, **I at least give credit to the Golden Joysticks** for being the only one voted on exclusively by the general public (and not those who can buy their award) **and the GDCA** because it's developers voting for other developers' works so it's a recognition of technical achievement as well.

Edit:

Some more thoughts: Popular vote alone is not necessarily worse, industry vote only is not necessarily better; this is why I mentioned the Golden Joysticks and GDCA in particular.

The Golden Joysticks have always split the Game of the Year into its PC, console (sometimes separate consoles), and ultimate categories. And rarely has a game won all three, even if it exists on PC and console. For example, the 2024 winners were Satisfactory (PC), Helldivers 2 (console), and Black Myth Wukong (ultimate GotY). They're also more stringent with the votes when looking for fraud, bot votes, and false votes; if you're in the UK you can vote from your phone and it's unlikely anyone would pay for an extra phone just for this event, if you're outside the UK then votes are tied to your email address and additional checks are done to make sure it isn't a throwaway. So surprisingly, it doesn't always go the way of the public making weird or joke choices, but that's only because they're not given complete freedom to enter whichever game they want as their vote.

The Game Developers Choice Awards could be seen as a circle-jerk between devs, I admit. But it seems less likely than what goes on with DICE or TGA, as it's individual developers voting and not a company or journalist. Because of this it seems like it would be harder to buy off votes of so many people without word getting out, and even if they did it would be too high a price to pay. Even if they did, there's no guarantee those paid off would vote how they say they're going to as the votes are anonymous and developers can't vote for games they've worked on.

Basically the former seems more in-line with general user reviews from a gameplay while the latter seems more in line with how developers judge each others' works from a technical perspective.",Safebox,1h15bsk,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h15bsk/q_is_there_any_game_award_show_you_have_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h15bsk/q_is_there_any_game_award_show_you_have_some/,2024-11-27 14:17:37,0,0.31,0,0,73,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h15bsk

gaming,Lets talk about damage modelling,"Persistent day dream so I'm going to write it down to get it out of my head.

In the genre of combat driving games and mech something that has never quite hit right is damage modelling.

Back on the atari ST I was playing an F1 game and tire wear was modelled and being ""back then"" your imagination filled in the blanks. For some reason that sticks with me.

F16 fighting falcon, again on the Atari ST - getting the bird back with all the warning lights flashing and a broken under carriage. Real sense of achievement.

Fast forward a bit, Mech Warrior 2. Heat management, per limb damage. Seeing mechs with arms missing etc. All good.

Wipe out! Ps1. Speed and weapons! Bounce off things and slow down or boom and respawn. Classic fun.

Rollcage, more of the same but wheels on the ground and you could knock buildings on top of people. That was extra fun.

split second, blur. All had weapons and stuff but the damage modelling was nill. Split second environmental stuff although scripted was cool.

Burnout? no weapons but good deformation

Special shout out to Soldier of fortune 2s ghoul engine and their damage model. Gory as you like with the easter egg that if you get a cross body shot just right intestines would fall out.

Another shout out to Frostbite engine and battlefield building damage.

Mech games, damage is basically red amber green done with soot.

With the crazy amount of cores we all have aren't we ready for deeper damage modelling.

There are physics voxel games (abriss?) that go to the extreme. Of course we cant build games in that engine yet with tiny voxels and individual physics but there is a half way house between full material simulation and red/amber/green.

My ""realistic"" expecation using a mech game as an example;

3 damage layers CC/CH/SK

Core function, chassis, skin.

In essence its just 2 layers of armour over a health bar.

* Core function can keep Red amber green
* Chassis - 4 states - pristine, battered, buckled &amp; failed
* Skin - this is where the visual effort needs to go.

3 types of damage (possibly 4)

Energy, kinetic, explosive (environmental)

Example base weapon damage value distribute across the 3 layer cc/ch/sk

* Energy - various sized soot marks and has to wear through skin first. 5%/10%/85%
* Kinetic - holes in skin, chassis and core. 5%/60%/35%
* Explosive - soot and holes. (possibly just scaled up from the above) 15%/60%/25%
* Environmental - basically same as kinetic but without holes. Crush damage from falling masonry or bumping into a tree. Imagine an urban setting where you get staggered in to a building and it collapses on you.

Seeing games like borderlands with crazy amounts of gun stats makes it seems straightforward to implement a damage table like the above and churn out relevant textures and model deformations.

(core damage distribution across multiple components is a complexity I haven't thought through)

Slap on the Frostbite building damage and you can create a visceral mech game. If anyone has played Pacific Drive - the car is the star. Now change that to a mech.

This approach could also be applied to combat driving games. Added bonus of damage effect on car handling. Trackside buildings and collateral damage.

Easy if lengthy to type out. AAA studios are churning out cookie cutter games and this doesn't feel to outlandish to expect and its more meaningful than just reflective puddles and shadows. Also can scale across console generations with PCs getting the largest asset stack and it gets scaled back from there.

A final thought, in death race film (remake) a driver had ""the tombstone"" as a bullet proof shield. There's a scene where its getting chewed away but autocannon fire. That experience of seeing your armour flaking away and crumbling. Having that rather that hit markers or little shield icons, thats what I'd like.

Now this is written down I can dream up something else.",Olly230,1h118p6,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h118p6/lets_talk_about_damage_modelling/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h118p6/lets_talk_about_damage_modelling/,2024-11-27 10:22:29,0,0.47,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h118p6
gaming,Am I misremembering SR2 and 3?,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Saint's Row 2 and 3 (and possibly even 4) have on road GPS directions so you didn't have to always keep a hawkeye on the mini-map for directions?

For all the features and mechanics open world games *borrow* from one another, why is this the one that has been left behind?

gaming,Does the experience older gamers have serve as a  disadvantage in modern games?,"This might seem like a strange question but I feel like my gaming experience is a detriment in modern games. I grew up with titles where coming in contact with an enemy meant taking damage, and I’ve been playing Hades where they only hurt you if you get caught in the active frames of their attacks. I’m so used to avoiding contact that even though I know I can dash through them for backstab damage, I have a hard time turning off decades of experience. I’ve found that in other games, enemies are doing things that I’m not expecting, like leaving what appear to be clearly delineated zones to look for me, chasing me through changing screens, etc. Most of the games I used to play had enemy behavior limited by hardware restrictions, but as they fall away I’m finding modern gameplay mechanics are killing me until I adapt. Am I alone in this or do other gamers find they’re having the same issues. I’m Gen X, for what it’s worth.
