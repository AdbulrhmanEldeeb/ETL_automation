This false narrative is being abused more than ever by industry leaders. We want to change the direction the industry is heading so that sufficient hardware is not buried for the sake of unnecessary hardware sales and mass consumer manipulation. But we need both gamers and developers more aware of this massive industry oxymoron.""
""Key words:
TAA, Upscaling, Fake Optimization, Blessing or Curse,
Hybred, DLSS, DLAA""


So this video about how most game studios are offloading development costs onto your GPUs and I wanted to spread the word about it.
I'd like to hear from some people about why this could not be true, but specifically from Design oriented background individuals who deal with graphics design. 

TAA in my opinion is the worst looking one and always made my PC lose a ton of frames instead of using fxaa or something but the visual quality and detail games have done according to this video is that extreme TAA is almost necessary due to it being relied on entirely to mask how badly rendered things are. Other than that, the optimization standard is for 30 fps so that is mainly what games apparently are optimization for as a standard in the industry buy mainly if those games are on console. What would the gaming industry projects look and play like if the standard for optimization was at 120 or higher FPS?",Placzkos,1h9luw7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9luw7/fake_optimization_in_modern_gaming_and_how_we/,https://youtu.be/lJu_DgCHfx4?si=OknaXDpQtMpEojEr,2024-12-08 15:58:52,0,0.45,0,0,57,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5kHodCQXPcqQsvzOqdjkBGHZXF462rAD86T-WDi53eU.jpg,t3_1h9luw7

So I'm not the longest standing gamer, but for the last 5 years, I've been playing competitive multiplayer games. I mainly just played competitive Minecraft, like Ranked Bedwars and co, but It's taken a toll on me in certain ways. I don't want to quit gaming yet, as I'm still relatively young (I'm under 21).

Now I never played ay of the ""great classics"" most people played in 2010 upwards. I don't have the beefiest PC either, so I'm looking for story mode games that aren't too new and demanding on your device either. The only one I've heard of is Titanfall, which I'll most likely get today. It doesn't have to be a calming game, but something I can pause, come back to, and feel like I'm in a movie too.

gaming,Multiplayer Teamwork/Minigame Game Recommendations?,"I have grown exhausted of all the ""kill the other people!"" Games. A lot of them are great, well made games. Don't get me wrong. But, I am sick of the sweat. The skill ceilings and the absurd amount of stress they can sometimes bring about instead of joy. I work a full-time job and have fully accepted I will never be on the same level as someone who's either naturally gifted (which I am not), or has the majority of their day to practice (which I do not). So, I ask in hopes that some of you might have some amazing recs!

When I say MP Teamwork, I mean things like Vermintide 2. Deep Rock. Ready or Not. Phasmophobia. The list goes on forever, but I hope you get what I mean. The mission of the game is not ""Kill the other people!"" It is ""All of you are on the same team, working towards the same goal."" Or hell, the examples I listed were just violent (for a lack of a better word) games. Chill games like Party Animals, or other ""minigame"" style experiences are also welcome!

Multiplayer is my favorite type of game to play. I am incredibly anti-social in real life despite wanting social interaction, so it's nice to sit back and play games with other people. It creates this sphere where I am interacting and hanging out with others, but there's really no pressure, and it's a bubble I like to exist in. Thus my preference for it over singleplayer games. But, trying to find games like the ones I'm searching for-outside of the ones I already listed-feels like pulling teeth. I appreciate any recs you might have, or if you just gave this a look over, I appreciate it all the same.

gaming,Easy open world games like Mario Odyssey?,"My five year old son loves video games and while I‚Äôve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I‚Äôve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There‚Äôs basically no way to play that game wrong. It‚Äôs a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There‚Äôs a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.

We‚Äôve tried some other games to varying success, but I‚Äôm looking for more options. We are also somewhat system agnostic as I have the means to provide him with different systems.

1. Kirby and the forgotten lands: probably his second favorite. Very youngster friendly. However, it‚Äôs not a sandbox and the linear nature frustrated him sometimes (no going backwards, game forces you in a certain direction).

2. Super Mario world 3d and bowser‚Äôs fury: the difficulty was a bit too high for 3d world after the first world and suffers the same linear design issue. Bowsers fury was great but ultimately short for him.

3. Animal crossing new horizons: youngster friendly art and design but honestly not in game play. It seems simple, but is heavy on reading and understanding the motivations of progression (paying off your house, earning money, etc.) it also has the issue of not being able to start from scratch and my island is already pretty decked out. He can start his own tent but the island is still the same as my decked out one.

4. Yoshi‚Äôs crafted world: great difficulty for kids but again‚Ä¶ not open world

5. Captain Toad Tracker: fun bit too difficult as the puzzles get harder

6. Sonic frontiers: way to clunky. He lost interest pretty much right away because of terrible controls.

7. Zelda: breath of the wild: too difficult for him for progression

8. Pok√©mon: his reading needs to be polished a bit more for him to really get it.

9. Spider-Man: Miles Morales: hilariously is super fun for him to just swing around the city. He even started getting good at fighting, but the puzzles grind him to a halt and then I have to play all those parts.

Anybody have any suggestions that I‚Äôve missed?

The game's cleverness and great storyline (so far) have me feel like I'm in the midst of a real Indiana Jones movie, and it's easily the best Indy content of the 2000s. I'm enjoying it so much that it got me thinking of another movie franchise that I have been wishing could return to the glory days..... 007.

  
GoldenEye is obviously considered a high mark of the series and the N64 era, but I, as a fan of the series, even enjoyed the Nightfire, Agent Under Fire and even the terrible multiplayer of Quantum of Solace on the 360. Bond, like Indiana Jones, is a great protagonist/seires that when written well, could have an amazing return to console. While movie licensing has typically meant awful games for the past few decades, this launch is giving me hope that out there is an opportunity to ""be"" James Bond in a well-developed and modern adaptation that I think is sorely missing from our current gaming world. Ideally, if we could see something that grabs a little inspiration from the Hitman games as well, I could die a happy man!

gaming,Why people act like every Xbox game is on PlayStation right now?,"Dont get me wrong guys, i get all the talk and i especially get the doubt (now everything is an ""what if this goes to PS at some point, and i get it)

And i also dont really care about esclusivity at all, im a all platform owner and i would like to own just one lol.

But recently, especially when people ask what console to buy, i've noticed that people tend to say like ""PlayStation since it has Xbox games anyway""

Now, it is true that they've ported some games here and there, and we have some future games confirmed, but as it is now is **far** from having any decente number to say ""all"". 

Just looking at this year, Xbox released 5 fp games (not counting Ara on PC). Of these, only 1 is multiplatform. And is Cod, a game that was always multiplatform. Indiana Jones will be multiplatform but is a 4-6 months exclusive, still i can see the point.

But also looking at next year, out of 6 announced fp games, only 2 are confirmed for PlayStation and yet again they where always multiplatform. Cod and Doom.

I think is kind of dishonest to push people to a console with the promise of playng everything when is clearly not true. You cant play Starfield on PlayStation, you cant play Halo, you cant play Gears, Flight Sim, Age of Mythology, Hellblade 2, Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, Towerborne ecc.

I get that they might get ported in the future, but that's a theory and not a fact.

gaming,Return of the Obra Dinn is my preferred games in years.,"No spoilers.

This game is one of the most brilliant games I ever played. And a short one, which I appreciate having now a toddler. 
What a wonderful time to be alive to play such an awesome piece of art. Lucas Pope if you ever read this, I'll pay you a drink, whenever.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

gaming,"[PS5 - Helldivers 2] Image quality difference with TV vs Monitor, why?","Probably a stupid question but I've never been one to pay attention to quality outside of 1080p/4k/etc

But i FINALLY noticed a real difference during gaming and I think I figured out that it's my monitor but I don't know why.

Played Helldivers 2 on my TV and everything looked wonderful, swapped back over to my monitor and its more sharp/pixelated. I'm not sure if that's the best way to put it honestly. But the fire especially was way more pixelated. I didnt change the settings. 

I'm hoping someone can look at the specs of each and speculate as to why.

I think I have found my answer ladies and gentlemen , SIMULATION games are the shit for people like me lol. Will be focusing on powerwash simulator and Hardspace ship breaker. 

My personal shortlist to try for the future based on thread: 

* Vampire Survivors
* Tetris
* Brotato (lol)
* Snowrunner 
* Old School wow / runescape 
* Fallout 76
* Skate

Lots of great suggestions here though , keep reading and you'll find something for you!

gaming,Why are there so few notable/good Spy thriller games?,"Im rewatching all the Bond movies and it occured to me that it seems to be a severely under represented genre in gaming?

Other than actual bond games which there haven't been any for years there really isn't any Spy Thriller style games. Sure there are espionage games like Syphon Filter, MGS, Splinter cell etc but they're much more spec ops commando style espionage. 

Where is the jet setting around the world, shmoozing with villians in casinos, infiltrating enemy organisations in plain sight, flirting with femme fatals, car chases with gadget filled cars, laser watches, shark pits, volcano bases games?

It seems like such an obvious premise. Id imagine a mix of LA Noire and hitman with some Uncharted style action set pieces.

gaming,"I feel sad when i see all the yelling at UbiSoft, because it isn't their fault. ","The loude minority is after UbiSoft yet again for not producing a new masterpiece, but just a good one. Yes they have screwed up a couple of times over the last year chasing trends in the free to play marked, trying to be both the new trendsetters with Roller Champions and BattleCore Arena while still trying to take players from Fortnite and Warzone with Xdefiant.   
  
But besides that, they have also released a bunch of good and great games in form of Assassins Creed: Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla and Mirage, Far Cry 5 and 6, Rainbow Six Siege, The Crew 2 and Motorfest, Riders Republic, Anno 1800, Prince of Persia, TrackMania, Settlers, Star Wars Outlaws and more. Yes, not all aspects with Outlaws was great, but in the end it was a good game, that has gotten better with the latest patches. 

And there lies the flaws with UbiSoft today, their shareholders demanding a quick return on their investment, not allowing the devs to actually do their job and create something and finish it, but half ass it out the pipeline, just as the majority of AAA have been doing the last couple of years. Because when we all got house arrest during the pandemic, and start buying games along with new generation of consoles, wall street suddenly understood that it might be some money to earn on us geeks out here. 

But what they failed to understand is that quality and art takes time, unlike Ford and Apple who can crounch out x amount of cars and phones each hour. So when they investment didnt return a profit the next morning, they started to push on the companies, that again started to push their devs, who in return needed to push unfinished builds to marked. So when we yell at AAA devs creating bad products, we should instead yell at the finance in the background for not having the patient too wait for a complete product.
