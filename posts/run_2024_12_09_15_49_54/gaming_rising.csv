Edit: 

I think I have found my answer ladies and gentlemen , SIMULATION games are the shit for people like me lol. Will be focusing on powerwash simulator and Hardspace ship breaker. 

My personal shortlist to try for the future based on thread: 

* Vampire Survivors
* Tetris
* Brotato (lol)
* Snowrunner 
* Old School wow / runescape 
* Fallout 76
* Skate

Lots of great suggestions here though , keep reading and you'll find something for you!

gaming,Return of the Obra Dinn is my preferred games in years.,"No spoilers.

This game is one of the most brilliant games I ever played. And a short one, which I appreciate having now a toddler. 
What a wonderful time to be alive to play such an awesome piece of art. Lucas Pope if you ever read this, I'll pay you a drink, whenever.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

For me this game was as marking as Outer Wilds, or Subnautica. Two games with surprising aspects you shouldn't know about prior to playing them.

I wanted to share my excitation and awe with this community. 
Now I feel empty and should find which game to play next.",Goupilverse,1h9vsyf,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9vsyf/return_of_the_obra_dinn_is_my_preferred_games_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9vsyf/return_of_the_obra_dinn_is_my_preferred_games_in/,2024-12-08 23:22:18,166,0.87,166,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9vsyf

Other than actual bond games which there haven't been any for years there really isn't any Spy Thriller style games. Sure there are espionage games like Syphon Filter, MGS, Splinter cell etc but they're much more spec ops commando style espionage. 

Where is the jet setting around the world, shmoozing with villians in casinos, infiltrating enemy organisations in plain sight, flirting with femme fatals, car chases with gadget filled cars, laser watches, shark pits, volcano bases games?
