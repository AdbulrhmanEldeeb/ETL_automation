movies,I don't agree with the sentiment that the Driver from Drive was a psychopath (SPOILERS),"Just watched the movie for the first time. Fantastic, instantly went to see what others were discussing. Seems the common consensus seems to be the Driver was sociopath/psychopath, even my friends think so.

To me, the movie was a character study on a troubled man looking for a normal, happy life, but got involved with the wrong people (and continues to.) Not a sociopath or psychopath. Probably on the spectrum. The whole movie was also showing us that he was a real human being. 

First, biggest signs of a socio/psychopath are lack of empathy and love, but he clearly has a lot of empathy and love for Irene and the child. He puts himself into danger just so he can keep them from harm. He isn't just physically or intimately in love with her, he never advances on her in a sexual way, it's a sweet and caring love. The elevator scene didn't scream lust to me (or my wife) personally, just a final kiss before he'll never see her again. The dates were always innocent with them chilling with her child. He is also very clearly distraught when Shannon dies, who again, proves to be part of the wrong friends he accidentally associates himself with. 

At the beginning of the movie, he denies a job for a lot of money from a previous client. Tells him to STFU, but ends up inadvertently taking the job because now Irene and her little boy are in danger if he doesn't.

People also mention the brutality of his kills, but all his kills in the movie come from self defense, or defense of a loved one. He was furiously stomping on the guy in the elevator because he was an active and present threat to Irene. It was a violent outburst towards his frustration at being unable to keep a person he loves out of danger. She becomes sad because she realizes she fell in love with yet another man with violent baggage that mean harm to the family.

He 100% does have a violent past. That is why he is disconnected, awkward, calculated and aware. 

He has good intentions, but fate and nature keep him away from them. He's the frog, the scorpion, and the shark in one package. He's not feigning his care for humanity. He sacrificed his only remaining bond to keep her safe. He left the money behind. Gave her a sweet goodbye voicemail. Clearly sad as he drives onto nowhere, where he'll probably get a job on the spot from a random guy again, forever and ever in this cycle.",Forhaver,1ha4h5u,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,2024-12-09 07:28:38,0,0.44,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha4h5u

movies,Juror #2 with no spoilers and a general question about suspension of disbelief in movies!,"I won’t spoil Juror #2, but there are two “major” plot points that, as a lawyer myself, just pulled me fully out of the movie - my wife and family are not lawyers and they had similar issues. Things that were just so unbelievably ridiculous I couldn’t take the movie seriously. There are a lot of legal thrillers that are a bit silly but I give passes because I love them (My Cousin Vinny for instance?) I just don’t understand though in a serious legal drama how you don’t have a legal consultant in the writers room that says “no this isn’t serious don’t do this.”

My question to you all is a more general question - what movie have you seen that is about something you either have a ton of knowledge on or is about your work that is so unrealistic it pulled you out of the movie? AND what’s the opposite (a movie that is unrealistic but you didn’t even care because it’s so good)?

movies,Was the Hag in Snow White an Illusion?,"We all know that after the huntsman fails to provide Snow White's heart, the queen then magically transforms herself into the old hag which she then uses to trick Snow White into eating the apple.

The thing that I've always been curious on is whether or not that transformation is simply an illusion or not. What I mean is does the black magic only make her appear to be an old woman but she still functions as her normal self or is it truly a transformation and she IS that old woman? Sure she acknowledges the voice change, but she also seems to run pretty damn fast for an old woman and almost succeeded in moving a boulder onto the dwarfs; also an impressive feat given her ""age"". It wouldn't surprise me if someone that powerful was able to keep her strength and endurance while changing the voice to make it believable. 

What do you all think? 

Bonus question, do you think that after her death the magic wore off? Or did she remain even in death as the hag?

Regardless, personally she remains tied for my top Disney villain (with Maleficent), and by far the scariest, particularly as a child.

movies,"""The Lovely Bones:"" A New Add to My Least Favorite Movies List","I just saw the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. 

I came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on ""paired with"" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl ""everyone dies"" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. 

I also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to ""everyone."" The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. 

Furthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the ""cool grandma"" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a ""grown man"" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just ""live with it"" less than a year after the murder.

It's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.

Finally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the ""weird looking, creepy stranger"" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.

This movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.",Due_Assist_7614,1ha2xe2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,2024-12-09 05:43:43,319,0.71,319,0,151,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha2xe2

movies,"I'm gonna defend the ""Liar revealed"" trope in Bug's life","I know people hate the ""Liar Revealed"" trope and im not gonna argue that this scene is actually a ""Masterfully done example"" of it or anything, but people always say the same thing regarding it.  ""Why do they care that Flik lied?  They have the giant bird! thats the plan now! why wouldnt that work?!?!""

But people are forgetting the overall context of Flik in the group.  Flik was a *continuous* screw-up before he went out to get the warrior bugs.  They literally sent him out of the colony to look for warriors just so they would have time to fix HIS major screw-up.  They were even arguing about what his punishment should be but couldnt figure one out cause he's apparently had, and subsequently messed up, every single job he's been given.  So they aren't discounting the bird plan because ""oh Flik lied so theres no way that plan will work.""  They're discounting it because he's literally **NEVER** had a plan that DIDNT make things worse.  

On top of that, they think him saying ""The Bird will Work"" is just him trying to cover his own Ego rather than to save everyone.  He lied about the Warrior bugs the ENTIRE time they were there and if the grasshoppers came, they would've been no help whatsoever without the bird plan.  NOT telling the truth actively put the entire colony at risk as they weren't rushing to gather extra food for the grasshoppers.  They think he kept the lie going to just protect HIMSELF, so him insisting on the bird plan sounds like he's still protecting HIMSELF over the colony.

Again, I understand people don't like the Liar revealed trope, and I won't say this is a 'groundbreaking' take on it or anything, but the ants don't think his plan will work cause he's screwed up every single idea he's ever had.

What I’m looking for, though, is movies that take place in historical versions of the standard courtroom drama. For arguments sake, by historical let’s say we mean before 1930. These courtroom settings could be either in a western or non-western country.

Two films made me think of this topic, and they coincidentally have the same lead actor and similar themes. The first one I saw was Le Colonel Chabert (1994), with Gerard Depardieu as a French cavalry officer presumed dead during the Napoleonic Wars. When he returns, he hires a lawyer to regain his inheritance from his remarried widow.    
The second, also starring Gerard Depardieu, was Le Retour de Martin Guerre (1982). In this one, a peasant in 16th century France leaves his wife and village to take part in the Hundred Years’ War. But the man who returns seems to be an imposter, and the village is divided on his identity.

movies,"Characters, where you felt the same exact devastation they did. ","Hearts In Atlantis. Liz, the mother was so excited about being included on the business retreat. Obviously, the pay increase to take care of the family. I was fucking gutted when she found out what sort of business retreat her boss had in mind. Every time I watch the film, my heart sinks. She was so excited and hopeful. It was a knife in the chest and the back. I still have never forgiven the actor that was her boss. I'll honestly stop watching something if he pops up.

The performances of everyone in this movie was amazing, but its few films where you feel just as bad emotionally as the character does. You feel bad for them. You feel as if ""what if that happened to me?!"" and you're living it in real time.

Its not so much the actions, because a lot of people go through this. But watching the entire before and after is what the film captured well. It was seeing a characters candle extinguished.

The only other time I really felt the film was when the villagers in Apocalypto were enslaved/sacrificed. It really captured how dire the situation was, and how much of a total and complete alien mindfuck that would have been.

movies,What did we think of Nightbitch?,"I was on the fence, leaning negative, for the first two-thirds. This is coming from someone who unreservedly adores *Can You Ever Forgive Me* and *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*. Once it hit the third act, I got it. And thank god it clicked, because it would have made me really sad to give a negative review to a movie that needle-drops ""Dare to Be Stupid"" by Weird Al.

While I still prefer Marielle Heller's previous films, this big and often baffling swing reveals itself as a deeply personal reflection on balancing artistic legacy with continuing heritage. Kudos to Heller for making a film on her terms, even if it almost turned me off completely before eventually winning me over.

I was reminded of Ari Aster's *Beau Is Afraid*. In *Beau*, Joaquin Phoenix as Aster's self-insert protagonist only finds peace when performing a play in the woods—mirroring how Aster himself might only feel at ease when creating films and seeing the world through his unique lens. Even as some audiences follow Richard Kind's character out the door wondering what the hell they just saw, they at least had the opportunity to understand how it feels to live with Aster's restless, haunting brain.

An unhinged Amy Adams gives us a similar peek into Heller's mind in *Nightbitch*. And like Scoot McNairy's character admits, I ""didn't get it"" at first. Honestly, as a single man with no kids, I still don't get all of it. But now I feel a little closer to empathizing, rather than just sympathizing, with moms in the arts.

(Side note: I saw Brian De Palma's *Phantom of the Paradise* a week ago and didn't recognize a young Jessica Harper until the end credits. Then tonight I didn't realize an older Jessica Harper plays Norma until I saw her name on the Letterboxd page. I don't know what's causing my Jessica-Harper-prosopagnosia, but as a big fan of hers, I'm hoping one of the witches at Tanz Akademie can cast a spell to fix it.)

movies,Han’s Zimmer’s score for Interstellar,"I was fortunate enough to get IMAX 70MM tickets for a showing. Of Interstellar’s re-release last weekend.

Obvious love for the visuals aside. One thing that I did not appreciate when I saw this film 10 years ago was the stakes and what was happening to the characters. Being that this was Nolan’s first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could “solve” his movie like many tried to after Inception released.

I can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.

I read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. “Stay/Coop leaving Murph” in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. 

there is something so powerful in that composition that just had me losing it. It might be the idea that I’m becoming more open to becoming a father, but when the entire orchestral noise starts escalating as Coop is letting Tom have the truck, I am wailing for him to stay. 

And this was just for one of the compositions in this film. I can keep going on about how this element alone was truly amazing for a film like this.

I noticed strong similarities between its plot and more recent movies like Bong Joon-Ho's Memories of Murder and Wei Shujun's Only The River Flows.

To be honest, I doubt that the next winner will be able to top that...

...but we can try. I'm following an alphabetical order here (yeah, yeah, I know, that England and Co are still missing, wait for it), and so, we now take a look at movies set in **Switzerland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Do Audiences Even Care About Cinematic Details Like Color and Light?,"As a filmmaker passionate about cinematography, I’ve been diving deep into the niche of film emulation—replicating the look and feel of celluloid film in digital work. I find it fascinating, almost magical, how the right colors, textures, and lighting can transform a scene. But here’s the question that keeps circling in my mind: Do audiences, especially those not involved in filmmaking, really see these subtle details? Do they feel them, even if they don’t consciously notice?

For context, I make movies purely for fun, out of passion. They’re not for money or validation, just a way to express myself. Sometimes I wish I could ask my 10-year-old self—someone who simply loved movies without knowing the technical side—if these nuanced elements would have mattered to him. Back then, I wasn’t thinking about grain structure, dynamic range, or color grading. I was just immersed in the magic of storytelling.

It reminds me of this video by Cleo Abram about football shots. She discussed how people thought the footage looked incredible—like it was shot in 8K—when, in reality, it was all about the aperture. The shots people loved were done on DSLRs with a shallow depth of field, unlike traditional broadcast cameras with their massive lenses, which prioritize a different aesthetic. When I saw the footage, I instantly recognized it was the aperture creating that ""cinematic"" look, not resolution or 8K. But it was fascinating to see how much people loved the DSLR footage without knowing why.

From this example, it’s clear that people do notice these things—but does it really matter? My assumption is that there’s a bare minimum that evolves over time as generations grow up exposed to better and better clarity. They notice the overall improvement, but they can’t pinpoint what it is—and honestly, they don’t even care. It’s not their job to know these details.

That’s the thing, right? This is also why smartphones have diminished DSLR sales compared to a few decades ago, when standalone cameras were the only option. Obviously, we in the industry know the technical reasons why DSLRs are still better than even flagship phone cameras. But that’s not the point. The point is the bare minimum.

And honestly, as an aspiring filmmaker, I feel great about this. It means I can start with a smartphone as my camera. All I have to do is figure out what the bare minimum is for how my movies need to look. Everything above that is good to have, but not necessarily a deal-maker.

Because at the end of the day, if the vibe of the movie doesn’t resonate with someone, they won’t want to watch it—no matter how good it looks, even in IMAX.

So, to the community here: Do you think the average viewer, or even a younger version of yourself, notices or appreciates subtleties like film emulation, color, or light? Or are these details more of a filmmaker's obsession? And what do you think that ""bare minimum"" standard is today?

Edit-
The reason why I ask this question is because I make movies simply because the process makes me happy. But sometimes, I find myself diving too deep into the rabbit holes of filmmaking details, losing track of the joy and starting to see perfection in those details as the only path to fulfillment—when it’s really not. That’s not who I am. Even though I make movies for myself, I wanted to understand what the audience actually feels about these things because, honestly, I’ve been exhausted thinking about it all on my own. What I really want is the clarity to know when I’ve done enough, to recognize when I’m focusing too much on the details and losing sight of myself in the process.",No-Indication9775,1ha8nph,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,2024-12-09 12:31:23,0,0.27,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha8nph

movies,Was the main character of Kingdom of Heaven (2005) the real son of Godfrey in the movie? I think he might not have been.,"Rewatching the movie and I start to think that Bailan (Orlando Bloom) may not have been Godfrey's (Liam Neeson) real son.

I see it as Godfrey and his circle were driven by meritocracy and finding a right guy to fit into Jerusaleem to keep peace, justice and all.

After seing the smith and hearing about his talents, the hosptalier (David Thewils) asks Godfrey ""remember what we talked about on the road?"".

I think that they either
a) agreed to come back to France and pick the most deserving/fitting man to become Godfrey's heir, either while on the road or even before sailing out from the Holy Land

b) Met his real son and realized they couldn't let such a jerk inherit the.piece of the kingdom of god they were building

c) Both a) and b) + hearing about his engineering talents played the crucial part of choosing him.

It is just a presumption, but it lays into the narrative which both Godfrey and King of Jerusaleem pronounce, ""everyone can be the master of his fate here, no matter who he was in his homeland"".

Baldwin even straightly says ""a father may claim a son"" while pronouncing this whole narrative during his first conversation with Bailan.",RuslanNCAA,1ha1p10,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,2024-12-09 04:30:26,0,0.39,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha1p10

movies,Galaxy Quest censorship theory.,"For those that haven't seen the movie, absolutely worth the watch, it is the best Star Trek movie made. There is a theory out there that talks about the movie censored a line to achieve a PG13 rating. A scene towards the end takes place where Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen have to navigate through a booby trap inside the ship. When Sigourney Weaver sees the trap, she exclaims ""Well, screw that!"" while mouthing the words ""Well, fuck that!"".

I have a second theory. The premise of the movie is the main characters are former actors of a show, much like Star Trek, and have washed up and struggling to get by. One day, Tim Allen is confronted by strange people at a convention. They claim that they are in danger, and Tim Allen is the only one who can help. He mistakes them as just kooky fans and agrees to meet with them thinking it is a gig. He is instead abducted and taken aboard a ship that is based off the ship on the show he was the star of.

It turns out, these aren't fans, they are a species of alien that have based their entire culture around Galaxy Quest, the TV show. Thinking the show was a factual documentary, they received the signals from earth and practically worshiped the show, replicating everything around them to be as accurate as it would have been in the show. To include how they speak.

TL;DR the aliens would have had something on the ship that would censor any curse words. The TV show was on national television in the 80's and would not have any curse words, therefore the aliens would not allow curse words.

Edit: Yes, I know the movie is known to have been more raunchy and likely has an R rated cut, this is more of a fan theory that gives it an in universe explanation.",JDubStep,1h9wx56,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,2024-12-09 00:16:35,0,0.29,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9wx56

Alexander Pushkin's verse novel ""Eugene Onegin"" is well-known in English-speaking countries, partly due to the influence of Tchaikovsky's opera, so I need not set out the plot in any detail. It centres upon the relationship between Yevgeny Onegin, a 19th century Russian landowner, and a teenaged girl named Tatyana Larinа, the daughter of a neighbour. Tatyana falls passionately in love with Onegin and writes him a letter setting out her feelings, but he replies that he cannot return them. Six years later Onegin meets Tatyana again and discovers that she is now married to a prince. A subplot deals with a duel fought between Onegin and Vladimir Lensky, the fiancé of Tatyana's sister Olga.

Ralph Fiennes executes a stunning performance as the aloof, sarcastic disillusioned aristocrat managing a performance which combines a great deal of emotion and extreme surface passivity; Liv Tyler is at her most beautiful in one of her best performances to date as the poignant Tatiana who, as the film unfolds, evolves from passionate idealism into resignation and honour.

As for the story, the movie is very faithful to the Pushkinian attitude. The story is very character-centred, typical to Russian lit. The change in Evgenyi Onegin  is marked indeed. However, the character of Tatyana captivated me. Her faithfulness to herself and to her integrity is amazing.

I wanna add  that I'm a an anti vaxxer or anti mask in any ways. I just got the flu shot and I will wear a mask when I feel sick.

movies,District 9 is great original film.,"A recommendation post of this film suddenly popped on my Instagram feed and I thought I should give it a try. I'm glad that I did.

I knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it has aliens in it (thought that it was an alien invasion movie).

Never in my life did I imagine that a film can make me sympathize with aliens and hate humans. Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.
 
Another thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.

The ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).

The only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.

In short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.

Highly recommend if you haven't already watched it.",CYBOZAX_,1ha0t0x,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,2024-12-09 03:40:06,1572,0.91,1572,0,178,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha0t0x

movies,"Revisiting ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" critiquing it on its own merit, I found it to be a pretty bad film.","This is a sort of Mandella Effect with me, but after rewatching the film only remembering bits and pieces of it when I was younger, I was surprised how small the guardian angel imagination sequence actually is. I thought this was the bulk of the 2nd act originally, but it happens after the film almost reaches its 2-hour runtime. The impact this film has in popular culture is completely dependent on those final 20 minutes.   


If you look up the plot of the film on an website, it will say a variation of ""An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.""

This, however, actually happens at the end of film.  This happens about 1 hour and 50 minutes into it. So, this cannot be the plot of the movie. This could only be the plot of the movie if the first act gave us a brief character development of George in the first act, before Clarence takes him on his excursion, where the film will spend the majority of its runtime. But that is not what happens. The plot of the film is actually more closely aligned with, ""A businessman is at financial and personal dilemma when a wealthy tycoon has sights to take over his business and have completely control over the city.""

The only reason this is listed as a plot is the impact its had in culture rather than the film on its own merit.

Other things:

The film opens with an exchange of George, Violet and Mary and children. Violet and Mary both fawn over George.

The way the film opens, you'd think this would foreshadow Violet and Mary feuding over Goerge as adults, or George having to choose one. Opening with the 3 of them suggests these 3 are going to be the main characters later. But no. Adult Violet isn't really integral to the plot at all. Kid Violet has more lines than adult Violet. The opening scene sets something up that didn't end up happening.  

A 7-year-old Violet's innocent crushes on ""a lot of boys"" is somehow offensively supposed to foreshadow that adult Violet is promiscuous. Women who are promiscuous and exotic dancers don't generally start showing signs of this at 7, and it's completely unrelated to any crushes she'd have at that age. 

They spent too much on the opening scene when the only two plot points it needed was to show that George saved the druggist from a fatal error, and George liked exploring. The druggist ended up being an insignificant character later on, so there's no need to spend so much time here. 

George is mildly surprised that Mary is ""18"" as if they just met, yet doesn't seem to remember Mary from childhood. Young Mary didn't just come into the pharmacy that one time; she knew George quite well. Young Mary whispered in his ear ""I'll love you 'til the day I die,"" so they were well acquainted with each other as children.  In fact, there is never a callback to the child years, as if the opening scene was tacked-on later.

We didn't need the narrator exposition by the angels. We didn't need to the conversation by the angels at the introduction about who George is. Clarence's first appearance could've been when he was drowning, and that would've been fine.  There's enough exposition that Clarence is an angel after Clarence saved him (or George saved Clarence) that we didn't need the opening exposition.   
  
If we already see Clarence in human form, then what was the point of the star sequence anyway, which was also horrible special effects even by 1946 standards? The movie could've opened with Clarence in human form simply could've been conversing with the two other angels off-screen.  There was no point in showing them as stars. This seems like a tacked-on reshoot when they didn't have the actors available. 

Officer Ernie spots George by the bridge and says he's been looking for him all night. George is ecstatic he's back to his normal life and leaves. However, if Ernie had been looking for George all night, then he would've stopped at Martini's Bar prior the bridge, where the patrons would've told Ernie that George left drunk. Additionally, Ernie would've found out about the accident. Regardless of his friendship with Ernie, George still should've or would've been detained for drunk driving and leaving the scene of accident. 

When Freddie opens the gym floor to engage the pool- he's told George and Mary are right over the crack.  Freddie opens this floor, and George and Mary are dancing away from the crack at this point. There're a lot of other dancers closer to the opening than they are, and manage to see and avoid it. But coincidentally, George and Mary are the only two that don't see it and fall in accidentally. The two people that Freddie targeted are the two people that happen to fall in despite them not being any more likely than any one else at the dance. What should have happened was, as soon as the floor opened, everyone started falling in. 

Finally, there's an unresolved arc for the main villain. Potter stealing the money isn't addressed, nor is he shown to be defeated overall. 

In sum, it's a badly made film, and the initial reviews are negative, but it does have an cultural impact but that's mostly because it's shown during every Christmas season through decades of rewatch.
