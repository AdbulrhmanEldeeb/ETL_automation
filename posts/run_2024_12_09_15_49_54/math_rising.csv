math,Point-Set Topology definition vs. intuition,"*This is an edited repost of a question I asked in a thread a little while ago, that went unanswered.*

I have read popularization articles about topology, things about continuous transformations of strings on torii, looping (or not) around the hole, going on to multiple holes and ways of looping, etc and found it exciting.

But when I picked an actual point-set topology textbook, it began with a set-theoretic definition of topological space, open/closed sets and neighborhood than seemed to me unrelatable to those ideas.

Can you help me connect that definition to the intuitive, popular account of topology?",peregrine-l,1haan37,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1haan37/pointset_topology_definition_vs_intuition/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1haan37/pointset_topology_definition_vs_intuition/,2024-12-09 14:15:02,6,0.8,6,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1haan37
math,"Bashar Al-Assad's son Hafez has recently defended his doctoral thesis, can someone explain in laymans terms what exactly he did?","Given recent developments in Syria, I was surprised to learn after a bit of reading that the oldest son of now ex-president Assad is a mathematician. He studies at Lomonosov State University in Moscow.

In a bit of an ironic twist, he recently (like two weeks ago) defended his doctoral dissertation while the Syrian opposition was about to start their offense. I dug up a summary of his thesis although I can't actually find the full text. I'm not a mathematician so as I'm trying to read the translated summary, I'm still not sure what exactly he did.

The title is ""Arithmetic questions of polynomials in algebraic number fieldsÂ "" and this is the summary translated from Russian:

The first topic we will consider is the representation of two rational integers as sums of three rational squares having a common square. Representations of rational integers as polynomials have always been of interest to mathematics. Many well-known theorems and results, such as Legendre's three-square theorem, Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorems, the Hilbert-Gamke problem and many others, are devoted to this issue. In particular, Legendre's three-square theorem completely solves the problem of representing a rational integer as a sum of three rational squares. For representing an integer by a homogeneous polynomial of degree two, the local-global Hasse principle reduces the problem to representability modulo all powers of primes and representability in real numbers. In 1980, D.L. Colliot-Thelen and D. Core generalized Hasse's principle to two homogeneous polynomials under certain conditions. Our study is aimed at generalizing the above-mentioned Legendre theorem, and exploits this generalization.

The second topic we consider is estimates of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. Trigonometric sums have long been of interest because of their deep connection with modular arithmetic in the residue ring modulo q. In particular, they arise in the Hardy-Littlewood-Ramanujan circle method in the form of I.M. Vinogradov's trigonometric sums for estimating the number of solutions of Diophantine equations. In particular, the solvability of a given equation is considered, first, in the real numbers, and second, modulo any rational integer q. The latter part is usually deeper and more difficult, and rational trigonometric sums play an essential role in it; they are effectively responsible for the solvability modulo q. In 1940, Hua Lo-keng found a nontrivial estimate for trigonometric sums in the field of rational numbers. Subsequent work by Chen Junrun and V. I. Nechaev improved the estimate. In 1984, Qi Mingao and Ding Ping found a constant in Hua Luo-ken's estimate. In 1949, Hua Luo-ken generalized his estimate to the case of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. The first part of our study on this topic is aimed at strengthening this estimate. The second part of our study on this topic is aimed at generalizing Hua Luo-ken's tree method for constructing solutions of polynomial congruences modulo a rational prime, used in solving the convergence problem of a singular series in the Prouet-Terry-Ascot problem, to the case of algebraic number fields.

The third topic we consider is the representations of Dirichlet characters. Dirichlet characters, first introduced by P. L. Dirichlet in 1837, play a central role in multiplicative number theory. They were originally used by him to prove a theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.Many important questions of the analytical number theory were developed on the basis of Dirichlet characters and the theory of Dirichlet L-functions. In the modern theory of L-functions, estimates of character sums are of great importance. A.G. Postnikov's formula, proved by him in 1955, expresses Dirichlet characters modulo a power of an odd prime number through exponentials of polynomials with rational coefficients. Thus, the problem of estimating the sums of such Dirichlet characters is reduced to I.M. Vinogradov's method of trigonometric sums. Our study on this topic is connected with the generalization of A.G. Postnikov's formula to the case of a Dirichlet character modulo a power of 2 and the application of both the original and the generalized formula of A.G. Postnikov to estimate the sums of characters in algebraic number fields.

math,Research in Galois and Field Theory,"Hi, I wanted to ask a question about active research done in algebra, more specifically in field theory.

In the math department where I study, it seems that the main research in algebra involves finding the asynptotics of the probability of a set of random polynomials  These questions are much different than the algebra courses I took (like Galois Theory and commutatice algebra)- they are more about asymptotics, bounding terms and overall much more calculation-heavy.

I was recently given a few papers to read, which also had a lot of calculations, and the results where about counting the number of polynomials that satisfy a certain condition. It didn't really interest me, and the whole thing makes me a bit hopeless about doing research in this subject- the courses I took where so beautiful, but now everything looks like it's just calculating things.

I wanted to ask if there are different areas of research in Algebra/Field Theory (I'm not talking about Group Theory in this post), which is less about calculating things and more ""beautiful"" (I know it's subjective but I don't know how else to put it), like things done in class.

Thank you all in advance and sorry for the long post.

Tldr; searching for areas in Galois/Field Theory that aren't involved with asymptotics and counting which still have active research.
