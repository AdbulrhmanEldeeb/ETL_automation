Physics,Physicists vs Mathematician doing Maths,"I am a 1st year Theoretical Physics but I am slowly realising I am bad at Physics and okay at Maths. Then, I wondered whether Mathematical Physics is more ideal for me.

Anyway, my question is: how exactly does it differ between a physicists and a mathematician doing maths?

Obviously we have different research topics but other than that, let's assume a physicist and a mathematician is approaching the same problem. What would the difference be? The obvious one I have in mind is how rigorous we are (my maths module lecturer from the physics department literally doesn't care about the modulus for , say, integral 1/x dx)",Richie_Feynman,1h93m2o,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h93m2o/physicists_vs_mathematician_doing_maths/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h93m2o/physicists_vs_mathematician_doing_maths/,2024-12-07 22:10:17,58,0.81,58,0,55,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h93m2o
Physics,"How to optimize a Cloud Chamber, based on my experience","Hey guys! You all probably know what a cloud chamber is (if not, it's basically the simplest particle detector you can build at home, great for visualization and teaching), but If you ever tried to build one, you probably noticed just how different the instructions on Youtube and the internet might be. I recently worked on a project for school where I tried to improve the cloud chamber as much as possible, and wanted to share what worked for me and didn't. Note: though I tried to justify my results scientifically in the study, it still might be wrong and my suggestions might go against theory, in which case please correct me. Also, some of these tips might be already available online, and I don't claim to have invented them. Anyhow, here's a list of suggestions:

\- For starters, check out the two following videos: 1) [https://youtu.be/xky3f1aSkB8?si=VGAR5G1y6HTRyX3f](https://youtu.be/xky3f1aSkB8?si=VGAR5G1y6HTRyX3f) and 2) [https://youtu.be/eh3bxXHqF2U?si=zh\_Ju3Gc150XQVr8](https://youtu.be/eh3bxXHqF2U?si=zh_Ju3Gc150XQVr8) . I found these resources extremely helpful as the initial guide. The CERN one uses a metal sheet with grooves, however these are hard to find or do by yourself. So, follow ElectroBOOM's suggestion to make a silicon groove, it generally helps with the sealing and fixes the chamber container in place.

\- Use glass or plastic for the chamber container. Some people suggested using plexiglass, which I ended up using, and do not recommend you do. Since we cool the chamber, the low temperature ended up cracking the container for me, leading to leaks at the bottom. Generally it's easier to get a ready container (from cooking sets or smth) rather than building you own, cause mine was imperfect and had gaps, which I had to glue together for some time.

\- For the alcohol absorbent, use felt, not sponge. Felt can collect more alcohol and generally spreads it better than sponge. Also, the felt should cover the entire area of the top layer of the container, as it evenly spreads the alcohol. The felt layer should be quite thick (around 3-4 cm), as it allows to pour a sufficient amount of alcohol.

\- Concerning the alcohol itself. It's best to use isopropanol, but for personal use different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, etc) are quite sufficient. I personally used ethanol because isoprop isn't sold in my region. Try to hit &gt;90% purity - generally the higher you go the better the tracks. The cloud chamber has a specific limit of alcohol quantity where it actually operates, i.e if you poor too little or too much, it won't display tracks. If you have the time, try to play around with the volume of the vapor to see where this region lies for you - you will also see a change in the quality of the tracks, as some volumes produce a high number of tracks, others display them for longer. But if you're low on alcohol or just want to see the chamber work, the rule of the thumb is to cover the entire area of the felt and pour out the excess.

Also, the waiting time until the chamber actually starts displaying particles varies based on the amount of alcohol you add. So, for smaller volumes it took me about 10 minutes to start up, and 20 for higher volumes.

\- For the metal sheet (which you place on top of your cold layer, where you actually see the tracks), try to find a black one. Aluminum, etc won't display as good and reflects light.

\- The temperature gradient between the top and bottom layer plays a big role. It's best to get the bottom layer as cold as you can by using dry ice. Flaked ice worked best for me, as it covered the whole metal sheet area. Pellets work good as well. But if you plan to make more of a ""perpetual"" cloud chamber, go with Peltier coolers submerged in frozen salted water. This, however, will deteriorate the quality of your tracks, so judge based on your use. You can place hot water on your top layer, which will also improve your quality. I tried making a chain of resistors to heat the felt directly, but failed to do so. Maybe you'll be able to make it, but please be careful and look into it further because I'm not sure if it might actually ignite the alcohol :)

\- If you want to produce more tracks rather than relying on cosmic rays, order smoke detectors with Americium-241 (I got them off of Aliexpress. Bought 10, only 3 produced decent results). Some recommend thorinated welding rods, but I went with the detectors. Remember radiation safety. Also, place the detector inside rather than trying to produce tracks from outside the container, plastic blocks off the particles.

Hope this helps! Have fun, I loved my experience with the chamber.

Edit: If you're concerned about the price of the chamber, the whole thing cost me around 30-40 usd, 20 of which went to the dry ice order.

Physics,Barry Barish's Take on Imposter Syndrome,"We were lucky enough to have Barry Barish speak at an informal round table event at Stony Brook University, and someone asked how to deal with imposter syndrome, feeling like every other student/physicist could do everything so much better than you, like you could never do anything significant next to them. 

Barish explained that he felt particularly inadequate when he went to sign off on his Nobel Prize. 

""Getting the Nobel Prize is this whole week long process, and I'd been doing well so far. The last day, they took us to get the money, take pictures, do all the important things. They came up to me with this nondescript, small book, and opened up this page that was blank except for '2017' at the top. 'Sign here,'  they said. I signed my name, and flipped through the book. I saw Einstein, Feynman, all these fantastic physicists who changed the world... how could I be in this book? But I had already written in pen, so I couldn't erase my name.""

I hope this brings you guys as much comfort as it did me, that even the most accomplished physicists feel this way at one point or another.",srw_11,1h8j8o2,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h8j8o2/barry_barishs_take_on_imposter_syndrome/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h8j8o2/barry_barishs_take_on_imposter_syndrome/,2024-12-07 03:11:54,121,0.92,121,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8j8o2
