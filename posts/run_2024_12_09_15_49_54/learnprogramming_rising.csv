After i done the whole Projects with Wxwidgets, i have lots and lots of compatibility issues, so scrapped it, and QT designer was a bit better but the way i got it is that a m8 sent me a file (not the setup file, the preextracted one), which was obvusily missing things, and wasnt working on my device correctly, and he said works on my machine, cuz duh u set it up with an installer

When n is 2, the functions stop. If n&gt;= 2, the code execute n* every n-1 until a when n is &lt;2.

The code is as follows:

      constant_1 = ((b*b*b)*-1) / (27*(a**3)) + ((b*c) / (6*a*a)) - d/(2*a)
      constant_2 = (c/(3*a) - b**2 / (9*a*a))**3
      result_1 =  ((constant_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) + ((constant_1 - cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2)))** (1/3) - b/(3*a)
      result_2 = (-0.5 + (cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3))/2) * ((constant_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) + (-0.5 - cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3)/2) * ((constant_1 - cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) - b/(3*a)
      result_3 = (-0.5 - (cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3))/2) * ((constant_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) + (-0.5 + cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3)/2) * ((constant_1 - cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) - b/(3*a)

For reference, this code is using the cubic formula to calculate roots of a cubic.  
Now, I want to direct your attention to the part where I raise the part of the results to the third power (the ""(constant\_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant\_2 + constant\_1 \*\* 2))\*\*(1/3)""  part). This should be equal to the cube root of the number, however I have found this part of the code is creating problems for some reason.

learnprogramming,CS50 Final Project Ideas,"For anyone who has done CS50, I'm trying to think of some projects. I've thought of a few I want to attempt but I'm not sure there will be enough knowledge to implement them since I'm only on week 5 of the class.

First is either a text based of ASCII based RPG. I'd assume a text based one wouldn't be too hard. I could have a few classes and stats, but I don't know how I'd code the enemies and make it challenging enough to be able to fail. This however would probably be a project that would help me gain a ton of experience. I'm not sure if I'd be able to do this though with the level of experience gained in CS50. It may be worth doing in a language other than C.

The second idea, which is also probably complex is a minecraft skin maker. Basically a simple pixel based editor. A lot of people say to learn it, to solve a problem. However I don't have anything I can think of that needs solving. I am extremely interested in CS, but I'm not experienced enough in programming to recognize things I do on the daily.

The only other thing I could think of, that may be hard at this point in time, is to find a way to program a calendar that would be able to take the appointments and things my wife have to do from IOS and Android and consolidate it into one calendar.
