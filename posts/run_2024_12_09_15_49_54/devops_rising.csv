devops,"'Leveling Up' a developer, how to shift mindset to security? Just keep trying?","There's dev from an acquisition years ago who wears the title 'DevOps Engineer'.  So our director wanted me to move some of my workload to him.

Baby steps, I let him handle migrating their teams to GitHub.  When he moved their package repository they had some difficulty setting it up, developers couldn't access it.

He jumped to a conclusion (that it was permissions issue) and asked me.... wait for it.... you'll never guess...  ""could you create a PAT with repo admin rights that we can share with the devs so they can access the packages"".

I explained why it wasn't going to happen and asked him to walk the other devs through the step by step instructions I provided and tested with the help of 2 other devs with normal access.  He assured me that it's not working and they setup exactly like I said..  I'm sure you've heard this story before.

A few days later it's all working, I had to ask because I never got the whole story on who dropped the ball and still have no clue what caused the issue.

I'm all for leveling up people, however this person doesn't seem ready.  Primarily the failure to own the situation and communicate what happened leaves me questioning his overall maturity.

devops,Can Backstage just deploy one-offs without creating a repository?,"I'm on day 2 right now of testing Backstage, enjoying it so far, but all of the examples and demos I can find are focused around templating boilerplate to create a new repository.  I need, for the purposes of demonstrating the concept of self-service to get momentum going, just the most basic example of like ""Standard S3 Bucket,"" so that when I click Create in Backstage, it just kicks off a terraform apply in the CI/CD, and skips the whole publishing to repo bit.  For the purposes of this demo, I don't even care about the TF state, this can just discard it.

devops,Company blocks all downloads; how the fuck am I supposed to do my job?,"I recently started working at a big law firm as part of a four-person DevOps team, and I'm honestly losing my mind. Everything is locked down. I mean, I literally can't download anything. Want zsh? Nope. WSL for a Linux-y environment? Not happening. Need Python scripts or any files from any github repos? Also nope. Need kubens, or any other kubectl plugins? No chance. Want to be an administrator on your own computer? Not gonna happen. ChatGPT to speed up basic scripting tasks? Hah, forget it. Even Chrome extensions are off-limits.

This is all because of the strict security guidelines implemented by the security and networking team. And every single time I want to do something like use some github repo to automate my work I need to open a request to the security team who are physically in a different building and it takes *days* for them to respond. And the answer is usually no!

The pay is great, but I'm stuck doing a bunch of manual work that I know I could finish in a fraction of the time if I had the right tools. Is this normal at big companies—or am I just in some kind of corporate IT nightmare?

I’m genuinely curious about what the DevOps experience in this regard has been like for other folks here.

devops,"Feedback on my AWS/DevOps design: separate infra &amp; app repos, shared database schema, multi-env migrations","Hey everyone, I’m working solo on a SaaS product (currently around $5,000 MRR) that for the purpose of privacy, call **CloudyFox,** and I’m trying to set up a solid foundation before it grows larger. I currently have just made a **cloudyfox-infra** repo for all my infrastructure code (using CDK on AWS), and I have a repo **cloudyfox-tg** (a Telegram bot) and will have **cloudyfox-webapp** (a future web application). Both services will share the same underlying database (Postgres on AWS RDS) because they will share the same users (one subscription/login for both), and I’m thinking of putting all schema migrations in **cloudyfox-infra** so there’s a single source of truth for DB changes. Does that make sense or would it be better to also have a dedicated repo just for schema migrations?

I’m also planning to keep my dev environment totally ephemeral. If I break something in dev, I can destroy and redeploy the stack, re-run all migrations from scratch, and get a clean slate. Have people found this works well in practice or does it become frustrating over time? How often do you end up needing rollbacks?

For now, I’m a solo dev, but I’m trying to set things up in a way that won’t bite me later. The idea is:

* **cloudyfox-infra**: Contains all infrastructure code and DB migrations.
* **cloudyfox-tg** &amp; **cloudyfox-webapp**: Application logic only, no schema changes. They depend on the schema defined in **cloudyfox-infra**.
* **online dev/prod environments**: Run CI/CD, deploy infra, run migrations, deploy apps, test everything out online using cloud infra but away from users. If I need a new column for affiliate marketing in the Telegram bot, I’ll add a migration to **cloudyfox-infra**, test in dev, and once it’s stable, merge to main to run in prod. Is this an established pattern, or am I mixing responsibilities that might cause confusion later?

When it’s time to go to prod, the merge triggers migrations in the prod DB and then rolls out app code updates. I’m wondering: is this too risky? How do I ensure the right migration is pulled from dev to prod?

Any thoughts or experiences you can share would be super helpful! Has anyone tried a similar approach with a single DB serving multiple microservices (or just multiple apps) and putting all the migrations in the infra repo? Would a dedicated “cloudyfox-schema” repo be clearer in the long run? Are there any well-known pitfalls I should know about?

2. **Commit and push changes** to GitLab (CI/CD pipeline is triggered, runs tests, linting, etc., but no deployment yet).
3. **Create a Merge Request (MR)** to merge `add-button-feature` into the `test` branch.
4. **Assign MR to a code reviewer**.
5. **Code reviewer reviews and approves the MR**.
6. **Code reviewer merges MR** into `test` branch.
7. **CI/CD pipeline runs again** on the `test` branch, including deployment steps.
8. **Deployment to test server** happens after the merge, based on the pipeline configuration.

devops,Cutting redundant costs,"As I am sure many others here experience, we have a lot of redundant costs in our AWS accounts. We are a mid-sized company with a lot of different account owners, departments etc. who govern their internal workloads under their department budget. We do analyses every month to identify high-costs and add automation to prevent needless cost-overruns (i.e. add tag to EC2, otherwise we automate ec2 stopping during weekends). We have recently thought about automatically prompting users directly when our automation suspects that a machine / workload or any other expensive ""operation"" could be stopped / terminated etc. but it's dangerous to automatically do it - i.e. to terminate that process if the user confirms it can be done (perhaps we could also add some more options - like stopping it this week etc.).

To make the user experience a bit better, we thought to use chatGPT to prompt the user, so it can answer some questions to help the user understand the context... i.e. what account, region, other information that will make it more likely the user will understand the context (dropping a large json on the user probably won't work).

devops,devbox (nix) vs. prefix.dev pixi,"Hi everybody,

I wonder if anybody of you have looked at both devbox and pixi and formed an opinion about them. 

I've come across devbox first and really liked the idea of how everything worked. The Nix package repository has most of what one could wish for. One of the issues I've had though was that it turned out that the portability of devbox/nix itself was not always as straight forward, especially when I don't have root on a system.

Just recently, I've found Pixi by prefix.dev. In some essential ways, it works similarly to devbox. There is also a project file that contains all the dependencies and which can be ran with an ephemeral environment. The main difference is that it uses conda-channels to source the software. Obviously, nix supplies many more packages, but I've found that usually, the essentials are also available on conda. Me, not primarly being a devops person, but primarily a python developer, also  appreciate the closer connection to relevant package repositories. It's also able to use uv to resolve PyPi dependencies and define tasks in the project file to run project related scripts. Just like devbox, it can also install tools as global. Devbox however exceeds Pixi in shell customization and service orchestration.

The most important differentiator to me though is that pixi actually installs in user space and neatly isolates installs from the rest of the system while devbox/nix claims root left and right and is actually quite a chore to debug. This is very much a skill issue, but I share my projects and can't rely on coworkers to debug the dev environment. Pixi is also simply uninstalled by removing two dirs. 

Anyways, I'm very interested in what others think!",Kornfried,1h9uezi,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h9uezi/devbox_nix_vs_prefixdev_pixi/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h9uezi/devbox_nix_vs_prefixdev_pixi/,2024-12-08 22:17:39,2,0.75,2,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9uezi
