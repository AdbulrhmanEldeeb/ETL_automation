      constant_2 = (c/(3*a) - b**2 / (9*a*a))**3
      result_1 =  ((constant_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) + ((constant_1 - cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2)))** (1/3) - b/(3*a)

learnprogramming,Something isn't working. I need advice.,"I'm a first-year undergrad studying Business. For the past year, I have been working full-stack, using React and React Native as the frontends. I loved it. I started with React, but soon realized that I should be more focused on mobile development to align myself with my goals, so I naturally went to React Native. 

I used RN for 7-8 months, and while I enjoyed coding with RN, I kept hitting limitations. Complex animations are near-impossible with RN, and theres just so many small little features, such as 'blur', that are just one line of code when programming natively for Android or iOS, but give so much headache in RN. So, I started learning Swift and SwiftUI, and have been using it exclusively for the last 2 months.

Unlike when I started with React and RN, I decided to really get myself to understand the ins and outs of Swift and follow a more established path to learning it. I read many comprehensive books and followed many tutorials on it, and I, now, have a very solid foundation, and can comfortably navigate myself through it. But I've come to realize: I hate Swift. I hate Apple.

I've always used Windows. I've always viewed MacOS negatively. Though, to program natively for iOS, you need to use a MacOS. Now, over the past 2 months, I've gotten used to using a mac, but I simply just prefer windows for everything. If I'm programming, I'll have my windows and my mac open, and I would do any research on my windows, and code on mac. If I'm designing a UI, I would do everything on my windows, but use my mac to occasionally paste svg icons from SF Symbols (which aren't available to windows, thanks Apple). I have an Iphone, I have an Apple watch, I have airpods, but I just hate macs.

But the worst part is XCode. I genuinely hate XCode with a passion. It's a good IDE, don't get me wrong, but I despise Apple's dedication to giving its developers the least amount of customization possible. With VSCode, you are able to download any extension, and customize it in basically any way you can imagine. I love the open-source community.

Alright, lets move onto Swift and SwiftUI. It feels... weird? I've had experience with JavaScript, Python, and even a little bit of C#, but Swift just feels really weird to me. It has a lot of features right out of the box, such as app storage and environmental variables, whereas with RN, I had to manually spend hours configuring Redux Toolkit and storage persistence. But, I'm realizing now that I much enjoyed writing all that boilerplate code for the external libraries to make applications using RN. I miss the feeling of taking so many open-source contributions, reading documentation on them, and then implementing them into my project. Some had really good docs, which felt amazing to see, some were more frustrating with hard-to-follow docs. I miss the feeling of having this variety. Every NPM package was a different package and you knew what each one did. In Swift, ofcourse there are packages, ofcourse there is the Swift package manager, but working with Swift just feels like you're working with one project, and everything is just supplied to you, barely any variant.

And all of this just destroys my motivation to code every time I sit down. There were, unavoidably, headaches and hardships with React and React Native, but atleast I enjoyed it. Now I just feel like I'm being forced to work with software I hate and at the same time supporting a company I hate. But I need to use Swift. I need to develop for iOS, and there is nothing that comes near to the power of Swift for iOS development.

TDLR; I hate Swift. I hate Xcode. I hate Apple. I hate Macs. How can I make myself more motivated to work with Swift.",RareDestroyer8,1ha38pa,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ha38pa/something_isnt_working_i_need_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ha38pa/something_isnt_working_i_need_advice/,2024-12-09 06:03:38,1,0.67,1,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ha38pa

learnprogramming,How to program renderer for a volumetric display?,"I'm working on a volumetric display using a 64x64 LED panel rotating at 900rpm to create a persistence of vision effect. I need help writing the software to render images for it as I'm unsure how to go about it.

My current plan is to render a 3d model like an obj file, and take individuals slices/planes at 6 degrees intervals as a plane rotates through it. These could then be stitched together with ffmpeg into a 900fps video and played on the rotating display. 60 frames per rotation, 15 rotations per second, 246k pixels.

The display should support this refresh rate as it updates the pixels 2 rows at a time at 1920hz.

My question is what's the best way to go about this, what should I program it in and how? I'm looking into python and trimesh at the moment as that has a voxelise feature which could help, and a slice feature built in. Is there already existing software that could do this for me?

I also need a way to test these videos/emulate the display, and at the moment I'm thinking I'd just put them on a spinning surface in blender and render that, but I'm open to better suggestions.",rabbitrampage198,1h9l0tm,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l0tm/how_to_program_renderer_for_a_volumetric_display/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l0tm/how_to_program_renderer_for_a_volumetric_display/,2024-12-08 15:19:58,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9l0tm
learnprogramming,CS50 Final Project Ideas,"For anyone who has done CS50, I'm trying to think of some projects. I've thought of a few I want to attempt but I'm not sure there will be enough knowledge to implement them since I'm only on week 5 of the class.

First is either a text based of ASCII based RPG. I'd assume a text based one wouldn't be too hard. I could have a few classes and stats, but I don't know how I'd code the enemies and make it challenging enough to be able to fail. This however would probably be a project that would help me gain a ton of experience. I'm not sure if I'd be able to do this though with the level of experience gained in CS50. It may be worth doing in a language other than C.

The second idea, which is also probably complex is a minecraft skin maker. Basically a simple pixel based editor. A lot of people say to learn it, to solve a problem. However I don't have anything I can think of that needs solving. I am extremely interested in CS, but I'm not experienced enough in programming to recognize things I do on the daily.

The only other thing I could think of, that may be hard at this point in time, is to find a way to program a calendar that would be able to take the appointments and things my wife have to do from IOS and Android and consolidate it into one calendar. 

Any suggestions or ideas?

learnprogramming,Web Programming project help,"Is this a good place to ask for help with web programming? I am in desperate need of assistance. I have a project due where I need to create a Blackjack game with the following functionality:



a) ""Splitting"" capability: What is splitting? If you hold two cards with the same value, like two eights or two sixes, you can split them into separate hands and play each hand individually. For this project, once the two cards are split, they should be treated as two separate hands, each with its own ""hit,"" ""stay,"" and ""split"" (if the two cards are the same) buttons. To achieve this, I need to add a button that appears only when the player holds two identical cards, and otherwise stays hidden. Once the button is clicked, the two cards should be split into two hands.



b) ""Reset"" capability: Currently, the game can only be reset by refreshing the page. I need to create a button that resets the game environment and starts a new game by clearing the scores and cards, without refreshing the page.



c) Disable ""hit"" button: When the player's total exceeds 21, the ""hit"" button should be disabled and grayed out to prevent further action, until the game is reset or a new game begins.



I’ve managed to get b) and c) working, but no matter what I try, I haven’t been able to get splitting to work. Additionally, I need to add a backlog feature that tracks matches, pauses, and records the player's progress, so users can return to their previous place in the game.

learnprogramming,Seeking Advice for Implementation,"

Hi r/learnprogramming ! 👋

I'm a Salesforce developer with a bit of experience in web development and Java from about 10 years ago. A couple of friends need a tool to help them with the logistics of serving cocktails for events which should include features for adding, editing, and deleting cocktails from a database and calculating ingredient quantities based on the number of participants.

# Project Overview:

* **Functionality**:
   * Manage a database of cocktails (name, ingredients, quantity).
   * Calculate ingredient quantities based on selected cocktails and number of participants.
   * Nice-to-have in the feature: being able to export a file with the list of ingredient, calculate the number of glasses required ect

# My Goals:

1. **Ease of Use**: The tool needs to be easy to use for someone who isn’t a developer. Ideally, it should work on someone’s personal computer without requiring any special setup.
2. **Portability**: I want to ensure that anyone can use this tool without needing to install additional software or perform complex configurations.
3. **Long-Term Maintainability**: Considering my last serious web project was nearly a decade ago, I’m seeking advice on modern best practices to ensure the project remains maintainable and can be easily improved or expanded in the future.

# Questions:

1. **Which Tech Stacks would you recommand me to base my project on?** I've thinking of maybe an local website using HTML/JS but I dont know how to easily handle the database 
2. **How can I make this project easily portable and usable on someone else's computer?** What setup steps would be needed from an end-user perspective?
3. **What are the best practices for managing a simple local database in this context?** Are there any tools or framework that I can use?

Additional Information:

1. As a Salesforce dev, I am comfortable with object programming logic (the Salesforce language is close to Java), I do JS/HTML5/CSS and SOQL

learnprogramming,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6vx,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:54,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9l6vx
