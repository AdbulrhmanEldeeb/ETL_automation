Use  this thread to discuss whatever you've been playing lately (old or new,  AAA or indie).  Don't just list the names of games as your entire post,  make sure to elaborate with your thoughts on the games.

&gt;Make  sure to use spoiler tags if you're posting anything about a game's plot  that might significantly hurt the experience of others that haven't  played the game yet (no matter how old or new the game is).

pcgaming,Did I just get older or have things changed?,"I'm sure my experience mirrors others. When I was a kid, I trusted the Ubisoft logo. Prince of Persia, Hawx 2, Blazing Angels, and Just Dance, to name a couple of the ones i played on the family Wii. Granted, i was a child and not the best judge of games, but I had fun with all of those and that's what games are for. Nowadays that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Skull and Bones, which i thankfully avoided buying altogether when reviews were less than stellar. Shame the tailers made it seem like exactly my type of game, i LOVED Sea of Thieves. 

Most of the recent Assassin's Creed games selling permanent double money and experience points (imo should not have even been offered, if the feedback you get from testers is that progression is too slow, it's scummy to sell a solution). Did the fact that they sell those boosters spoil my enjoyment of Oddysey/Valhalla? Mostly no, but I was far more conscious of the fact I COULD be progressing faster like my friend who bought them. We would play the game on a voice call, share loot locations and strats, it became frustrating hearing the things I couldn't access because of my low level. 

Games like Call of duty seem to be slowing the progression of the battle passes to get you to play their game and ONLY their game if you want to reach the top tier within the time limit. Could be just placebo, unsure how true this is.

As I said above, I'm not alone in feeling this way. A few of my friends share my sentiment. It's not only Ubisoft that does this, they're just a prime example. Create a problem and sell a solution is a great business move, but shitty for consumers.",dadodavedude,1h9z4hz,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,2024-12-09 02:09:27,0,0.21,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9z4hz

pcgaming,how are unoptimized/buggy games able to ship out that way?,"Everyone knows PC game optimization hasnt ever been the best but i gotta ask, if anyone were to know, is it really that hard to test a game for shit like that? I do understand game development isnt a walk in the park like its made out to be sometimes by people who are mad, but do these developers have like super computers or something? Maybe their dev kits for consoles(if those are still a thing) just make the game work better or sum. Even then though, couldnt they just test the game on just consumer products? It just seems like itd be such a huge shock to devs to release a game that they (hopefully) have rigorously tested for it to be reviewed as unoptimized and buggy.

All this is just genuine curiosity btw. Not mad or frustrated with any specific games causing me to wonder about this topic.",toxictuxX0,1h9yk53,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9yk53/how_are_unoptimizedbuggy_games_able_to_ship_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9yk53/how_are_unoptimizedbuggy_games_able_to_ship_out/,2024-12-09 01:39:47,0,0.19,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9yk53
