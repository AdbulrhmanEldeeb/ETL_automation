Python,YTSage: A Modern YouTube Downloader with a Stunning PyQt6 Interface!,"**What My Project Does:**  
**[YTSage](https://github.com/oop7/YTSage)** is a modern YouTube downloader designed for simplicity and functionality. With a sleek PyQt6 interface, it allows users to:  
- üé• Download videos in various qualities with automatic audio merging.  
- üéµ Extract audio in multiple formats.  
- üìù Fetch both manual and auto-generated subtitles.  
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è View detailed video metadata (e.g., views, upload date, duration).  
- üñºÔ∏è Preview video thumbnails before downloading.  

---

**Target Audience:**  
YTSage is ideal for:  
- Casual users who want an easy-to-use video and audio downloader.  
- Developers looking for a robust yt-dlp-based tool with a clean GUI.  
- Educators and content creators who need subtitles or metadata for their projects.  

---

**Comparison with Existing Alternatives:**  
- **vs yt-dlp**: While yt-dlp is powerful, it operates through the command line. YTSage simplifies the process with an intuitive graphical interface.  
- **vs other GUI downloaders**: Many alternatives lack modern design or features like subtitle support and metadata display. YTSage bridges this gap with its PyQt6-powered interface and advanced functionality.  

---

**Getting Started:**  
Download the pre-built executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/oop7/YTSage/releases) page ‚Äì no installation required! For developers, source code and build instructions are available in the repository.

Python,"Web Scraping Social Media Profiles [ X, Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube ]","Hi everyone!

I‚Äôve created a script for scraping public social media accounts for work purposes. I‚Äôve wrapped it up, formatted it, and created a repository for anyone who wants to use it.

# What My Project Does
The main focus of this project is to scrape data from profiles and their posts. For example:
- In my job, I‚Äôve automated it to run daily for our social media profiles, storing the data for later analysis.
- A firend of mine wanted to download all the thumbnails of a youtube channel.

# How it works
The script uses Playwright to intercept requests and clean up the data. It also includes a second part that converts images to Base64 encoding, which is useful when image URLs expire or cannot be displayed directly in an `HTML img tag`. For YouTube, it uses the API v3, as it's straightforward to obtain an API key.

I believe the script is easy to use, and you can quickly adapt it to suit your needs. Be sure to check out the README for more details!
 
# Target Audience
This tool is for anyone who needs to scrape social media data. The code is simple enough to copy, modify, and integrate into your project.

# Comparison
I haven‚Äôt extensively researched if there are better solutions out there. However, you can consider using libraries like Instaloader or Twitter-scraper for similar functionality.

# Finally
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you have.

I've tried tesseract but it is not performing well. It extracts the data very messily, incompletely, and it comes out disorganized and disconnected.

Python,Python Online IDE,"# 1. What My Project Does

This project is a sample application that integrates a language model to generate code and provides an interface for users to execute it.

# 2. Target Audience

It is built for Python enthusiasts. The purpose of integrating AI is to allow students to query the AI and practice coding at the same time. It is not meant for production use.

It can be helpful for teachers and tutors as well.

# 3. Comparison

It differs in two key ways. First, it automatically downloads the required modules based on the generated code and allows users to upload files. While it is a toy project, Google Colab already provides a 100000 times better alternative for this type of IDE. However, this project can be adapted for other programming languages, as the code execution occurs on the local machine
