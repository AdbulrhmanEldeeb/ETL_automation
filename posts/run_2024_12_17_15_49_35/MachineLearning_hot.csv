MachineLearning,[R] Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings: Lucene Is All You Need,"Recent research challenges the need for dedicated vector databases in AI-powered search. Researchers from the University of Waterloo and Roma Tre University propose using the widely-used Lucene search library with OpenAI embeddings as an alternative. This approach reduces resource demands and may offer a more accessible solution, encouraging organizations to reconsider specialized vector storage.

MachineLearning,[R] SVGFusion: Scalable Text-to-SVG Generation via Vector Space Diffusion,"**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10437](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10437)

**Abstract:** 

&gt;The generation of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) assets from textual data remains a significant challenge, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality vector datasets and the limitations in scalable vector representations required for modeling intricate graphic distributions. This work introduces SVGFusion, a Text-to-SVG model capable of scaling to real-world SVG data without reliance on a text-based discrete language model or prolonged SDS optimization. The essence of SVGFusion is to learn a continuous latent space for vector graphics with a popular Text-to-Image framework. Specifically, SVGFusion consists of two modules: a Vector-Pixel Fusion Variational Autoencoder (VP-VAE) and a Vector Space Diffusion Transformer (VS-DiT). VP-VAE takes both the SVGs and corresponding rasterizations as inputs and learns a continuous latent space, whereas VS-DiT learns to generate a latent code within this space based on the text prompt. Based on VP-VAE, a novel rendering sequence modeling strategy is proposed to enable the latent space to embed the knowledge of construction logics in SVGs. This empowers the model to achieve human-like design capabilities in vector graphics, while systematically preventing occlusion in complex graphic compositions. Moreover, our SVGFusion's ability can be continuously improved by leveraging the scalability of the VS-DiT by adding more VS-DiT blocks. A large-scale SVG dataset is collected to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Extensive experimentation has confirmed the superiority of our SVGFusion over existing SVG generation methods, achieving enhanced quality and generalizability, thereby establishing a novel framework for SVG content creation. Code, model, and data will be released at: {[this https URL](https://ximinng.github.io/SVGFusionProject/)}

MachineLearning,[P] Vision Parse: Parse PDF documents into Markdown formatted content using Vision LLMs,"Hey Redditors,

I'm excited to share Vision Parse - [https://github.com/iamarunbrahma/vision-parse](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma/vision-parse), an open-source Python library that uses Vision Language Models to convert PDF documents into perfectly formatted markdown content automatically.

* Converts each page in a PDF document into high-resolution images
* Detects texts, tables, links, and images from the high-resolution image using Vision LLMs and parses them in markdown format
* Handles multi-page PDF documents effortlessly
* And it's easy to get started with this library (just `pip install vision-parse`, and then a few lines of code to convert a document into markdown formatted content).

**Why I built this?**

* Traditional PDF to markdown conversion tools often struggle with complex layouts, semi-structured and unstructured tables and formatting. Hence, relying on Vision LLMs to extract content in markdown from images (Here, I am converting each PDF page into an image).
* Document structure would get distorted with traditional OCR's and PDF to markdown conversion tools. Hence, using Generative AI models would help us in getting better understanding of the structure and preserve it.

You can find documentation to get started with this library here: [https://github.com/iamarunbrahma/vision-parse/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma/vision-parse/blob/main/README.md)

MachineLearning,"  ""[Discussion]"" ""[D]"" Introducing TLR: Training AI Simultaneously Across Three Environments with Shared Learning","**TL;DR**: I developed **TLR (Triple Layer Training)**, a reinforcement learning framework that trains a single agent across **three environments simultaneously** while sharing experiences to enhance learning. It’s producing positive rewards where I’ve never seen them before—like Lunar Lander! Feedback and thoughts welcome.

Hi everyone! 👋

I wanted to share something I’ve been working on: **Triple Layer Training (TLR)**—a novel reinforcement learning framework that allows an AI agent to **train across three environments simultaneously**.

# What is TLR?

* TLR trains a single agent in **three diverse environments** at once:
   * **Cart Pole**: Simple balancing task.
   * **Lunar Lander**: Precision landing with physics-based control.
   * **Space Invader**: Strategic reflexes in a dynamic game.
* The agent uses **shared replay buffers** to pool experiences across these environments, allowing it to **learn from one environment and apply insights to another**.
* TLR integrates **advanced techniques** like:
   * **DQN Variants**: Standard DQN, Double DQN (Lunar Lander), and Dueling DQN (Space Invader).
   * **Prioritized Replay**: Focus on critical transitions for efficient learning.
   * **Hierarchical Learning**: Building skills progressively across environments.

# Why is TLR Exciting?

* **Cross-Environment Synergy**: The agent improves in one task by leveraging knowledge from another.
* **Positive Results**: I’m seeing **positive rewards** in all three environments *simultaneously*, including Lunar Lander, where I’ve never achieved this before!
* It pushes the boundaries of **generalization and multi-domain learning**—something I haven’t seen widely implemented.

# How Does It Work?

* Experiences from all three environments are combined into a **shared replay buffer**, alongside environment-specific buffers.
* The agent adapts using environment-appropriate algorithms (e.g., Double DQN for Lunar Lander).
* Training happens simultaneously across environments, encouraging **generalized learning** and **skill transfer**.

# Next Steps

I’ve already integrated PPO into the Lunar Lander environment and plan to add curiosity-driven exploration (ICM) next. I believe this can be scaled to even more complex tasks and environments.

# Results and Code

If anyone is curious, I’ve shared the framework on GitHub. [https://github.com/Albiemc1303/TLR\_Framework-.git](https://github.com/Albiemc1303/TLR_Framework-.git)  
You can find example logs and results there. I’d love feedback on the approach or suggestions for improvements!

# Discussion Questions

* Have you seen similar multi-environment RL implementations?
* What other environments or techniques could benefit TLR?
* How could shared experience buffers be extended for more generalist AI systems?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback! I’m genuinely excited about how TLR is performing so far and hope others find it interesting.",UndyingDemon,1hg5siv,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hg5siv/discussion_d_introducing_tlr_training_ai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hg5siv/discussion_d_introducing_tlr_training_ai/,2024-12-17 07:52:37,12,0.73,12,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hg5siv

MachineLearning,[R][D] What are the possible soft label for distilling different student and teacher LLMs?,"I want to explore knowledge distillation in LLMs. Seems like there are a lot of methods but the easiest one is where the student is simply a smaller version of the teacher. However, I want to explore where the student is a different model than the teacher. So first of all the vocabulary is different, is there some techniques so that we can compute loss with the soft label with KL divergence when the set of vocabulary is different? As during the distillation process, we might want to introduce new words from the teacher model to the student model.

I see that there are some other ways than using KL divergence as the soft loss in this case, maybe even distilling in a black box teacher setup.

MachineLearning,[D] Evaluating the quality of LLM responses,"Hi all. I'm working on a project where I take multiple medical visit records and documents, and I feeding through an LLM and text clustering pipeline to extract all the unique medical symptoms, each with associated root causes and preventative actions (i.e. medication, treatment, etc...).

I'm at the end of my pipeline with all my results, and I am seeing that some of my generated results are very obvious and generalized. For example, one of my medical symptoms was excessive temperature and some of the treatment it recommended was drink lots of water and rest, which most people without a medical degree could guess.

I was wondering if there were any LLM evaluation methods I could use where I can score the root cause and countermeasure associated with a medical symptom, so that it scores the results recommending platitudes lower, while scoring ones with more unique and precise root causes and preventative actions higher. I was hoping to create this evaluation framework so that it provides a score to each of my results, and then I would remove all results that fall below a certain threshold.

I understand determining if something is generalized or unique/precise can be very subjective, but please let me know if there are ways to construct an evaluation framework to rank results to do this, whether it requires some ground truth examples, and how those examples can be constructed.

MachineLearning,[P] Graph-Based Editor for LLM Workflows,"We made an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows: [https://github.com/PySpur-Dev/PySpur](https://github.com/PySpur-Dev/PySpur)

**Why we built this:**

Before this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.

In practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:

1. **Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps:** Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.
2. **Debugging failures:** Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.
3. **Measuring performance:** Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.

We tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.

We eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :

1. **Graph-based interface:** We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.
2. **Integrated debugging:** When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.
3. **Evaluate at the node level:** We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.

We hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!",Brilliant-Day2748,1hfr4sg,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hfr4sg/p_graphbased_editor_for_llm_workflows/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hfr4sg/p_graphbased_editor_for_llm_workflows/,2024-12-16 19:23:32,14,0.84,14,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Project,self,t3_1hfr4sg

MachineLearning,[R] Optimizing LLM merging to reduce performance tradeoffs,"We just released our new [work](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.04144) on large-scale merging across checkpoints trained with different hyperparameters, data mixture, objectives, etc. to optimize tradeoffs. For instance, some models that perform well on code generation do worse on instruction following and vice versa. An interesting question to ask whether model merging can lead to a Pareto-optimal model in such setup.

  
**TL;DR:**

AS you're developing an LLM, it is common to obtain different checkpoints, where each excels at a single or a group of tasks/capabilities. Typically, you can keep tuning your hyperparameters until you obtain a Pareto-Optimal model, but the process can be super expensive. We show that you can collect all these models into a pool, and optimize merging parameters to reduce the task tradeoffs. We show that simple linear merging can yield Pareto-Optimal models in different tradeoff scenarios---better tradeoffs than individual models and strong merging baselines. Interestingly, our optimized merges outperform the original models in some cases. Our study uses large-scale models (Command R+ 104B from Cohere) and explores merging up to 16 checkpoints from SFT/RLHF training.

MachineLearning,[R] Developing a new optimization algorithm that will heavily change ML as a whole. Gradient descent has met its end. Here are the results:,"Microsolve (inspired by micrograd) works by actually solving parameters (instead of differentiating them w.r.t objectives) and does not require a loss function. It addresses a few drawbacks from SGD, namely, having to properly initialize parameters or the network blows up. Differentiation comes as a problem when values lie on a constant or steep slope. Gradients explode and diminish to negligible values as you go deeper. Proper preparation of data is needed to feed into the network (like normalisation etc.), and lastly, as most would argue against this, training with GD is really slow.

With microsolve, initialization does not matter (you can set parameter values to high magnitudes), gradients w.r.t losses are not needed, not even loss functions are needed. A learning rate is almost always not needed, if it is needed, it is small (to reduce response to noise). You simply apply a raw number at the input (no normalisation) and a raw number at the output (no sophisticated loss functions needed), and the model will fit to the data.

I created a demo application where i established a simple network for gradient descent and microsolve. The network takes the form of a linear layer (1 in, 8 out), followed by a tanh activation, and another linear layer afterwards (8 in, 1 out). Here is a visualisation of the very small dataset:

https://preview.redd.it/t3pd4kpccd7e1.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad03c3caf340a5b92aa24612ee7b5be963167a56

The model has to create a line to fit to all these data points. I only allowed 50 iterations (that makes a total of 50x3 forward passes) of each example into the neural networks, I went easy on GD so i normalised the input, MS didnt need any preparation. Here are the results:

GD:

https://preview.redd.it/5sf8do9fcd7e1.png?width=718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c232b062b1bb50aa01ef3efc73cde133b8ad28a

Not bad.

MS:

With precision, 0 loss achieved in under 50 iterations.

I have to point out though, that MS is still under development. On certain runs, as it solves parameters, they explode (their solutions grow to extremely high numbers), but sometimes this ""explosion"" is somewhat repaired and the network restabilises.

Comment your thoughts.

  
Edit: 

Apparantly people are allergic to overfitting, so i did early stopping with MS. It approximated this function in 1 forward pass of each data point. i.e. it only got to see a coordinate once:

Sees a coordinate thrice:

MachineLearning,[D] Understanding the Technology Behind Chat GPT’s Agent Routing ,"Good morning. When talking with ChatGPT, you’ll notice it routes to different agents. This means that if you want to create an image using DALL·E, it automatically identifies your intent and directs you to that agent. I was wondering what technology is behind this. Is it a small transformer model that classifies prompts and sends them to the corresponding agents? Or perhaps a smaller LLM that routes to the agents using a structured output?

I’m building a router that needs to decide which agent to use, and I’d love to know how other companies are handling this.

MachineLearning,[D] What are the (un)written rules of deep learning training ,"Disclaimer: I posted this in r/learnmachinelearing first, but the sub seems to be more concerned with very basic questions, courses and hiring, so feel free to remove it if it doesn't fit here (tho I think that also fits this sub as a discussion).

I now have a few years of experience building and training different model architectures, I know most of the basic theory and am able to follow most papers. So my question goes into a more methodological direction. While I am able to successfully build models for a number of applications, a lot of the time this is to a large extend guesswork. I try out different stuff and see what sticks. I know there is a lot of research in the direction of interpretability going on, but this is not directly the direction I want to go with this. Instead I want to ask you all what general advice you have on the training process, what are some practical observations, rules of thumb, approaches you take that are not described in a paper or theoretical ml class. For example:

- How do you analyze gradients in your model. I know how to do some very basic plots in this regard, but would be interested in your methods and how you read them from a practical perspective?

- How do you visualize temporal instabilities between optimizer steps resulting from e.g. a too large learning rate?

- How do you determine appropriate regularization?

- What are your rules of thumb for diminisheing returns during a training run?

- How do you tune your hyperparameters? I eyeballed them more or less and also used optuna for this in the past.

- What are some important intuitions, unwritten rules and pitfalls during training in your opinion?

- What are your debugging steps when a model does not perform as expected?

- What tricks do you actually use? There are lots of small tricks (EMA, obscure activation functions, ...) that promise some gains, but what do you actually use?

- How does your approach differ when you do a transformer, CNN, diffusion model, ...

- Some general opinions or tips that I might have missed above. 

University classes and online resources mostly teach the basics or theoretical foundation, which is very important, but in practice only part of the story. Real world experience also helps, but you only get so far with trial and error and might miss something useful.
I am aware of the blog posts by Karpathy on the training of neural networks and look for more resources in this direction.

I am happy to here your replies on this arguably broad topic.

MachineLearning,"[Project] Matrix Recurrent States, a Attention Alternative","[https://github.com/mikayahlevi/mru-lm](https://github.com/mikayahlevi/mru-lm)  
Hi, I'm posting here to share a project I just published on GitHub. I'll start with a description, some of which will be copy/pasted from the GitHub repo.  
The idea of a matrix recurrent unit is dictated by the update rule H\_t = H\_{t-1} X\_{t-1} and H\_1 = X\_1 where X and H are s×n×n sequences of square matrices. The primary difference between this and a traditional RNN is that no initial vector is passed through the linears, instead the first state is a matrix, leading to the output also being a matrix. My motivation for coming up with this idea are based on the following reasons:

* Matrix multiplication is associative but not commutative. The associativity means I can compute the cumulative matrix product using an (inclusive) parallel scan. The lack of commutativity means that the order of tokens is automatically incorporated into the MRU.
* When you try to do this scan on an traditional RNN, the number of operations scales cubically with the amount of elements in the output state, meaning that limited information is retained compared to the amount of computation. On the other hand, if the states are matrices, the number of operations as a function of elements in the output state is (n\^2)\^(3/2), where n\^2 is the number of elements in the square n×n matrix state. Here's a paper including some information about this: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04057.
* When processing the tokens sequentially or in parallel with the (not-yet implemented) Brent-Kung parallel scan the network scales linearly with time, in contrast to attention which scales quadratically with time.

I tried generating matrix X by different methods in the different branches. All of the ways to generate X and fold the output hidden state back into a vector, are arbitrary combinations of linears and reshapes and just based on what I found worked well.

MachineLearning,[D] Are We Okay With This? Questionable Poster Behavior at NeurIPS,"This was my first year at NeurIPS. It’s inspiring to see so much cutting-edge research being presented, but something troubling caught my attention during the poster sessions that I feel compelled to share, especially given [the recent incident with Rosalind Picard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hdxbru/d_what_happened_at_neurips/).

Getting a paper accepted at NeurIPS is a huge achievement. Each poster spot represents so much hard work and is highly coveted.

I saw two posters that *shouldn’t* have been there, and it has left me wondering about the exploitation of these spaces.

**Illegal Poster #1:** [Generative Boba](https://x.com/BoyuanChen0/status/1778565953627775453). This was a “cute, look at me” poster, but it also featured a QR code linking to the creator’s X/Twitter. While the poster itself was placed on a side wall in the exhibition hall and not in an official poster spot (when I saw it anyway), it still felt odd. Why did they make this poster? Was this about sparking joy, or gaining attention and followers?

[Illegal Poster #1: Generative Boba.](https://preview.redd.it/u3vfvszkoy6e1.jpg?width=3363&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c09ddda45e0ac002223dadf0eac4165bfdc0433)

**Illegal Poster #2:** [Benchmarkthing](https://x.com/xdotli/status/1867823150068535797)**.** This was far more concerning. It blatantly promoted a new AI startup, mentioning funding by a prominent figure in our field, Jeff Dean. Unlike the boba poster, this could visually pass as a real NeurIPS poster. Probably most passersby didn’t give it a second thought, but the poster's presenter (who is also the company’s founder) was essentially promoting his new startup, sometimes to a significant audience size AND across *multiple* poster sessions. This feels deceptive and exploitative — gaming the trust of the community to cheatingly gain visibility in a sacred academic space.

[Illegal Poster #2: Benchmarkthing.](https://preview.redd.it/qn7vpos4py6e1.jpg?width=2646&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cfd1aa535bdf74cdb57ba8e44f1fa813b9d28a7)

A different type of gaming involves authors putting up their poster at unused spots while leaving a sign in their formally assigned location that says “See poster at #{better spot}”. If the authors for the unused spot arrived, they’d just move their poster back — but if not, they would presumably revel in the extra attention from being located, for example, closer to the hall’s entrance with more foot traffic.

Relocating posters still seems problematic, but at least the posters *belong* at the conference. On the other hand, I feel much more strongly that unauthorized posters for personal or commercial promotion hurts the integrity of the space, disrespects the presenters whose posters truly belong there, and undermines the conference overall.

Questions for the community:

1. Should there be stricter policies or better enforcement for poster sessions?
2. How do we differentiate between minor gaming (e.g. relocating posters) and outright exploitation (e.g. unauthorized posters)?
3. Is it fair to tolerate some flexibility as long as the intentions are lighthearted or still academic? 
4. How do we address these behaviors moving forward? Should there be consequences?",Positive_Lychee6904,1heo36q,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1heo36q/d_are_we_okay_with_this_questionable_poster/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1heo36q/d_are_we_okay_with_this_questionable_poster/,2024-12-15 08:08:41,0,0.33,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/r9cEQ2e72Zhy6nH9XkcERYWkKB8X-saXhRtgLnKAF2I.jpg,t3_1heo36q
MachineLearning,"[D] NVIDIA’s hostages: A Cyberpunk Reality of Monopolies
","In AI and professional workstations, NVIDIA's dominance feels like a suffocating monopoly. Their segmented product lines widen the gap between consumer and professional GPUs, particularly in VRAM, performance, and price.

AI enthusiasts struggle with prohibitive costs for GPUs equipped with sufficient VRAM. The reliance on CUDA cores—a proprietary standard—further locks developers into NVIDIA’s ecosystem, stifling competition and innovation.

NVIDIA’s control extends beyond hardware, as their CUDA platform discourages adoption of open, competitive solutions. This feeds a cyberpunk dystopia where corporations consolidate power, leaving consumers and developers with few choices.

Why does the tech world remain complicit? Why aren’t we pursuing alternative hardware architectures or broader software compatibility beyond CUDA? AMD’s ROCm is a start, but more aggressive development and policy interventions are needed to challenge NVIDIA’s grip.

MachineLearning,[R] Identifying Critical Decision Points in Neural Text Generation Through Token-Level Uncertainty Analysis,"This paper introduces a framework for analyzing and visualizing the branching decisions language models make during text generation. The key methodology involves tracking probability distributions across different sampling paths to understand how early choices affect downstream generation.

Main technical points:
- Developed metrics to quantify uncertainty at each generation step
- Created visualization tools for mapping decision trees in generation
- Analyzed how different sampling methods affect path divergence
- Measured correlation between model confidence and generation quality
- Identified clustering patterns in generation trajectories

Key results:
- Found that paths tend to cluster into 2-3 distinct trajectory groups
- Early sampling decisions have outsized impact on final outputs
- Uncertainty patterns vary significantly between sampling methods
- Similar prompts can lead to dramatically different generation paths
- Model confidence doesn't consistently predict output quality

I think this work provides important insights into how we might better control text generation. The ability to map and understand generation paths could help develop more reliable sampling methods and better uncertainty estimates.

I think the clustering of generation paths is particularly interesting - it suggests there may be ways to guide generation toward desired trajectory groups. This could be valuable for applications needing more predictable outputs.

The methodology also reveals some concerning aspects about current sampling methods. The strong dependence on early decisions suggests we may need new approaches that better preserve generation flexibility throughout the sequence.

TLDR: New framework for analyzing how language models make text generation choices. Shows that generation paths cluster into distinct groups and early decisions heavily influence outcomes. Could help develop better sampling methods and uncertainty estimates.

MachineLearning,[D] Help with clustering over time,"I'm dealing with a clustering over time issue.
Our company is a sort of PayPal. We are trying to implement an antifraud process to trigger alerts when a client makes excessive payments compared to its historical behavior.
To do so, I've come up with seven clustering features which are all 365-day-long moving averages of different KPIs (payment frequency, payment amount, etc.). So it goes without saying that, from one day to another, these indicators evolve very slowly. I have about 15k clients, several years of data.
I get rid of outliers (99-percentile of each date, basically) and put them in a cluster-0 by default.
Then, the idea is, for each date, to come up with 8 clusters. I've used a Gaussian Mixture clustering (GMM) but, weirdly enough, the clusters of my clients vary wildly from one day to another.
I have tried to plant the previous mean of my centroids, using the previous day centroid of a client to sort of seed the next day's clustering of a client, but the results still vary a lot.

From ReAct, I like that it has a reflection/observation LLM, to decide whether the output is good enough or needs another pass through the agents.

What I don't understand:
Why does ReWOO not have a reflection component??

Wouldn't it be the best of both worlds to have the planner and the reflection?

MachineLearning,"[R] A Grounded Theory Study of LLM Red Teaming: Motivations, Strategies, and Techniques","This paper presents a grounded theory study of how red-teaming is conducted on Large Language Models (LLMs), based on interviews with practitioners. The researchers systematically analyzed practitioner approaches to identify common patterns, strategies and motivations in LLM red-teaming.

Key technical points:
- Used qualitative coding of interviews to develop taxonomy of red-teaming approaches
- Identified 12 distinct attack strategies and 35 specific techniques
- Found red-teaming requires manual effort rather than automation
- Demonstrated importance of team collaboration over individual attempts
- Established red-teaming as distinct from malicious attacks
- Mapped common patterns in tester motivations and goals

Main results:
- Red-teaming strategies fall into categories like prompt manipulation, psychology-based attacks, and system limit testing
- Successful testers adopt an ""alchemist"" mindset of systematic experimentation
- Most practitioners are motivated by curiosity and safety concerns
- Testing requires deep understanding of both technical and psychological aspects
- Manual testing currently more effective than automated approaches

I think this work provides an important foundation for developing more structured approaches to LLM safety testing. The taxonomy they've developed could help standardize how we evaluate and secure these systems. Their finding that manual testing remains superior to automation suggests we need much more work on automated testing approaches.

I think the emphasis on non-malicious intent and safety motivations is particularly relevant as these systems become more widely deployed. Understanding how and why people conduct these tests helps distinguish legitimate security research from attacks.

TLDR: First systematic study of LLM red-teaming practices, providing taxonomy of strategies and techniques based on practitioner interviews. Shows importance of manual testing and team collaboration, while establishing red-teaming as legitimate security research.

MachineLearning,[D] Question About ResNet and Scalability of Extremely Deep Networks,"I’ve been exploring the architecture of ResNet and its ability to train very deep neural networks effectively.

From my understanding, a ResNet with, say, 100 layers might effectively function like a much smaller network due to the residual connections, which essentially ""skip"" layers and add outputs. However, wouldn’t this also mean that if a regular MLP struggles to scale beyond 15 layers, a ResNet might just shift this limit proportionally (e.g., struggling beyond 150 layers)? In other words, does ResNet fundamentally solve the problem of training extremely deep networks, or does it merely extend the depth at which issues start to reappear?

  
I’d appreciate any insights you might have!

MachineLearning,[R] What should I choose: AI-assisted data labeling or crowdsourced data labeling?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a researcher at my company, and I’m starting to train a model using a dataset of over 50k medical images. One of the major challenges I’m facing is choosing the best approach for data labeling.

I’ve seen promising results with **AI-assisted labeling**—it seems faster and less costly upfront. However, I’m concerned about potential inaccuracies and whether the AI’s assistance would skew the dataset in ways I might not expect.

On the other hand, **crowdsourced labeling** is significantly more expensive and time-consuming, but the results are often highly reliable due to diverse human input.

Given the scale of my dataset and its importance in a sensitive domain like medical imaging:

* **Which method would you recommend, and why?**
* **Are there hybrid approaches that balance cost, quality, and efficiency?**
* **What tools or platforms would you suggest for either approach?**

MachineLearning,[R] Continuous Latent Space Reasoning: Enhancing LLM Performance Through Chain of Continuous Thought,"This paper introduces **COCONUT** (Chain of Continuous Thought), which transforms language model reasoning from discrete token space into continuous latent space. The key idea is encoding reasoning steps as continuous vectors rather than text tokens, allowing for more flexible and precise intermediate computations.

Main technical points:
* Encoder-decoder architecture that maps text↔continuous vectors
* Novel continuous reasoning module operating on latent vectors
* Parallel processing of reasoning steps in continuous space
* Gradient-based optimization during the reasoning process
* Special loss function combining reconstruction and reasoning objectives

Key results:
* **20%** improvement on reasoning benchmarks vs traditional methods
* Reduced computational steps needed for complex problems
* More consistent performance across different reasoning tasks
* Better handling of mathematical and logical reasoning
* Enhanced ability to maintain coherent reasoning chains

I think this approach could meaningfully advance how language models handle complex reasoning tasks. By moving beyond discrete tokens, models may better capture the continuous nature of human-like reasoning. The ability to optimize in continuous space during reasoning is particularly promising for improving reliability.

I think the main challenge will be scaling this to very large models while managing computational costs. The translation between discrete and continuous spaces adds overhead that needs to be addressed.

TLDR: New method transforms language model reasoning into continuous vector space instead of discrete tokens, showing 20% better performance on reasoning tasks through more flexible computation.

MachineLearning,[D] From Unemployment to Lisp: Running GPT-2 on a Teen's Deep Learning Compiler,"A couple months ago I found myself unemployed, uncertain about what to do next. I wanted to learn more about deep learning, but from a systems prespective. Coming from Andrew's Ng course on supervised learning, I was eager to learn more about how deep learning frameworks (or deep learning compilers) like Pytorch or Tinygrad.

I started to poke around Tinygrad, learning from the tutorials I found online, and I found it fascinating because it was an actual compiler, it took conventional python code and translated them into an Abstract Syntax Tree that was parsed into UOps and ScheduleItems, to finally have a codegen layer. While the design was interesting, the code was hard to read.

That's when I stumbled across something completly unexpected, A deep learning compiler built on Common Lisp, maintained by a Japanese 18-year-old during his gap year. And currently we have acomplished something great, it can run gpt2!

For now, it just generates C-kernels, but in the future we would like to support cuda codegen as well as many other features, and serve as a learning tool for anyone who would like to get to work on deep learning compilers in Common Lisp.

This is an open source project and anyone is welcome to contribute!

[https://github.com/hikettei/Caten](https://github.com/hikettei/Caten)

Edit: add an example of how it works.

Here's an example i wrote in a different forum:

Hello! Thanks for your question.

First of all, there are three layers of abstraction within Caten:

1. caten/apis | High-Level Graph Interface 2. caten/air | Low-Level Graph Interface 3. caten/codegen | AIR Graph =&gt; Kernel Generator

The inputs of the compiler are just Common Lisp classes (similar to torch modules). For example, in Common Lisp, we could create a module that does SinCos:

        (defclass SinCos (Func) nil
          (:documentation ""The func SinCos computes sin(cos(x))""))
    
        ;; Forward creates a lazy tensor for the next computation.
        ;; You can skip this process by using the `st` macro.
        (defmethod forward ((op SinCos) &amp;rest tensors)
          (st ""A[~] -&gt; A[~]"" (tensors)))
    
        ;; Backward is optional (skipped this time)
        (defmethod backward ((op SinCos) &amp;optional prev-grad)
          (declare (ignore prev-grad))
          nil)
    
        ;; Lower describes the lowered expression of `SinCos`
        (defmethod lower ((op SinCos) &amp;rest inputs)
          (let ((x (car inputs)))
            (with-context
              (a (%sin (%add x (%fconst (/ pi 2)))))
              (b (%sin a)))))

The \`apis\` layer is the high-level interface, while the \`lower\` method is the lower-level step before code generation.

Next, the framework generates an Abstract VM (AVM) representation:

        #S(AVM :GRAPH Graph[seen=NIL, outputs=(STC6466_1)] {
          &lt;ALLOCATE : TID6464 &lt;- (shape=(1), stride=(1)) where :dtype=FLOAT32&gt;
          &lt;Node[BUFFER] ALLOCATE(NID6480) : SID6479* &lt;- ()&gt;
          &lt;Node[BINARYOPS] ADD(NID6484) : BID6483* &lt;- (TID6464, LID6481)&gt;
          &lt;Node[UNARYOPS] SIN(NID6486) : UID6485* &lt;- (BID6483)&gt;
          &lt;Node[UNARYOPS] SIN(NID6488) : UID6487* &lt;- (UID6485)&gt;
          &lt;Node[SPECIAL/VM] PAUSE/BACKWARD(NID6501) : STC6466_1* &lt;- (UID6487)&gt;
        })

Then, the computation graph is translated into schedule items:

        FastGraph[outputs=(val_6)] {
          { Allocate } : [ val_0 &lt;- (1) ]
          { KERNEL } : [ val_5 &lt;- val_1, val_0 :name=FUSED_SIN_SIN_ADD_LOAD6511]
        }

Finally, the code generation step produces the following C code:

        void fused_sin_sin_add_load6511(float* val_5, const float* restrict val_0);
        void fused_sin_sin_add_load6511(float* val_5, const float* restrict val_0) {
            val_5[0] = sin(sin((val_0[0] + 1.5707964)));
        }

This C code is compiled by a C compiler and executed.

So to answer your question: the compiler takes Common Lisp code and generates C functions.",yCuboy,1hb7v5h,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hb7v5h/d_from_unemployment_to_lisp_running_gpt2_on_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hb7v5h/d_from_unemployment_to_lisp_running_gpt2_on_a/,2024-12-10 18:00:45,103,0.93,103,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hb7v5h

MachineLearning,[R] How difficult is this dataset REALLY?,"New Paper Alert!

Class-wise Autoencoders Measure Classification Difficulty and Detect Label Mistakes

We like to think that the challenge in training a classifier is handled by hyperparameter tuning or model innovation, but there is rich inherent signal in the data and their embeddings.  Understanding how hard a machine learning problem is has been quite elusive.  Not any more.

Now you can compute the difficulty of a classification dataset without training a classifier, and requiring only 100 labels per class.  And, this difficulty estimate is surprisingly independent of the dataset size.

Traditionally, methods for dataset difficulty assessment have been time and/or compute-intensive, often requiring training one or multiple large downstream models. What's more, if you train a model with a certain architecture on your dataset and achieve a certain accuracy, there is no way to be sure that your architecture was perfectly suited to the task at hand — it could be that a different set of inductive biases would have led to a model that learned patterns in the data with far more ease.

Our method trains a lightweight autoencoder for each class and uses the ratios of reconstruction errors to estimate classification difficulty. Running this dataset difficulty estimation method on a 100k sample dataset takes just a few minutes, and doesn't require tuning or custom processing to run on new datasets!

How well does it work? We conducted a systematic study of 19 common visual datasets, comparing the estimated difficulty from our method to the SOTA classification accuracy. Aside from a single outlier, the correlation is 0.78. It even works on medical datasets!

MachineLearning,[R] Understanding Transformer Limitations in Graph Search: A Mechanistic Analysis of Learning and Scaling Behavior,"This paper tackled a fundamental question about transformers' ability to learn search algorithms by studying how they handle graph connectivity problems. The authors developed a novel interpretation method to analyze how transformers process search operations layer by layer.

Key technical points:
- Used graph reachability as a test case with controlled complexity and unlimited training data
- Developed interpretation technique to understand how transformer layers compute reachable vertex sets
- Found transformers learn to expand search frontier exponentially with depth
- Demonstrated clear scaling limitations based on graph size
- Showed in-context learning (chain-of-thought) doesn't overcome these limitations

Main results:
- Small transformers can learn basic search when trained appropriately
- Each layer computes union of previously reachable vertices plus their neighbors
- Performance degrades sharply with increasing graph size
- Adding parameters doesn't solve the scaling problem
- Models struggle with graphs beyond their training distribution

I think this work reveals important architectural limitations in transformers that we need to address for applications requiring search capabilities. The scaling behavior suggests we may need fundamentally different approaches for larger search spaces rather than just bigger models.

I think the interpretation method they developed could be valuable for understanding how transformers process other types of structured data beyond just graphs. The clear empirical results on scaling limitations should inform architecture choices for applications involving search-like computations.

TLDR: Transformers can learn basic graph search operations but face fundamental limitations with scale. Adding more parameters doesn't help, suggesting we need new approaches for complex search problems.

Basically, my aim is to determine the input values of a multivariate function that satisfy an output value, e.g., find x=\[x1,...,xN\] so that 0.2=f(x).

My main major is engineering (not machine learning) and my knowledge about the field is quite limited. However, I'm good with reading any research papers that you suggested.

Thank you all,

MachineLearning,[R] The Well: a Large-Scale Collection of Diverse Physics Simulations for Machine Learning,"**Dataset**: [https://github.com/PolymathicAI/the\_well](https://github.com/PolymathicAI/the_well)

**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00568](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00568)

**Abstract:**

&gt;Machine learning based surrogate models offer researchers powerful tools for accelerating simulation-based workflows. However, as standard datasets in this space often cover small classes of physical behavior, it can be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Well: a large-scale collection of datasets containing numerical simulations of a wide variety of spatiotemporal physical systems. The Well draws from domain experts and numerical software developers to provide 15TB of data across 16 datasets covering diverse domains such as biological systems, fluid dynamics, acoustic scattering, as well as magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of extra-galactic fluids or supernova explosions. These datasets can be used individually or as part of a broader benchmark suite. To facilitate usage of the Well, we provide a unified PyTorch interface for training and evaluating models. We demonstrate the function of this library by introducing example baselines that highlight the new challenges posed by the complex dynamics of the Well. The code and data is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/PolymathicAI/the_well).

MachineLearning,[D] Question about heating system machine learning,"Hello, in conventional heating processes you control when to start heating and when to stop with target values. Once reached it'll stop and start the whole process over and over again, alongside some pump valves (how much water to go through the circulation).

I've captured several room temperatures, all start/stops and pump valve adjustments made by the heating automation software in a time series database for the last 5 years (every minute).

I'm trying to create a model which has a constant target value of e.g. 23 °C. The inputs for the model are the heating system status (on/off), pump valve positions and current room temperatures. Output should be how to set the heating system status and adjust the valve positions to achieve and hold the target value of the room temperatures. In the best case scenario it should replace the heating automation software completely. Other is to just advise or supervise the process.

A few problems come to my mind, where I'm not sure on how to approach these:

1. The process is slow and once heating starts the results can be seen 1 hour later as the temperature changes slowly. So the evaluation of the actions must be done with some delay?
2. My captured data contains historical temperatures, but I think it might be flawed. The temperature in the data is already influenced by the existing heating system. I don't have temperature data which show how the room temperatures realistically change without any heating systems. Is this a problem for learning? Do I need to create synthetic data?
3. Would it be better to train a model to output ""start heating / stop heating"" (leave the rest for the conventional heating automation) or to control the heating status and the pump valves itself?
4. What would be the best machine learning technique, e.g. un-/supervised, reinforcement learning?",QuickYogurt2037,1hb5dty,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hb5dty/d_question_about_heating_system_machine_learning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hb5dty/d_question_about_heating_system_machine_learning/,2024-12-10 16:15:47,2,0.75,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hb5dty

MachineLearning,"[D] How do you manage and track your large, evolving, image datasets?","I’m wondering how people manage the lifecycles of their large in-house datasets? Say &gt;1TB and 100k files.

In my new role we have multiple production models trained from in house datasets ranging in size from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand images. We also have huge amounts of fresh data coming in, more than 1M images per day, and so we are constantly mining that and sending new tranches off to be annotated.

Until now the team has been largely left to their own devices to manage this and the results are predictable. In some cases we can’t associate our prod models with any specific data. Some of our core datasets exist only in people’s home directories, ripe to be wiped out by a single misplaced command. For one model, thankfully being sunsetted, both the training code and original training data are known to be lost.

Parts of the org have adopted DVC which seems pretty good until the number of files or overall size gets big. On one end, some stuff the entire dataset into just a few archives and track them. That minimizes frustrations with hashes but uses a lot of storage when only a few files get updated. On the other end, some people track every single file which lets files be individually updated but is a pretty big pain to check in and out. Others split the difference of these two approaches, tracking chunks of the dataset as archives hierarchically.

So how does your org manage this?

MachineLearning,[R] Improving robustness to corruptions with multiplicative weight perturbations - A simple yet effective approach to robustify neural networks to corruptions,"We would like to share and discuss this NeurIPS spotlight paper (disclaimer: I am a co-author).

**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16540)  
**GitHub**: [https://github.com/trungtrinh44/DAMP](https://github.com/trungtrinh44/DAMP)  
**DAMP** (Data augmentation via multiplicative perturbations) is a simple yet effective approach to improving neural network robustness through multiplicative weight perturbations. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods, DAMP operates directly on model weights during training, enabling improved corruption robustness without compromising clean image performance or increasing computational cost.  
  
**Key Highlights:**

* **Theoretical Foundation**: DAMP demonstrates that input corruptions can be equivalently represented as multiplicative weight perturbations, providing a theoretical basis for weight-space data augmentation.
* **Simple Implementation**: The method requires only random Gaussian sampling and pointwise multiplication, maintaining almost the same training cost as standard SGD while being fully compatible with data parallelism.
* **Breakthrough in ViT Training**: Successfully trains Vision Transformers from scratch using only basic preprocessing, achieving ResNet50-level performance (23.7% top-1 error) on ImageNet without complex augmentations.
* **Advanced Integration**: When combined with MixUp and RandAugment, DAMP significantly improves both clean and corruption performance:
   * ViT-S/16: 20.09% clean error (vs 20.25% baseline), 58.30% avg corruption error (vs 60.07% baseline)
   * ViT-B/16: 19.36% clean error (vs 20.41% baseline), 56.76% avg corruption error (vs 58.83% baseline)

**Why DAMP?** Unlike traditional approaches that rely on complex data augmentation pipelines or computationally expensive ensemble methods, DAMP provides a simple, theoretically-grounded solution to improving model robustness. Its ability to train Vision Transformers from scratch without advanced augmentations and compatibility with existing techniques makes it a practical choice for developing robust vision models.  
**Since DAMP has minimal overhead over standard training, it is particularly effective when applied to large models and datasets.**

MachineLearning,[D] How to Ensure Fair Comparison Between Few-Shot Prompting and Fine-Tuning in NLP Experiments,"I’m working on comparing a few-shot prompting mechanism with a fine-tuned GPT model for a text classification task. However, I realised that in a 5-fold validation setup, the fine-tuned model has access to significantly more data (ex: 4 folds for training) compared to my few-shot approach, which only uses a limited number of examples for prompting (At the moment I select n samples per each class from the training fold).  

`Example Scenario: My dataset has 4 classes, total number of data is 100, and I am conducting 4-way 5-shot experiment. For the traning set I have 80 (since it's 5-fold) and for test I have 20 data samples. For the fine-tune experiment I use the whole 80 data but for the few-shot experiment I use only 20 (4*5) data from the 80 traning samples. So the approach has only access to 20 samples of the whole training set.`

This imbalance feels unfair and makes it hard to assess the true performance difference between the two approaches. How can I modify the experimental setup to ensure a fair comparison? Should I restrict the fine-tuned model to use the same examples used in the few-shot prompting mechanism?

MachineLearning,[R] Distillation-Based Colorization of 3D Neural Radiance Fields for Consistent Novel View Synthesis,"This paper introduces a knowledge distillation approach to colorize 3D neural representations (NeRF/3DGS) from grayscale multi-view images. The core idea is transferring color information from pre-trained 2D colorization models to 3D scene representations while maintaining view consistency.

Key technical aspects:
- Uses a teacher-student framework where 2D colorization models guide 3D representations
- Works with both Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting
- No additional parameters or computation needed during inference
- Handles both indoor/outdoor scenes and different types of grayscale input (IR, historical photos)
- Maintains color consistency across viewpoints through volumetric optimization

Results:
- Matches or exceeds SOTA colorization quality on standard benchmarks
- Successfully colorizes complex scenes with varying lighting/materials
- Works effectively on legacy photographs and infrared images
- Demonstrates consistent colors across novel viewpoints
- Compatible with current NeRF/3DGS implementations

I think this method could be particularly valuable for cultural heritage applications, allowing us to create immersive 3D experiences from historical black and white photographs. The IR imaging capabilities also suggest potential applications in security and surveillance where color visualization of thermal data would be useful.

I think the key strength is how it bridges the gap between 2D colorization and 3D scene understanding without requiring architectural changes to existing 3D representations. This makes it quite practical for real-world adoption.

MachineLearning,[R] Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers,"**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04139](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04139)  
**GitHub**: [https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet](https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet)

**Monet** presents a novel approach to enhancing mechanistic interpretability in large language models (LLMs) through an innovative Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. By directly incorporating sparse dictionary learning into end-to-end pretraining, **Monet** addresses the fundamental challenge of polysemanticity - where individual neurons respond to multiple unrelated concepts - while maintaining model performance.

**Key Highlights:**

* **Scalable Expert Architecture**: **Monet** introduces parameter-efficient expert decomposition methods that enable scaling to 262,144 experts per layer while ensuring total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of expert count.
* **Monosemantic Experts**: Through fine-grained expert specialization, **Monet** achieves monosemantic experts that demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge, allowing transparent observation of model behavior and parametric knowledge.
* **Robust Knowledge Control**: The architecture enables precise manipulation of domain-specific knowledge, language capabilities, and toxicity mitigation without compromising general performance.

**Why Monet?**

Unlike traditional approaches using post-hoc reconstruction (like Sparse Autoencoders), **Monet** integrates interpretability directly into its architecture. This enables both transparent understanding of model internals and fundamental behavior control. By scaling monosemantic experts, Monet paves the way for more transparent and controllable language models.

MachineLearning,"[D] Is there such a thing as ""integrable programming""?","I come from a pure math background and have been getting up to speed at a new job in scientific AI/ML where I've been working a lot with JAX. JAX is great, love it, but I see a super common pattern where researchers will have a fully differentiable simulation and a couple of neural net architectures or something, but then there will be a bunch of relatively imprecise numerical estimations of integral values. Obviously I'm reading up on numerical methods and doing my best to restructure problems to solve more algebraically, but for my own curiosity, is there an equivalent of ""differentiable"" programming where you're handling ""integrable"" entities instead?

Obviously, this would be a much harder class of problems since you can integrate...well, everything. And that's how you end up solving PDEs on compact supports with weird ugly Holder bounds. But are there computational approaches (or hell, differentiable programming strategies I should be aware of) that move in this direction? Are there nice natural algebraic properties to be leveraged? Can you use a computational graph the same sort of way? How about, like, valid ways to extend to ""weakly-differentiable"" functional programming?

Hope this is relevant enough since it's learning JAX inspired...

MachineLearning,[R] Should I Use ML Experiment Tracking Tools Like MLflow or DVC for my Academic Paper?,"Hi everyone!

I'm a Computer Science graduate currently working on machine learning experiments for a research paper. I have a dataset and plan to compare error metrics across several deep learning models.

The conference where I intent to submit my paper requires that I provide the code and dataset and I also strongly believe that reproducibility is crucial in academic research. To this end, I'm using Docker and pip-compile to make the environment as reproducible as possible.

That said, I know there are tools like MLFlow and DVC for tracking ML experiments. However, I've never seen these tools mentioned in the code accompanying academic papers.

My questions are:

1. Are there any academic papers that use ML experiment tracking tools like MLFlow or DVC?
2. Should I use these tools for my research, even it means additional work?

I'm also experimenting with DVC because it stores experiments outputs in Git. However, my project involves running many distinct experiments in a single repository (comparing multiple ML algorithms). Would DVC or another tool be the best choice for this kind of workflow? Or is using such tools overkill for academic papers?

We aim to build a prototype project using Deep Learning, but we require a dataset containing Kubernetes deployment metrics. I initially tried sourcing data from my company, but—spoiler alert—we obviously can’t use it.

Our current idea is to create a virtual lab with a small Kubernetes cluster running a custom app. Using JMeter, we plan to simulate random scenarios to generate traffic similar to the microservices deployments in our company.

The synthetic data generated will be used to train our prototype. Afterward, we’ll test the model by slightly modifying the JMeter scenarios and evaluating its performance against Kubernetes’ default algorithm.

MachineLearning,[R] O1 replication paper,"Hi Everyone,

Just released a paper that I think hints at how OpenAI might have developed some of O1's remarkable reasoning capabilities. TLDR- you need a small dataset of really high quality human paired with a little bit of RL

Here are some of they key take ways from the research

* Reasoning data is extremely scarce on the internet. It's very difficult to find data that really shows the problem solving process e.g hypothesis testing, backtracking etc
* RL although important is overrated by the general community. It's really the cherry on top. The human data does most of the heavy lifting. See deep-seek math for more info on this

Paper can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04645)

MachineLearning,[D] - Approximating Long Convolutions,"I think I'm beginning to wrap my head around the way modern, ""deep"" state-space models (e.g Mamba, S4, etc.) leverage polynomial multiplication to speed up very long convolutions.  There's a short and simple description here: 

[https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-12-11-conv-tutorial](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-12-11-conv-tutorial)

**I'm curious if there are other methods for approximating long convolutions that are well-known or widely-used?**  I'm in the audio field and interested in learning long \_FIR\_ filters to describe the resonances of physical objects, like instruments, or rooms.  



**I'm definitely aware that multiplication in the (complex) frequency domain is equivalent to convolution in the time domain and that, because of the fast-fourier transform, this can yield increased efficiency**.  However, this still results in storing a lot of gradient information that my intuition tells me (possibly incorrectly) is full of redundancy and waste.

  
Stateful, IIR, or auto-regressive approaches are \_one\_ obvious answer, but this changes the game in terms of training and inference parallelization.  Block-coding, or fixed-frame size approaches reign supreme, at least in audio coding, but have their own issues in terms of windowing artifacts, etc.

  
A couple ideas I've considered, but have not yet tried, or looked too deeply into:

\- First performing PCA in the complex frequency domain, reducing the point-wise multiplication that must    occur.  Without some additional normalization up-front, it's likely this would be equivalent to downsampling/low-pass filtering and performing the convolution there.  The learnable filter bank would live in the PCA space, reducing the overall number of learned parameters.

\- A Compressed Sensing inspired approach, where we perform a sparse, sub-sampled random set of points from both signals and recover the full result based on the assumption that both convolver and convolvee? are sparse in the fourier domain.  This one is pretty half-baked.

  
I'd love to hear about papers you've read, or thoughts you've had about this problem.

MachineLearning,[D] Offline AI/ML activity for high school students?,"Next week, I am giving an hour of code presentation at a local high school. Since I run my university's artificial intelligence club, I'd like to center it around AI. I've done some AI focused activities with high schoolers with various levels of success in the past, but haven't found ""the one"" yet. Any ideas on what I could try next? I'll list what I've done so far as well as the restrictions are this particular event.

Restrictions:

1. These are random students in grades 9-12, so I can't rely on any prior computer science knowledge
2. We don't have access to computers so everything has to be offline. I *may* be able to get ipads for them though
3. We have 1 hour for the event. Filling around 45 minutes would be ideal so we don't go over and we don't end up with too much extra time.

Things I've tried before:

1. AI Kahoot + Simple lecture explaining neural networks - The students liked the kahoot, but I dramatically overestimated their knowledge (and interest) in AI. Stupidly thought at least a handful of them would have at least heard of a neural net, but not a single student had lmao
2. Wordle AI pseudocode and code along - I had the students get into groups and brainstorm how they would make an algorithm to solve the wordle. Then I coded their solutions on the projector and we competed against my algorithm. This one was cool, but I think it only really works if the students are *really engaged* and I really don't think this group will be that engaged.
3. Image classification code along - I've done this by myself on the projector (bad) and as a group with students with some CS experience (decent). But this one wouldn't work for this event I just thought I'd include it
4. Turing test activity - Have the students guess which answer came from ChatGPT and which came from a student volunteer. The volunteer will leave the room and the rest of the students will ask a question (like ""what is the meaning of life"" or something). I'll write the volunteer's answer and ChatGPT's answer on a powerpoint slide and have the student guess which was GPT. This has been really successful with middle school students in the past, but I worry it's a bit too childish for high schoolers.

MachineLearning,[P] I got too frustrated trying to test all these AI cookbooks and recipes,"Over the last year of building AI enabled SaaS applications I became increasingly frustrated at the developer experience of going from AI RAG cookbooks authored in jupyter notebooks to integrating it into my application. Notebooks are great and all but it's incredibly hard to test which part of it was actually important for my app. This led me down the road of having to understand every piece of code in each notebook, deciphering what was important, somehow build an API server as a POC to then hook it into my app. The feedback loop was excruciatingly long, painful, and most of the time I canned the POC because it wasn't quite what I wanted.

this is when it dawned on me that the roles in the AI developer world are fractured into two. Data Scientists and AI devs want easy notebooks to test methods and techniques but do not care to ship something that can be easily be consumed by applications.

In the other camp lies application devs, they just want simple API's that they can use to test quickly and verify these AI methods enhance their application.

Enter KitchenAI.

A way to bridge the gap between the two by converting AI related Jupyter notebooks into a ready made production API server so that it becomes easy to test various cookbooks, recipes, and techniques. Shortening the development cycle in half while giving users a complete local experience with the ability to share them as docker containers.

Completely vendor agnostic and framework agnostic, the goal is to give developers the most about of freedom to use the libraries they already feel most comfortable using.

It comes with a plugin architecture so I envision our team and the community building all sorts of llmops type plugins like evaluation frameworks, observability, prompt management and more.

A lot of hard work was put to provide something that is totally open source, local, and with battle tested technology like Django so that developers didn't have to rely on 3rd party providers.

We’ve launched this repo under Apache license so any developer can use the tool. We're working hard to provide a managed cloud version with much deeper integrations, metrics, analytics, and workflows for those that want have more complex demands

MachineLearning,[R]  GraphMaker: Can Diffusion Models Generate Large Attributed Graphs?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working through the recent paper “GraphMaker: Can Diffusion Models Generate Large Attributed Graphs?”, but I’ve run into some issues and was hoping someone here might have insights.

* Asynchronous Model: The paper and its implementation don’t seem entirely consistent when it comes to the asynchronous model. Specifically:
   * Is the generation process done step-by-step asynchronously?
   * Or does it first denoise the attribute vectors entirely before moving on to edge denoising?

MachineLearning,[D]Stuck in AI Hell: What to do in post LLM world,"
Hey Reddit,

I’ve been in an AI/ML role for a few years now, and I’m starting to feel disconnected from the work. When I started, deep learning models were getting good, and I quickly fell in love with designing architectures, training models, and fine-tuning them for specific use cases. Seeing a loss curve finally converge, experimenting with layers, and debugging training runs—it all felt like a craft, a blend of science and creativity. I enjoyed implementing research papers to see how things worked under the hood. Backprop, gradients, optimization—it was a mental workout I loved.

But these days, it feels like everything has shifted. LLMs dominate the scene, and instead of building and training models, the focus is on using pre-trained APIs, crafting prompt chains, and setting up integrations. Sure, there’s engineering involved, but it feels less like creating and more like assembling. I miss the hands-on nature of experimenting with architectures and solving math-heavy problems.

It’s not just the creativity I miss. The economics of this new era also feel strange to me. Back when I started, compute was a luxury. We had limited GPUs, and a lot of the work was about being resourceful—quantizing models, distilling them, removing layers, and squeezing every bit of performance out of constrained setups. Now, it feels like no one cares about cost. We’re paying by tokens. Tokens! Who would’ve thought we’d get to a point where we’re not designing efficient models but feeding pre-trained giants like they’re vending machines?

I get it—abstraction has always been part of the field. TensorFlow and PyTorch abstracted tensor operations, Python abstracts C. But deep learning still left room for creation. We weren’t just abstracting away math; we were solving it. We could experiment, fail, and tweak. Working with LLMs doesn’t feel the same. It’s like fitting pieces into a pre-defined puzzle instead of building the puzzle itself.

I understand that LLMs are here to stay. They’re incredible tools, and I respect their potential to revolutionize industries. Building real-world products with them is still challenging, requiring a deep understanding of engineering, prompt design, and integrating them effectively into workflows. By no means is it an “easy” task. But the work doesn’t give me the same thrill. It’s not about solving math or optimization problems—it’s about gluing together APIs, tweaking outputs, and wrestling with opaque systems. It’s like we’ve traded craftsmanship for convenience.

Which brings me to my questions:

1. Is there still room for those of us who enjoy the deep work of model design and training? Or is this the inevitable evolution of the field, where everything converges on pre-trained systems?


2. What use cases still need traditional ML expertise? Are there industries or problems that will always require specialized models instead of general-purpose LLMs?


3. Am I missing the bigger picture here? LLMs feel like the “kernel” of a new computing paradigm, and we don’t fully understand their second- and third-order effects. Could this shift lead to new, exciting opportunities I’m just not seeing yet?


4. How do you stay inspired when the focus shifts? I still love AI, but I miss the feeling of building something from scratch. Is this just a matter of adapting my mindset, or should I seek out niches where traditional ML still thrives?



I’m not asking this to rant (though clearly, I needed to get some of this off my chest). I want to figure out where to go next from here. If you’ve been in AI/ML long enough to see major shifts—like the move from feature engineering to deep learning—how did you navigate them? What advice would you give someone in my position?

And yeah, before anyone roasts me for using an LLM to structure this post (guilty!), I just wanted to get my thoughts out in a coherent way. Guess that’s a sign of where we’re headed, huh?

Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!

TL;DR: I entered AI during the deep learning boom, fell in love with designing and training models, and thrived on creativity, math, and optimization. Now it feels like the field is all about tweaking prompts and orchestrating APIs for pre-trained LLMs. I miss the thrill of crafting something unique. Is there still room for people who enjoy traditional ML, or is this just the inevitable evolution of the field? How do you stay inspired amidst such shifts?

Update: Wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone for your comments and suggestions. I really like some of those. This thing was on my mind for a long time, glad that I put it here.

MachineLearning,[D] How does OpenAI’s O1 outperform others in math despite limitations noted in recent papers?,"Recent research has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs often struggle with mathematical reasoning:

1. The GSM-Symbolic benchmark highlights that LLMs frequently fail when numerical values or question wording change, suggesting reliance on memorization rather than true mathematical understanding ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229.pdf)).
2. Logical reasoning studies, like the AIW problem, show inconsistent performance even for basic reasoning tasks ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02061.pdf)).

MachineLearning,[D] Encode over 100 million rows into embeddings ,"Hey everyone,

I'm working on a pipeline to encode over **100 million rows** into embeddings using **SentenceTransformers**, **PySpark**, and **Pandas UDF** on **Dataproc Serverless**.

Currently, it takes several hours to process everything. I only have one column containing sentences, each under 30 characters long. These are encoded into **64-dimensional vectors** using a custom model in a Docker image.

At the moment, the job has been running for over **12 hours** with **57 executors** (each with **24GB of memory and 4 cores**). I’ve partitioned the data into **2000 partitions**, hoping to speed up the process, but it's still slow.

Here’s the core part of my code:

    F.pandas_udf(returnType=ArrayType(FloatType()))
    def encode_pd(x: pd.Series) -&gt; pd.Series:
        try:
            model = load_model()
            return pd.Series(model.encode(x, batch_size=512).tolist())
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f""Error in encode_pd function: {str(e)}"")
            raise

The `load_model` function is as follows:

    def load_model() -&gt; SentenceTransformer:
        model = SentenceTransformer(
            ""custom_model"",

            truncate_dim=64
        )
        return model

I tried broadcasting the model, but I couldn't refer to it inside the Pandas UDF.

MachineLearning,[R] Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models - DeepMind,"Paper: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/papers/SchultzAdamek24Mastering/SchultzAdamek24Mastering.pdf

Abstract:

While large language models perform well on a range of complex tasks (e.g., text generation, question
answering, summarization), robust multi-step planning and reasoning remains a considerable challenge
for them. In this paper we show that search-based planning can significantly improve LLMs’ playing
strength across several board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex). We
introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external engine, and in internal search,
the model directly generates in-context a linearized tree of potential futures and a resulting final choice.
Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, capturing the transition and
value functions across these games. We find that our pre-training method minimizes hallucinations, as
our model is highly accurate regarding state prediction and legal moves. Additionally, both internal and
external search indeed improve win-rates against state-of-the-art bots, even reaching Grandmaster-level
performance in chess while operating on a similar move count search budget per decision as human
Grandmasters. The way we combine search with domain knowledge is not specific to board games,
suggesting direct extensions into more general language model inference and training techniques.",RobbinDeBank,1h7nshy,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h7nshy/r_mastering_board_games_by_external_and_internal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h7nshy/r_mastering_board_games_by_external_and_internal/,2024-12-05 23:58:37,9,0.86,9,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Research,self,t3_1h7nshy

   * For each image generation, provide at least 3 component images to be used in the final output.  A set of [component images](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BU6gu9Y1LkhSqRNhRVl82jqHmX9xq7J1_RiHNdlV91g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p13d4p443fpl) related to the [sample prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BU6gu9Y1LkhSqRNhRVl82jqHmX9xq7J1_RiHNdlV91g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mws7uwdbs4m) has been provided for your convenience.
   * Develop the model, and test its performance with your sample input prompts and component images.  Source code must be pushed to the main branch of the provided repo.
   * Provide the output images in ./static in the repo.
   * Document your findings and results
2. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   * **Image Quality**: The final image produced should incorporate all the features from your sample prompt, and component images.  Above all, the items in the component images need to be naturally incorporated into the final image.  They should not be significantly distorted, or look like they were copy and pasted from the input images.    
   * **Brand Element Incorporation**: Expanding upon the above point, the final image must accurately reflect the input component images.  So, if the input image is a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 40 in 18 kt yellow gold with a champagne colour, diamond-set dial, fluted bezel and a President bracelet, then the output image must incorporate that same product.
   * **Creative Flexibility**: Generate diverse variations of prompts, component images and output images.
   * **Customization**: Showcase how well your model responds to different parameters.
   * **Code Quality**: All aspects of code quality will be assessed. Examples include: repo structure, IaC, CI/CD, unit testing, performance, documentation, etc.
   * **Extensibility**: Your sample prompts, input images, and output images will be used to quickly screen for accuracy and limit submissions; however, importantly, your model will be tested against our internal prompts and input images to gauge how well it performs on different types of problems. 
3. **Deliverables**:
   * The repo structure is up to you, but the README should make it clear where your model, input images, output images and documentation reside.

MachineLearning,[R] ReVersion: Learning Relation Prompts from Images for Controlled Diffusion Generation,"ReVersion introduces a novel approach for learning and transferring visual relationships using diffusion models. Rather than focusing solely on object appearance, it learns how objects interact with each other through relation prompts and specialized sampling techniques.

Key technical aspects:
- Uses frozen pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model as foundation
- Implements relation-steering through contrastive learning to guide prompts toward relationship-rich latent spaces
- Employs relation-focal sampling to emphasize high-level interactions over low-level details
- Creates relation prompts that capture spatial and interactive relationships between objects
- Introduces new benchmark dataset for evaluating relation inversion methods

Results:
- Outperforms existing methods in preserving object relationships while allowing appearance flexibility
- Shows strong performance on spatial relationships like ""on top of"", ""next to"", ""inside""
- Successfully transfers learned relationships to novel object pairs
- Maintains relationship consistency across different styles and contexts

I think this approach could be particularly valuable for improving automated image generation systems that need to handle complex scenes with multiple interacting objects. The ability to learn and transfer relationships, rather than just appearances, could help bridge the gap between current image generation capabilities and human-like understanding of how objects interact in space.

I think the relation-focal sampling technique could also have applications beyond just relationship learning - it might be useful anywhere we need to emphasize high-level features over low-level details in diffusion models.

TLDR: New method learns visual relationships from images using diffusion models, introduces relation-steering and relation-focal techniques, shows strong results on spatial relationship preservation and transfer.

MachineLearning,[D] What approaches can we use to train an open vocabulary or image referential detector for configurable specificity?,"Open vocabulary object detectors allow you to pass in a prompt and an image and attempt to output bounding boxes around objects matching your prompt. Image referential detectors allow you to pass in an image of an object as the prompt and a target image and attempts to output bounding boxes around objects matching the image prompt in the target image.   
  
For a reference, [YOLOWorld](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World) provides both image referential and open vocabulary modes.  
  
The idea I've been toying with is whether there is a good way to train for greater control over specificity. For example, If I pass in an image of a golden retriever, am I looking for golden retrievers specifically? All dogs? All animals? 

Language is a bit more specific, but the same principle can apply. If I search for red cars, do red trucks count? Do maroon cars? In my experience, trying to be too specific textually with OVD models causes erratic behavior. IE, ""A red car or van but not truck "" would give bad performance, as it doesn't really match what would be in grounding captions.

My initial idea for how to systematically define the distance between potential targets and the query is via embedding distance. If I take a phrase grounding dataset, I could compute embeddings separately for each crop of a region and for its corresponding text using a model like CLIP.

A sample training process would be like this

* Select a random image. Select a random image crop embedding.
* Select a random similarity threshold.
* Do an approx KNN using that random image crop embedding, stopping once we reach a sample with an embedding above the similarity threshold. This is our prompt embedding If we selected an image region embedding, we are doing image referential detection. If we selected a text embedding, we are doing open vocabulary detection.
* Calculate prompt embedding similarity to all image crop embeddings in the primary image. Mark all objects with similarity above the threshold as positive examples.
* Run the network, using the selected image, prompt embedding, and similarity threshold as input. Use the previously calculated positives examples as labels.

  
Does anyone know of any papers that work with similar ideas, or have thoughts on whether this process would be useful or could be improved? I'm pretty early into looking into this, so just references or even field terms that would point me in the right direction would be helpful.

Other ideas 

* Always detect all objects given a target phrase, but set the label confidence equal to the embedding similarity. 
* Make the model capable of handling multiple input queries corresponding to the same object, to better indicate the intended domain. Possibly with both negative and positive queries. Not sure how to train yet, possibly sample clusters of similar embeddings from the dataset to build prompt sets.
* Perform instructional tuning, similar to what is done for some LLMs and VLMs, to make the model better handle complex text prompts, and allow instructional text prompts to be paired with images for image referential mode.

MachineLearning,[Discussion] Unsigned Integer Representation as Vectors with Focus on Extrapolation,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a regression task with a transformer-based architecture applied to grid-based structures. Think of something like mazes, where the goal is to predict the distance to a target. Each input token contains categorical features along with x/y coordinates. The idea is to train on small grids and generalize to larger ones.

Here’s my current approach for coordinate and token embeddings:

`x_emb = self.w_x.weight * x # shape: bs, sequence len, 1, d`  
`y_emb = self.w_y.weight * y # shape: bs, sequence len, 1, d`  
`cat_emb = self._categ(categ)`  
`sequence_emb = torch.cat((x_emb, y_emb, cat_emb), dim=-2) # shape: bs, sequence len, num_cat, d`  
`sequence_emb = sequence_emb.view(bs, seq_len, -1)`  
`transformer_inputs = self._linear(sequence_emb)`

In other words, the x/y coordinate embeddings are scaled learnable vectors. However, this approach only generalizes moderately well. I suspect that improving the coordinate representation is critical.

Unfortunately, this token-based structure is required for the task, so I need to focus on crafting a smart token representation. I’m deliberately avoiding subtracting embeddings to compute relative distances because a core objective is for the model to learn these distances on its own.

Here are some things I’ve tried so far:

Things I also tried:

* Positional encoding instead of scaled vectors
* log-scaled vectors
* exp-scaled vectors

Does anyone know of interesting work or techniques for numerical representations in this kind of context? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

In case you find interesting papers about extrapolation in transformers based on size and tokens, I am happy to take any inspiration.",mbus123,1h769cs,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h769cs/discussion_unsigned_integer_representation_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h769cs/discussion_unsigned_integer_representation_as/,2024-12-05 10:33:19,4,0.67,4,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h769cs
MachineLearning,[R] ICLERB: A better way to evaluate embeddings and rerankers for in-context learning,"Current benchmarks for embeddings, like MTEB and BEIR, include multiple datasets and tasks, but are fundamentally based on relevance annotations like text similarity. These are great for choosing the best embeddings for most search/retrieval use cases. These days, many people use these embeddings to retrieve items for in-context learning (e.g. document RAG or few-shot learning), to adapt an LLM to a specific task. Yet, they are still using MTEB to pick the best embeddings, even though the performance on that benchmark doesn't necessarily translate to better performance on their downstream LLM task (MTEB came out in 2021 after all).

In our latest paper, we propose a new evaluation framework and benchmark called ICLERB. This benchmark challenges the conventional approach by using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a relevance metric to reflect the actual utility of embeddings and rerankers when used with LLMs for in-context learning.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18947](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18947)

Key Highlights:

\- Embeddings outperform rerankers: We found that simpler embedding models outperformed their higher-capacity reranker counterparts from Cohere, NVIDIA, and VoyageAI.

\- Size isn't everything: Among the three Snowflake embeddings, the smallest model (33M parameters) outperformed the larger ones (109M and 334M).

\- Rethinking training and evaluation objectives: These findings suggest that training and evaluating larger retrieval models solely on text similarity may be counterproductive.

Interestingly, the performance of some models, like BGE, is very sensitive to the dataset or the LLM used, while others like NV are more stable. We're planning to continue adding more datasets and LLMs to the benchmark to broaden its scope.

Curious to hear your thoughts and feedback as we work on improving ICLERB!

MachineLearning,[D] Daily Paper Discussions - FlashAttention 3,"As a part of daily paper discussions on the Yannic Kilcher discord server, I will be volunteering to lead the analysis of FlashAttention-3 🧮 🔍

📜 **FlashAttention-3: Fast and Accurate Attention with Asynchrony and Low-precision**  
🌐 [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08608](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08608)  
🕰 Thursday, Dec 5th, 2024 01:30 AM UTC // Thursday, Dec 5th, 2024 7.00 AM IST // Wednesday, Dec 4th, 2024 5:30 PM PT

**FlashAttention-3** introduces three smart ideas to boost performance on the Hopper GPUs -

1️⃣ Producer-Consumer Asynchrony: This technique divides tasks into separate parts. As an example, if we have 2 warpgroups (labeled 1 and 2 – each warpgroup is a group of 4 warps), we can use synchronization barriers (bar.sync) so that warpgroup 1 first does its GEMMs (e.g., GEMM1 of one iteration and GEMM0 of the next iteration), and then warpgroup 2 does its GEMMs while warpgroup 1 does its softmax, and so on. By doing this, it makes better use of GPU resources and hides delays that would otherwise slow down performance.

2️⃣ Hiding Softmax Operations: FlashAttention-3 improves efficiency by overlapping the slower softmax calculations with the faster matrix multiplications (GEMM). Instead of waiting for Softmax to finish before starting the next calculations, it processes them in parallel, speeding up the overall process.

3️⃣ Hardware-Accelerated Low-Precision Computations: This approach uses advanced GPU features to perform calculations with lower precision (FP8), which are faster and use less memory. FlashAttention-3 tweaks its algorithms to handle these low-precision calculations effectively, nearly doubling the processing speed while maintaining accuracy.

MachineLearning,[D] Advice for a new Machine Learning Tutor: what projects will get my students hired?,"I've just started giving lessons as a machine learning tutor. I have a masters degree in computer science and two years professional experience. But I've never been a tutor (atleast not in this field). Today I was giving my first lesson on ML, just a powerpoint on the basics when my student stopped and told me the powerpoint was too basic for her.

She wanted to talk more about projects that she could do that would attract employers and get an internship. And she asked me point blank what kind of projects she should make. To be honest I wasn't entirely sure, what flashed in my head were things like training a model to recognize the MNIST digits or other simple projects suitable for a (relative) novice. But would those really help her get an internship? I doubted myself so I turned it around on her and asked her what kinds of things related to machine learning she is passionate about and would motivate her to work hard? She responded that she could do anything related to machine learning and she just wants to do what would make her money and get her recognized by a company.

So basically I felt like I failed as a tutor for not having a good answer, and I would like to have an answer prepared if this happens again. What do you all think? What are some projects that a novice, or not so novice students can take on that will make them more hireable for jobs and internships?

And while we're at it, what kinds of things do you think I should be preparing to be a better tutor in general. What kinds of things would you want your machine learning tutor to prepare for you?

MachineLearning,[D] Do lots of metadata really help in semantic search?,"I'm on my second week in learning AI and I was thinking of preprocessing biography data by including lots of metadata like city, date of birth, key events, education, hobbies, etc, and then generating embeddings and adding them together into a vector database. Perhaps by using NLP API or LLM. But is it necessary? Or should I just use OpenAI model to dynamically extract this metadata from the bios prior to storing them? Will having lots of metadata dramatically help to improve the quality of the search results?

I thought maybe the semi-automatic preprocessing step would allow me to check and clean the metadata.

MachineLearning,[R] The Multimodal Universe: Enabling Large-Scale Machine Learning with 100TB of Astronomical Scientific Data,"https://openreview.net/forum?id=EWm9zR5Qy1#discussion

Abstract: We present the Multimodal Universe, a large-scale multimodal dataset of scientific astronomical data, compiled specifically to facilitate machine learning research. Overall, our dataset contains hundreds of millions of astronomical observations, constituting 100TB of multi-channel and hyper-spectral images, spectra, multivariate time series, as well as a wide variety of associated scientific measurements and metadata. In addition, we include a range of benchmark tasks representative of standard practices for machine learning methods in astrophysics. This massive dataset will enable the development of large multi-modal models specifically targeted towards scientific applications. All codes used to compile the dataset, and a description of how to access the data is available at https://github.com/MultimodalUniverse/MultimodalUniverse

MachineLearning,[D] Packaging a Pytorch model to an exe. What is the best method?,"I have Pytorch models that are designed to run locally, both training and inference on a local machine.

The GUI is being created using another language, and the plan is to package all the Python aspects into an executable and run it via the Python equivalent of subprocess (and Pipe very basic data between the two). I will be running cross platform on both Windows and Mac

There are multiple auxiliary scripts which read in data, and process it (data extraction + feature engineering). While I have extensively used vectorised functions, I have used a cythonized approach for some code, and I am compiling the underlying scripts using Cython(so pretty much everything is a compiled binary, except an entry point, say, main.py).

My ancillary libraries are the usual suspects, Pandas, Numpy (1.x), SciKit learn.

My question is this, what is the most reliable packaging approach at the moment? I know that both PyInstaller and cx\_freeze are options that I have used before. My preference is PyInstaller, but previously I encountered issues with it (and Pytorch).

Has anyone completed a similar project recently, and do you have any advice?

nb. I've checked the old posts, there are a few on this topic. However, there have been a number of changes to Pytorch, particularly with some of the runtime compiled elements (which can be a nightmare on Mac with its notarisation process) - and I know Pyinstaller has a very active user base.

MachineLearning,[R] Forecasting and Mitigating Security Threats from Malicious AI Applications,"This paper provides a systematic analysis of potential malicious applications of AI systems across digital, physical and political security domains. The methodology involves:

- Surveying dual-use AI capabilities that could enable attacks
- Mapping specific attack vectors and required technical capabilities  
- Analyzing the evolution of attacker/defender dynamics
- Developing a framework for threat assessment and mitigation

Key technical findings:

- ML advances in areas like NLP and computer vision lower barriers to sophisticated attacks
- Automated systems can significantly scale up traditional attack vectors
- Transfer learning and GANs enable rapid adaptation of attack techniques
- Technical countermeasures alone are insufficient - policy/governance frameworks needed

The researchers provide a detailed assessment framework examining:

- Technical requirements for different attack types
- Estimated timeline for capability development
- Difficulty of execution and potential impact
- Proposed defensive measures and their limitations

I think this work is important for helping the ML community get ahead of security risks before they materialize. The framework provides a structured way to evaluate emerging threats, though I expect the specific attack vectors will evolve significantly as capabilities advance.

I think we need much more research on measuring the effectiveness of proposed countermeasures and understanding the co-evolution of offensive/defensive capabilities. The policy recommendations are a good start but will require ongoing refinement.

TLDR: Systematic analysis of how ML advances could enable new attack vectors across security domains. Provides framework for assessing and mitigating threats through both technical and policy measures.

MachineLearning,[N] Hugging Face CEO has concerns about Chinese open source AI models,"Hugging Face CEO stated that open source models becoming SOTA is bad if it just so happens to be created by Chinese nationals.

It doesn't impact my experience w/ model).

The CEO thought censorship of open source models is best stating that if a country like China ""becomes by far the strongest on AI, they will be capable of spreading certain cultural aspects that perhaps the Western world wouldn’t want to see spread.” That is, he believes people shouldn't spread ideas around the world that are not ""western"" in origin. As someone born and raise in U.S. I honest to god have no clue what he means by ideas ""the Western world wouldn't want to see spread"" as I'm ""western"" and don't champion blanket censorship.

MachineLearning,[D] Linear Regression but with Binary Output for wide range predictions with better precision,"A neural network tends to find it difficult to predict data that ranges between very large and small numbers on the output. My application requires the NN to predict between -1000 and 1000 ∈ Z. I could make this possible by scaling up the output by 1000 hence allowing the model to predict between -1 and 1, but a loss between 2e-2 (prediction) and 3e-2 (target) with L1Loss (worse case L2Loss) would be negligible (1e-2 in this case, 1e-4 in the worse case). It is imperative for the model to be very precise with the predictions, when the target is 5e-2 it should be so and not even at least deviating by +-0.1e-2. This precision is very difficult to achieve when it comes to linear regression, so i thought of a more systematic approach to defining the prediction and criterion. Again, i wanted the model to predict between -1000 and 1000. These numbers can be represented using a minimum of 11 bits (binary), so i redesigned the model output to contain 22 neurons, arranged as ∈ R (11x2) 11 outputs with two classes, the classes being a binary representation of 1 or 0. CrossEntropy could be used as a criterion here but im using multimarginloss instead for specific reasons. Otherwise a different approach could be a sigmoided output of 11 neurons to represent the binary number. Whats you guys' take on this? Is this considered good (if not better) practice? Is there any research similar to this that i can look into?

MachineLearning,[D] The popular theoretical explanation for VAE is inconsistent. Please change my mind.,"I had a really hard time understanding VAE / variational inference (VI) in theory, for years. I'd be really appreciated if anyone could clarify my confusions. Here's what I've got after reading many sources:

1. We want to establish a generative model p(x, z) (parameters are omitted for simplicity) for the observable variable x and the latent variable z. Alright, let's select appropriate parameters to maximize the marginal likelihood of the observed samples p(x).
2. According to basic probability theory (the law of total probability and the definition of conditional probability), we have: p(x)=∫ p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz (Eq. 1).
3. Here's the point that things becomes rather confusing: people now will claim that this integral is ***intractable*** because z is a continuous variable / z is a high-dimensional variable / p(x∣z) is too complex / or any other excuses.
4. What to do for the intractability of Eq. 1? Although we didn't mention the posterior p(z ∣ x) above, we will now bring it into the discussion. The posterior p(z ∣ x) is also intractable since p(z | x) = p(x | z) p(z) / p(x) and p(x) is intractable. So we will introduce another parameterized model q(z ∣ x) to approximate p(z | x).
5. After some derivation, we obtain a new optimization objective, commonly known as ELBO, which is the summation of:
    - the ""reconstruction"" term: ∫ log p(x ∣ z) q(z ∣ x) dz (Eq. 2);
    - KL divergence term between q(z | x) and p(z), which results in a closed-form.
6. So now we have to work on Eq. 2. Compared with Eq. 1, p(z) is replaced with q(z∣x), both of them are (usually) normal distributions, and p(x | z) is still there. Great! Clearly we have transformed an intractable integral into… another intractable integral?
7. Don’t worry, we can compute Eq. 2 using Monte Carlo sampling… Wait, since we can use Monte Carlo for this, why can’t we just handle Eq. 1 the same way without so much fuss?
8. Of course it is not a good idea. It can be shown that log p(x) = ELBO + D_KL(q(z ∣ x) || p(z ∣ x)). So we cannot estimate p(x) with Eq. 1 as it does not have such nice properties… Huh, it seems like that’s not how we started explaining this?

Questions:

1. When tackling the original problem, i.e., modeling p(x, z) by maximizing p(x)=∫ p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz, why do we want to involve the posterior p(z | x)?
    - Someone explains this with [""to narrow down the value space to facilitate faster search""](https://web.archive.org/web/20241202042731/https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae) (with the approximation of p(z | x), q(z | x)). But again, please recall how the intractability of Eq. 1 is explained, I can't see anything improved under this argument.
2. The Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 are essentially similar, where either of them is the expectation of (log) p(z | x) with respect to the probability density function of some normal distribution. I can't see how the motivation based on the intractability of Eq. 1 could make sense.
    - Ironically, we still have to resort to Monte Carlo sampling when handling Eq. 2. But people appear to forget it when talking about the intractability of Eq. 1, but remember it when facing the same problem of Eq. 2.

Update: I have editted some typo.

Update 2: Question 2 seems to be resolved after some discussions: 
- It is not a good idea to sample on p(z) due to the high variance.
- In practice, we are usually working on log p(x), the log-likelihood of samples, and MC sampling for log ∫ p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz (Eq. 3) can be biased. 
- Apply Jensen's inequality on Eq. 3 and we will have log p(x) ≥ ∫ log p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz. This bound is very likely worse than ELBO, and still relying on sampling on p(z).

However, these points are still rarely found in existing articles. I hope we may think more carefully when introducing VAE in the future.",function2,1h5f6co,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5f6co/d_the_popular_theoretical_explanation_for_vae_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5f6co/d_the_popular_theoretical_explanation_for_vae_is/,2024-12-03 04:25:19,142,0.94,142,0,67,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5f6co
MachineLearning,[R] Enhancing LLM Reasoning Through Bidirectional Forward-Backward Thinking,"The key contribution here is a ""reverse thinking"" method that improves LLM reasoning without any model modifications. Instead of only reasoning forward from the question to an answer, the approach adds a backward verification step - working from potential answers back to the question to validate the reasoning chain.

Key technical points:
* Two-stage process: forward generation followed by backward verification
* Backward pass examines logical consistency between answer and premises
* No fine-tuning or architectural changes needed
* Tested across multiple reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, LogiQA)

Results:
* 8.3% improvement on GSM8K math reasoning
* 6.2% gain on CommonsenseQA 
* 5.4% increase on LogiQA
* Consistent improvements across different model sizes
* Performance gains come at cost of 2x inference time

I think this method points to untapped potential in how we prompt LLMs for reasoning tasks. While the doubled inference time is a real tradeoff, the consistent improvements across different benchmarks suggest this approach captures something fundamental about machine reasoning. The simplicity of implementation means it could be quickly adopted in many applications where reasoning accuracy matters more than speed.

TLDR: Adding a backward reasoning verification step improves LLM performance on math, logic and common sense tasks by 5-8%, with no model changes required. Doubles inference time but provides consistent gains across different models and tasks.

MachineLearning,[R] Simplified RNNs Achieve Transformer-Like Performance with Parallel Training and Reduced Parameters,"This paper systematically examines whether RNNs might have been sufficient for many NLP tasks that are now dominated by transformers. The researchers conduct controlled experiments comparing RNNs and transformers while keeping model size, training data, and other variables constant.

Key technical points:
- Tested both architectures on language modeling and seq2seq tasks using matched parameters (70M-1.5B)
- Introduced ""RNN with Parallel Generation"" (RPG) allowing RNNs to generate tokens in parallel like transformers
- Evaluated on standard benchmarks including WikiText-103 and WMT14 En-De translation
- Analyzed representation capacity through probing tasks and attention pattern analysis

Main results:
- RNNs matched or outperformed similarly-sized transformers on WikiText-103 language modeling
- Transformers showed 1-2 BLEU score advantage on translation tasks
- RPG achieved 95% of transformer generation speed with minimal accuracy loss
- RNNs showed stronger local context modeling while transformers excelled at long-range dependencies

I think this work raises important questions about architecture choice in modern NLP. While transformers have become the default, RNNs may still be viable for many applications, especially those focused on local context. The parallel generation technique could make RNNs more practical for production deployment.

I think the results suggest we should reconsider RNNs for specific use cases rather than assuming transformers are always optimal. The computational efficiency of RNNs could be particularly valuable for resource-constrained applications.

TLDR: Comprehensive comparison shows RNNs can match transformers on some NLP tasks when controlling for model size and training. Introduces parallel generation technique for RNNs. Results suggest architecture choice should depend on specific application needs.

MachineLearning,[D] Training a VAE. Single epoch with infinite data or smaller subset over multiple epochs?,"Hello! I'm training a VAE for image models and I finally am getting some pretty decent results in training after correcting my loss function adding KL annealing and LPIPS loss and adjusting my learning rate and batch size, but now I have a doubt about the data i'm feeding to my VAE.

I have a limited time budget for the training and I have more data available than I can feed within that time budget for training.  
What is the best course of action here?  
Should I just run all the data through my VAE training until I run to the end of my training time in one single giant epoch or should I select a subset of the data small enough so that I can go through it multiple times during training and run this smaller dataset over multiple epoch?

My instinct tells me that different data is better for generalization, but VAEs also try to be resilient to variations of the representation of the same image. Because during the encoding phase we use the latent generated to sample from a random distribution (causing a different representation to be passed to the decoder) it feels like potentially feeding back the same data multiple data might actually beneficial to learn resiliency there ...

Is this actually not a thing? I'm actually overthinking about the potential impact of the multiple epochs on VAE training? Is one single giant epoch the best?

MachineLearning,[D] Benchmarks for RL algorithms across Gymnasium environments?,"Hey r/ML!

Let me preface this by saying I'm fairly new to RL. My previous work was with LLMs, where it is very common to rank and stack your model against the universe of models based on how it performs on a given benchmarks (but you already know this).

Recently started training models in MuJoCo environments and I'm trying to figure out if my algorithms are performing somewhat decently. Sure, I can get Ant-v5 to walk using SB3's default PPO and MlpPolicy, but how good is it really?

Is there some benchmark or repo where I can compare my results against the learning curve of other people's algorithms using the default MuJoCo (or any of the other gyms') reward functions? Of course the assumption would be that we are using the same environment and reward function, but given Gymnasium is popular and offers good defaults, I'd imagine there should be a lot of data available.

I've googled around and have only found sparse results. Is there a reason why benchmarks are not as big in RL as they are with LLMs?",geepytee,1h5a9s8,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5a9s8/d_benchmarks_for_rl_algorithms_across_gymnasium/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5a9s8/d_benchmarks_for_rl_algorithms_across_gymnasium/,2024-12-03 00:18:26,7,0.9,7,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5a9s8

MachineLearning,[R] ImageFolder🚀: Autoregressive Image Generation with Folded Tokens,"https://preview.redd.it/2olpl72q6i4e1.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54d91736543906b6a71102a09dc04883033d795

&gt;Image tokenizers are crucial for visual generative models, e.g., diffusion models (DMs) and autoregressive (AR) models, as they construct the latent representation for modeling. Increasing token length is a common approach to improve the image reconstruction quality. However, tokenizers with longer token lengths are not guaranteed to achieve better generation quality. There exists a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality regarding token length. In this paper, we investigate the impact of token length on both image reconstruction and generation and provide a flexible solution to the tradeoff. We propose ImageFolder, a semantic tokenizer that provides spatially aligned image tokens that can be folded during autoregressive modeling to improve both generation efficiency and quality. To enhance the representative capability without increasing token length, we leverage dual-branch product quantization to capture different contexts of images. Specifically, semantic regularization is introduced in one branch to encourage compacted semantic information while another branch is designed to capture the remaining pixel-level details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of image generation and shorter token length with ImageFolder tokenizer.

MachineLearning,[R] RuleOpt v.1.1: Optimization-Based Rule Learning for Classification,"**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10751)

**Package:** [https://github.com/sametcopur/ruleopt](https://github.com/sametcopur/ruleopt)

**Documentation:** [https://ruleopt.readthedocs.io/](https://ruleopt.readthedocs.io/)

RuleOpt is an optimization-based rule learning algorithm designed for classification problems. Focusing on scalability and interpretability, RuleOpt utilizes linear programming for rule generation and extraction.

The Python library ruleopt is capable of extracting rules from ensemble models, and it also implements a novel rule generation scheme. The library ensures compatibility with existing machine learning pipelines, and it is especially efficient for tackling large-scale problems.

Here are a few highlights of ruleopt:

* **Efficient Rule Generation and Extraction**: Leverages linear programming for scalable rule generation (stand-alone machine learning method) and rule extraction from trained random forest and boosting models.
* **Interpretability**: Prioritizes model transparency by assigning costs to rules in order to achieve a desirable balance with accuracy.
* **Integration with Machine Learning Libraries**: Facilitates smooth integration with well-known Python libraries scikit-learn, LightGBM, and XGBoost, and existing machine learning pipelines.
* **Extensive Solver Support**: Supports a wide array of solvers, including *Gurobi*, *CPLEX* and *OR-Tools*.

  
With the latest version update, RuleOpt is now fast even with the free solver OR-Tools, even on large datasets! In the graph below, you can see how the new version performs in terms of runtime compared to the previous version.

MachineLearning,[D] Handle varying output dimension in Graph Neural Networks?,"I have a question about handling varying output dimensions in **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** during training. I'm working with **a combined graph** (merging task and compute graphs), where the structure resembles the task graph, but with compute node information integrated into the features. Since both the task graph and compute graph (nodes count) can vary, I'm using a feedforward layer to transform the node and edge features into a fixed hyperparameter embedding dimension.

MachineLearning,[P] Promptwright - Open source project to generate large synthetic datasets using an LLM (local or hosted),"Hey r/machinelearning,

[Promptwright](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/promptwright), a free to use *open source* tool designed to easily generate synthetic datasets using either local large language models or one of the many hosted models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini etc)

Key Features:

\* Multiple LLM Providers Support: Works with most LLM service providers and LocalLLM's via Ollama, VLLM etc

\* Configurable Instructions and Prompts: Define custom instructions and system prompts in YAML, over scripts as before.

\* Command Line Interface: Run generation tasks directly from the command line

\* Push to Hugging Face: Push the generated dataset to Hugging Face Hub with automatic dataset cards and tags

Here is an example dataset created with promptwright on this latest release:

I'm trying to implement deepAr for various stores to predict futures sales (each store with ~10k SKU of different products). Due to sheer size of the SKU I wouldn't be able to just do only single training for all the data at once. I'm thinking to train it by store.

2. How to deal with unseen SKUs which are not present in the data?

MachineLearning,[R] Sources: Reasons why KG outperformes RD in Retrievers?,"Are there any sources discussing WHY Retriever work better with KG in contrast to RD? I find it super intuitive to say its better because in knowledge graphs we have more semantic structure and relations are discovered effeciently. In my mind its ""of course the graph is richer/more dense"" but when collaborated on a paper, it struck me that I wasnt able to justify that claim. I found no source whatsoever that actually explained why that might be the case.

The only source i got was this one:  
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07509)

So all we we're able to say was ""We justify our decision because KG works better then RD \[source to benchmark paper\]""

I would have loved to discuss why exactly KG are better suited and give arguments about information density, semantic strutuce or the better selection of related entities.

MachineLearning,[D] Seeking Advice on Machine Learning Models for Generating Seamless 360° Images,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a project that involves creating 360° images, and I’m running into some challenges. The goal is to generate seamless 360° panoramas without visible edges or artifacts where the image wraps around.

I’m wondering if there are any machine learning models, techniques, or tools that are particularly well-suited for this task. Specifically, I’m looking for something that can:

* Ensure continuity at the edges of the 360° image.
* Handle different textures and patterns without noticeable distortions.
* Be trained or fine-tuned on my custom dataset (if needed).

I’ve explored GANs like StyleGAN and diffusion models, but I’m not sure if they can handle the edge continuity issue out of the box. Has anyone worked on a similar problem or knows of a good starting point?

Since I'll be deploying the model in C++, there is no time to port and evaluate them all.

I tested YOLOv5/v5Lite/8/10 previously, and YOLOv5n was the fastest.

Unfortunately, the hardware for my current project is significantly less powerful, and meanwhile processing time must be less than 20ms.

However, I am struggling to find resources with similar level of detail for modern approaches—such as flow matching/rectified flows, how the different ODE solvers for sampling work, etc. There are some, but everything that I have found is either quite outdated (like from 2023 or so) or very superficial—like for non-technical or scientific audiences.

Therefore, I am wondering: has anyone encountered a good compendium of theoretical eplanations beyond the basic diffusion model (besides the original papers)? The goal is to let my team deep dive into the actual papers should they desire, but giving 70% of what those deliver in one or more decent compilations.

I really believe that SEO is making any search a living nightmare nowadays. Either that or my googling skills are tanking for some reason.

MachineLearning,"""[P]""Static variable and dynamic variable tables in RFM ","



I am creating a prediction model using random forest. But I don't understand how the model and script would consider both tables loaded in as dataframes.


What's the best way to use multiple tables with a Random Forest model when one table has static attributes (like food characteristics) and the other has dynamic factors (like daily health habits)?

Example:
I want to predict stomach aches based on both the food I eat (unchanging) and daily factors (sleep, water intake).

Tables:
 * Static: Food name, calories, meat (yes/no)
 * Dynamic: Day number, good sleep (yes/no), drank water (yes/no)


How to combine these tables in a Random Forest model? Should they be merged on a unique identifier like ""Day number""?

MachineLearning,[R] Recursive Methods for interpolation between vector fields ( Known and Unknown),"Hello everyone Does anything of the next makes sense?  
I Have been posting on Learning first ( also on math and number theory ) , but I think is a bit more math theory than ML but it does have to do with how the data is interpolated so I am unsure. 

( I hope I am not breaking rule 5 with my links ) 

this will be the interpolation of the data ( Via organized vector field levels )  before the generative process starts, but because its recursive, the generative process can happen on inside the iteration too 

its there a model I can use ? And if someone understand the math, can I get some papers or things I could follow or just is learning and reading now?

I am a little lost and need some help ( I organized my question with chatGPT to make it understandable so bare in mind if there is some odd work here and there, I am on the I am going a bit mental stage )

I think this is dealing with machine learning problems that have been solved between interpolation of point could on space that have recursive data ( mapping and data organization )

I've been developing a concept that merges artistic visualization with advanced mathematical interpolation techniques inspired by the Mandelbrot set. Coming from a creative background, I've ventured into creating what I believe could be a **recursive Mandelbrot predictive method**  for manipulating vector fields. I'm eager to understand if this approach already exists and to gather resources or similar algorithms to explore further and test my ideas.

I will add some things like this latter to test segmentation models for the recursiveness [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1h0ypc2/linear\_algebra\_project\_i\_implemented\_a\_kmeans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1h0ypc2/linear_algebra_project_i_implemented_a_kmeans/)

# The Concept

Imagine a system where the interpolation between data points isn't limited to traditional methods like **lerp** (linear interpolation) or **slerp** (spherical linear interpolation). Instead, it employs a **pseudo vector field Mandelbrot slerp**, allowing vectors to be guided from a base state (reality) to a target state (altered time) within a Mandelbrot-inspired vector field. This method is recursive, meaning multiple layers of calculations are applied to refine the interpolation continuously.

# Key Components:

1. **Reality (Ground Truth):** Represents the current state of the system, serving as the foundational dataset.
2. **Agents of Change (Vectors of Closest Influence):** These act as pull forces influencing the direction and magnitude of interpolation.
3. **State (Ground Truth Prediction Model):** Utilizes the current data to predict future states based on the influences of the agents.
4. **Altered Time (Goal):** The desired target state, akin to a Mandelbrot-type location on the outer range of the vector field.

# Interpolation Method

The interpolation technique extends beyond simple linear methods by incorporating the complexity and fractal nature of the Mandelbrot set. Here's how it functions:

* **Guided Vectors:** Vectors transition from reality towards altered time, following paths influenced by a Mandelbrot-like vector field.
* **Recursive Layers:** Multiple layers of interpolation allow for increasingly refined calculations, enhancing accuracy and adaptability.
* **Dynamic Intensity:** The closer the interpolation is to reality, the more intense and detailed the calculations become, while the vector field simplifies as it moves towards altered time.

# Theoretical Foundation

The core idea revolves around mapping and adjusting Mandelbrot-inspired vectors to facilitate interpolation between recursively organized data banks. This approach aims to:

* **Capture Complex Patterns:** Leverage the self-similar, fractal nature of Mandelbrot sets to identify and utilize intricate patterns within the data.
* **Enhance Predictive Capability:** Recursive calculations allow for continual refinement of projections, improving predictive accuracy over time.
* **Achieve Real-Time Adaptability:** Dynamically adjust vectors to align with specific goals, similar to how a car's performance might be modulated in real-time to achieve optimal racing outcomes.

# Visual Analogy

Think of this system as calculating the ""ghost"" position of a car in a racing game like *Need for Speed*:

* **Acceleration and Braking:** Based on historical and current data, determining when to accelerate or brake to achieve the best performance.
* **Engine Adjustments:** Modifying the system's parameters in real-time to align with the target state, ensuring the system reaches its goal efficiently.
* **Dynamic Modulation:** Continuously adjusting these actions to meet the desired ""goal time,"" always operating within physical (mathematical) constraints.

# Questions for the Community

1. **Does This Technology Exist?** Is my approach accurately described as a **recursive Mandelbrot predictive method** for vector field interpolation? Are there existing models or research that align closely with this concept?
2. **Resources and References:** If similar technologies or algorithms exist, could you recommend any resources, papers, or specific Mandelbrot-like algorithms that I can study or begin testing with?
3. **Mathematical Validation:** Given that my approach stems from an artistic visualization perspective, what mathematical frameworks or theories should I explore to formalize and validate this method?

MachineLearning,[D] Why aren't Stella embeddings more widely used despite topping the MTEB leaderboard?,"https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard

I've been looking at embedding models and noticed something interesting: Stella embeddings are crushing it on the MTEB leaderboard, outperforming OpenAI's models while being way smaller (1.5B/400M params) and apache 2.0. Makes hosting them relatively cheap.

For reference, Stella-400M scores 70.11 on MTEB vs OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large 64.59. The 1.5B version scores even higher at 71.19

Yet I rarely see them mentioned in production use cases or discussions. Has anyone here used Stella embeddings in production? What's been your experience with performance, inference speed, and reliability compared to OpenAI's offerings?

MachineLearning,[R] BitNet a4.8: 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs,"**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04965](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04965)

**Abstract:**

&gt;Recent research on the 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet b1.58, presents a promising direction for reducing the inference cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

MachineLearning,[R] Fast Matrix-Based Counterfactual Regret Minimization Using GPU Parallelization,"A novel GPU implementation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) that accelerates the computation of optimal strategies in extensive-form games. The core innovation is parallelizing the regret updates and strategy computations across GPU cores while carefully managing memory access patterns.

Key technical points:
- Custom memory layout that maps game states and actions to GPU threads
- Batch processing of information sets to maximize GPU utilization
- Parallel computation of counterfactual values and regret updates
- Multi-GPU scaling through game tree partitioning
- Evaluated on Leduc Hold'em and Limit Texas Hold'em poker variants

Results:
- Up to 30x speedup compared to CPU implementation
- Linear scaling with number of GPUs up to 8 devices
- Memory usage scales with game size and number of information sets
- Solution quality matches CPU baseline within statistical error
- Successfully solved games with up to 10^14 states

I think this work could make CFR much more practical for real-world applications beyond poker. The ability to solve larger games faster opens up possibilities in areas like automated negotiation, security games, and resource allocation. The multi-GPU scaling is particularly interesting as it suggests potential for solving even more complex games.

The memory optimization techniques developed here might also transfer well to other game-theoretic algorithms that need to process large state spaces efficiently.

TLDR: GPU-accelerated CFR implementation achieves 30x speedup through careful parallelization and memory management, with linear multi-GPU scaling. Makes solving large extensive-form games significantly more tractable.

MachineLearning,[D]Is Freelancing as a Data Scientist Even Possible?,"Hi everyone,

I’m fine working for as low as $15/hour, so earnings aren’t a big concern for me. I’ve gone through past Reddit posts, but they mostly discuss freelancing from the perspective of income. My main concern is whether freelancing in data science is practical for someone like me, given its unique challenges.

A bit about my background: I’ve completed 3-4 real-world data science projects, not on toy datasets, but actual data (involving data scraping, cleaning, visualization, modeling, deployment, and documentation). I’ve also worked as an intern in the NLP domain.

Some issues I’ve been thinking about:

1. Domain Knowledge and Context: How hard is it to deliver results without deep understanding of a client’s business?


2. Resource Limitations: Do freelancers struggle with accessing data, computing power, or other tools required for advanced projects?


3. Collaboration Needs: Data science often requires working with teams. Can freelancers integrate effectively with cross-functional groups?


4. Iterative and Long-Term Nature: Many projects require ongoing updates and monitoring. Is this feasible for freelancers?


5. Trust and Accountability: How do freelancers convince clients to trust them with sensitive or business-critical work?


6. Client Expectations: Do clients expect too much for too little, especially at low wages?



I’m also open to any tips, advice, or additional concerns beyond these points. Are these challenges solvable for a new data science freelancer? Have any of you faced and overcome similar issues? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

MachineLearning,[D] Advanced methods of data management,"Hello everyone, right now I'm involved in a project which is basically (audio)LLM fine-tuning, and we're having problems related to data management. 

Since there isn't that many sets in that area, we're using different augmentation schemas. tl;dr, we have different datasets of various nature, and using some schemas we can convert usual ASR-type datasets to QA, generate refusal data, combine questions etc. 

Problem is, it's hard to control ratios of different data, and right now it's mostly a manual labour. We kinda have to manually adjust the amount of data we're generating. Which is rather annoying and hard process; we have many target datasets, you have to remember how much samples you've generated and try to get some adequate mix for train.

Right now, we use airflow for data filtering (lots of raw data is badly labelled), but I'm not really sure that I understand how to connect that tool to data generation, and if it's a good tool for that purpose. I was thinking about writing some snakemake script, but ideally the final solution should be flexible when we change configs, add new sets etc, and that's not what I associate with snakemake. Also, another question is visualization. 

So, I'm asking what kind of tools/libs I can use to tackle this task, is there anything that can fit our purposes, or it's time to write customs scripts? What do companies like meta use for their enormous 15t tokens set, surely they don't dump everything in one place? 

There's another question related to connecting datasets with data pipeline of training (it's complicated, there are additional steps of precalculation of feats and creating webdataset which is used in training), but for now I'd be really glad if anyone helped with just data management tools.

* Qdrant container running on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an ability to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and mac os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problems:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the models (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

MachineLearning,[D] Which LLM models can I run on an NVIDIA 4060 for research purposes? Recommendations needed!,"Hi everyone,

I’m diving into research on large language models (LLMs) and looking to experiment with running them locally on my NVIDIA 4060 GPU. While I know the 4060 isn’t a high-end card compared to some research setups, I’m optimistic about making the most out of what it offers. I’d greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations on:

1. **Models that can run efficiently** on a 4060. I’m aware that some smaller versions of LLMs might be more suited for this hardware, so any advice on what’s realistically possible without excessive optimization would be fantastic.
2. **Models suitable for fine-tuning or pre-training experiments.** Although I’m starting with basic experiments, I plan to explore fine-tuning in the future, so I’d love suggestions for models that are versatile and widely used in research.
3. **Open-source models** or ones that are easy to access and work with for research purposes. Licensing and transparency are important to me, as my work is focused on academic and experimental objectives.

So far, I’ve been looking at options like LLaMA, GPT-NeoX, and BLOOM, particularly their smaller variants, but I’m open to exploring other possibilities. If you’ve had experience running these or similar models on mid-range GPUs, I’d love to hear your thoughts on performance, setup, or any potential limitations I should be aware of.

Additionally, I’d be grateful for any advice on:

* **Optimizing models for a 4060.** Are there specific tools, techniques, or libraries (like bitsandbytes or FlashAttention) that could help with running or fine-tuning these models?
* **Preparing for fine-tuning.** What should I keep in mind when selecting a model to ensure it can support future fine-tuning experiments effectively?

New to ensembles.

If you ensemble MLR, you may end up with a non-linear equation however….

A) the residuals of the indicidual MLR that were ensembled need to meet parametric assumptions? Can’t use a crap MLR just because it’s going to be used in an ensemble?
B) if the ensembled MLR equation is linear then residuals should meet parametric assumptions?

MachineLearning,[R] Meissonic: High-Resolution Text-to-Image Generation via Enhanced Masked Image Modeling,"This work introduces a non-autoregressive masked image modeling (MIM) approach that aims to match SDXL-level image generation while avoiding the token inefficiencies of autoregressive methods. The key innovation is combining MIM with architectural improvements and sampling optimizations to enable high-resolution image synthesis.

Main technical points:
- Uses a transformer-based architecture with specialized self-attention and positional encoding
- Incorporates human preference scores as ""micro-conditions"" to guide generation
- Employs feature compression layers to handle high resolutions efficiently
- Generates 1024x1024 images through parallel token prediction rather than sequential
- Achieves comparable FID scores to SDXL while being more computationally efficient

Results:
- Image quality metrics competitive with SDXL on standard benchmarks
- Faster generation compared to autoregressive approaches
- Better handling of complex scenes and compositions
- Improved text alignment compared to previous MIM approaches

I think this could impact the field in several ways:
- Shows that non-diffusion approaches can achieve SOTA-level generation
- Provides a potential path toward unified language-vision models
- May lead to more efficient deployment of text-to-image systems
- Could influence architecture design for future multimodal models

The biggest open question in my view is whether this approach can scale further - while it works well at current resolutions, it's unclear if the same principles will hold at even higher dimensions.

TLDR: Non-autoregressive masked modeling approach matches SDXL-level image generation while being more efficient than typical autoregressive methods. Shows promise for unified language-vision architectures.

MachineLearning,[R] Black holes and the loss landscape in machine learning,"Abstract:

&gt;Understanding the loss landscape is an important problem in machine learning. One key feature of the loss function, common to many neural network architectures, is the presence of exponentially many low lying local minima. Physical systems with similar energy landscapes may provide useful insights. In this work, we point out that black holes naturally give rise to such landscapes, owing to the existence of black hole entropy. For definiteness, we consider 1/8 BPS black holes in =8 string theory. These provide an infinite family of potential landscapes arising in the microscopic descriptions of corresponding black holes. The counting of minima amounts to black hole microstate counting. Moreover, the exact numbers of the minima for these landscapes are a priori known from dualities in string theory. Some of the minima are connected by paths of low loss values, resembling mode connectivity. We estimate the number of runs needed to find all the solutions. Initial explorations suggest that Stochastic Gradient Descent can find a significant fraction of the minima.
