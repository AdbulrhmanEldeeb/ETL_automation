math,Is there any deep intuition behind inner products and orthogonal functions?,"
I’m studying measure theory in my masters year. I really love analysis and so far everything makes sense and is very easy to follow. I always like to construct my own proofs of theorems and I understand everything.. that is until I started studying orthogonal functions. 

I have 0 intuition as to why,what and when two functions are orthogonal. Saying that the integral of their multiplication should be 0 gives me 0 clue as to what this thing looks like. I did some reading about it and it related it back to the dot product of vectors, but I don’t have any intuition as to why thats true either (I can prove it algebraically and its straightforward, but the proof seems like a blind man feeling his way out of a dark room slowly). When I prove analysis based theorems, I can always see it in my head, then formulate it in terms of algebra. But when that “head image” is not there and all you have is blind algebra, it just sucks all the joy out of studying it.",sheraawwrr,1hfs9os,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfs9os/is_there_any_deep_intuition_behind_inner_products/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfs9os/is_there_any_deep_intuition_behind_inner_products/,2024-12-16 20:11:24,66,0.93,66,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfs9os

math,Noether normalization lemma proof (Nagata),"I think I understand the statement at an intuitive level now.  Let me know if this is the right way to think about it!

For a field k, a k-algebra on n generators A = k\[x\_1,...,x\_n\] can be ""factored"" into a two-stage extension of k, with each stage having a finiteness property:

1. By extending k as a ring to B = k\[x\_1',...,x\_m'\] \\cong k\[X\_1,...,X\_m\] for a finite collection x\_i \\in A for some 0 \\leq m \\leq n, and then 

2. By extending B as a module to get A (i.e., there's a finite collection y\_1,...,y\_r \\in A such that every element of A can be written as \\sum b\_iy\_i for b\_i \\in B.

It's like the dimensionality of A is m, but you can add a ""fudge factor"" of this module-finite extension on top of that.

It seems like a really natural statement, but the standard proof by Nagata is horrendous.  I'm reading it in Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, and he has a way of brushing details under the rug, but even then, it's a complicated construction.  

I roughly understand that it's doing a change-of-variables and I learned that there's a nice geometric interpretation of getting ""m-dimensional"" affine varieties in A\^n to project to A\^m with finite fibers by changing the coordinate axes.

Can someone explain where the intuition of the Nagata proof comes from?  The proof makes it look like an ugly ""technical lemma"", even though the statement seems to be fundamentally important for algebraic geometry.  Are there cleaner proofs?  (The proof for k infinite is cleaner, but I still don't understand the intuitive idea of why you would change variables this way.)",WMe6,1hfyak4,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfyak4/noether_normalization_lemma_proof_nagata/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfyak4/noether_normalization_lemma_proof_nagata/,2024-12-17 00:37:28,17,1.0,17,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfyak4

math,What would the graph of a functional look like?,"It’s currently 4am and this is my late night thought and I have a presentation in 6 hours. 

How would you even graph a functional? 

A function is when x-&gt;f(x) and a functional is when f-&gt; F[f]. So if I input x I want to see what F[f] outputs and do that for every x. I wonder if it’ll lead to chaos or something. Honestly, I don’t know any equations that are functional (can I make one up?) besides the Kohn-Sham equations because it is the back bone of DFT which is part of my research. 

Anyways, just curious feel free to enlighten me.

math,Advice for Graduate School Application - Gap Year or Apply Now?,"Foreword: Typically, I would reserve such question for the academic advisors at my school; however, it is winter break, and I'm realizing nobody is looking to talk atm (and understandably so). Being that applications are due before the Spring semester starts back up, I'm stuck w/o many options. So, pls down beat me down with mean comments and heavy downvotes lol! I would appreciate the mercy. Thank you!! :) I appreciate all the help I can get.

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

Here's my situation: If I took a gap year next year, the benefits would be that I would be able to...

(i) improve GRE scores (math subject test &amp; general test),

(ii) work as a full-time tutor in mathematics (as well potentially fill the role of a substitute teacher for high school math courses),

(iii) prep on getting PhD passes on all four qual courses offered at my university (I have already taken all of these courses, just have yet to take quals),

(iv) have extra time to polish Personal Statement, looking into which universities best fit my interests, etc.

HOWEVER, I am unsure whether (a.) this would be good in ensuring strong letters of rec (most of my options are professors which I've only had one semester under, and asking for a letter of rec an entire year later I'd imagine could cause some difficulties), and whether (b.) graduate schools would frown upon seeing an applicant having taken the most recent year off.

What are your thoughts? Is this a good idea I'm currently considering?

math,Math puzzle: Move the tower,"French mathematician Édouard Lucas was born in Amiens in 1842 and died in Paris 49 years later. He wrote the four-volume work *Recréations Mathématiques*, which became a classic of recreational mathematics. In 1883, under the pseudonym “N. Claus de Siam” (an anagram of “Lucas d’Amiens”), he marketed a solitaire game that he called the Tower of Hanoi.

He claimed that the game was a simplified version of the so-called Tower of Brahma. In this supposed legend, monks had to move a tower made of 64 golden disks in a great temple. Before they could complete this task, however, the temple would crumble to dust, and the end of the world would arrive.

The Tower of Hanoi consists of a small board on which three identical cylindrical rods are mounted. On the left rod there are five disks of different sizes with a hole in the middle. They are ordered by size, with the largest disk at the bottom. The goal of the game is to move all the disks from the left rod to the right rod in as few moves as possible. In each move, only one disk can be taken from one rod and placed on another rod, and a larger disk can never be placed on a smaller disk. How many and which moves are necessary to transport the disks?
