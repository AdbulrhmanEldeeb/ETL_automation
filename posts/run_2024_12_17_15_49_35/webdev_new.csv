webdev,An end-to-end data pipeline tool in Go called Bruin ,"Hi all, I have been pretty frustrated with how I had to bring together bunch of different tools together, so I built a CLI tool that brings together data ingestion, data transformation using SQL and Python and data quality in a single tool called Bruin:

[https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin)

Bruin is written in Golang, and has quite a few features that makes it a daily driver:

* it can ingest data from many different sources using ingestr
* it can run SQL &amp; Python transformations with built-in materialization &amp; Jinja templating
* it runs Python fully locally using the amazing uv, setting up isolated environments locally, mix and match Python versions even within the same pipeline
* it can run data quality checks against the data assets
* it has an open-source VS Code Extension that can do things like syntax highlighting, lineage, and more.

We had a small pool of beta testers for quite some time and I am really excited to launch Bruin CLI to the rest of the world and get feedback from you all. I know it is not often to build data tooling in Go but I believe we found ourselves in a nice spot in terms of features, speed, and stability.

webdev,Clarification on Using Google Search and Autocomplete for a Chrome New Tab Extension,"I’m working on a **free Chrome New Tab extension** that helps users learn Korean and integrates a basic search feature. The extension will work similarly to the normal Google search experience:

1. Users type a query in the search bar on the new tab page.
2. Autocomplete suggestions appear as they type to enhance usability.
3. When users submit the query, they are redirected to the **standard Google search results page** (e.g., https://www.google.com/search?q=query).

To provide autocomplete suggestions, I’m currently fetching data from Google's endpoint:  
[https://www.google.com/complete/search?client=chrome&amp;q=query](https://www.google.com/complete/search?client=chrome&amp;q=query)  
I’m using a **proxy server** to fetch and return the suggestions to the extension.

Before proceeding, I’d like to clarify the following:

1. Is fetching autocomplete suggestions this way **compliant with Google's terms of service** for a Chrome extension?
2. If not, what is the **recommended approach** for providing autocomplete suggestions while keeping the experience similar to Google's?
3. Would Google Programmable Search Engine (PSE) be applicable here, even though we’re redirecting users to Google’s unmodified search results page?

I want to ensure this implementation follows best practices and remains fully compliant. Any guidance or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

webdev,How can I have two totally different themes in the same project with MUI and Tailwind?,"I have two different products in the same repo, but their designs are different. Most of the componentes are shared but some features are different.

The problem I’m facing is dealing with the UI, specifically theming conflicts. I have setup two MaterialUI themes, and also two Tailwind presets, each with their own color variables. And depending on which project I want to run, it selects the right theme.

But it’s not as reliable, because often when I change something in product A, it breaks product B, with the MUI themes it’s better but with Tailwind it happens often. For example, a component is styled with tailwind classes and used in both products, one needs a border and the other doesn’t. Of course one way to solve this would be to check which product uses which classes but the code is unmaintainable and messsy.

Another common issue that I have is: Product A primary color is a dark color and product B is a light color, so they need different text colors.


How would you deal with this?

Ideas I have:

1. A components library, so instead of manually styling them in the project itself, I create a separate repo only for the UI, and in there I can do the variants logic in a more isolated way. This would bring a new repo to maintain tho and a new workflow we may not have the space for.

2. Maybe stop using Tailwind to style the components, and focus more on MUI since I can then have different designs for each. One issue with this, is I can only use MUI components and I already have many custom ones.

Not sure if there is a way to easily create the Product A and B variants of a component and use them based off the environment variable the defines the project.

It can’t be too troublesome tho, I need a way to easily create and maintain components.",PatchDev_,1hg8i0v,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hg8i0v/how_can_i_have_two_totally_different_themes_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hg8i0v/how_can_i_have_two_totally_different_themes_in/,2024-12-17 11:19:02,1,0.57,1,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hg8i0v
webdev,best way to save worker results in microservice architecture,"I'm currently developing a graphql api in nodejs with graphql-yoga that needs to query and process large amounts of data from an external service. 

To ease the load on my api service I thought of using bullmq to create a multi purpose worker microservice to which I can offload expensive tasks from my main api server. 

Now I'm wondering what is the best way to get the worker result data back to my main application. The data the worker produces should end up in the postgres database that the api service uses and it also downloads some files that I want to save in a bucket.

there are a few approaches that I thought of:

1. Give the worker access to the db and a bucket to save the data directly.
This approach goes against my understanding of an encapsulated microservice architecture.

2. Put the result data back into another bullmq queue and let the api server write the data to the database. But how would I handle the files I want to save in a bucket?

3. create endpoints on the apiserver for the worker to return its data. I do not want to have internal graphql endpoints to pollute my schema. I discovered that maybe grpc could be a good fit for this but never used it.

Is any of the approaches even viable? Maybe there are other ways to achieve this that I don't know about, I would really appreciate some input on this :)

webdev,The recent WP hacks along with Matt's tantrums &amp; antics have made me realize one thing as a WP Designer:,"I am constantly in shit. 

Now I used to be a developer in React (both Web and React Native) but took a huge break from that trying to focus more on my mental health and figuring out what I want to do which turned out to be design and illustration. I used to hate WordPress because I didn't know much about as a developer with his nose in the air. 

As a designer now, of course I use WordPress for myself and found some clients so I can make a living. I am grateful for this ecosystem and it's community. 

But I'll be damned if I don't mention how insecure I feel as of late. There have been so many hacks in the system and I don't see much people really reacting as hard I would expect them to so it either tells me that these hacks are a norm in the system or that we are better off acting ignorant of it all. 

To top off the fact that Matt's antics show how much of a joke he takes this project and it's community for, it makes me really wonder if I should invest more in WordPress by learning PHP and getting deeper into the development aspect of it since lacking in that aspect might put so many clients at risk under my name and brand, or if I should just translate my design skills into going back to the JavaScript environments.

webdev,SQL database design for storing tags,"Completely rookie dev here. My application allows admins associated to a specific organisation to create custom tags and tag organisational resources (PDFs, images etc.) that can later be filtered. I'm using PosgreSQL. My initial idea is having a Tags table with Organisational ID, Admin ID (who created the tag), Tag ID, and Tag Name. Then associate the Tag ID to specific organisational resources. But then each resources can have multiple tags so not sure what's the solution here. I'm more familiar with NoSQL where one way is to just store the tags of a resource object as an array of Tag objects

Is there a better way of doing it? I have a RAG who should be able to query the database for specific tags by name so that might complicate things

As a side project I have been asked by the executive team to kick off a charity for the company. **I am not a webdeveloper or have any experience in this, just a guy with hands and half a brain and a task.** Naturally, it will start small and then grow over the years, long term working with celebs and the like, charity auctions and livestreams etcetc. They have tons of money to throw away but want a roadmap to show them next week and a proof of concept doable for Q1. Something like a regular donation system is fine for the start of the year.

I will have to ask for budget as we go but basically will rely on Fiver or freelanced web devs for the project.

Before I kick it off I did want to ask experienced webdevs who may have done this type of work what considerations I may need to bring to them during the roadmap prez to make the rollout easier?

I thought of;

\- Payment system, what will we use?

\- Legality of donation/system worldwide

\- Legal terms to write out with the legal team

\- Will it be a subdomain of our normal site (charity.SITENAME.com), or a whole new website, or a subdirectory of our site (SITENAME.com/charity)? **What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?**

webdev,Shopify App- how to track user among several stores who have my app?,"Am I trying to achieve the impossible? Please read whole thing.  
  
I have a mobile app where user can store their receipt data. And a Shopify app, which basically shows a button which when clicked, shows a QR code for first time Auth. So, I am using device fingerprinting to track the user, update the database, etc. 

Problem:  
1. Is fingerprinting the only way to Auth for cross-domain verification? I don't want my users to scan QR again and again for verification. I was looking into cookies, but they are useless for cross domains.   
What else is possible? Chatgpt says iframe cookies are also mostly blocked by default in most browsers.  
  
2. This device fingerprinting is valid only until the cart page, so there is no way for Shopify to know which order belongs to which user. So I tried to connect the cart token with the device fingerprint -&gt; then Shopify looked up for that token. However, the token changed from cart to checkout, and now I don't know what else I can do to make sure the order checkout sends the data to the right user in my database.   
What other attributes I can use which remain constant and are solid identifiers?

webdev,Trying to figure out the right migration strategy from React/Node to NextJS,"Hi all,

Mostly a backend developer here, but I created a website using a React frontend (hosted in S3/Cloudfront)) and a Node server serving JSON data (on a single EC2 instance) which fetches data from an RDS DB. 

The website has a lot of dynamically created pages (think of a site like goodreads, serving pages about Books) and while I'm okay with most content being fetched async after page load, I want to serve the pages with metatags so search engines and social media can create better previews and index the content better.

I'd like to move over to NextJS for that reason. I'm quite new to the idea of NextJS, however, and I'm having trouble wrapping my head around what it replaces. Every article I find involves replacing React apps with NextJS, but it seems to me that rather than that, it actually replaces the Node app and simply has you moving your React app into the server app.

Is that about right or am I totally wrong here?

From that understanding, it seems like my setup should move from:

    React app:
     - book-page.jsx
     - book-client.jsx (which fetches data from Node App)
    Node app:
     - book-api.js
     - book-db-client.js (which fetches data from SQL)
    SQL DB (RDS)
     - Book tables 

To:

    NextJS app (hosted on EC2 or using AWS Amplify?):
     - pages folder (has the react app):
         - book-page.jsx
         - book-client.jsx (maybe no need for this anymore?)
     - pages/api
         - book-api.js
         - book-db-client.js (which fetches data from RDS)
    SQL DB (RDS)
     - Book tables 

Does this sound like the right strategy for what I'm trying to do? I'm still learning NextJS, so the info in the pages and api folder is a bit... loose.

Edit to add: the reason I'm asking and not simply ""googling"" is because I have already tried and the number of articles and tutorials is high due to the number of different setups devs start with and which strategy of NextJS (SSR, SSG, IVR) they use AND what kind of content their website actually serves. It's been a bit of a pain to figure out the right strategy for my own website because of all these nuances.",ubccompscistudent,1hfrwas,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hfrwas/trying_to_figure_out_the_right_migration_strategy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hfrwas/trying_to_figure_out_the_right_migration_strategy/,2024-12-16 19:55:54,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hfrwas

So I want to be able to push these small changes live, but without losing all the work I've done regarding the major change and without pushing that, because it isn't complete.

What I was going to do was make another branch, for example ""frontend changes"", switch to it, make the changes, merge that to the main branch and then push the main branch.   
After which I'll then switch back to my major change branch and carry on with my work there. 

Is that ok? Will I lose anything/accidentally push my major change branch live that way?",RyXkci,1hfncjx,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hfncjx/could_i_get_some_git_novice_help_please/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hfncjx/could_i_get_some_git_novice_help_please/,2024-12-16 16:45:48,0,0.33,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfncjx
webdev,Always check the  node engine in your local vs pipeline when building you app - rant,"Hey, devs

I’m in the middle of migrating my corporate app to MFE. 

For the past 2 days I couldn’t figure out why my local build shows different files vs pipeline. 
I checked everything:


- env variables
- different file naming 
- played with optimization
- played with how webpack use build commands
- checked the deployment settings

Build after build, whatever I did it showed same result - files are different. The file names and structure come from content hash and I was 100% not matter where you run it - it should be same.

Besides the fact that files are different - the MFE modules that I needed were not in the pipeline build.

At this point I was 99% sure the Skynet took over and it’s trying to drive me crazy. 

And then I took a glance at our node image - it was called node14 so I naturally assumed it had node 14 under the hood.

Can you imagine my face when I console logged the node engine and saw the magic number - it was running under node 10. I quickly changed node on my local to 10, did the build and finally saw same file structure.

At that moment I started jumping like a little girl. It was really driving me nuts for the last coupe of days

Moral of the story - always consider engine check when doing builds.

webdev,Devs who freelance - need input on client management tooling,"Hey fellow dev freelancers!

I'm looking for a client management solution that would actually work for developers. Current situation: managing multiple clients, each with their own requirements gathering, tech stack discussions, GitHub access setup, deployment processes, etc.

Current pain points:

* No standardized way to collect technical requirements
* Project setup varies per client (some need AWS access, others use their own infrastructure)
* Managing access to different tools/platforms for each client
* Tracking where each project is in the setup phase
* Juggling different communication channels (Slack/Discord/email)

I've looked at general freelance tools (Dubsado, HoneyBook), but they seem more geared towards creative freelancers. What I really want is something where I can:

* Create custom workflow templates (e.g., different flows for web apps vs APIs)
* Automate repetitive tasks (repo setup, project board creation, etc.)
* Track technical requirements and dependencies
* Handle contracts and payments
* Give clients visibility into the technical setup process

Right now I'm cobbling together Notion + Jira + various docs, but it feels inefficient. Wondering if there's a more dev-focused solution out there?

If not, would you use something specifically built for managing development clients? What features would you want to see?

webdev,How to debug Largest Contentful Paint on mobile being slow?,"I'm working on a large site with multiple plugins using a C# CMS. A Lighthouse scan in Chrome shows an LCP of 1.5 seconds on desktop but 10.1 seconds on mobile. Lighthouse results vary significantly across runs—ranging from 11.2 to 15.3 seconds—so I'm skeptical of its consistency. Could the slow mobile performance be due to simulated 3G speeds?

I've checked [WebPageTest.org](http://WebPageTest.org), which reports a 6.776-second load time. The LCP element is a div with a 12KB compressed WebP background image, so it’s already optimized. I suspect render-blocking resources might be a factor, but there are only five of them, each under 200ms, so they account for less than a second.

webdev,Is this what web development is like?,"I have been working on web/mobile development since ~2019 as a hobby. I took a course on HTML/CSS/JS and then moved into learning react and more recently react native. I’ve definitely improved over this time, and can make higher quality things faster. Recently I’ve been more serious about it and am trying to make stuff which could actually be used by other people. While I find the general process really fun and addictive, I notice that I also feel a lot of stress and burnout when I’m working on a project. But the thing is, I don’t feel that stress from the actual programming- dealing with errors and things not working the way I want etc. is stimulating if not fun, since I know that there is some error in my thinking that I need to resolve. 

What frustrates me is constantly fixing a seemingly endless onslaught of environment/set-up related issues. For example, right now I’m trying to use the expo-linking module in my expo development build and am getting a “Cannot find native module ExpoLinking” error. “main” has not been registered. “A module has failed to load due to an error and ‘AppRegistry.registerComponent’ wasn’t called.”

Lately it feels like my time spent programming has been 20% actually writing code and 80% jumping between stackoverflow questions trying to resolve issues like this, fiddling with package.json when I don’t really understand what I’m doing. What is the name for this sort of problem?

Is this simply what web development is like? Does it get easier? I am passionate about what I create so I usually just grind through these issues and slowly move forwards. I think I’m better at resolving these issues than when I started 5 years ago, or at the very least am suffering because I’m taking on more and more sophisticated projects.

But to some extent I worry that I have a fundamental lack of knowledge which severely slows me down. I’ve only ever done this as a hobby which has mostly meant ‘learning by doing’ rather than ever actually sitting down and properly studying any of it. Is that what I need to do? What are the best resources for doing this? I study computer science at university but they don’t touch any of this sort of stuff.

webdev,Recommended ways to generate a visual report based on form data,"Greetings everyone,

Apologies in advance if this question is either not allowed or has been answered before, but I just wanted to get an idea of the best methods to generate really visual reports based off form data.

For context, I am building a web based application based on providing change management solutions - essentially a user will input form data including # of impacts, severity of impacts, who they impact and the environment - as well as including information surrounding the change, pre and post etc. 

With that said, once a user submits this information, I want a report generated that could be presented at an executive steering committee - so think high visuals, fact based information, quick and to the point to capture attention, while still remaining professional. 

I'm someone who needs a visual example to get ideas, but so far all the reports look dull and are top down based, they don't make use of cards, buttons, and other widgets so Im here looking for good recommendations, thanks again for all your help.

webdev,Help with HTML and CSS layout for a row of images with various aspect ratios,"I have what I feel like is a very simple problem, but I can't figure it out (and AI has been no help). I have a website that is randomly selecting 4 images from a set of images to display. Many of the images have different aspect ratios, which is making this complicated. The images should be displayed in a single row and they should all have the exact same height. There should be no gaps or blank space between or around any of the images. None of the images should be cropped. Basically, the height of the entire container should adjust to line up all 4 images in a row with the same height while taking up the full width of the page.  The images do *not* need to all have the same width, but every solution I find seems to have this behavior.

Here's what I've got so far with some example photos:

    &lt;div class=""image-collage""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""image-collage-image-container""&gt;&lt;img class=""image-collage-image""

    &lt;/div&gt;

    .image-collage {
        display: grid;
        grid-auto-flow: column;
        grid-auto-columns: auto;
        width: 100%;

        display: flex;

    .image-collage-image {
        height: auto;
        width: 100%;
        filter: brightness(75%);
    }

And here's how it's rendering:

As you can see, the second image has blank space above and below in order to fill the space, but I don't want that. What I want is the rest of the images to shrink until they all have the same height, then all grow together until they fill the width of the page.

I hope my explanation makes sense. Any help is appreciated.

webdev,Best Approach for Authorization in a Nested Resource Structure ,"I have an app with the following structure:

* A `Company` has many `Clients`.
* Each `Client` has many `Projects`.
* Each `Project` has many `Tasks`.
* A `User` belongs to a `Company` and can only access/edit/delete tasks associated with the same company.

I need to ensure that users can only access resources (like tasks) that belong to their company. I’m considering two main approaches:

1. **Option 1: Add** `company_id` **to all related tables (e.g.,** `tasks`**,** `projects`**,** `clients`**)** This would allow quick authorization checks by comparing `company_id` directly, reducing the need for joins when querying.
2. **Option 2: Use a purely hierarchical approach** This would maintain relationships (`task → project → client → company`) and enforce access through the hierarchy, resulting in complex joins but no redundant data.



In my opinion Option 1 feels better because i can straight away check if a user can edit a task or not, instead of joining tasks with project and client and then checking the company\_id's of them both.

Would there be significant performance or maintainability trade-offs with each approach? Which method would you recommend and why?

7. [repo2file](https://github.com/artkulak/repo2file)

...there are some real advantages to this one that make it stand out:

* It's a single html file that you download to your local machine-- that's it! just open in a modern browser like chrome and you can use it securely. 

* Because it's locally hosted, with no requirements like python or anything else, it's very quick to get it running on any machine, and because it's local, you can use it on your own private repos without worrying about using a github authorization token or similar annoyance. 

* You don't even need to be working with a repo at all, it works just as well with a regular folder of code files.

Also, I added tons of quality of life improvements that were major pain points for me personally:

These include laboriously re-selecting the same or very similar subset of files over and over again; now you can save a preset (either to localStorage in the browser or exported and saved as a JSON file) and dramatically speed this up. There are also a few other features to speed up the file selection process, such as quick string based filtering on file names, and common quick selection patterns (such as ""select all React files""). 

It also keeps track of the total size in KB and lines of text that have been selected in a handy tally section which is always visible in the upper right corner, so you always know when you are reaching the maximum of the context window of whatever model you're working with. Based on my experience, I added in warnings for GPT4o and o1 and also Claude3.5 Sonnet.

Before the listing of the files and their contents, it also automatically includes the hierarchical file/folder structure of the files you select, and next to each one, shows the size in KB and the number of lines, which helps give the model context about which files are the most important. 

I also added the ability to minify the code so you can cram more into the context window.

I need someone to help me set up web alert as soon as there is some change or website (ie new article on News source)

Hello everyone 

I'm a very big fan of RSS but as you guys know not everything website is offering that 

I've been trying to find some solution I manage to find an Android application that offers the option to get notification as soon as there is a certain change in website 
In my case that is going to be new news or video being published 

The problem is I'm having small difficulties setting that up 
I'm not quite sure how to set up the whole process since I'm getting lots of irrelevant information I don't quite care about 

I've been trying to select title or maybe even something between &lt;span&gt;but it doesn't quite give me consistent results 

I'll provide a video of what I exactly mean 

I wish someone could help me whether here or through dm

This is my first freelance project -- out of my full time work, and I don't even know how much I should charge him (third world country). I work on this project daily for about 2 to 4 hours per day. He expects the project as a cross platform app, so I may be wrapping it later in Electron.

webdev,We built a HeadlessCMS and would appreciate some feedback,"Hey everyone, a friend and I started a business together and built a headless cms (I know yet another headless cms but it’s what we know and the work we do within our current corporate jobs revolve around building custom internal content management applications within ServiceNow). Would love to have feedback for an initial gut check in terms of design (we didn’t use a designer and pulled it out of our rears and leveraged Bootstrap) and any brutally honest feedback you’re willing to share as well as any issues you encounter here.

The app has a free tier to sign up for testing (other tiers are paid and WILL charge your card via Stripe so stick to free). We’re still working on documentation and finalizing development however some initial feedback would be valuable, and the app itself isn’t mobile friendly as of yet so please test on desktop. It’s an Express application leveraging Mongo, Cloudflare, Auth0, Hotwire Turbo, Stripe, a sprinkle of hyperscript in a few places since I just recently discovered it and enjoy the syntax, but the majority of the entire app is written in pure vanilla js since we couldn’t agree on which framework/library to work with, and honestly wanted to see how far we could get without the need for react/vue/etc (we still use AngularJS 1.x within ServiceNow since we're both portal devs and learned to hate front end frameworks). 

The app allows for localized content, scheduled actions (publish/retire/etc), and leverages OpenAI for text generation for text fields. It also has versioning and you can store assets such as images, videos, files etc, as well as the ability to assign roles to control access to different modules. It’s still a work in a progress but we’re close to launching after finalizing some additional testing and validations. We built it on our spare time after work to get a feel for what is it was like to start a business from the ground up and build an app from scratch. It was a hell of a journey.

webdev,SPA Stateless Authentication,"I’m building a SPA application to interact with a REST API I built. The API is serverless and stateless so “sessions” only last as long as a single request. I’m looking for good guides/resources on how to accomplish this. Ideally without cookies as the API already has about 4 different auth methods (stakeholder requirement, don’t ask) and I don’t really want to add yet another one, but I’m willing to accept this is the best way. Thanks!

Edit: Some have rightly commented that I haven't given enough detail. For clarity: 

1. I have an endpoint (call it /auth/token) which a user can use to exchange their username and password for a JWT. At the moment this only returns an access token.
2. I have SPA application built in a reactive framework which has access to a global state manager. 
3. A user should be logged in and their token should be stored... where? 
   * Stored in state management? Potentially insecure and ephemeral so if a user was to refresh the page, then they'll have to log in before the JWT expires which isn't great UX.
   * In local storage? This becomes vulnerable to XSS as its accessible not just by a single script. 
   * Store the JWT in a cookie? While this seems to be the most secure way of doing it, it feels weird to me as someone who has worked with many stateless APIs and has always used some variance on the Authorization header. 

Therefore I'm looking for general guidance on how I should approach token management.

webdev,Why doesn't JavaScript implement an optional type system like PHP and Python?,"I've worked at multiple companies, and every single one of them uses TypeScript or some kind of type-documentation library for JavaScript. So, it makes me wonder: why hasn't JavaScript just added an optional type system, similar to what PHP or Python have done?

In PHP, you can choose to use types for all your code, some of your code, or none at all. It's fully compatible. Even if you're using an un-typed library (which has become rare), you can still add ""type hints"" as doc comments.

    function add(int $a, int $b): int {
        return $a + $b;
    }
    
    function getData(): mixed {
        return json_decode('{""key"": ""value""}', true);
    }
    
    /** @var $userCounts array&lt;string, int&gt; */  // Lets the IDE know $userCounts is type of array&lt;string, int&gt;
    $userCounts = getUserCounts(); 

I really like this system because it's flexible and never gets in the way. Since type support is built into the language by default, almost everyone uses it, and it's now considered best practice to type your code as much as possible.

Meanwhile, in the JavaScript ecosystem, there's still a huge gap. Most React or framework/library tutorials teach JavaScript first, and people only transition to TypeScript later—if they do at all. This feels odd, especially considering that browsers still don't support TypeScript natively.

An optional type system in JavaScript itself could make the developer experience smoother and reduce the reliance on external tools like TypeScript.  Is there a technical reason why JavaScript hasn't gone this route?",Representative-Dog-5,1heplzn,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1heplzn/why_doesnt_javascript_implement_an_optional_type/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1heplzn/why_doesnt_javascript_implement_an_optional_type/,2024-12-15 10:05:49,0,0.38,0,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heplzn

webdev,"Fornax: Bun-powered Angular-inspired web framework
","I have been working for the past couple of weeks on a fairly ambitious project - a Bun web framework inspired by Angular. So far, I have component decorators functional - with components being built out using Google's incremental-dom. I have live reload working. I'm focusing at the moment on getting routing to work without full page reloads, getting Output decorators to work, finishing up services, and dependency injection (hand-in-hand with services). I'm aiming to try and recreate as many Angular features as possible. I just made the repo public and would love and appreciate any and all support or feedback. Thank you!

[Link to demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmZAew8MZ-Q&amp;lc=UgwCs7TRIIKJUwdgtih4AaABAg)

This is a first pass at a Rust driven audio looper with FX. I plan on iterating on and rewriting much of this application, and once I am happy with it, I would love to get some contributions.

The main issue right now stems from having to use crossbeam to send samples to a DSP library, which gives worse performance and can cause audio pops, especially when recording or using heavyweight software in the background. I have another backend repo that uses iterators, and a double buffer for recording that performs much better, but the reverb algorithm is not as nice as the one in FunDSP. I plan on maybe porting that over to a more lightweight solution.

I also ran into some nastiness with the audiograph, as the library I used needs a lot of this information at compile time, and I didn't want to use macros, so there is some repeated code. I think there may be an alternative way to set this up, but I did some pretty hacky stuff there for the time being.

My goal would be to get this performant enough to run on a RaspberryPi, although I may have overestimated the Pi's ability to render WebView performantly.

webdev,Question: Same backend for both mobile and web app,"Hi,

I have a question for the same backend design for both mobile and web app:

https://preview.redd.it/cd5ki8srzw6e1.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be0df63885df95a99d1662001bed6b5e07fa11b7

API usually sends back ***JSON*** response. While, as can be seen from the picture above, mobile app has the view on the frontend so it only requests the json data and it knows how to render the data in the app. While for web app, the browser doesn't know the view, therefore the backend need to send back the **HTML view** along with the dynamic data.

After searching, I come up with 2 feasible solutions:

https://preview.redd.it/25zq9pu50x6e1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b798f27c8588be8cff137780f6bc2b78eb5f182

So:

1. **First approach**: Having another **helper class** to help query from the model, which returns JSON data format. Then it depends on the controller route class to return JSON/HTML. This means the controller route class for API and Web will be different
2. **Second Approach**: Web page still send a static new page, but **on load**, there will be a JS to request dynamic data from the same API from the Backend. But for HTML Form post, I am not sure how the 2nd page knows what data was sent by the 1st page.

Since, I am new, I would like to hear more input/advice from the people here of which approach is better or is there another best practice approach?

In case this matter:

Mobile frontend framework: **Flutter**

Backend framework: **Laravel**

Web frontend framework: *not decided yet*

webdev,Best way to test mobile sites (cache issues)?,"Hi.  

I'm working on a website and I need it to behave differently on mobile; larger inputs for easier touch use, changing horizontal stuff to vertical, etc.  So I setup my media rules and loaded it on Chrome on my Android Galaxy Note9.  Looks good, just needed a little tweak.  Change the CSS, reload.  No difference.  I think, ahh cache.  So I hit the hamburger, scroll down, settings, privacy, delete browsing data, delete data, confirm, back, back, back, hamburger, reload.  

Twelve !@##$% steps.  Is there an easier way to do this?  Plus while that usually works, for some reason I'm having trouble today.  To test, I set a media rule:

    @media (max-device-width: 805px) {
      INPUT[type=text] {
        border: 2px solid #F00 !important;
      }
    }

I figured that'll make it glaringly obvious when the media rule takes effect.  Cleared cache, but still not going red.  Now this site's DNS is served through Cloudflare's proxy, so I suppose CF may also be introducing some caching; dunno.  On my PC, I go to the site and leave full screen then drag the right side of the window in and eventually when it's small enough, bam, I get red borders.  So the rule is working.  I run dual DNS for my domains; [www.mysite.com](http://www.mysite.com) on the phone *(external network)* is getting [50.77.xxx.xxx](http://50.77.xxx.xxx) whilst on my browser on the PC *(internal network)* it's 10.0.10.100.  Ergo, no CF.

webdev,Portfolio Advice ,"Hi everyone! I'm a newcomer to frontend/software development and I'm absolutely loving it. 

I've been exploring so many amazing portfolios shared in this community over time (from very cool gamified/3D experiences to elegant traditional layouts), as I was trying to figure out how to approach my own.

I decided to go with a minimalist design, though packed with subtle micro-interactions which (hopefully) add flair and tactility without comprising the performance. One of the projects I featured is actually a flashy gamified 3D Arcade experience, but I kept the main portfolio more understated and clean - I hope I’m not shooting myself in a foot with that choice?

Would greatly appreciate any feedback/advice on the portfolio! Do you think it is competitive enough to be applying for junior positions/freelancing or is there something I should add?

You can check the portfolio here: www.byilya.com Thank you!

webdev,We Built an Environment That Annoys Salty Web Devs: The Shelbula CDE (Conversational Development Environment),"Our small team of long-time devs (aka old devs / gasp: millennials!) have been working on it for a few months now. [Shelbula.dev](http://Shelbula.dev) gives the best of AI coding assistants in a dedicated environment, free from your IDE. Just bring your own OpenAI or Anthropic key. We call it the Conversational Development Environment (CDE).

With that, we can do a lot more. Work with multiple bots at once, give bots your entire project context instead of one file at a time (like in IDE editors tend to do), save snippets as you go, quick copy code blocks from the built-in code blocks, drag and drop files with any model, and most importantly adjust context windows on the fly. Chat getting too long? Trim the whole chat or prune specific messages to keep context alive. Multiple tab friendly for multiple chats at once. 

**Will it code for you? Absolutely not. It's not a substitute for knowledge. It's a productivity tool for those WITH knowledge.**

As any good developer knows, AI gives the wrong answer 50% of the time, but when you're able to provide full project context and micro manage conversations, your ability to get the right code on the first try improves dramatically. Additionally, our structuring allows models to return FULL blocks of code (up to 1000 lines on Claude 3.5 for example) vs the ""insert here"" kind of placeholders AI just loves.

It's free while our beta period finishes up the end of this month. There are several new bots being tested over the next week that come with Pro plans. (React Mockups, Documentation Bot, Multi-step flows) Gemini 2 support coming in January as well.

We know there's a huge divide of ""AI is useless for coding"" and ""AI is incredible for coding"" but through our teams 40+ years of combined programming experience we think it's a game changer when your dev brain can focus on architecture while the bots do the boring syntax. Time is money in this game, and Shelbula is all about saving you time.

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] Build a very basic RAG anyone can deploy and use,"Part of my AI learning journey, I wanted to see how complex it is to build and configure a RAG.

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is a framework that combines information retrieval and GenAI models to improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated outputs. It is useful when the LLM you use needs to produce responses based on up-to-date information that was not included in its training data.

Written in Typescript using Express, Mongo, NodeJS and hosted on [Genezio.com](http://genezio.com/), it needs a key from OpenAI for the LLM part and takes a URL as input.

It starts by crawling the URL and all sub-pages (by looking for \`&lt;a hrefs/&gt;\`, then it creates the vector database and then shows a UI to query the content with the help of OpenAI's Chat APIs.

The Vector DB and the page contents is stored and queried in MongoDB.

You can play with it here: [https://openai-rag.app.genez.io/](https://openai-rag.app.genez.io/) (it indexes Genezio's website, articles and documentation). Please don't over-test this as it uses my personal API key. I've put some spending limits, so it will stop working if you spam it. :)

You can look at the source code here: [https://github.com/bogdanripa/openai-rag](https://github.com/bogdanripa/openai-rag)

You can deploy your own instance using the ""Deploy"" button from Github (it's in the README file). While deploying, you'll need to specify your OpenAI API key and the URL to crawl. Then, when visiting the front-end for the 1st time it will crawl, index and then let you search.

If you want to crawl another URL, simply change the corresponding env variable to the new URL.

What other similar projects should I start?

webdev,Clerk bombed my NextJS deployment,"Word to wise, stop using shitty libraries that invest more in marketing than development, and don't fall for sponsored influencers, no matter how ""Fireship"" they may be.

I fell for the Youtubers shilling for Clerk and in my latest project I switched from NextAuth to Clerk. I've done several Nextjs projects before with NextAuth, hosting them on a Digital Ocean VPS and proxying them with nginx, with no major issues whatsoever.

This time, with Clerk, everything was OK in development, though their middleware seemed a bit fussy. Deployed to the vps, though, it went crazy and blocks all my api routes, due to some cors issues that seem to be out of my control. Nothing I can think of has any effect, ChatGPT goes around in circles, and I'm stuck now with basically a sabotaged app. User signUp/signIn/signOut works fine, it just messes up with \*my\* bloody api.

Clerk's customer support is as helpless as it is arrogant. First they just copy pasted some irrelevant code from their useless docs, then told me I'm using localhost. I don't know how Vercel does it, but what other ways are there to serve something other then from a local host? I also set up everything correctly, both on the DNS and the Clerk dashboard, so cors shouldn't be issue. But that's where all communication stopped with Clerk.

I don't have time this year to switch to NextAuth, so the project will be late, and I will finish the year and conclude several months of work in quite a shitty manner.

Did something like this happened to anyone else? Any possible advice on this?

Edit: Wow, such  a friendly and helpful community, you guys never disappoint. Just as none of you have ever used ChatGPT.

Edit 2: If it's a simple matter, then customer support should have been able to help. And yes, a VPS is ""my computer"". Funny I need to tell you that.

webdev,Confusion regarding HTTP based REST APIs?,"Recently trying to wrap my head around the client/server architectures and communication protocols between them.

HTTP was originally designed to transfer web pages from a server to anyone requesting aka clients. During the early ages of the Internet where webpages were static, this was the only job of a server. Clients hit an anchor tag, you serve them a webpage. As the name of the protocol implies (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), your job was to securely transfer HTML, to the requesting party.

Now in the current times where webpages are much more dynamic and interactive, servers apart from transferring HTML, now also transfer some additional data because now navigation into a website doesn't cause a full render, it only changes some parts of the webpage, so the server sends only that part of the webpage.

This ""additional data"" in most cases is not HTML, it's JSON (or XML etc), which only contains the necessary bits needed for that part of the webpage.

So my question is, why are we still using HTTP for this purpose? Wouldn't it make sense to make a different protocol only for this purpose? And why do we call these APIs HTTP based when clearly we are not transferring any hypertext?",Patzer26,1hdzjfs,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hdzjfs/confusion_regarding_http_based_rest_apis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hdzjfs/confusion_regarding_http_based_rest_apis/,2024-12-14 09:37:29,0,0.5,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdzjfs

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] Open-Source Password &amp; Alias Manager Built with .NET Blazor WASM,"Hey r/webdev,

**TL;DR for Devs:**  
For the last couple of months I have been building an open-source, end-to-end encrypted password and alias manager called **AliasVault**. It uses C#, [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core, Entity Framework Core, Blazor WASM, and SQLite—fully containerized via Docker. It also includes integrated E2E tests (Playwright) run on every PR. You can self-host or use the cloud version, and I’m looking for feedback on architecture, deployment, performance, and developer experience.

\---

**What is AliasVault?**  
AliasVault helps users protect their privacy online by generating unique identities (email, password, etc.) for every service. Unlike password managers that only store credentials, AliasVault integrates a built-in email server so you can manage full “alias” identities. It’s zero-knowledge and end-to-end encrypted, so the server never sees your master password, and all data is stored encrypted.

It can be compared to existing services like Bitwarden or OnePassword. But where those services focus more on storing passwords, AliasVault extends this by integrating full identity generation (aliases) and a built-in email server into a single platform.

**About me and goal**  
I've been a software developer for over 15 years and have been working primarily with PHP and .NET. I'm a big privacy advocate and have been running a website called [SpamOK.com](http://SpamOK.com) since 2013 that offers free temporary email addresses to help people protect their privacy. However by the nature of this service all emails are public which makes it anonymous but not entirely suited for occasions where privacy is important.

With AliasVault my goal is to create a fully open-source but private platform which helps protect the users privacy online. People can either choose to use the cloud hosted variant for convenience or self-host it on their own servers via Docker. Right now everything is free but if there's enough interest I am thinking about adding additional premium options (as source-available) to cover the costs of running the cloud version and aid in future development.

I'm sharing this project here on r/webdev for anyone that is interested to check it out both technically and functionally. Everything is open-source and you can install it on your own servers in a few minutes. I'm open for any feedback or questions you might have!

**Live demo and source code:**  
Here you can find the links to the cloud-hosted beta version, documentation and GitHub source code.

* **Docs &amp; Self-hosting:** [https://docs.aliasvault.net](https://docs.aliasvault.net)
* **Source Code:** [https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault)

**Tech stack highlights:**  
Some technical details about the tech stack that AliasVault uses:

* **C#,** [**ASP.NET**](http://ASP.NET) **Core, Entity Framework Core** for API backend and ORM.
* **Blazor WASM** for the SPA front-end, minimizing JavaScript while enabling shared .NET code between front and back-end.
* **SQLite** for a lightweight, self-contained database.
* **Docker** for painless self-hosting and one-click installs.
* **Tailwind CSS**
* [**SRP.net**](http://SRP.net) **&amp; Argon2id** for secure login without requiring master password to be sent over the network and for encryption/decryption. For more information about the encryption technologies used you can check out the Security Architecture documentation here: [https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture/](https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture/)
* **SmtpServer &amp; MimeKit** to handle virtual email aliases internally.
* **Playwright** for E2E browser tests (run on every PR via GitHub Actions), testing frontend+API communication with a clean SQLite instance each time.

**Some of the challenges I faced and lessons learned:**

* **Blazor WASM &amp; Crypto Challenges:** Blazor WASM allows C# to run in the browser which is very powerful in terms of development efficiency, but comes with trade-offs. Initial load size (\~20MB for current version) is quite big for a webapp, and certain encryption functions still require JavaScript fallbacks. I'm hoping future versions of .NET will improve on this.
* **Robust Testing with Playwright &amp; GitHub Actions:** When I started to build this project I set out on making it possible to run E2E tests automatically on each pull request. Now on every PR the front-end, back-end, and database interactions are all tested and verified in an all-in-memory environment with a fresh SQLite database per test. This allows for a lot of flexibility in creating tests to ensure all components are working nicely together. It did take some effort in order to make the test framework be stable and reduce flakiness.
* **Self-hosting convenience:** Part of my vision for AliasVault is to make it as simple as possible to install on your own servers. For this I created an extensive custom installation script that configures all environment files, pulls docker images (or builds them from scratch if you want) and takes care of lifecycle actions such as updating when a new version comes out, enabling LetsEncrypt for automatic SSL certificates etc. You can install the current version of AliasVault on a clean VM in e.g. Azure, AWS or DigitalOcean in literally minutes.
* **SQLite database limitations for back-end:** Currently AliasVault is running on SQLite for both the server and the client. With the server part I've been slowly running into concurrency limitations which causes locking and errors when multiple apps (API and worker services) try to mutate it at the same time. I am therefore planning on switching the server backend to PostgreSQL instead. When I started with just one service accessing the database it worked fine, but now that there are multiple background services, an API and an admin project the amount of locking increases.
* **SQLite database power for front-end:** The architecture for the client works quite interesting: when a new user creates a vault the WASM app creates a new SQLite database in-memory with EF migrations (thanks to the power of the full Entity Framework ORM). Then during sync with the server the WASM app locally encrypts the full .sqlite blob, and then sends that encrypted blob to the server. This allows the client to have full EF ORM capabilities such as searching through local credentials while literally all the user's vault data including all metadata is only stored in encrypted state on the server.

If you have any questions feel free to let me know and I'll happily answer them as best as i can. I'm also open for all feedback regarding architecture, deployment, ease of use etc.

Thank you very much for your time and for checking it out!

webdev,"Conditional Fetching with SWR and React
","Hello Guys!

I am working on a project where I have to build an queue management system. It is integrated with an external API, and I need to display people on the waiting queue, and people that are being called to be served. I am using Next.js for this.

I have three components: the Page (where I do the fetching), the Tail (people that are waiting) and the Head (people being called, it can be one or more people).

In Page, i use SWR to fetch an object with the head and the tail, and pass them as props to Head and Tail.

The thing is that for every person on the Head, I use the Speech Synthesis Browser API, and that can take some time, if the name of the person is big and there are multiple people on the head.

I have set the polling time on SWR to be 60 seconds, a value that I believe will be fine for the system. But that time being a minute makes the system feel clunky and slow for the attendants.

Is there a way to tell SWR not to fetch data while the speech synthesis is happening for each person on the queue? For that, I would need to pass some kind of information to the parent component, how should I do that, use Context?

Also, in the Head component, I'm using three useEffects.

webdev,Check your namecheap auto-renewals,"I had purchased a namecheap domain along with a 3 month free trial for their email service, had no idea that meant I would have to pay for their relate social pro service on top of that. 

Once the email service had expired, 3-4 months later I realized I was still paying for a service that I wasn't using. After digging on the website to see what was being charged, since I wasn't sure at first if my account had been hacked, I finally found that I was being charged for their relate social pro service.

I tried contacting namecheap and submitted a ticket regarding the situation, seeing if I could get a refund on the service I didn't use but no response. So I decided to chargeback through my credit card company thinking it would be okay, but then just recently I receive this from namecheap.

[TLDR: I need to payback the chargeback, else they will \~2x my chargeback](https://preview.redd.it/o0n13bih5q6e1.png?width=2168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3edc7893390bc4042695a805579d0404c6152cc7)

Here's a receipt for when I first started the trial, should've been more diligent but had no idea what Relate Social Pro meant or that it would have auto renewal on.

webdev,Local offline CMS for SSG (11ty preferably),"I have a personal small static site I build with Eleventy. I build it on my own computer, manually creating the Markdown files and transferring the output to my hosting provider. I don't mind managing my content manually that much, but I'm looking into ways to make it easier as files are heaping up. 

Is there anything like a GUI front-end to manage my source content in the traditional CMS way, without having to connect to any online service, all locally? I don't intend to use GitHub/GitLab or Netlify or anything. I want my computer to manage and build the static site that I can then simply upload to the hosting server, whose only job would be to serve the static files.

Decap CMS seemingly needs a remote git repo and heavily pushes towards Netlify; I don't se how to alter that. Strapi has no official documentation for integration with Eleventy.

The only thing I've seen is BuhoCMS, which does exactly what I need but can't read, only write pre-existing frontmatter in my 20+ posts which I don't want to manually recreate. Its repo is also set to read-only, which probably means it's a bad idea to start using it just now.

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] Rebuilding my personal web with pure HTML and TailwindCSS,"Hello and happy saturday!

For the last couple of weeks I've been rebuilding my website from scratch, that before it was using Materialize as CSS framework (rip project), some heavy PHP and jQuery.

But now I wanted to go full minimalistic and use as minimum resources as possible, I've ended up with pure HTML page (using PHP only for the contact form), pure JS with no frameworks, and TailwindCSS for easier layout building. The page fully loaded it's just 412kB, so basically loads instantly.

Now, there are still some features to implement, like the dark mode, and also I want to add some fancy animations when changing the language, now it only changes the texts. I also need to update my PDF CV to make the download and print buttons work (side question: as .print() funcion has been deprecated for a while, is there any way to print a document, not the page, directly with a button via JS?)

I'm looking for your feedback, as this page was only viewed by me I don't have any external input on how this page looks to other, if it's appealing, and also if there are any bigger design flaws to improve.

webdev,Best Headless CMS for Freelancing (editable by the client?),"Hey guys,

I'm a freelance web developer who enjoys building websites with custom code (often using Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS). I'm looking for the best headless CMS solution to allow my clients to easily edit website content.

**Current Challenge:**

* I want to maintain full control over the front-end development, avoiding limitations imposed by traditional CMSs like WordPress.
* My clients need the ability to easily edit all aspects of website content (text, images, etc.) through a user-friendly interface, not the layout or design, just the content.

**Current Considerations:**

1. **Astro with DecapCMS:** While promising, I feel it might limit client editing to specific components, and I'd prefer more granular control, also I can't seem to figure out how to customize the user interface/dashboard of the CMS.
2. **Storyblok:** I haven't used it extensively, but it seems like a strong contender.

**What are your recommendations?**

* What headless CMS do you recommend for this scenario?
* Are there any with highly customizable interfaces that I can tailor to my clients' specific needs?

webdev,Help me estimate cost of an app,"Hi, I’m thinking to start creating a project, I’m not yet sure to begin.

Anyway, I’ve experience in creating app with small audience (internal tools) so usually the cost of hosting and databse is very limited .

The app that I’m thinking is an app that offer a service for a single city.

The user can:
- login
- register

The main feature is:
- user open the app and see a map (like map box or Google maps ) but the map is restricted to show only one city
-user can zoom in , zoom out and move around the map
- user can add a marker to a street in the map and add some information (text only for now , images upload will be added maybe in the future but I don’t want to consider it for now)
- user can see every marker created by other user
- user can add a “like” on a marker 
- user is not happy to pay for this, but the user expects that the app to be a free service payed by the city (so the user indirectly pays for this with taxes)

My question is: how much monthly it will cost to have an app like this ? Development excluded.
The things that need to be payed are:
- hosting (VPs or serverless)
- frontend (react for sure so next js or vite)
- db (with only text I don’t think the disk space of the db will be higher that 1 go for a while
- map service ( I never used for an app like this a service for map so I have no idea how to estimate it.user will zoom in,zoom out and move around the map
so I presume a lot of requests are performed under the hood.
- Auth service

For sure the app will have an initial stage with super low traffic , then later it can increase highly but not sky rocket. 
How to estimate these two stages?



The city has 15000 people in the main area, and with interland it reaches 300000 people. It isn’t expected that every user will use that , so I think 10/15% of total people can spend 30 minute every month on the app.
This when the app is in high traffic stage.

webdev,How did web advertising become so bloated?,"I'm not talking about the excessive, obnoxios ad campaigns that cover content or exceed its quantity; that's a separate issue. What I'm talking about are articles, even from known and relatively trusted (at least for reading content) websites, that become so bogged down with ads that they wind up freezing or outright crashing mobile browsers, or lagging noticably on budget or low-power PC-based devices.

I don't think their quantity alone, as annoying as it is, is enough to account for their overhead. Many just display static images or simple animations which barely take up any processing power at all once loaded from the server. What are a few dozen animated images for a device that has no trouble whatsoever running quite complex browser games? The rest are presented as videos that take up some fraction of the screen, and only two or three of these videos are onscreen and playing at any given time. Meanwhile it would take at least a dozen videos at the same resolution to match the load of a single 1440p video stream which the same devices can comfortably handle, in a browser, even after downsampling it to fit the display.

What are these ads doing in the background that takes up so much processing power?

webdev,How do you work remotely in your team?,"This is a long post, I apologize in advance, but background info if required and I am not sure how to TLDR it.

I just joined a new company almost 4 months ago. In my previous company we had the following setup (prior to covid):: 

Everyone had a work computer in the office with VirtualBox running a local copy of the codebase and the DB. (we also had VirtualBox with a local copy at home after covid when we went remote for 1 year).

That local copy was a git repository connected to a BitBucket remote origin. We all worked on our own copy of the codebase because prior to 2014 we were not using git at all. We used Dreamweaver with it's checkin/checkout and we constantly were overwriting each other's changes. In comes git and we solved that problem.

This new company I am working for now, also does not use git, and we all (4 devs) just remote into the dev server and work directly on it. So far in 4 months, it has happened 4 times where someone has been ""working on a new feature"" directly on the dev server, and it would break something for some other section that QA was working on. QA all have to stop and wait for it to be fixed before they can keep working. 

On my second week there, I was told that 2 of the other devs use SFTP. So I also setup SFTP in order to at least create a local git repo to track my own changes locally. Of course now I have to sync my local with dev manually. Not ideal. So long story short, I get assigned a larger project that is a major overhaul of a single system within the application as a whole (which I am still working on today). So I setup a local development environment in docker, which involves tweaking some things in the application code in order to get it to run locally because hard coded redirects and forced https and whatnot.

Everyone asks how I am working on stuff when they can't see my changes on dev... I work on a local setup with proper version control... ""OH THAT SOUNDS COOL!!!! WE WANT SCM TOO!!! CAN WE DO THAT TOO!!!"" why yes you can. Here is a docker compose file so you can mount your local files directly into the VM, and here is the remote repo so you can clone it. Have fun.

They immediately go straight to the single devops guy who calls me and tells me that I am not authorized to have a local copy of the codebase, and is freaking out because he thinks we are running the DB locally as well. In fact, no one is authorized to have local copies. We all need to stop using it and docker immediately and work on dev directly like they have been doing for decades. After the new year we will look into setting up something else that is more inline with ""doing it the right way"".

So I apologize for overstepping my role (Senior Frontend Architect - DevOps Engineer), and let him know it was not my intention to violate any non-existent, not-in-writing, never-explained-to-me-as-a-new-hire policies or procedures, and that I just wanted to get things moving in the direction of using SCM, since it is something we need to implement.

Anyway, I thought about it for like 20 minutes after I got off the phone, and thought of the following setup:

* Everything is already running on AWS
* Setup 1 remote server with 4 user accounts, one for each dev
* Each user account has it's own copy of the codebase that is a git repo on the server that only they and a single devops user can access (in case someone leaves and has not pushed code to the origin yet we can still get into it and not lose the code). (Possibly also running a remote VSCode IDE so we don't have to configure a local one as well - not really necessary, but would be a cool feature to have).
* Each dev remotes into their account on the server and works on the server files in their account directly (no local copies).
* The account based repos connect to a self-hosted git origin, and push/pull from there
* The self-hosted git origin CI/CD pipelines into the current dev server (which now becomes staging) and the load balancer which pushes to 2 production servers.

webdev,how would you approach building an alternative to itch.io?,"I hope this is the right place to post this. if not, I would love to be pointed in the right direction. preamble over. 

so i have this concept for a site like itch.io but more niche with a focus on specifically contemporary art games (i can explain what that means to me if anyone cares, but i feel is not really pertinent to the question at hand). and I'm looking for some perspectives on how other people might approach things like the UX, server side stuff, and general architecture of such a site. and, since I've never hosted something that could potentially have a lot of traffic, what server and hosting fees might look like. 

just in case you're not familiar, a quick breakdown of itch.io from a user perspective:

* sign up either as a developer, a player, or both
* search games by tags, developer, etc
* developers have a profile page that lists their games along with your standard profile stuff
* games have individual pages that can host multiple versions of their game, comment sections, etc
* allow games to also be played on the site, or downloaded,  if the developer wishes
* communities and events for things like game jams 

I might be missing a few things, but that's the majority of how the site is generally interacted with. 


not really interested in a full on guide so much as just a discussion on how you might approach a project like this.

It seems like Google is somehow looking at a cache proxy or something I cannot control.

webdev,"To my beginner friends, a warning: transitioning your career out of JS is hard","I've worked (in Italy as my first dev role) as a Full Stack dev around the MERN stack for a little less than 4 years. At the time, it wasn't a difficult position to get, and it allowed me to finance my degree in Germany.

Now that I have my degree in Comp Ling, I'm again interviewing for positions more around what I'm interested in, which is BE only and, possibly, other ecosystems like .NET (there are many open positions for this environment in my area now, which there weren't a few years ago).

Unfortunately, it seems it's really quite hard to transition out of both the front end and javascript in general. I had a company turn me down due to not having professional experience with Kubernetes and relational DBs, while there was good overlap with the rest of the stack. This is of course completely fair on their part, but I think I could've become a competent user in relatively little time thanks to experimenting with these things in my personal interests and projects. Regardless, it seems I have room to grow in selling what I'm capable of.

Overall, this process of trying to transition out of front-end work and (specifically) MongoDB has been a bit more depressing than I anticipated.

webdev,Website load testing advice,"I run a website that sells tickets for events. It’s built with **Next.js**, hosted on **Vercel**, and uses **Turso DB**. I’m trying to figure out how scalable the setup is and how many purchases it can handle per second before things start to break.

My idea is to simulate up to **100,000 clients** with an end-to-end test (using Playwright), starting with smaller loads and scaling up gradually. The goal is to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle significant traffic, as this is critical for securing deals with larger customers. I’m not too worried about cost since this testing is an investment in reliability.

# My Questions:

1. **Has anyone load-tested a similar setup?** What challenges did you run into?
2. **Should I notify Vercel and Turso DB** about the spike in traffic beforehand? I assume they’ll need a heads-up.
3. **Is Playwright suitable for this kind of load testing**, where can I run it?

# My Current Plan:

* **Vercel**: Since it’s serverless, scaling should be automatic, but I’ll confirm with their support.
* **Turso DB**: I’ll reach out to Turso to discuss their rate limits and any potential bottlenecks for write-heavy operations.
* **Testing Strategy**: Start small (e.g., 1,000 clients) and incrementally increase load while monitoring response times, query latency, and error rates.
* **Monitoring**: Use tools like Vercel Monitoring to pinpoint any issues during testing.

# What I’m Looking For:

* Where to host the playwright tests that won't get blocked by a firewall.
* Advice from anyone with experience load-testing serverless + turso setups.
* Tips on tools, methods, or optimizations I might not have thought of.

webdev,Developed a SPA to help devs temporarily deploy their javascript and css code,"**Hello Fellow Developers,**

Have you ever needed a quick way to temporarily host a JavaScript or CSS file to share with friends, colleagues, or even just for testing your own code—without having to update the entire project?

Recently, while working on a project, I faced this exact challenge. I needed to integrate custom JavaScript into a Squarespace website to ensure it met WCAG accessibility standards. Unfortunately, Squarespace didn’t offer a direct way to write custom JavaScript (or at least I couldn’t find one). However, it allowed adding custom scripts via a `&lt;script&gt;` tag.

After some research, I discovered a few platforms that let you temporarily deploy JS/CSS files. But most of them were either limited in functionality or required payment after a few uses. While I managed to resolve my issue, it made me wonder how many developers face similar obstacles.

That’s when I decided to create **CloudSyntax**. You can check it out here: [cloudsyntax.site](http://cloudsyntax.site/)

I developed it over a weekend—starting Friday night and finishing by Sunday morning. I wanted to share it immediately, but the domain was unexpectedly suspended. Now that it’s live, I’d love for you to check it out!

**What is CloudSyntax?**

* It’s a free platform (no sign-up or login required, for now).
* You can deploy any JavaScript or CSS code and receive a CloudFront link to embed directly into your projects.

I’d really appreciate your feedback—whether positive or constructive—to help improve the platform.

**Tech Stack:**  
It’s a simple project built with **Next.js**, **AWS S3**, and **CloudFront**.

Thanks, and I hope CloudSyntax proves useful to you!",Beginning-Bother4644,1hd4jmn,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd4jmn/developed_a_spa_to_help_devs_temporarily_deploy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd4jmn/developed_a_spa_to_help_devs_temporarily_deploy/,2024-12-13 04:39:24,9,0.65,9,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1hd4jmn

webdev,GraphQL static Resolvers vs dynamic resolvers ,"Hello cool cats. I have a quick question. I'm defining resolvers for a personal application.
I plan on implementing a mix of dynamic resolvers capable of being used for essentially any of the models and resolvers specific to certain requests like creating a user, creating tokens, etc..

The reason why l'm asking this question is to develop standards and best practices.

Without the use of a dynamic resolvers capable of placing data wherever i need to I would have to create somewhere around 250 resolvers. Don't really have a problem doing that but I can obviously make this list A LOT smaller and it is probably not advisable just because it'd be a pain in the ass to manage.

What resolvers would you, as a graphql developer, design with specific intent and what functions would you leave to a dynamic resolver? 

It's an E-commerce project. I'm looking for general standards and practices but E-commerce specifics are useful as well. I can make sense of what is said and apply it logically to what I'm doing so no need to cater your response specifically to an E-Commerce plattorm.

I understand my technical jargon and lingo may not be up to par.

webdev,Please Advice a Sole-Developer Seeking a Corporate Job with NDA-Limited Portfolio,"# Context:

I’ve been working remotely as the sole back-end developer for a boutique Cyber Security company since 2021. My focus has been on Python (Flask) for back-end work, but I’ve also handled full-stack tasks like front-end development (Angular), database design and deployment.

While it’s been a fantastic learning experience, the lack of mentorship, code reviews, and team workflow exposure has limited my growth.

Key projects if needed:

1. A system for analyzing machine-generated files and generating Word docx reports with complex formatting.
2. A tailored CRM for management of clients and services.

Unfortunately, **NDAs** prevent me from showcasing these projects, leaving me without any real-life portfolio examples for interviews.

# Research results so far:

Most advice suggests building custom projects, but I worry that a truly reflective project could take 1–3 months, while simpler ones might make me look like a fresh graduate.

# TLDR;

How can I effectively demonstrate my skills (specifically backend) with no real-life projects?

What are your thoughts on creating custom projects to bridge the NDA gap? Is the time investment worth it?

Also, any and all advice for transitioning from a sole developer into a team-based role would be much appreciated.",NonPraesto,1hcqja4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcqja4/please_advice_a_soledeveloper_seeking_a_corporate/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcqja4/please_advice_a_soledeveloper_seeking_a_corporate/,2024-12-12 17:38:33,1,0.67,1,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcqja4
webdev,Color management in NextJS/TailwindCSS (and in general),"I am very new to web developing, but I come from a background with strong fundamentals in firmware/embedded development. So I am a good ""programmer"" - just for context.

I taught myself webdev and have so far become intro-level decent but have recently struggled with color management.

From what I gather, it's common practice to set a bunch of very specific variables in your globals.css for things like primary, secondary, card, accent, muted (thinking of [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com)) and applying those liberally around the codebase. And should you want to support multiple themes (e.g. light, dark) you just need to define these vars for each theme and use media queries to select which one to use. But how/why were these vars chosen specifically?

What's a best practice for what's in globals.css (with respect to colors) and generally how to apply them to components? I feel like this could quickly unravel into having variables for everything - card, button, link, etc. That seems poorly designed and a maintenance nightmare.

Can anyone point me to a good tutorial/writeup on basic color management? NextJS/TailwindCSS would be preferred, but anything would help.",jigajigga,1hcpyeh,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcpyeh/color_management_in_nextjstailwindcss_and_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcpyeh/color_management_in_nextjstailwindcss_and_in/,2024-12-12 17:14:02,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcpyeh

webdev,Worth Learning TS for Small Projects,"Currently work as a security engineer, do a lot with cloud, devops, etc. It's been beneficial to learn basic React (JS) as we frequently build small-scale UI sites. For example, one site displayed container vulnerability Jira tickets and presented a way to configure fields across all tickets via a friendly interface. 

However recently during my React learnings, TS is pushed heavily and seems to be the primary webdev language. I get the benefits of it, but it seems a bit heavy to learn personally. I come from a Python &amp; Go background, so it's not foreign but definitely requires some time commitment. I've already known standard JS from previous experience.

I'm trying to decide if it's worth learning for these small projects of ours, and others in the future.

* Poor transcription quality.
* No flexibility to tweak things to fit *my* setup.

So I built **Amurex**, a self-hosted solution that actually works:

* Records meetings quietly, with no bots interrupting. 
* Delivers clean, accurate diarised transcripts right after the meeting.
* Automatically drafts follow-up that I can email.
* Keeps a memory of past meetings for easy context retrieval.

But most importantly, it has it is the only chrome extension in the world that can give

* Real-time suggestions to stay engaged in boring meetings.

It’s completely open source and designed for self-hosting, so you control your data and your workflow. No subscriptions, no vendor lock-in.I would love to know what you all think of it.

webdev,Developer (from a non web background) looking for framework suggestions for a side project,"Hey folks,

I'm a developer, however my experience is not in the world of web development. I have a number of years of professional experience using Java/Javascript/C#/SQL/Bash and random other bits along the way.

  
This project falls outside of my career and is more of a pet hobby project. What I'm trying to do is just build a simple website/web app used to pull and filter various information from a Mysql database. The data is just membership data for a student organization I was involved with more than a decade ago. I've been keeping up with it as a favor since then as the individual who used to do it before is very senior at this point and has been relegated to an assisted living facility.

  
The original site was built using Drupal 7 ages ago and I've kept it up to date with whatever version they are on now I think its Drupal 10. But this variant of the site is just using static pages and is a pain in the ass to update when I have all of the data in a database anyway that has all of the appropriate relationships to generate any dataset with just a sql query.

  
I think most people who would be using it would be accessing from mobile devices and only using a desktop when they wanted to print off information so it needs to display well on mobile.

  
As of now the webhost which is being provided free of charge does not support Node.js. I can of course switch the host but free is a great price so if I can get something decent enough without moving that would be ideal.

Looking for framework suggestions that ideally don't require node. I'm certain that I will not be creating the most fantastic site ever seen but I have enough development experience that I expect I can get something that works and does what I need once I fight with it for a bit. To set myself up with the best chance of success, I figured the professionals who actually exist in this world might be able to give me some good advice on some options to look at.",PineappleTuesday,1hcab2f,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcab2f/developer_from_a_non_web_background_looking_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcab2f/developer_from_a_non_web_background_looking_for/,2024-12-12 01:55:35,2,0.75,2,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcab2f
webdev,"Alignment to a ""global"" grid?","I haven't ""laid out"" a website in some time and I'm starting work on a web app. A question popped up in my head: is it worth trying to align as much content as possible to a multiple of some base width/height (say 12px)? I.e., to a global grid of dividing the page up into multiples of 12, both horizontally and vertically? 

Traditionally, I've tried to align as best as possible but acknowledge that outside of more controlled layout contexts like cards and lists that relative alignment and spacing between elements would suffice. 

Honestly, I think it looks great when the content of the page seems to be universally aligned; it makes it much easier to parse and partition the page in my mind. 

One caveat is that the width of the viewport isn't guaranteed or likely to be a multiple of 12, but this isn't a complete deal breaker when you see that most elements could still be aligned and that the only elements touching the left/right borders would likely be containers and it's sufficient if their content is aligned.

My plan is to lay the page out with a combination of grid and flexbox, using grid for elements where there is a need for unambiguous arrangement, and then use multiples of the base unit (12) to space, pad or position things as best I can.

Please feel free to discuss and let me know if I'm way off track; I'd appreciate it.

webdev,Is there any way to efficiently query Firestore documents using both where() and limit() in React?,"I'm trying to optimize the read/writes from my restaurant management project, and I think I've run into a brick wall as they say.

I'm using Firebase as my backend, and right now I'm working on the process of fetching and displaying items on a Menu to customers. It's easy enough to get all documents in the 'items' collection. And if I wanted the customers to be able to sort by categories I can simply use filter() for client side field validation.

But what if I wanted to further optimize the reads I'm using up? I've thought about using limit() to either paginate or lazy load items in the menu so that at least the customer won't be getting all documents at once. However, since only the first *n* documents are loaded in, I can't properly use filter() since it will only show, say, items with a category of ""meat"" within the first *n* documents currently loaded as opposed to the first *n* items in the collection with category == ""meat"".

I've also thought about combining where() and limit() to get items of a specific category and maybe incrementally adding those objects to a variable within React. But wouldn't restaurant menus usually start by displaying all items, and give customers the option to sort after? Besides, if I get the first *n* items with no specific category first and then add the first *n i*tems of one category after, won't that run the risk of duplicating objects within the variable? Checking if the document id already exists before adding it in the variable would also defeat the purpose of optimizing my reads as much as possible since we'd still be getting, say, 20 documents for 14 items (if 6 items in the second query already exists in the variable).

I'm sure there are tools meant to solve this exact problem out there and Firebase even recommends services (albeit not free) in acknowledgement of their product's limitations, but I'm curious if anyone in this sub has any ideas or solutions that could help me.

I should also maybe add that this is merely a practice project, so this is really just me seeing if there's anything I missed before I give up and move on.",niye,1hc3usx,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc3usx/is_there_any_way_to_efficiently_query_firestore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc3usx/is_there_any_way_to_efficiently_query_firestore/,2024-12-11 20:56:39,1,0.6,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hc3usx

webdev,How I got out of tutorial hell,"Don't get me wrong, tutorials are important when you are first starting your web development journey. They should not be where/how you build the majority of your projects from.

This took me a long time to realize, I thought hiring managers and recruiters would find these projects interesting enough to give me a shot... I was very wrong.

This realization is what got me out of tutorial hell, I realized that re-building an already made product that showcased no effective problem-solving skills of my own was going to get me no where.

As someone who was in tutorial hell myself for a long time, I know how hard it is to think of what to build; it seems like everything that has a chance of being successful is already built.

What I found best to building a successful project was fulfilling these requirements:

1. I needed to be passionate enough to finish the project
2. It needed to serve a particular unpopular niche to have the best chance with establishing presence for SEO to eventually have organic growth.

What I landed on was a platform, similar to dribbble, where developers could easily find images from developers portfolios for inspiration.

This was:

✅ Something I was passionate about

✅ Serving a purpose within a particular untouched niche

Unfortunately, at the end I was left with a project with no users (of course) like a lot of projects we make. So I decided to take a leap and do what is known as ""building in public"".

I made an X account, started to find users apart of the niche and directly messaged them about my project. This did not work at first as everyone's always a little skeptical being the first user on a new website.

As I continued to publicly market my product on X, I decided to find ways to market my product directly to users email inboxes.

Where I struck gold was finding this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios)

This single repository got me my first 20+ users that helped establish the foundation of my site.

The repository is filled with developers who uploaded their portfolio link, along with their name, to be publicly showcased. This was my niche served to me with no fluff.

The approach I took was sincere when emailing users from this repository, clearly stating how I came across their email address, and portfolio site and why I thought they would be interested in my site.

Within the email, I also included positive feedback I had from their site as I did have to browse it to find their email address.

From this, I was then able to continue ""building in public"" with a decent enough level of success by eventually getting 80+ users and about 20k monthly visitors for my first month after launching my project.",yeahimjtt,1hc2fv1,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc2fv1/how_i_got_out_of_tutorial_hell/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc2fv1/how_i_got_out_of_tutorial_hell/,2024-12-11 19:57:35,63,0.79,63,0,36,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hc2fv1

webdev,Are Microservices Feasible for a Budget-Conscious SaaS Project?,"Hi all,

I’m building a SaaS platform and considering whether to use a microservices architecture or stick to a monolithic approach for the initial release. The platform involves several domains, such as user accounts, profiles, search, bookings, notifications, and payments, each of which could theoretically be its own service.

**The Challenge:**  
I’m working with a tight budget, and I also plan to set up multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production), meaning hosting costs will multiply for databases and services. Additionally, I’m currently a solo developer, so while I see microservices as a great learning opportunity, I recognize they might not be strictly necessary for my initial launch.

For context, I expect the launch period to handle no more than 10000 users, and that's if things go absurdly well. I’m not sure at what scale microservices actually make sense in terms of benefits outweighing the added complexity.

One idea I’m exploring is using a single shared database backing domain-based services split into an ECS cluster. This could help me reduce hosting costs while still giving me a microservices-style structure. However, I want to avoid building myself into a corner where a future refactor to full microservices becomes unnecessarily painful.

**Questions:**

1. Is a monolithic architecture a better starting point for a SaaS project with budget constraints and modest user expectations?
2. If I go with a single database backing multiple services, are there pitfalls I should watch out for?
3. If full microservices are worth pursuing, what are the most cost-effective options for hosting databases for each service?
   * Managed cloud databases like AWS RDS or Cloud SQL seem ideal but expensive for multiple services.

webdev,"I don't produce optimal algorithms, how crucial is this in web dev? (Junior)","Junior full stack dev (back-end oriented) with 1.5 years of experience in freelancing.   
I've recently started applying for full-time jobs, and they assess using coding problems. I get to the solution, but it is not optimal. In my little work experience, I've always been focused on getting things done in an appropriate time and resource, but not on optimizing them to the fullest.

I've started recently to improve that by working on Leetcode problems but I still struggle with the output optimality, and I take a long time to solve even with easy problems.

My question is:

1- Is algorithm optimality a crucial factor in full-stack/back-end positions? Should my focus be targeted at something more important like working more on the languages/frameworks?

2- Through practice, does this get better? My brain seems to get lost in working on complex algorithms and resort to brute force when blacked out. And, I still never got the hang of dynamic programming.

  
Appreciate your insights!

webdev,"I’m afraid to open source the data for my website, should I be?","I have made a free price comparison website for SaaS dev tools. And as the different categories and all the providers keep growing it will reach a point where keeping this up to date stops scaling time wise for me alone.

The project is still small-ish, but its growing and the requests for adding and updating data is growing as well.

So I’m thinking of open sourcing the pricing data so others can contribute if they want to, to keep the data up to date, and letting people add new categories or providers themselves.

But my worries is that in the day of AI assistants like v0 and bolt, the data source will be used to copy my little site and that it will be overtaken by others.

Is this a legit worry, or is the potential upside of having the tool grow and be a good resource for the community too great?

The target audience is developers so most of them can copy this pretty easily, its not complicated code. It’s the gathering of data that stops the copies I think.

I’ve been thinking of adding APIs for adding data as well, but I dont really think people will use that, what do you think?

We also have 3 environments, stage, beta, and production but we deploy features by batch and some features that are ready to be deployed cannot be deployed first since we are deploying by batch/sprint.  
So right now, we are thinking of ways on how to speed up the deployment process. May be we could have different branches for each feature and merge it to stage branch for staging, once the staging is done, we could cherry pick the commit for the feature branch and merge it to the beta branch. Once done, cherry pick the commit and merge to production branch.

webdev,Easy Automated Image Gen on the Web,"I have written some python code that generates a few .png using matplotlib with some data I get from an API. I want to regenerate these images daily, and share them with one or more people. Currently this involves me sending an email every day. I'd rather have it hosted on the web where it's easily accessible.   
  
Two questions: 1.) Is there a photo hosting site that has an API I can automatically upload them to? If so, I assume you can program a computer to automatically run some python code at a set time each day, what would I search to learn more about this?  
  
2.) Some of the parameters are customizable, so I'd rather have a little website that allows the other person be able to adjust some parameters and generate the images on the fly. Is Django the best way to get this done? If so, should I host it on a VPS or is there a simpler place to run this web app? Theoretically, these plots/data have monetary value, so I'd eventually want to lock it behind a login as well. I know this seems like I might be biting off more than my amateur self can chew. But I am happy to learn along the way of this process. I don't care if it takes me a few weeks to make all of this work.

webdev,"I want to create a website that's essentially a mix of debateart, kialo and lichess","I'm well aware this may not be realistically viable. But just in case it is, I'm asking here.

I want to create a website that's essentially a mix of these three sites: https://www.debateart.com/ https://www.kialo.com/ https://lichess.org/
A site where you can create or join timed matches (much like in lichess, with different time controls and ratings) to debate virtually any subject you like.

But during the debates, instead of each person having day(s) to come up with a big block of text like in Debateart, the debates will generally be much faster and structured like they are in Kialo, making it very systematic.

Voters, instead of having to read the whole debate to have any input, can vote on individual arguments in the kialo-esque chart according to their relevance, validity, soundness and impact on the parent claim. They can vote on as many or as few arguments as they want, perhaps restricted by whether or not they've voted on the child arguments.

I have some other ideas for it as well if it's possible, but what I've described so far is the main part.

I looked into Odoo, Yola and Webflow but it seems like they won't work. How can I make a complex site with almost no experience? And I would prefer to do it for free or on a low budget.

\- having the ability to rotate each radial menu as a form of selecting something (selection at the top of the concentric circle)  
\- the child elements need to look like they are buttons.  
\- 6 elements per menu/concentric circle  
\- each element need to be spaced out and have a custom width and still look exactly as in the example above.  
\- the larger the concentric circle, the move space each element need to have in between.

I have managed to create the circle, and  managed to rotate the.

The issue is when I try to add the child elements that represent different options. It just doesn't click with me.

From my understanding, I need to bring each element at the border of the circle...

webdev,Is anyone using Processwire with Laravel for authentication?,"Hey All,

I've recently gotten into Laravel, and I love it. It was very easy setting up a previous project using it as a backend to a nextjs frontend. The documentation was great on this front.

I have a pet project now where I really want to use Processwire as a CMS in conjunction with Laravel for authentication only. ***I'm just curious how many here have done this, and if there are any pointers that can be offered? How well is it also working out for you?***

I know how to implement the appropriate table migrations for the Laravel part within the existing MySQL database that Processwire uses - as these will the be same kinds of tables I want to use as I did on my previous project. However, I want to bypass any and all authentication and user management that processwire does. 

Appreciate any advice.

webdev,"Warning, Smartrmail app contains 'bad' automatic permissions in the terms &amp; conditions, and will plant your business's email in everyones' spam.","I recently made a giant mistake by downloading this one Shopify add-on app... right from that wholesome official Shopify app store.

I recently decided to try out this marketing app, Smartrmail (bad idea). I have to say... the experience was so negative, that I felt the need to protect fellow store owners.

Once you download the app, you'll notice the option to create a password for your account (recommended by the app for ""security purposes"" lol). Once you create a password, you'll never be able to delete your account or change the email attached. Not kidding.

The option to delete your account isn't available. You cannot remove your important business-email from this account profile. The option isn't available. You will be stuck.

Next, they'll start sending shitty emails from a shitty template from your email address, because you agreed to 'let' them by checking the box that says ""I agree to these terms and conditions."" They will send emails to every single one of your customers, and the emails look TERRIBLE.

This is so heinous, I had to dig deeper. The company was active about three years ago in late 2020, and then closed it's doors. The application business, Smartrmail, was acquired in 2023 by new owners. At the bottom of the page, the app claims to be owned by Intercom (Google showed it as an AI chat bot business for retail), however, there isn't any proof anywhere else on the web that shady ass Smartrmail is ACTUALLY owned by Intercom. The Shopify app store says it's owned by a company called Relay. So, who is who? We just don't know yet.

Worse, this app has received 500+ 5 star reviews... yet their official youtube channel has less than 100 views total for the three half-ass AI videos they have up. All of them use AI voices. Why on earth wouldn't anybody want their actual name/face or voice affiliated with Smartrmail. Is there something wrong with it? I'm still seriously considering calling the US &amp; Australian FBI, this app is sooooo effing shady. It blows my mind the Shopify app store approved it... yikes

I care about this community, so that's why I'm recommending you stay away from this super-scam Smartrmail app on Shopify. You deserve better. We all do. I love Shopify as much as the rest of us. I can't believe Shopify is letting this app continue... so embarrassing for them.

Don't believe me? Log-out, and open a separate, free 30-day Shopify trial using a dummy email address, and see for yourself. You'll see what I'm talking about. This app is designed to hurt sellers.

I work for a marketing company that manages multiple businesses, and one of my responsibilities is flagging Google reviews that breach Google's policies and following up with Google based on the outcome.

The main challenge is that this is a manual process—we have to log in to each client account and perform this task individually. I’ve noticed that some other platforms offer a dashboard where users can flag specific reviews and receive feedback on Google’s response regarding those reviews. If Google’s reply is negative, these platforms allow users to provide additional information through the same dashboard to support their reason for flagging the review.

I know this process can be done manually via a business’s Google My Business (GMB) account and the Google Reviews Management Tool to submit more information for a review. However, I’ve searched extensively and can’t find any information in the Google API that would enable the above scenario programmatically.

This makes me wonder if these other companies are falsely marketing their dashboards and actually have someone manually performing the process in the background, while simply updating the dashboard with Google’s feedback.",startup4you,1haol26,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haol26/is_programmatic_review_flagging_possible_via/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haol26/is_programmatic_review_flagging_possible_via/,2024-12-10 00:10:21,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haol26
webdev,"YACPD question: I know this has been asked many many times over the last decade or so, but I'm going to ask it again. I'm curious about your experiences with the current cross-platform SDKs","Disclaimer: I intend to build POC apps in my short list to come to my own conclusion, but I would like your opinions in case i've over looked something.

I've always had a native-firsts stance, so I haven't needed a cross-platform solution for a while so i am a bit out of date on the current state of affairs, so i'd like any constructive feedback

I'm currently considering:

- flutter
- kotlin compose/native
- nativescript

My thoughts so far:

**Flutter**

Pros: 

- I've always loved flutter from the pre-beta version
- Their rendering model is very interesting
- Dart is perfectly boring in the best sense of the way. It is familiar whether you're coming from java, javascript, or some other algol-inspired language. it can be quickly adopted by other developers in an afternoon or so
- It is a very opinionated language which eliminates unnecessary conversations about how to do things
- Their web output is finally stable


Cons: 

- State management and design patterns have been questionable in the past and change often. 
- Using canvas for the web output feels icky but that's a knee-jerk reaction and they seem to have addressed accessibility issues

**kotlin**

Pros: 

- Jetbrains understands developer needs and have vastly improved the android ecosystem. 
- Kotlin fixes java and is a fun language

Cons: 

- Kotlin has a large learning curve for new devs because there are so many features. 
- Web and iOS are not yet to a stable state

**nativescript**

Pros:

- It seems robust and stable
- It supports many FE tools

Cons:

- I have no experience with it


**Things i've ruled out (but can be convinced otherwise)**

- react native
- ionic
- anything that uses a web view",anus-the-legend,1haogom,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haogom/yacpd_question_i_know_this_has_been_asked_many/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haogom/yacpd_question_i_know_this_has_been_asked_many/,2024-12-10 00:04:27,1,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1haogom
webdev,Launched an Open Source Tool on Product Hunt. Want to share why I built it.,"Over the past year of building AI-enabled SaaS applications, I kept hitting the same wall. Going from a Jupyter notebook full of AI RAG techniques to something usable in my app was a nightmare. I'm sure if anyone here has taking a look at llama-index or langchain cookbook sections you might understand what I'm talking about.  
  
I came to the conclusion that this is the problem:  
\- Notebooks are great for testing ideas, but they’re not meant for building applications around them.  
\- I had to manually dissect notebooks, build a proof-of-concept API server, integrate it into my app, and pray it worked.  
\- The feedback loop was \*painfully\* long—and most of the time, I canned the project because it didn’t quite fit.  
  
This frustration comes from a gap in roles:  
1. Data Scientists/AI Devs want notebooks to experiment with methods and techniques—but it's not their main focus to also create an API for other applications to use.  
2. App Developers just want simple APIs to test and integrate quickly to see if it actually enhances their app.

This is where KitchenAI comes in. A tool that bridges this gap by transforming your AI Jupyter notebooks into production-ready API server in minutes.  
  
But why??  
\- Shorter Development Cycles  
Test, iterate, and deploy AI techniques faster and cut the feedback loop in half.  
\- Vendor and Framework Agnostic  
Use the libraries you’re comfortable with, no lock-ins.  
\- Plugin Architecture  
Extend functionality with plugins for evaluation frameworks, observability, prompt management, and more.  
\- Open Source and Local-First  
Built on trusted technologies like Django, so you stay in control—no 3rd-party dependencies required.  
\- Docker-Ready  
Share your API server as a lightweight container for easy collaboration.  
  
We’ve released KitchenAI as an Apache-licensed open-source tool, so anyone can use it. Up next is a managed cloud version with deeper integrations, metrics, analytics, and workflows for teams with more complex needs. One short term goal is to go straight from colab to a KitchenAI cloud hosted API so development can be absolutely seamless.

1. Any recommendations for a free open source API I can use to test and implement the system?


2-  What security risks should I be aware of (e.g., API key exposure), and how can I mitigate them?


3- How can I ensure scalability in tracking requests and maintaining uptime? 


4- Any tips for managing API limits and DevOps processes for a system like this?


I’d appreciate any advice or resources. Thanks!

webdev,Ecommerce choice for almost 500k monthly visitors?,"Hey, I am currently in process of building a rather heavy ecommerce that will have a lot of features ( including all normal ecommerce features such as shipping, stock management, order status types, user registration, loyalty features etc). And I will likely need something really strong and customizable, I will also need something that I can go headless route which will allow me to decouple front from back.

Shipping and order management should be something I can fully customize though (like offer free shipping after a certain amount, set order status to what shipping method is used).

There will also be recurring payments, which will be monthly, bi weekly or weekly depending on user package (they will be just a small part of the shop though, I can set the recurring payments via stripe or paypal if needed).

Shop will be operating in Europe and will likely end up being a multi store type shop (different for every country it will operate in, not many countries max 4).

So far I have checked out Shopify Plus, Shopware 6, Medusajs etc.

Shopify Plus while good doesn't really seem to fit the criteria for my project considering client doesn't want to pay monthly for addons and such so I've ruled it out. 

I did look at Medusajs but to be honest it seems like it lacks so many features out of box that most shops have, it lacks category nesting (based on what I have seen) which is something I really need to have.

Shopware 6 to me seems like a good choice, since it is customizable enough for it to work for me and headless seems like a good enough option for it. 

I have ruled out some things like Woocommerce (too slow and can't rely on its security), Magento 2 (too much dev time) and PrestaShop.

My question is, is there anything better and faster considering project scope than Shopware 6? 

Thank you very much for reading.

Edit: I do have the option of going for custom solution backend which is indeed likely the best choice when it comes to this project?

webdev,I Built a WordPress Plugin to Solve My Own Problem—Looking for Feedback on How to Share It ,"Hey Reddit!

I’ve recently built a WordPress plugin, and I’m at the stage where I could really use your advice on how to productize and share it with others.

Here’s the backstory: I was developing a WordPress plugin, and every time I made a small change, I had to:  
1️ Zip the folder  
2️ Upload it to WordPress  
3️ Install it  
4️ Activate it  
5️ Test

And I was doing this *every 2-3 minutes.*

Coming from modern frameworks like Vue, where **hot reloads** are standard, this felt painfully outdated. So, I decided to create something that would let me just push my changes to GitHub and have it automatically sync and deploy.

That’s how **RepoSync** was born—a plugin that simplifies WordPress development workflows. It’s functional and ready to go! Here’s what it does:

* **Auto-syncs with GitHub** so you can skip the zip-upload madness. Just push ti Github and your plugin will be updated automatically
* Supports **private repos**, even on the free tier
* Lets you connect to **specific branches**
* Keeps the setup super simple so anyone can use it (no setting up web hooks, just a simple oauth approval with read permissions)

There are other tools on the market, but I found them either missing key features (like auto-sync or private repo support), were too tedious to set up, or too expensive for what they offer.

**Here’s where I need your help:**

* **How should I productize it?** I’m considering a **generous free tier** (maybe limiting to 1-2 plugins/themes but including private repos) and offering both **recurring and one-time payment options**. Most of the others only have a subscription which I hate. I'd rather pay a one-time fee.
* **What’s the best way to share it with the community?** Should I go all in on the WordPress marketplace, or are there other avenues I should explore?

I’m also looking for **beta testers**, so if this sounds like something you’d use, let me know—I’d be happy to share the full version with you for free.

webdev,Questions about interfacing with OAuth and Azure,"Hey all! Will be posting this to an Azure subreddit too, but since half of the problem is mine as a dev, thought somebody here might be able to help...

For the past 3 years, have been providing single sign-on to a site I run for a client who uses Azure for their employee logins. That was a big learning curve for me as a dev (first work with Azure SSO), but it's been going great since. The expiry for the original certificates is coming up quickly, though, and the closer we get the more I feel like rollover is a situation of ""the blind leading the blind"". Hoping somebody here might have experience from the admin and developer side and be able to provide some perspective.

My understanding is that the usual rollover goes like this... They add a new cert with a later expiry, and add it as a secondary in Azure. They send it my way (they sent it in an XML document). When I'm set, I swap out the old cert for the new, things for the site continue unabated, and once everything's stable they can make the new cert primary and delete the old.

It appears that on their end they've only got ""active/inactive"" for certs, though. They're saying that I can't use the new cert while it's inactive, and activating the new one will deactivate the current one. Apparently they usually do the switch with a scheduled, simultaneous change on both ends. That sounds nuts to me.

So, first question is am I missing something here? I'd be happy to support their system by keeping a primary and fallback cert on my end, and trying the fallback if the primary fails, but in that case could use a little guidance on what going to a fallback looks like for OAuth (in particular, how to deal with the fact that trying the primary I believe consumes the authorization code). Any resources would be greatly appreciated.

Second question... When we started this whole thing the admin on their end had me send a PFX including the certificate for the key we're signing the client assertion with. That will also be expiring soon, so I assumed I'd need to get a new cert to them as well. They're saying there's no ""spot"" for that and they don't think they need an updated certificate.

webdev,"Stream Postgres changes to AWS SQS, GCP Pub/Sub in real-time","Hey all,

We just added AWS SQS and GCP Pub/Sub support to Sequin. I'm a big fan of both systems so I'm very excited about this release. Check out the quickstarts here:

* [https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/sqs](https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/sqs)
* [https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/gcp-pubsub](https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/gcp-pubsub)

**What is Sequin?**

Sequin is an open source tool for change data capture (CDC) in Postgres. Sequin makes it easy to stream Postgres rows and changes to streaming platforms and queues (e.g. SQS, Pub/Sub, Kafka):

[https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin)

**Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub**

So, you can backfill all or part of a Postgres table into SQS or Pub/Sub. Then, as inserts, updates, and deletes happen, Sequin will send those changes as JSON messages to your SQS queue or Pub/Sub topic in real-time.

**FIFO consumption**

We have full support for FIFO/ordered consumption. By default, we group/order messages by the source row's primary key (so if \`order\` \`id=1\` changes 3 times, all 3 change events will be strictly ordered). This means your downstream systems can know they're processing Postgres events in order.

For SQS FIFO queues, that means setting `MessageGroupId`. For Pub/Sub, that means setting the `orderingKey`.

You can set the `MessageGroupId`/`orderingKey` to any combination of the source row's fields.

**What can you build with Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub?**

* **Event-driven workflows**: For example, triggering side effects when an order is fulfilled or a subscription is canceled.
* **Replication**: You have a change happening in Service A, and want to fan that change out to Service B, C, etc. Or want to replicate the data into another database or cache.
* **Kafka alt:** One thing I'm really excited about is that if you combine a Postgres table with SQS or Pub/Sub via Sequin, you have a system that's comparable to Kafka. Your Postgres table can hold historical messages/records. When you bring a new service online (in Kafka parlance, consumer group) you can use Sequin to backfill all the historical messages into that service's SQS queue or Pub/Sub Topic. So it makes these systems behave more like a stream, and you get to use Postgres as the retention layer.

**Example**

You can setup a Sequin sink easily with [sequin.yaml](https://sequinstream.com/docs/reference/sequin-yaml#sequin-yaml) (a lightweight Terraform – Terraform support coming soon!)

Here's an example of an SQS sink:

    # sequin.yaml
    databases:
      - name: ""my-postgres""
        hostname: ""your-rds-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com""
        database: ""app_production""

        password: ""your-password""
        slot_name: ""sequin_slot""
        publication_name: ""sequin_pub""
        tables:
          - table_name: ""orders""
            sort_column_name: ""updated_at""
    
    sinks:
      - name: ""orders-to-sqs""
        database: ""my-postgres""
        table: ""orders""
        batch_size: 1
        # Use order_id for FIFO message grouping
        group_column_names: [""id""]
        # Optional: only stream fulfilled orders
        filters:
          - column_name: ""status""
            operator: ""=""
            comparison_value: ""fulfilled""
        destination:
          type: ""sqs""

After just making a super basic SPA I found working regards to images to be quite frustrating. I am familiar with the myriad of devices and screen sizes that need to be accommodated, but I am quite rusty. I am now thinking that for my portfolio I should start with a few websites that dont even have subjects in their images, but instead are just big colored X's that pertain to a certain image size so I can get the hang of this again. Thats practical right? I am rediscovering how switching from one content pane with images, to another with form inputs, will expand and contract the parent container and I need to revisit my understanding on this topic. 

On the other hand, I was also wondering if anyone knows of any resources or tutorials that do a deep focus on web development with respect to working with just images? It would be nice to learn more about how the web isnt all JPG, PNGs, SVGs, anymore, and whatever else has changed over the last 4 years since I have been in school. I did a search on this forums but I didnt find any resources that truly focused on this subject with great emphasis. 

Backstory- I used to manage a PHP/HTML/CSS/JQuery/WP website for a medium sized non-profit before COVID shutdown the company. I went back to school to earn a degree, landed a backend dev job, but then that company started hemorrhaging money and I am now seeking to go into Full Stack development by making a portfolio of projects using React/Node with BS5.

webdev,Need advice and guide for amateur web development,"To keep it to the point, I'm looking for a solution to a problem I'm having with the hosting of my multiple WordPress websites

Basically, currently, my relative, who is a professional dev developer has been managing these for me by hosting them on his own server. There are 4 websites and are all wordpress. I've learnt how to use WordPress too now so the daily working of the websites was never an issue. The relative out of his own goodwill bought these and pays for them, however they are only for my small businesses and non profits

Unfortunately, since the last few weeks, he has gone AWOL and his server has completely crashed with none of the websites online. This has obviously caused me a lot of loss already, and due to me having no clues how hosting works, i am unaware of what to do

I have already informed him that I'll be taking over the hosting from him, and he has agreed to that. However, I would really appreciate any guide or help on how this process works, and even any guidance on which hosting service should I use, considering I have 4 websites out of which only 1 is heavy

webdev,"High-level architecture of my point-of-sales app (Vue, IndexedDB, Electron &amp; React Native + Laravel)","I've been building a point-of-sales app that works on iPads, Android devices and Windows systems, and I drew up a high-level architecture diagram to show you.

At the core sits a Vue SPA, that gets wrapped in:

* Electron for Windows/MacOS builds
* React Native for Android and iOS builds

[High-level architecture of our POS app](https://preview.redd.it/n3s58yejau5e1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6912edbafd36ace6bfe35d1c68efeb39de887fbf)

Both the React Native app, and the Electron app have a shared NodeJS component, that allows the SPA to communicate with devices on the network using TCP for example.

This way, our app can communicate with peripherals like thermal printers and payment terminals.

Since React Native doesn't come with a NodeJS runtime, we ship [NodeJS mobile](https://nodejs-mobile.github.io/) with it, and this entire setup allows me to share \~95% of my entire codebase for all platforms.

webdev,Full-stack dev looking to go solo - advice needed,"Hey fellow developers! 👋

I'm a technical lead with 5 years of experience building financial software and enterprise applications. I love turning complex business problems into elegant solutions, and I'm looking to branch out on my own.

My stack:

* Backend: Symfony/Laravel (built multiple enterprise apps)
* Frontend: NextJS/React (created dynamic form systems)
* Plus the usual suspects: Docker, AWS, Git, etc.

I'm particularly good at:

* Building smart form systems that adapt based on user input
* Integrating with external APIs and services
* Modernizing legacy systems
* Making complex processes simple and user-friendly

Instead of just looking for regular contract work, I'm interested in:

1. Finding companies whose problems I can solve (and potentially turn solutions into products)
2. Building relationships with businesses that need ongoing development support
3. Creating systems that can be repurposed for similar companies

I've already built a solid Symfony/NextJS starter template to hit the ground running. What I need now is to find the right companies to work with.

For those who've gone solo: How did you find your first real clients? Any specific industries or approaches you'd recommend?

webdev,I created this all-in-one JSON Toolkit,"This post might come across as a bit self-promotional, but I created this tool for personal use, and some of my colleagues have found it helpful. It's mainly for developers and testers, so I think r/webdev is a good place to share it, and I hope it will be useful to others too.

This tool addresses some pain points I face when developing, debugging, or testing features that involve JSON data.

* I often need to search for each key whenever I get the data, so I built a way to query multiple keys at once.
* It's difficult to remember deep paths to locate my data, so I built a JSON viewer that lets me extract any path by simply clicking on the key.

Some might argue that I should use Postman test scripts or Postgres' `json_extract_path`. But I find these solutions better suited for stable APIs or data. When I’m developing a new feature or debugging an issue, the target field can pop into my mind at any moment. So I prefer to quickly access the field and the data directly, rather than having to write a Postman script or SQL query.

webdev,update on my open-source social media scheduler,"Hi everyone, I built a little bit more into my open-source free scheduler :)

Postiz is an open-source social media scheduling tool that offers scheduling on the following:

Instagram, YouTube, Dribbble, LinkedIn, Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, Threads, X, Slack, Discord, Mastodon and BlueSky.

[https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app)

There are some cool new features:

* Option to add stories to Instagram and tag people for collaboration.
* Customer separation - you can group accounts per customer, and when you schedule, you can filter by customer.
* Option to tag companies on LinkedIn (I wanted to tag people also, but it was not possible)
* Fixes for different social media posts failing.
* **Introducing Plugs!** This is a concept you can find in other tools that can boost your engagement for your current posts. Here are some examples:
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, repost it (to regain visibility to it)
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, add another message to it (all your existing commenters will get a notification)

**What's next:**

* Public API - I have been too lazy to make it, I have to push more :)
* One Inbox - so you can reply to all your messages from one place.
* Google My Business provider
* AI Agents - I am still trying to figure out what to do with it, but it looks interesting.

webdev,Offering financing to clients,"Own a digital agency and IT consultancy. 

Something I've thought about for a while is offering finance options to clients. For example, if an ecommerce site costs £30,000, they could put down a deposit and spread the cost, say £1000 a month for 36 months (subject to credit check). Clients wouldn't gain ownership of anything until it is paid off entirely.

Another alternative is potentially leasing whereby we include maintenance and hosting but the monthly is indefinite. They'd commit to a minimum time period and keep paying after this to keep the site active or start again and rebuild. 

Changes outside of the agreement would be billed at ""x"" amount extra for the remaining agreement months. 

Could offer this by partnering with a bank/broker potentially. Contracts would have to be watertight. 

Drawback - debts die with the company if it folds unless we enforce a personal guarantee. 

Thoughts?

webdev,Help needed - Embassy Appointment ,"Need help

Hello,
I have been trying to get a germany study visa appointment for the last six months. All the appointments get taken in a few seconds. I have tried everything. I had to defer my semester and now the deadline is going to pass again. 
The problem is that there is a server side limit of 3 seconds before which you can't submit the captcha and appointment form. Considering this limit, the earliest you can submit the form after the appointments are open is 4 seconds (one second to click the appointment slot, open the form and fill it; and 3 seconds wait before the submission). I have many a times clicked the submit button at exactly the 4 second mark, but still no luck . 
I was told that there are some people who have somehow bypassed this limit and they can submit the form and captcha from the client side before the 3 second limit. They book all the appointments. 
I don't know if this is true. But if someone can confirm this or help me, i would be eternally grateful.
Here is the link to the appointment website:

webdev,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow?

webdev,Do you know where i can find a solid Full Stack Pre-built Chat App? (next.js &amp; shadcn),"Hey everyone!
I’m working on a chat app built with Next.js/Supabase/Shadcn (Tailwind + Radix), and currently, the UI is built from scratch, using Supabase (with their websocket). 
It works, but I’m looking for something more solid in terms of both backend and frontend (logic and UI)

—FRONTEND—
I’m searching for a library or package that:
- Provides a ready-to-use and robust UI for a chat app (paid options are totally fine).
- Handles common behaviors efficiently, like:
1. Fetching older messages while keeping the scroll position intact
2. Auto-scroll to the bottom when a new message arrives
3. Maybe even built-in gestures or animations to improve the UX.
- It's highly customizable, similar to shadcn: I want to copy/paste components into my project and have the freedom to tweak them directly, rather than being tied to a rigid external library.

webdev,I feel like I am losing my mind on this project,"This is a rant, but if anyone has any advice... please.  
  
I feel like I am losing my damn mind on this project. Im working off of some older, bloated code that has had so much scope creep it's turned into this monstrous ball of mud. I worked on a lot of the project, but the devs before me left some really weird design patterns and its garbage to work with. Not to mention, I'm integrating with some really old and crappy .net APIs that pretend to be REST but arent.

Every time I open my code editor to work on this project I feel like I suddenly get so sleepy and feel 0 motivation. If I try force myself to work on it and sift through the mess of code and functions I start to feel like Im going insane and want to have a full blown panic attack at what a mess everything is.

I feel like Im trying to untangle 500m of tangled earphone cords.

webdev,Consulting on a web dev niche technology vs overall web dev services?,"Hi all,

I am in the process of spinning up my own consulting / development shop and I am stumped on one thing and I would appreciate some advice from the group...

Should I focus my consultancy on the niche technology that I know very well (MyNicheTechConsulting.com) and only do work in that tech / framework, or should I broaden out to do whatever people need and will pay me for?

There is a part of me that thinks that focusing on the niche will pay off down the road, and that doing overall tech consulting will find me building wordpress sites for people, competing against every other firm on the planet.

That said, I hate to leave money on the table and if a potential customer needs X, Y, or Z I should be willing to provide X, Y, and Z.

I am asking this question mostly in the context of what services do I list that I offer on my website. I CAN do X, Z, or Z but part of me thinks 'marketing specialization"" on the website would pay off in the long term.

webdev,Tracking order section in a wordpress website ? ,"I am creating a website using WordPress. Basically as for now, the website is free and I am also using WooCommerce in the website. I am not a web developer. I don't have much knowledge. I am just building a website through WordPress and WooCommerce with the basic knowledge im getting through tutorials from here and there.

So my question is that I want to add a tracking service to my website. I am not sure of which delivery service will be used later. The question is that if I add a tracking order section into my website and the section includes the customer to add a tracking ID or whatever tracking data that the user enters, is it supposed to lead to the delivery service's own platform on which they can track the order? Is there any coding or plugins involved in such a thing if I want to include it into my website?
Or how does this whole process of creating such a tracking section goes on about? Any help would be really appreciated since I have zero knowledge about web development as a whole. :)

webdev,"Help! P2P Video Call App with React, Express, and Socket.io - Remote Stream Not Working","Hi all,

I'm building a P2P video call app using React, Express, and Socket.io. I've gone through several articles and tutorials, and I believe my setup is close to working, but I'm running into an issue. Everything seems to be functioning well, but I'm not receiving the remote video stream. There are no errors in the console, but the remote video doesn't display.

# Setup:

* **React** on the frontend for UI and WebRTC implementation.
* **Express** and **SocketIO** on the backend to handle signaling and peer connections.
* **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication (using STUN server for ICE).

# Logs:

From the server logs, I see that the peer IDs are being set successfully, and messages are being passed between peers.

Logs from Server: 

    [2024-12-08T08:34:19.378Z] Received message of type 'setPeerId' from Ub0_7yT_57X6Ngd7AAAS

    [2024-12-08T08:34:23.419Z] Received message of type 'candidate' from two_2x42mksyr6v

As you can see, the peers are getting connected correctly, but the remote video stream isn't showing up on the client-side.

# Steps I've Tried:

* Ensured that the remote video element is being updated with the incoming stream.
* Checked that the RTC connection is correctly handling the tracks.
* Verified that the signaling messages (offer, answer, and candidates) are being sent and received properly.

# My Question:

Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this issue? Why isn’t the remote video stream displaying, and what could I be missing in the WebRTC setup?

Any help is appreciated!

webdev,Framework for desktop-like approach to developing web applications?,"I'm an engineer in a classical sense, I work with signal processing equipment, system integration, and also implement and manage corporate infrastructure. I'm not a web developer by trade, and *have no such aspirations*. I do however occasionally write specialized utilities for the business.

I wish to ask for a very specific thing. I would like a framework that would allow me to develop applications that will display in a web browser, developed in a desktop application manner, meaning not like traditional web development with separation of front-end and backend, separated by an API. I would like my application code to be monolithic and application be ""rendered"" on the server. In other words, **I do not wish to (read: must not) write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, that should be handled by the framework.

**I found one such example:**

[**Webswing Demo**](https://prototype.webswing.org/webswing-demo/)

This is pretty much perfect, I'm very proficient in Java and Swing. But. My company will likely not adopt Java, and Java runtime.

**Are there other examples of this type of framework? How about something for scripting languages, like Python or PHP? Is there something like this for .NET?**

I have a much better chance of adopting something if the webserver prerequisites come from official RHEL packages repos (CentOS/Rocky/Alma). My company avoids 3rd-party stuff for security reasons.

webdev,Suggestions for developing a simple interactable line graph front end for an econometric model,"Hi I'm a total noob when it comes to web dev but I'm pretty technically savvy and can devote time to self teach. I have an econometrics model which I developed in R that queries Google Trends at a daily interval and then produces an output value using this data. I want to build a simple attractive web front end to display the output of this model in a line graph, that has some basic interactivity (change timespan, zoom in / out, mouse over line to see data value etc.). 

My needs aren't very esoteric / complex, so the simplest tool for the job would be great. What is the best way to do this for someone who is a bit of a web dev noob? I've looked at streamlit and shiny but I'm not sure if these would be the right tools for the job. The model is not very computationally expensive so can run on basically anything and requires very little storage. It would be a bonus if I could run it in some sort of containerisation system like Docker for portability. I'd appreciate any help!

I know that there are some optimizations that I could do to improve readability, but do people actually notice that? Like:  

- Reduce font weight - Often white text on black background has a perceived stronger font weight than black text on a white background.
- Allow for a light and dark mode toggle. (Dark and light mode toggle definitely would help some people, but how many, is it worth the time implementing it?)
- Reduce brightness of text - Text too bright on a dark background may be harder to read.

Do you think these changes could actually help here?

webdev,Best Tech Stack for Engineering Notes/Pages with Equations and Graphs?,"Hey all,  
I’m looking to build a website focused on engineering content, with lots of notes, equations, and visual content (graphs/images). My goal is to make navigation between pages *super fast*.

# My Experience

* I’ve worked with static and dynamic site generators like Astro.js, Gatsby, and Next.js.
* I’ve built single- and a few-page websites before but nothing too big yet.

# What I’m Thinking

* **Content Type:** The site will have lots of equations (thinking LaTeX in Markdown for simplicity and readability) and visual content like graphs and images.
* **Speed:** Priority is speed, especially when loading pages.
* **Approach:** Considering Astro.js for a fully static site to keep things fast, but I’m open to suggestions.

# Questions:

1. Is LaTeX rendered in Markdown a good approach for displaying equations? Any better options?
2. For images and graphs, what’s the most efficient way to handle them while keeping performance in mind (e.g., CDN, image formats like WebP)?
3. Should I consider other frameworks or approaches besides Astro.js for this use case?

Would love any advice or insights from people who’ve worked on similar projects!

Thanks in advance!

webdev,Looking for feedback! - Making (grant) expense tracking less painful,"**LINK:** [**https://grantkeeper.com/**](https://grantkeeper.com/)

Hey everyone 👋

After struggling with spreadsheets and scattered receipts while reporting to funders (mainly Innovate UK), I built GrantKeeper - a simple tool to help UK organisations manage their grant expenses and reporting.

It lets you:

* Upload and organize receipts/invoices
* Automated data extraction
* Track expenses and automatically handle currency conversion
* Export Excel with all your data and files
* Collaborate with team members on financial reporting

**Screenshots**: [https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png](https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png) / [https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png](https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png)

I've already worked with others receiving grants and it's turned a task which typically takes weeks into hours (and I want to make it better!)

I'm curious how others currently handle their expense tracking? Are you using spreadsheets, accounting software, or some other solution? Have you tried other specialised tools, and if so, what was your experience?

I know similar stuff exists, but in this case I've decided to start by targeting a niche before thinking about expanding it for more general use cases.

[https://hosts.click](https://hosts.click)  
This tool allows developers and website administrators to instantly test their website without editing the hosts file on their computer or waiting for DNS propagation.

# How does it work?

1. Enter your IP address and domain name.
2. Receive a temporary URL pointing to the new IP address.
3. Instantly preview your website as it will appear after the DNS change.

# Advantages:

* No need to modify the hosts file.
* Completely free to use.

webdev,Should modals be generated by javascript or should they be in the HTML and fed values from the javascript?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a high school student and a newbie full-stack developer working on building a website. Right now, my approach for modals is to define them in the HTML and then feed them values dynamically from my JavaScript when needed.

However, I recently came across a post that suggested it’s better to generate modals entirely with JavaScript instead of having them pre-defined in the HTML.

Whats the best practice here? Should I stick with my current method, or would switching to dynamically generating modals with JavaScript be a better choice? 

Ty in advance!

webdev,Built my own search engine,"Hi guys over the past few months I've managed to build my own small distributed search engine where users can crawl the web given a list of entry point websites, it uses BM25 for ranking each page that are saved in an sqlite database, the crawler and search engine are both made with golang and the web server and database server is built with nodejs. I've learned a lot these past few months and I still plan on improving this project because there are still some QOL functionalities that needs to be implemented like crawl canceling and resuming, a UI on the front-end to let the user's know which website's they've already crawled etc etc... and need to fix some bugs.

please read the README file if you need some help

I hope you guys could try it out and report if there are any bugs thanks!

webdev,Grey vs Gray,"Just curious what developers prefer the spelling of Grey vs Gray.  
I know this is very mundane, but when creating class names, I keep struggling with \`grey\` vs \`gray\`. I have noticed that other frameworks are also mix matched. I know that the U.S. prefers \`gray\` and the rest prefers \`grey\`, but from a pure developer perspective, what do you prefer and think is most common in the developer realm. There are also others that use something like \`muted\`, etc, but I prefer to be more specific about the name of the color.

webdev,Feedback wanted,"Hey everyone! 

I’ve been working on a fun project called [whothatpokemon.com](https://whothatpokemon.com) which is just a browser based game inspired by the iconic “Who’s That Pokémon?” challenge. I mainly built it as I'm looking to eventually teach others how to code and wanted a project that can be enjoyable to build. I know this has been done before in this community and I've added my own sort of twist to it. You can compete against friends online to see who can guess the most correctly. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes (currently limited to 1 on 1 matches).

I’d love to get your feedback on any of these areas:

* Gameplay: Is it fun and engaging? Is it too easy? I let my cousin who is a Pokémon fanatic a try and had to take the phone away from him because he was guessing them all too easily lol.
* Design: I tried to keep this area as cleaned up as possible but I'm also not a designer so it was a bit hard to be creative in this aspect.
* Features: What could make it better or more exciting?
* Bugs: If you run into anything that's not supposed to happen, please let me know. It also hasn't had any users yet since this is the first time mentioning it, so I was hoping this could be some sort of stress test as well.

  
I’m open to any ideas to improve the game or even expand on it (like leaderboards, new modes, or generation specific challenges).

If you do have some spare time please check it out, and let me know what you think. I’d really appreciate your input as I work on making it better.

webdev,"AI assistants / assistance, who owns your code","So I am increasingly using Chat GPT and it's got to the point I want to start using an editor based assistant that has access to my codebases. However I have a few serious concerns about this and actually about Chat GPT.

Let's start with Chat GPT and other chat bots that are separated from local data, is the code produced by these bots yours or theirs? Who owns the copyright? If it's theirs can you make enough changes to now own the code?

When it comes to AI integrated into an editor like VS Code, it says in on the VS Code website that your data (i.e your code) will be sent to Microsoft for them to feed into their model. I guess they have to do that to make it work at all, but again what is going on with copyright and security here? Do Microsoft now have access to your entire codebase, API tokens etc and do you have full ownership of the code it helps you write? This seems like a huge level of trust for a commercial non-partner operation to agree to, not to mention obvious security issues.

Are there any local AI models used by code editors that don't send your code to the likes of Microsoft?

webdev,The Google Calendar API is getting on my nerves...,"So I use ClickUp as my task management tool and Google Calendar to organize my day. I wanted to view all my daily tasks on my calendar and the inbuilt GCal integration that comes with ClickUp is buggy. So, being a developer I decided to put my skills to use.

I wrote a script that fetches all my open tasks from ClickUp that have a start date or a due date. It then fetches all my existing events from GCal. All the tasks fetched from ClickUp are created as events on GCal. The previously fetched events from GCal are all then deleted. This runs as a CRON every one hour on AWS Lambda (once an hour to stay within the free tier of AWS, ClickUp and Google APIs)

This runs flawlessly for a few hours after which the Google Calendar API that fetches all events from the calendar starts returning 0 events even though I have existing events on the calendar. As a result, older tasks don't get deleted from the calendar and I now have more than 20 duplicates of each task on my calendar.

Weirdly enough, if I delete the calendar and create a new one and pass the new calendar ID it again starts working flawlessly. This lasts for a few hours after which the same thing starts happening again. The Google Calendar API starts returning 0 events even though there are existing events.

webdev,Meet CSSformalize: Simplify Your Form Styling Workflow,"Hi [r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)!

Styling HTML forms can often feel like navigating a minefield. Achieving consistency across various states—such as active or focus—requires meticulous attention to detail. It's all too easy to miss a crucial style or struggle with the myriad of browser-specific prefixes like -webkit- or -moz-. This complexity can turn what should be a straightforward task into a tedious chore. Recognizing these challenges, I was motivated to create a solution that streamlines the entire process.

Thus, CSSformalize was born—a comprehensive open-source CSS framework designed to transform the way native HTML forms are styled. By leveraging CSSformalize, developers can effortlessly generate elegant and consistent form elements. This framework eliminates the need to memorize complex styles or write repetitive CSS code, offering a much-needed shortcut for both seasoned developers and newcomers alike.

webdev,Node or Springboot,"Hi Guys,

I'm thinking of adding a backend for my portfolio website (this is HTML and CSS only). My goal is to have a blog in my portfolio site.

Others said that use the tech stack that you already know. Well I know Angular 17 and Spring Boot for creating side projects.

Then others also said that it is overkill if I use a framework or library (React or Angular) for a simple website with backend (portfolio)

And also, I want to become a Java developer so I searched that most of job postings for Java position need to have knowledge on (HTML, CSS, JS/TS) or (React or Angular).

So what would you recommend?

1. Create the portfolio with vanilla js and node then all the side projects will be React/Angular and Spring boot.
2. Create all side projects with the tech stack Angular/React with Spring boot.


My purpose is to demonstrate or show to interviewer that I am knowledegeable on fundamentals of HTML CSS and JS when I show to them my portfolio.

webdev,Advice for building an app with Cloud Sync?,"Hey everyone,

I'm eyeing a project with Cloud Sync functionality as my next side project. I believe I have the skillset for most of the things the project needs except Cloud Sync, which I have never done before. I have done some googling and collected some articles covering different approaches but I would also like to ask what your recommendations would be for implementing this? 

Here is the project outline:

* Basically, the project will allow users to have an account and store a bunch of data the user enters in their client. This data is synced to all their devices, i e mobile apps and web clients where they have logged into their account.

* You cannot edit data from multiple clients at the same time in real time, but rather work from one client at a time. 

* Users don't have to be able to collaborate on editing the same data, rather each user has their own private data. A future addition might enable other users to see your data, but it's not required for now, and changes don't have to become visible to other users in real time.

* A central server and database keeps track of the data, enables login/auth etc. Probably gonna write this in PHP (Laravel) and postgres unless you tell me this is a bad idea.
* Data is viewed in a mobile app client and stored in a local SQLite database as well for scenarios when they don't have internet. If the user edits data offline, it will be synced the next time they come online. In the future, a web client will be added as well. Will write this in React / React Native because my strongest skillset is in Typescript / React.

* If the user opens another client than the one they're currently on, the current one will disable data entry in favor of the new one (user will be asked if they want to switch) so that they can't try to change the same data from multiple clients at the same time. The only way I have pushed events from a server to clients (in this case, user has opened another client so disable this one) has been with WebSockets but I assume this could be done another way too?

I would assume Cloud Sync can be implemented by adding time stamps to each row of data telling when that row was last edited, and then updating rows that have been edited after the last sync date on that device. Or would it better to pick up a ready made solution for this, and perhaps switch server technology accordingly? For example, if there is a good, readymade solution for Cloud Sync available via NPM I could write the server with express, feathers or what have you instead.

webdev,"Your first project, from a business owner's perspective","I recently decided to start my own online bakery. Because I have a background in programming, I also decided to make the website myself. After completing most of it, I realized that what I had learned would be valuable to people starting off. Often it is the case that new web developers aren't sure where to start. They aren't sure what kind of a project would look good to show potential employers. The following is a list of things I ended up needing for my site, each of which would be excellent things to code.

Order submit form.  
• Layout: I started out using a column design. It looked great on my PC, but once I switched to my phone, it was a garbled mess. First lesson: make sure your design works for everyone.  
• Updating totals: Whenever the user changes the number of ordered items from 1 to 2, update the subtotal. Take into consideration shipping and tax as well. Know what event to trigger this on. There is onchange and oninput, for example. Users are often able to bypass these triggers when they copy and paste data in. Know how to deal with that.  
• Restrict input: Should it only be numbers? Only letters? Only a certain length? Restrict it. Learn how to use regex also. It's scary at first, but it is powerful.  
• Autocomplete, required, and read-only attributes: Sometimes autocomplete ends up making your site look tacky; it makes a dropdown field appear and that can be confusing for some users. Other times, it's handy to use. Know when to use it and when not to. Fields like subtotal, shipping, taxes, and total should be read-only.  
• Pricing: Have a single, small file that contains pricing information if you have a small site, and source this into your order page. Price figures will be used in too many places to have you going through and updating the numbers everywhere manually - they are displayed next to the products and used in the equations to calculate pricing. Having them in a small file greatly simplifies things. Obviously if it's for a large site, use a database.  
• The backend: Don't trust user input. There are various ways to screen it to avoid SQL injections depending on the language you are using. Everything you did on the front end you need to do again on the backend, and more, concerning checking that number inputs are numbers, that inputs aren't too long, that email addresses are in fact email addresses (there is a regex for this), etc.  
• Database: Insert the order into a database to save it. You will learn about the different kinds of fields like int, tiny int, date, and datetime. You will learn what specific format is acceptable for something like datetime as well.  
• Invoice: Once complete, you should show an invoice to the customer, detailing everything that was selected. Showing invoices is actually part of the Visa guidelines, which business owners will care about if they are accepting credit card transactions. Taking this a step further, you can also figure out how to automatically email the invoice to them without too much trouble.

Payment  
• Composer: Know how to use this, as many payment gateways will have you install their payment SDK this way. Know that there can be issues with trying to install it through shell access from an ftp client. It's more ideal through the terminal on your server.  
• Payment Gateways: Look at the developer guides for various payment gateways like Stripe, [Authorize.net](http://Authorize.net), and Elavon. It's also a good idea to explore their customer service, as some of them are absolute garbage. Some of them have code for Ruby, PHP, C#, etc, but others will not have one or the other. Some will have SDK's that are so out of date that they expect developers to edit the code themselves. Read the comments on the github pages to see what people are saying about it.  
• PCI Compliance: Understand the different levels of PCI Compliance, specifically SAQ A, SAQ A-EP, and SAQ D. Try to spot if the payment gateway specifically states what level of PCI Compliance you can achieve using one of their methods. If I had any advice to give here, it would be this: SAQ D is a significant step up and requires a lot of time, money, and effort to achieve. Stick to the easier ones. Lastly, do NOT have any CC data hit your server. The payment gateway should give you a nonce to use instead or take you to an entirely different payment page on their servers.  
• CC guidelines: Look at the Visa, Mastercard, and American Express guidelines. They want you to display their logos on CC forms, have specific image files for them, want specific spacing around the logo's, and specific coloration, even for the background in some cases (where their logo would be not as visible). They are even specific about capitalizing the V in Visa, and not having it as all caps: VISA. Some of these guidelines don't absolutely have to be followed, but you may be required to follow some by the agreement you signed with your acquirer, for example. For you, the new student just getting your feet wet, you don't need to go so far as to read the terms and conditions to get all this, but you still can familiarize yourself with the guidelines and attempt to adhere to them. It also offers you the chance to elaborate on what you know about this subject in interviews.  
• CC spacing: Another thing that comes from the guidelines is the spacing of the numbers in a CC for an input field. 6589756425691215 is difficult to read, but 6589 7564 2569 1215 is much easier to read. Coming up with the code to make this work is a bit tricky as well. With some solutions, using Replace() can alter the caret position, which can be jarring to the user. Copy/pasting can also bypass the event you are trying to wait for. AE cards can have 15 digits instead of 16. Some fancy CC forms also update a logo to the right of the CC number to reflect the kind of card the user is attempting to use. What first seems like a simple form can turn into a completed amount of code.  
• CC expiration dates: They should be separate - one field for the month, one for the year; limited to numbers only; limited to two digits.  
• Security field: I believe most are 3 digits long, but AE's is 4.  
• Luhn algorithm: You can use this to verify if a CC number is typed correctly.  
• Hide CC: The most ideal way to do this is to have each number of the CC that is typed be briefly visible, then switch it to an asterisk ( \* ). Simply putting the input field type as hidden will not accomplish this. I believe this is also a consideration the CC issuers want you to take, but it's not absolutely required. Always nice if you can achieve it though.

Coupons  
As a coder, you might not think this is that big of a deal, but on the business side of things, you realize this is huge when it comes to Direct Mail. Businesses will want to send out fliers through the mail. Postage is expensive, so you begin to learn about programs like EDDM through the United States Postal Service. This allows businesses to send out many fliers at significantly lower cost. You also learn about paper weights and dimensions for what is acceptable. All of this costs money. It's about $200 to hit 650 residents just for the usps side of things. The actual mailers cost around 20 cents each. As a business owner, you do not want to be blowing all this money to end up with zero new customers. This is where coupons come in. Fliers are the perfect place to put coupons, and so your website then needs to be able to process them as well. Coupons will lessen the chance that your fliers are immediately trashed.  
• Just like with pricing, have a centralized location where coupon codes can be sourced from to validate them.  
• You need to display to the user that the coupon code applied. The pricing equation needs to know what to do to account for the reduced price.  
• Consider how many coupons a user can use in a single transaction.  
• Consider if that coupon code should be used up or if it's fine to use it with infinite transactions so long as its not expired.  
• Calculate it on the backend side as well. Have a spot in the database for it so the total price makes sense if you have to investigate a customer order for some reason.  
• Have a way to remove the coupon discount if they decide they don't want to use it yet.

Security  
Fraudsters will buy millions of card numbers off the dark web, find a website with bad security, then will try to run as many of them through with a $1 charge to see which cards are still good. If you allow users to run millions of cards through, you can not only be subject to thousands of dollars worth of fines, but the credit card issuers will also then view you as a problem. Every incidence of fraud creates a problem for them, so if you are the reason, they can and will bar you from making any future online credit card transactions. Just like that, your business will have gone straight down the toilet.  
• Log IP's: Every time someone tries to run a transaction through, even if it is unsuccessful, their IP address needs to be logged in a specific table.  
• Suspension: Once an IP address has exceeded the maximum attempts allowed, that IP address should be suspended for 24 hours from making any transactions at all.  
• Absolute limits: To prevent IP spoofing, there should also be a limit to how many transactions can be attempted overall for a given time period.  
• Be careful of setting the field that counts transaction attempts as something like a tiny int. An attacker could continue to attempt transactions, running the number up to 256 where it may roll back over to 1, thereby making the system think that IP address has not exceeded the maximum transaction attempts any more. Then they of course would try to run more credit cards through. Ideally, the transaction counter for a specific IP address should stop counting once that IP address has been suspended to prevent this from happening.  
• Log IPs first; do the transaction second. Imagine this: an attacker edits a field so that it submits a bad value, causing your page to crash; however, because you have written your code in such a way as to complete the transaction first, they are still able to run millions of cards through to check them, all while avoiding the IP logging part of your code. By logging the IP addresses first however, you lessen the possibility of this occurring.

Customer Retention  
• Allow users to sign up for your website. Have a profile, settings, and order history for their account.  
• Store passwords in an appropriate way, using cryptographic algorithms and a salt.  
• Have sign-ups for monthly promotional emails and also a way to easily unsubscribe from them.

When you lay all of these things out, it really does amount to a tremendous amount of code. An employer would love to see this kind of work in an interview. I hope this helps.",e-2c9z3_x7t5i,1h8s5qz,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h8s5qz/your_first_project_from_a_business_owners/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h8s5qz/your_first_project_from_a_business_owners/,2024-12-07 13:09:57,3,1.0,3,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8s5qz

I made a search term management tool that helps you go through the search terms for a campaign so you can find new entries for the negative keywords list.

This is an internal tool that I've build for my own use, and I'm offering it for free, so if it feels unpolished, it's because it is. Should there be interest in it, I'll gladly keep improving it and adding new features.

Although it works just fine without it, it is AI-aided, so if you follow the instructions and the tips on the page, it should give you decent suggestions for negative keywords, which should speed things up quite a bit. It's not perfect, but it made me realize I didn't have a clear delineation in intent for my campaigns. Your mileage may vary.

webdev,The Frustration of Front-End Work,"Lately, I've got into front-end again, and during my first project I’ve been feeling completely burned out because of all the planning mistakes that keep coming up. It’s not even about the coding itself; it’s those moments when you realize you forgot to plan for something important.

Planning layouts is always like this—you can’t predict every possible scenario for every element. There’s just too much to think about, and no one’s brain can handle that much detail at once. Trying to manage all those little things in a scale from 320px to 2880px is exhausting and eats up way too much time and energy.

What’s worse is that no matter how experienced I am (and I’ve been doing this for about 10 years), no matter what methods or tricks I use, I don’t feel like I’m improving at handling this chaos.

And then there’s the issue with designers. If the designer doesn’t understand how development works, everything falls apart. The project turns into a mess of quick, hacky fixes just to make things work, and after spending hours fixing things, it’s hard to tolerate the work at all.

webdev,Will Authentication always suck?,"The entire web dev scene is  coming to a point where authentication is annoying than ever. Something so simple in concept but the way it is being implemented has frustrated me to a point that I'm writing this because i want to know if it is only me who can't implement proper auth. 

I've used many authentication services across many architectures but in my 3 years of experience I've still not figured out a way or even guidelines that i can follow for implementing authentication across all my applications! Which completely sucks. Authentication is probably the one thing that is keeping me from developing any of my projects which is pretty stupid but if not implemented correctly it poses huge security risks.

  
So I'm writing this to well, maybe discuss what is your approach to authentication. 

  
For context, I'm a full-stack developer (MERN stack) and the problem i encounter is implementing cross-oirigin authentication, many MERN auth videos i see online they either only do it on the frontend or if they are adding auth to both the client and server, that approach is usually not practical or has security risks. I mostly succeed in adding auth to the frontend side, it is securing the backend where i usually screw up.

  
Also when i check the documentation of auth libraries (ex. clerk or next-auth) they lack documentation for client-server architecture and how to secure routes in both frontend and backend. I usually come up with my own route protection system when using any of these but again all types of questions are in my mind. 

**Is this conventional? Is this secure? Is this a good approach?**

  
Again it's not like I've not implemented authentication in a client-server architecture but it's these questions that make me doubt my way of doing things. Anyways would like to know your opinions on this!

webdev,Which field has the highest demand in freelancing,"Hello friends,

I am a Node.js backend developer with 2 years of experience. I want to start freelancing, but I have no idea how to begin. Based on a friend's suggestion, I created an account on Fiverr and made a simple gig.

My question is: which field has the highest demand in freelancing? I mean fields like frontend, backend development, WordPress, DevOps, data pipelines, data engineering, etc. I want to learn as many skills as possible so that I can set up my own business and avoid working as an employee for a company.

Over the past few months, I have met many people and attended several interviews, some of which were not even related to my field. For example, I gave a data engineering interview where I built an ETL data pipeline using Node.js, Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, and Postgres. I also interacted with companies that develop gambling websites, games, and even crack software to steal user data or bypass paid APIs for WhatsApp and Meta applications.

After working for 2 years, I have realized that most IT companies have middlemen who take a significant cut of the revenue, leaving employees with very little. I want to do something of my own.

I have a few friends who are frontend developers, full-stack developers, and UI/UX designers.

If you have any advice, please share it with me. I’d like to know what strategies I should use, which platforms I should focus on, etc.

I am not interested in frontend development, and I’m not good at designing UIs. I prefer backend development and want to explore more opportunities in server-side technologies. Should I explore fields like DevOps or data engineering?

Thank you.

webdev,working with users location,"tldr: ive got an app that asks the user for location and stores in a localstorage but its giving me issues. I'm looking for a write-up or some tips on how to handle users location within a react/next app. 

full story-

i plan on using location throughout the app, so I was planning on using a context. one issue is whether I should ask for location on load, which means any page that gets loaded would ask for users location, even on pages its not needed. for this I could add a second function in my context like fetchLocation and on pages location is needed, if !location fetchLocation. so now I need to check for this every page location is needed?

also, some people don't like to share location. In a way I don't want to bother with them, but I should try to handle this and at least handle it gracefully rather than have the page error. i was considering using an API call to try to get some location from an IP address, or maybe just let people pick a city they'd want to use

the main page for this is an events page that uses location and also can move a map and get lat/lng so there's some logic to change the event location. somewhere in there I'm getting things mixed up and on initial load the maps trying to load without either and erroring. maybe if the first two were worked out I wouldn't fall into this. but I'm clearly doing something out of order. for example when testing in incognito, the page fails as the request to use location is still on the screen.

webdev,Help me choose a stack for my freelance portfolio,"Hi folks,

I'm a freelance dev currently revamping my old portfolio - which doesn't really showcase my skills - and I have trouble choosing a stack for it.

Let me explain:  
I'm a front-end developer with a specialty with CSS / integrations but also a WordPress developer, so I do lots of PHP too. I'm really not used to JS Framework, either front or back end, so I could use this occasion to learn one !  
Since the goal of this website is to present both my front-end and my WordPress services, I'm not sure which way I can go.  
Basically, I've narrowed it down to these four choices :

* **A WordPress with a homemade ACF/Gunterberg theme :** Seems logical since I do lots of WP sites anyway.
* **Just a from scratch HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS website :** Simple enough, I can add a tad of PHP for a contact form. Not even a back-office to add projects, I could to it manually, old-school style.
* **Another CMS like ProcessWire :** An occasion for me to learn some more CMS and not to bother creating a back-office of some sort.
* **Use a JS Framework like Vue.js or React :** I feel way behind modern webdev and I could use a bit of experience. But it might be overkill for a simple portfolio. I could use a boilerplate to have a backoffice/admin and such

Soooo, if I promote among others services, Wordpress dev, it is better to go this way ? Or should I just learn something modern and new ?

Here's the list what they do (according to what i observed so far)  :-

1. **Deceptive Domain Availability**: When I searched for a domain, it was initially shown as cheap and available. However, shortly afterward, it was claimed as unavailable, marked as a ""premium domain,"" and priced ridiculously high.
2. **GoDaddy Monopolizes Domains**: I noticed that every domain I searched for was suddenly ""claimed"" by GoDaddy. Visiting these domains leads to their landing page, where they sell the domain at inflated prices or suggest hiring a broker—essentially forcing users to overpay for domains they initially showed as affordable.
3. **WHOIS Confirms Suspicious Practices**: When I checked WHOIS information for one of the domains, here’s what I found:

5. **Unfair Market Manipulation**: GoDaddy is deliberately creating scarcity by claiming domains people search for and reselling them at inflated prices. This is not just unethical; it’s exploitative and undermines trust in domain registration services.

💡 **What You Can Do**:

* Avoid GoDaddy at all costs! Use alternative domain registrars like Namecheap, Hostinger, Cloudflare or Porkbun.
* Be cautious when searching for domains, as GoDaddy seems to track interest and manipulate availability to force you to pay more.

⚠️ **Conclusion**:  
GoDaddy’s practices are a blatant scam, designed to exploit users searching for domains. They manipulate the market to extort money and provide no transparency in the process. Stay away from GoDaddy and use trustworthy alternatives instead!

this happen for all the domain i checked specially (.com) all the one also don't say .com are popular in demand then why it available and now its register then why now and why after i checked and why all and why all the domain are directing to godaddy not once to their registered owners website

here the live proof:

see they are telling to buy at high price it's okay this premium one i don't want but why do they claim anonymously the domain after i looked or searched on their website in one day even after 3 months the domain does not have a website only godaddy promotion this is for all domains i looked into",Invincible-Bug,1h85tfm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h85tfm/dont_buy_domains_from_godaddy_scam/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h85tfm/dont_buy_domains_from_godaddy_scam/,2024-12-06 16:51:46,995,0.92,995,0,543,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85tfm

After encountering performance issues with `jsdom` while trying to integrate the [dom-accessibility-api](https://github.com/eps1lon/dom-accessibility-api) library, I started working on a similar library that is potentially faster.

[https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils](https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils)

Having tested the library on some previously heavy tests that could even lead to timeouts, I noticed a performance improvement of about 50% when using my library when retrieving element accessible names. When combined with `happy-dom`, the improvement is even greater.  


Would it be possible for some of you who have experienced similar performance issues to let me know if this library provides any improvements in that regard? Also, feel free to share any feedback on potential issues—it’s still a library in development :)

webdev,"Recently, I have been trying out LLMs for coding and they are surprisingly bad for anything even a tiny bit complex?","Since LLMs (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.) became popular, I have used them for basic things, but only sporadically for coding. Recently, I was entrusted a Vue 3 codebase, and since I didn't know Vue, I thought to myself: Why not get some help from AI? So, I started trying out different models and to my surprise, it's incredible how even basic things such as flexbox in component styling is just too much for them. Anything that has to do with styling, really, that goes beyond ""Set this component's border color to light gray"". If you use Vuetify and custom style classes, then the machine just doesn't WTH is going on anymore. Also, I tried it to make it tell me the difference between React's portals and Vue 3's teleport functionality, and it was disappointing to say the least. The fun became real, though, when I asked it how to teleport a Vue 3 component into a Cytoscape JS node; After 30 minutes or so of back and forth prompting, I gave up, and this is in general how my sessions end: With time wasted, frustration and back at the start of the task.

Other behaviours I have noticed are:

* In the same chat, repeating the same answer to different prompts (this is typical of Mistral), even though you try to nudge it in the right direction by telling it the answer wasn't satisfactory.
* Making up random stuff, e.g., CSS directives or a function's options and then saying ""My bad, you're right. Function x doesn't have the option y"".
* Mixing up versions (e.g., Vue 2 patterns in Vue 3)

... and more.

Honestly, the majority of the time it's useless. Also, for beginners, this is probably the worst one can do to learn programming, people should stay the hell away from it under they have some experience under the belt.

webdev,I can't get an Azure function to publish to my Azure account from an Nx monorepo,"The Azure vscode extension scaffolds correct and operations Azure functions but @nxazure/func functions scaffolded in a NX monorepo don't work. This is the repo for @nxazure/func: https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure .

webdev,Why do some modern MVC frameworks force automatic database connections for Models?,"I'm a student doing a very light survey of a handful of MVC frameworks (like 4 or 5), and I noticed Laravel and CodeIgniter 4 are set up to force connections between Models and databases. I thought Models were intended to handle business logic. I would assume a Model created exclusively to, for example, call an external API and parse the results would be valid to the MVC pattern without requiring database interaction at all.

Is my assumption incorrect, or is there a particular advantage to forcing automatic database connections?

webdev,The Rise of AgentWeb,"This is something I have been thinking about recently. Basically the idea how the Web is going to evolve in the future with AI. You can read the whole thing at my post, but just to flag a few things here:

""The web is splitting into two distinct futures: one driven by relentless AI agents, the other shaped by human hands. It fills me with both excitement and sadness - excited by the possibilities of AI-driven efficiency, yet nostalgic for the craftsmanship of a human touch. Let's dive into what this means for the future of web development and ownership.

# The Rise of AgentWeb

The AgentWeb represents the industrialisation of web development, where AI agents autonomously build, maintain, and optimise websites at scale. These digital properties will be born in vast WebFarms (remember Bitcoin farms?) where AI systems handle everything from design decisions to content optimisation and user experience refinement.

For website owners, this means hands-off management with AI handling:

* Complete brand identity creation and evolution
* Content creation and SEO optimisation
* Automated maintenance and security updates
* Real-time performance monitoring and optimisation
* User experience refinement through continuous testing
* Integrated social media presence and content distribution

# The Future Renaissance of ArtisanWeb

On the flip side, we might be witnessing a renaissance of handcrafted websites. Like craft beer versus mass-produced lagers, ArtisanWeb represents the boutique approach to web development. I can imagine content on the web being labeled Handcrafted by a Human or No AI Was Used in Creating This Content.

The interesting thing is that while handcrafted web will be proud to display these labels, web farms would not do the opposite: AI Generated Content. They are likely to try to fake that they are really hand-made content. In the same way [browsers once faked their identities to gain compatibility](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/?ref=mantcz.com), AI-generated websites might strive to mimic human craftsmanship to gain trust—a new battle for authenticity in the AI driven digital age.""

I am curious to hear what people think.

webdev,Learndash and FluentCRM API related issue ,"Hi folks,

I am running a WordPress site hosted on Rapyd Cloud and the site uses LearnDash as the LMS, FluentCRM for managing email engagement, and WP Fusion for advanced syncing. I also use Uncanny Automator and LearnDash Notifications for additional functionality.

Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:

When a student completes a topic in LearnDash, I want to log the completion date in a custom field within FluentCRM for that student.

After 7 or 14 days, I want to check if the student has started the next topic in the course.

If no progress is detected within those two weeks, FluentCRM should trigger an automated email encouraging them to continue.

I’ve written a PHP function using LearnDash’s hooks and FluentCRM’s API to update the custom field, but it’s not working. The completion date isn’t being stored in FluentCRM, and I’m unsure if the issue is with the hook, the API call, or something else.

I also reached out to Rapyd Cloud’s support to check if it might be a server-related issue, but they confirmed it’s more of an application-level concern and suggested I check with LearnDash or FluentCRM.

Some questions I have:

Is learndash\_topic\_completed the correct hook for this, or is there a better one to use?

Is there a more reliable way to update FluentCRM custom fields programmatically?

For the follow-up, should I consider using WP Fusion’s tagging features or a cron job for better reliability?

Here are the relevant documentation links I’ve been looking through:

LearnDash Developer Docs

FluentCRM API Docs

WP Fusion Documentation

If anyone has set up something similar or can point out where I might be going wrong, I’d really appreciate your help! Let me know if you need more details.

webdev,How to take Wix code and host it independently.,"I've got a website that I designed through Wix. The domain is registered through Hostinger and Wix connects it for me. Wix bills me 150€ yearly approx. I've done it this way for several years now.

Can anyone point me to a tutorial on how to take the code of the website and just do it myself? I imagine it can't be insanely hard. I imagine it would involve taking the source code of the page, collecting the image resources, and changing their locations in the code. Maybe I'm way off and there would be a lot more to mess with. I'm not a programmer, per se, but I do have fundamental knowledge of things.

If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it!

webdev,Next steps for semi-successful websites (and devs),"I have made a few websites over the years, but have substantially stepped up my skills over the last 12 months or so through uni study.

I currently have a simple game website averaging about 400 users per day and 10,000 views per week. It’s a little puzzle game that resets every 24 hours.

After a couple months of very little interaction it has built up to this point completely organically over a few months, but the growth is slowing.

So what do now? Try and advertise the site? Put google ads on the site and hopefully get $20-30 per week hoping not to alienate the users?

My full time work is currently in audio production and journalism so I am used to building creative things with technology. I think I could make more websites that attract users, but who knows? Making a living wage out of this feels pretty improbable. 

The most complicated website I have made but not put on the internet is a e-commerce site with flask - besides that mostly little games. I consider myself a bit more of a creative than strictly a dev - I can do a lot with a little. Having said that I am studying comp sci post-grad.

Apologies for the rambling - just looking for some help or direction. There might be an answer staring me in the face or a job that I’m not aware of?

webdev,How to communicate better during meetings? ,"I’m a new developer and an issue I’m facing is being able to clearly communicate the challenges of a task during team meetings. Sometimes clients would make requests to add something new or modify something prebuilt that sounds easy to do in theory but poses a great technical challenge. It could either be something entirely impossible to do or beyond my skillset. I’ve found when I try to communicate the difficulties, I’m being seen as “not having a can do attitude” or “not wanting to do the hard work”. Boss would interrupt me and tell me I just have to figure something out. 

I feel that my job as a developer is to clearly communicate the possibilities of what the client is asking for and/or provide possible solutions. But my boss just wants me to pretty much say yes to whatever and I think it’s because the more time I spend on the project the more he can charge the client. This may mean going away with a task then doing absolutely nothing and saying I’ve tried xyz and it didn’t work whereas this whole bullshit could’ve been avoided in the first place. I’m getting paid so not exactly complaining but this feels exploitative. 

And the other developers although understand the scope of the task, they just agree with the boss and the client to stay on their good side because it’s gonna be me doing the work anyways and not them. Also during calls they would briefly look at my code and confirm with the client exactly what I’ve said which I find disrespectful because I’m the one who wrote the code yet the client is more trusting towards someone who’s not even part of the project. They’re also very quick to make suggestions even though they don’t know anything about the codebase which is annoying asf.

I understand their perspective, but aren’t both approaches valid? My reasoning was that if design requirements changed in a real-world scenario (e.g., the bold word needed a different color or style later), it would be easier to manage through CSS without touching the HTML structure.

webdev,Facebook API - supposed to be this difficult?,"I'm not sure if the Facebook API is just extremely difficult or if I'm just looking in the wrong spot.

I'm looking for a way to create posts on Facebook pages that I am the administrator of, without having to log into Facebook each and every time.  Nothing fancy.  Ideally I'd like to be able to do this with cURL so I can program an interface with whatever has cURL bindings available.

But apparently, I have to create a Facebook app?  And get approval for that app?  Seems like a lot of obstacles to go through just to perform a simple task.

My intention is not to distribute this app or for other users to use.  I simply want to be able to post to pages I administrate without having to log into Facebook each time.

webdev,software developer doesn't know where to start to fix existing wordpress page,"Hello, for context I am frontend developer and have never done anything with wordpress and it's a shame to admit, but I have never hosted any webpage (or maybe I did when I was studying, but can't remember).

My friend told me that his wordpress webpage has issues and is showing some sort of errors when he tries to edit in cms (content management system) and asked me to fix those issues without ruining page SEO (so that google doesn't show it lower in results) and without losing any content that was added through cms, because my friend had previous experience when developer deleted all content that was added before.

I'm not sure where to start... Right now I just asked him for credentials to access cms.

Where should I start? What information do I need from my client (friend)? Is it possible and should I make some sort of backup of the page? Bonus question - can I adjust styling of that page and do some layout changes without ruining content added through cms or messing up current google result position?

- straightforward Versioning system
- dev and prod code deployment 
- ability to host single file (js or css) or complete build

webdev,Best Practices for Synchronizing Supabase Auth and Local Database in a NestJS App,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I’m working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What’s the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?
* Any tips for optimizing this flow for scalability and maintaining clean code?",Aymsep,1h6f2g6,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6f2g6/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6f2g6/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,2024-12-04 12:41:55,1,0.6,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h6f2g6

webdev,How did you develop your eye for web design? (looking for ressources),"Hello everyone,

While I'm comfortable translating designs (e.g. from Figma) into code, I'm struggling with the creative side of web design. Whenever I attempt to create designs from scratch, they end up looking flat, minimalistic (and not in the good way), or old school.

I'd love to improve my design skills - nothing fancy, just aiming to create clean, professional-looking sites for now. **What resources helped you level up your design game?** I'm interested in everything:

* Online courses
* Web design focused YouTube channels
* Websites/blogs
* Design systems or case studies you find inspiring

I figure other developers making the transition into design might find this valuable too. Would really appreciate any guidance from those who've made this journey!

  
**EDIT:** Thank you all for the amazing responses!  
Here's a summary of the most recommended resources and tips:

**Learning Resources:**

* **Refactoring UI (I just bought it and I really loved it, exactly what I wanted; their slogan ""Design with tactics, not talent"" really got me)**
   * Some people also recommended his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=refactoring+ui))
* I also watched this YouTube video ""[Learn Web Design For Beginners - Full Course (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Ule7GXaRs)"" (minus chapter 5) which helped me greatly as well
* [Interaction Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/) foundation courses
* [Adobe XD Essentials by Bring Your Own Laptop](https://bringyourownlaptop.com/courses/ui-ux-web-design-using-adobe-xd)
* [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) design courses
* [Pixentage YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Pixentage/videos) (focuses on UI redesigns)
* [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) (for UX/UI articles)

**Practice &amp; Inspiration:**

* Practice by recreating existing professional designs
* Study section templates (headers, footers, content blocks) from sites like [Brixies](https://brixies.co/) and [Bricksmaven](https://bricksmaven.com/)
* [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/search/projects) for design inspiration
   * [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1h2jb9q/comment/m1cdk8f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss): ""[Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) and Behance are also filled with ambitious/crazy designs that are way beyond what most projects require and are often discouraging when still figuring out the basics.""

**Key Tips from the Community:**

* Start with content organization and split into sections before designing
* Limit your color palette (3 colors minimum) -&gt; Refactoring UI covers that in a really pragmatic way I think
* Collect 10-20 reference designs for different sections before starting
* Get feedback from others (family, friends, AI) on spacing, sizing, shadows, and animations
   * let them talk out loud where they look at and what they think while browsing your site
* Keep designs simple and focused on your audience's needs
* Practice regularly - even daily - to develop and maintain skills",Michel1846,1h6brod,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6brod/how_did_you_develop_your_eye_for_web_design/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6brod/how_did_you_develop_your_eye_for_web_design/,2024-12-04 08:56:06,11,0.87,11,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,self,t3_1h6brod

I was just talking with some coworkers, and one of them brought up that they think the bell curve meme around the use of JS frameworks would be low IQ - use framework, mid IQ - just use base HTML CSS JS, high IQ - you must use a JS framework.

Personally I am of the opinion that JS frameworks have their place but for the vast majority of websites you don't need anything other than a templating language and vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

I've certainly written webapps that required the use a JS framework, but I would hardly call those websites they were more extremely complicated web apps that simply could not have been made without the use of a framework.

But that's the exception and 99% of all websites on the internet don't need anything more than HTML + a templating language for format, CSS for layout and prettiness, and JavaScript for interactivity (frankly HTML and CSS get you 90% of your interactivity), server requests, and content reactivity. There's a reason 80% of the internet is PHP, and why libraries like HTMX, and frameworks like Astro are becoming so popular - because they just get out of your way.

I sort of responded that for work and for personal projects I mainly build websites using no framework, and I asked why does he think that's the shape of the bell curve. But he didn't seem open to having a dialogue about it, and just kept responding ""it's just what it is"" with a really smug smile. And I didn't want to push it further / potentially start any conflict with a coworker so I dropped it.

I just feel like frameworks add so much complexity and overhead to development (unless your app truly absolutely needs it), that it's really unnecessary and creates so much work compared to using no framework and at the end of the day your user won't notice a difference. 

Runtimes, CSS modules, picking/learning a package, package specific JS, npm packages, typescript, webpack, docker, build tools, hosting... Homie this is a static page that fetches content on load and sends basic CRUD requests to the server, I could have it finished and hosted before you have your environment set up and project initiated. And mine will be functional with JS disabled and for users with 3G connections.

But I'm really curious, is the use a framework (JS or other) really the big brain move, and every website no matter what should use one.

webdev,"How do server-sent event ""streams"" work on a lower level?","Hi, and sorry for the lack of a tl;dr; - I'm not sure how to get away from providing the context. Basically I'm interested in connecting to a web server and consuming [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) using a lower level HTTP API and am hoping somebody can explain how the push vs pull of these events might work at a lower level.

I'm working on a hardware project (ESP32-S3 / espressif ESP-IDF based) where I'm writing C with a bit of higher level abstraction to support HTTP interactions. For example, the methods I might call are:

* `esp_http_client_open()`: Open the HTTP connection with write_len parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set write_len=0 for read-only connection.
* `esp_http_client_fetch_headers()`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). 
* `esp_http_client_read()`: Read the HTTP stream
* `esp_http_client_close()`: Close the connection.

([more examples / docs are here if you're currious](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client.html#http-stream))

Now what I'm trying to figure out is what `esp_http_client_read()` actually is doing in terms of the server to client communication. When I connect to a server over HTTP, and assuming `keep-alive`, I can call `esp_http_client_read()` every millisecond, or I can wait 100 milliseconds and call it. Both ""work"" in that if there is no data being sent from the server, nothing will happen, and if there is data, I'll read it and be able to do something with it. _edit: for clarity because it may be non-obvious, my intention is to have my hardware device connect to a server and stay connected to it indefinitely, waiting for the server to send data using server-sent events - so picture a while(true) loop, but I'm responsible myself for checking when new data comes in_

But I don't have a good sense of what it means to ""read data"" in an already open HTTP stream. As far as I'm aware, for this type of connection (which is similar as far as I understand to a chunked response), nothing is communicated to the server asking for more data for example, it's certainly not like an additional HTTP request is being made. I'm guessing ""read data"" just checks some sort of lower level buffer handled by the WiFi chip or some lower subsystem. I'm guessing if I chose to ""read data"" from an HTTP connection the server is none the wiser. 

That said, I also might 100% wrong, and perhaps (like other forms of communication) part of the underlying protocol is a message to the server that you've read data. This might not be important to the server, but perhaps it acts as a sort of heartbeat. 

My end goal here is to understand how often I should call ""read data"" in my code optimizing for quickly getting updates from the server but also not having any negative impact on the server or taking up needless CPU cycles by reading data every millisecond when once every 50ms would suffice for my needs. 

I'm hoping somebody in the web dev community who perhaps has more experience or a better understanding of lower level HTTP ""stuff"" might be able to understand the spirit of what I'm asking and help me understand.

webdev,Standard SSL to AutoSSL in cPanel?,"  
i decided to go with godaddy for webhosting (already regretting this after scrolling through this sub) and i got standard SSL and my website wont work (im getting the connection is not private message). I chatgpt'd it and its saying i need **AutoSSL**. I recently purchased a **Standard SSL certificate** from GoDaddy,  and i called the help desk and they told me to switch to **AutoSSL** because it automatically handles SSL installations and renewals, and I’d rather not manage SSL certificates manually.... 

Here's what I've done so far:

1. **Purchased a Standard SSL** from GoDaddy.
2. Installed the certificate manually via **cPanel**.
3. I saw that my certificate is self-signed in cPanel.

# What I want to do:

  
Make my website work.

I want **AutoSSL** to take over and automatically install and renew my SSL certificates. I’ve checked my cPanel, but I **don’t see an option for AutoSSL** anywhere in the **SSL/TLS Manager** or **SSL/TLS Status** sections. I also don’t see an option to **enable AutoSSL** in cPanel.

# Questions:

1. **Am I missing something?** Should AutoSSL be available by default, or is it something that needs to be enabled by GoDaddy?
2. **How do I get AutoSSL working for my domain?** Do I need to enable it manually, or does GoDaddy handle that?
3. **Is AutoSSL only available on specific hosting plans?** I'm on a basic hosting plan, so I’m wondering if AutoSSL is available for my plan.

If anyone has had similar issues with GoDaddy and cPanel, I’d really appreciate any advice on how to get AutoSSL up and running.

webdev,Can anyone explain how scrollbars  determine which element they get attached to? Mine is getting attached to the body for whatever reason and don't really understand it...,"I have encountered the worst problem in my web dev project. **SCROLLBARS**

Imagine implementing a *simple* chat system and you know nothing about websockets and broadcasting yet the **worst roadblock** is getting the scrollbar to go down in a react app.. I can get it to go down when I set `h-[some value]` but it won't go down otherwise...

So I throw in some `overflow` magic. Nah uh, the scrollbar ain't moving an inch.. I do all my scrollbar effecting witchcraft (looking at you **tailwind**) on the element that I think is managing the scrollbar. It did not move one inch. Then I change the potions, seems like `useEffect` ain't cutting it, so my truth sayer (**chat gpt**) recommended `useLayoutEffect`  and it still did not work. Then I go on a hunt for the element which the scroll bar is getting attached to.

Turns out it is getting attached to the body element. I was able to confirm this by adding overflow-hidden to the parent components one by one and it only worked on the body element!!

Now the realization hit me, I know nothing of scrollbars. I can't seem to find a resource to actually learn what it is relevant to my current **context**. I have spent hours on this problem and can't seem to figure it out.

EDIT: Did not add code because idk if it is allowed here

EDIT: Further context: In a chat app, the scrollbar should be at the bottom coz you want to see the latest message not the oldest.

webdev,Monorepo architecture and scopes,"Monorepo architecture

Hi there! I’m using NX with Angular for a monorepo (but I don’t think this issue is specific to Angular nor NX) (4 projects, multiple libraries). As the repo is growing, the current library structure feels unsustainable, and responsibilities between modules are becoming unclear. Here's the current setup:

# Current Library Structure

1. `libs/features`
   * Each ""screen"" (micro-frontend) gets its own library.
   * **Problem:** Shared logic across screens creates overlapping responsibilities.
2. `libs/services`
   * Libraries aligned with backend microservices, split into subcategories:
      * **UI:** Frontend-specific logic/components for an ""entity"" such as order-card.
      * **Feature:** Core functionality (but sometimes imports across services, which feels wrong). Could be a smart search screen for orders, an oder dialog etc.
      * **Data-access:** Backend-specific data handling logic. Like order-rest/websockets
   * **Problem:** The ""feature"" sub-lib crosses boundaries and doesn’t align with service isolation. And it doesnt seem to make sense since its generally more defined by the wanted frontend functionality.
3. `libs/shared`
   * Shared functionality, including:
      * Config
      * Notifications handling
      * Shared UI components not tied to entities

# Questions

1. **UI Libraries**
   * Should all UI components be consolidated under `libs/shared/ui` and divided into sub-libraries/categories (e.g., `shared/ui/&lt;category&gt;`)?
2. **Backend vs. Frontend Domains**
   * Should backend-related libraries only include `data-access` and avoid mixing in UI or feature logic?
   * Should the frontend code be reorganized into ""frontend domains,"" where each domain encapsulates:
      * Shared business logic
      * Specific screens (which could eventually become micro-frontends)?

# Goals

* **Clear separation of concerns**
* **Sustainable structure as the repo grows**
* **Logical boundaries between backend services and frontend domains**

# How should I reorganize my libraries to achieve this?

  
Really grateful for any inputs or direction. Im feeling a bit lost at how to best structure this. I think the way to go is splitting things up more by front-end domains. But what sort of library types would be suitable, and which scopes and types should be limited from importing what?

webdev,Best WYSIWYG website editor with full website control? (Leaving Squarespace),"I’m migrating my photography website away from Squarespace because it’s too limiting. I can’t manage my web pages and other media files directly (no FTP or local mounting), making it impossible for me to automate webpage creation amongst other things. 

This makes managing the many photo galleries I have, and something as simple as linking full-res images to every photo a huge pain. The latter is not even possible on Squarespace—when you upload a 12 MP photo to a gallery, it gets downsampled to 1-2 MP and there's no way to view the original-resolution file. Nor can I link the original resolution file to that gallery preview. 

I need a platform where I can control the entire website structure (individual HTML pages and media), ideally with local file system access via FTP or similar. My goal is to use Python scripts to automate tasks like generating new galleries/web pages, uploading images, and linking previews inside a gallery to full-resolution files (Squarespace forcibly downsamples images and the full-res versions are inaccessible to the end user).

What platforms would you recommend for this level of customization? Note that I do prefer a WYSIWYG editor so that I'm not spending hours setting stuff up from scratch, but when I need to do more powerful things like change sections across all my photo galleries, I want the option for stuff like multi-file regex replacements across all my galleries' HTML files.

webdev,Is This Login/Signup System Secure and Efficient? Looking for Feedback,"Hi, I’ve built a login/signup system for my website and would love your feedback. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sign-Up Flow**

* User fills out name, email, password (validated for strength) and completes hCaptcha.
* Frontend sends a POST request to /api/auth/register with user data and hCaptcha token.
* Server validates data, verifies hCaptcha, and creates a ""pending user"" with:
   * Hashed password, 6-digit OTP (valid 5 mins), and expiration (30 mins).
* OTP is emailed to the user for verification.
* On valid OTP, a user account is created, and the pending entry is removed.

**2. Sign-In Flow**

* User enters email/password.
* Server verifies credentials and creates a session via NextAuth.
* On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

**3. Additional Security**

* Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
* Failed logins tracked for account lockout.
* Background task clears expired pending users every 5 minutes.
* Password resets use the same OTP process as registration.

**4. Session Management**

* Handled by NextAuth with token storage in cookies.

**Questions:**

* Is this secure enough?
* Any improvements to the email verification or overall flow?
* Other tips for a better user experience or security?

webdev,News Article Content without JavaScript,"Curiosity question. I noticed this with Bloomberg but I've seen it with several others: the article content is unloaded if JavaScript is disabled, and not to be found in the HTML or DOM.

A lot of news websites (paywalled or otherwise) still load the article content, sometimes hidden, in the HTML with JavaScript disabled. I've noticed lots don't. 

Is this because Google has gotten better at loading the articles when it crawls so gating it behind a paywall doesn't matter anymore for SEO? Maybe there is some access token or element the crawler uses or they give search engines the article content from somewhere else (or don't care that much about losing out on search results if it gets them paid subs)?",KDLGates,1h5as5e,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5as5e/news_article_content_without_javascript/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5as5e/news_article_content_without_javascript/,2024-12-03 00:42:16,4,0.75,4,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5as5e

I’m super excited to share that I’m starting a **YouTube series** where I’ll be building real-world apps using **HONO** (a new and powerful web framework). The goal is to teach full-stack development by walking through backend APIs and frontend integrations – all using HONO as the core tool.

I’ve just released the first video, where I introduce the series and explain what we’ll be building together. I’d love to get your thoughts and feedback, especially if you’re interested in learning about HONO or full-stack development in general. As I progress, I’ll be posting more videos, so feel free to subscribe and follow along!

webdev,Anyone else consistently buy dope domains with big pipedreams then never do anything?,"Sometimes I doomscroll Namecheap like a maniac, putting in random words until I find something that seems too good to be available-- usually under $40 or else it's obviously not worth it.

I'll hang on to the domain for a year, do nothing; then I get an email to renew at twice the cost and usually bail. All this too soon before I'm able to actually come up with a good idea for something to put there.

The one's that come to mind are:
- hard.pizza
- atomic.gold (this one kills me because I originally got it for &lt;$30/yr on Namecheap and it's now it's  literally $25,000 on GoDaddy)

Currently, I have ""atomic.church"" and I need to renew or let it go. I can't stop. Ugh. I thought I could use it for sci-fi short stories or some kind of nerdy shop, but I definitely don't have enough prep for that...

Maybe if Reddit helps me come up with a good enough idea I'll keep it.

webdev,Web-browser games/gaming website,"Hello - I work in special education, and I see kids via telehealth on Zoom.  There are a couple of different websites I use for virtual activities, but I have my own idea for a very unique platform that I would like to develop over the next couple of years.  The site would be primarily simple games with and graphics drawn cutely, but poorly by me in Procreate.

I have practically no experience in this arena so forgive if I ask a stupid question(s).

I've learned so far I can make a lot with HTML and CSS, and I've played around with Scratch. I think I will be able to figure out the game-making.  However, a feature of this website would be for the user to be able to draw a card/picture/.gif in between turns of a game, or there to be a stop point before you can continue with a game.  My goal is to have potentially hundreds of decks/libraries available for a user to select as their question set prior to playing the game (for example - a deck with R sounds, a deck with action .gifs for expressive language tasks, a short video clip, etc)

Would I be able to have a library within HTML/CSS, or should I look at using a different language?  Eventually, if it goes well, I would also want the option for people to create accounts and subscribe to the website, so I would need to be able to store that information too.  This is a years from now goal, but if I can get learning now it will only help me later.

webdev,Is it overkill to learn this tech stack for an MVP?,"I'm new to web dev, with a couple simple projects under my belt, but my next project is aiming to be more ambitious creating a social media / blogging platform.

I've done some research and the tech stack that seems to make most sense is:

Backend: Node.js (Express), Supabase (as includes auth)  
Frontend: React (+ React Query), Tailwind CSS  
Hosting: Railway (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), S3 (Images)

However I have no experience with React, Tailwind, Vercel or Supabase (just vanilla CSS + JS, HTML/EJS, PostrgreSQL, hosting on Railway)

So really I want some help understanding:

1. Over the next 3 months, am I likely to have saved more time by learning React + Tailwind + Supabase or is it better to stick with my vanilla stack if I'm aiming to maximise progress in 3 months?
2. If I were to create my MVP using my current ""vanilla"" stack and hire a software dev in 3 months, would there likely be lots of technical debt to overcome or would converting to the new stack be relatively easy?

React seems to be the really big one to learn, so I'm also considering just learning tailwind + supabase, and leaving React for later.

webdev,"I can not gain traction, short shory","Hi, 

I just wanted to share my not-short but not-long journey. I have been doing freelancing on the side as a full-time developer for some time. I noticed that the competition is too high to get jobs on Upwork and make money. So, I slowly transitioned to indie hacker, solopreneur, entrepreneur, CEO, founder, or whatever you would like to call it because I wanted to scale. With the speed of AI, it is very easy to do small projects; with Vercel, it is very easy to deploy them. But that is it.

Building does not mean anything. If I were to build a website/app that does quantum calculations. It will remain as a hidden gem. It will be useless. Marketing is hard. It is much harder than software development. If I don’t stay active on social media and don’t comment on everything literally, everything. All the graphs goes to zero immediately. 

Like, I am not saying I built the quantum computer. That’s also the other thing. I am making these stupid projects. So that at some point  I would get the inspiration for the big thing, but that is also not happening. I don’t want to quit yet. But this is not just about just shipping it. It consumes more than a full-time job. It needs dedication, unfortunately, and most importantly, it needs luck.

webdev,I've created a sports competitions draw simulator,"Hey guys!

I'd like to introduce you to **DICEDRAW**, a web project that I've been developing with great pleasure recently. It's a website dedicated to **simulating draws for sports competitions**, currently focused on soccer. It already has draws for the Champions League, Europa League and, more recently, the new Club World Cup. The latter deserves a special mention because we're only a few days away from the official draw, and we can see how things might end up lining up.

The idea is that each draw respects the specific rules of each competition. In other words, nothing will be seen that goes against the rules of the entities. I've also included the new league stages of UEFA competitions, such as the Champions League, which has replaced the group stage.

If you have any suggestions or even ideas for other competitions you'd like to see there, let me know! I'm also accepting contributions to the project's repository, in case you want to get your hands on the code. And if you find it useful, leave a star there, it always gives you a boost of motivation.

I intend to continue evolving the project, and it would be great to have your feedback to make it even better!

So, instead I need to set up a backend, usually through a cloud provider that comes with more features than I need and confuses the hell out of me.

Basically, what’s a simple way to set up a backend that authenticates a “guest” user from a whitelisted client, relays my request to the third party with the key attached, then returns the data to my frontend?",Greeby_Bopes,1h4znal,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4znal/easy_ways_to_hide_api_keys/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4znal/easy_ways_to_hide_api_keys/,2024-12-02 16:58:07,96,0.86,96,0,106,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h4znal

webdev,Would you use this app for resizing iOS/Android images instantly?,"Hi, fellow developers!  
I’m building a macOS app aimed at developers who need to generate images (like app icons or splash screens) in multiple sizes for iOS, Androud, Flutter etc.  
The app lets you drag and drop a single image and instantly get resized images in all the required formats and dimensions without hitting the web.

Features:

* Drag-and-drop simplicity.
* Automatic folder organization for iOS (`Assets.xcassets`) and Android (`drawable`).
* Customizable sizes for additional use cases.

Would you use this? What features would make this indispensable for your workflow?  
Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Yes I know you can export with Figma, use a bunch of line tools etc. But i would like something really simple.

Want to participate with testing? Let me know

I think there are still many problems that intermediate computer science undergraduate students can provide solutions to.

In other words, this efficiency keeps some solvable problems unsolved.

webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,132,0.82,132,0,183,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

webdev,Drizzle anyone?,"So I started this project a while ago fire the website concept I have.  I had a developer, but they got busy with a new job.  At first I was going to do the front end and she was going to to the back, but it just made way more sense for her to do full stack.  They did React on the frontend with an Express/JS backend. Drizzle for ORM and PostgreSQL for the database.  I’m still pretty much a newb at all things that’s not just a static page with HTML/CSS and a lil bit of JS.  So I’m looking for someone to follow in their footsteps.  DM me if interested!  

Edit - I have a price in mind, but it’s negotiable for anyone doing me

Edit - here is the last post I made 8 months ago that attracted my previous developer:

So I thought myself front end development…


I’ve had this idea for a job board for forever.  But everyone was way too expensive to hire. So I started teaching myself coding at the middle of last year.   The journey had been up and down, but now I’m at a point where I’m comfortable with front end development.  The problem is, now I need to learn the back end, and I am very burnt out after spending all my nights and some weekends to get to where I’m at now.  So I’ve been looking at different options, here they are:

1. Pay $10,000 for someone to start my project and hopefully have a mvp by the end of it.  I have a better job now, so I can save the money in probably a few months
2. Continue to learn, whether it be self learning or taking a class.  Self learning is cool, but I have no one to ask questions to.  And taking a class would take far too long.  

Those both are a little far away for my liking.  So, I thought of a new idea today!  I thought about just hiring a backend developer.  I could build the front, which would save me lots of money, and someone could do the backend.  The only issue is, I have no idea on how to hire a backend developer.  Do I hire a company?  Do I try and get a freelancer?  If so from where?  I’ve looked at fivver and that option doesn’t work for me because I need someone I can have a conversation with and I don’t understand accents very well in learning environments.  Upwork seems promising, but I have my doubts.

webdev,Managing High-Volume Notifications with Digest (Batching) Strategies,"I'm implementing a notification system using [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) that needs to handle high message volumes without overwhelming users. 

I'd like to share my current approach and get feedback on potential improvements.

**Context:**

* Building a collaborative app with frequent updates (comments, file changes, tags)
* Using Novu as the notification infrastructure
* Need to prevent notification fatigue while ensuring important updates reach users
* Currently implementing in Node.js with PostgreSQL backend

**Current Implementation:** I've developed two digest strategies in Novu:

1. **Time-Window Digest / Batching:** 

&amp;#8203;

     // Using Novu to collect events in a 3-day digest window  
    const digestResult = await novu.digest(""digest-3-days"", {
      backoffUnit: 'days',
      backoffAmount: 3,
      digestKey: 'userId',
      events: notifications
    });  
    
    // Send digest via Novu
    await novu.trigger('digest-notification', {
      to: {
        subscriberId: userId,
      },
      payload: {
        events: digestResult.events,
        totalCount: digestResult.events.length
      }
    });

2. **Look-Back Pattern:**

    const shouldDigest = async (userId, eventType) =&gt; {
      const recentNotification = await novu.getNotificationHistory({
        subscriberId: userId,
        type: eventType
      });
      return Date.now() - recentNotification.timestamp &lt; ONE_DAY;
    };

Here is a visual representation I'm referring to - but with much smaller batching time window:

[Digest \/ Event Aggregation ](https://preview.redd.it/qozoe9akbf4e1.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301cfb85c68526175d084b86374fa8f3c29a3c21)

**Interesting Discovery -** [OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/journeys#time-window)**'s Time Window Approach:** While researching this, I found OneSignal's implementation of time windows interesting.   
  
They use a different approach where you can:

* Define specific allowed time periods (e.g., Tuesday 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST)
* Set intelligent delivery delays that randomly distribute notifications within allowed windows
* Handle out-of-window notifications by scheduling them for the next available window

For example, if you set a notification to trigger outside of Tuesday 1-6 PM PST, their system automatically schedules it for a random time within next Tuesday's window. This helps prevent notification clustering at window boundaries.

**Technical Challenges I'm Working Through:**

1. Race conditions when multiple events occur simultaneously
2. Handling failed notification deliveries within digest groups
3. Database schema optimization for efficient event aggregation
4. Coordinating time windows across multiple time zones
5. Implementing similar time-window functionality as OneSignal within Novu

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. What indexing strategies work best for quick digest compilation in Novu?
2. How do you handle digest delivery failures and retries?
3. Has anyone implemented custom time window logic similar to OneSignal's approach in Novu?
4. What's your approach to testing digest timing across different time zones?

If you've implemented similar systems with Novu or other notification services, I'd appreciate insights on handling these technical aspects efficiently.",Sudden_Profit_2840,1h4t9jv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,2024-12-02 11:53:39,39,0.98,39,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/S_ZmR_1cU5aKbwzfea80L7OQ7oKBdb43DuJDAxM8-xM.jpg,t3_1h4t9jv

webdev,Looking for better ways to use redirect domains to make my Github.io website more accessible and faster.,"Hi, I am having trouble getting my website to properly load through some redirect domains I'm trying to set up. Sometimes it takes about a minute to load, sometimes it gives an error page. I am using Namecheap domains, and this is what the redirect widget looks like:

[for some reason, I can't use \\""https:\/\/www.bongable.cc\\""](https://preview.redd.it/bsnthk5uxe4e1.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd0b9f2e200d60e9198b7cf2743a988710a369be)

The reason for the last one is a recurring problem where different browsers will add the ""https://"" automatically.

Is there an easy way to link an easy URL like ""bongable.cc"" to the Github.io address so that it loads faster and has less errors?

Also, I'm testing out the website on different browsers in their respective ""Private"" modes to avoid loading from the cache. Is this method of testing flawed? I might be tripping a little, but I foresee some customers quitting if the site doesn't load quick enough :/

Do I have to buy actual webhosting to get this to load correctly? All I'm really trying for right now is a simple site with a discord link and links to some documents that are also on Github.io.

webdev,Optimal Oauth flow?,"My web app has react frontend and java backend.
Will be using keycloak on the backend eventually.

Here's how the oauth flow would go: 
1. On the frontend user clicks authenticate which calls an auth endpoint on backend.

2. On the backend, a random state param is generated and what not. 
Then auth url is formed (with query params: state, clientId etc, and sent to auth provider for authentication code.
Redirection url is set as a backend endpoint.
The backend sends/redirects this url to the front end.

3. On the frontend the resource owner would be on the auth provider's auth page to either allow or decline the requested scopes.

4. Assuming the resource owner accepts, the auth code would be sent as query params with the backend redirect url. 

5. The backend endpoint verifies state param, auth code and obtains an auth token. Stores the auth token in db.

At this point, what does the frontend do to check if step 5 has been successfully executed since at step 4, the redirect url calls the backend endpoint and not the frontend endpoint.

3). Backend sends token to frontend via response 
4). Front end stores token in cookies for authenticating with backend for future requests / private route access
5).  Front end decodes jwt for user ID at what point and why???

webdev,How do you develop micro-services locally?,"How do you develop micro-services locally when there are several applications that communicate with each other and you need to see logs in several applications at once.

I'm using Docker Compose + Dozzle for such purposes to run batch of services and watch logs, but with this approach the file system can slow down a lot when live reload is enabled.

Recently I found out that there are Procfile and overmind, which allow to conveniently run several services at once with one command without virtualization. But logs are shown in a single console and it is not convenient to see what is going on (my application has a large business logic and a lot of communication back and forth, so a lot of logs).

UPD:

Combining [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) (Procfile launcher) and [logdy](https://logdy.dev/) (logs viewer from pipe to browser) can be working

My understanding is that Google has tried to maintain a monopoly over the search engine market by making other companies use Google as the main search engine for their browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).

If that's the case, what's the point of having Google sell Chrome, the browser? There are plenty of other browsers out there -- Google doesn't hold a monopoly over the browser market. Chromium is a thing, yes, but neither Firefox nor Safari is Chromium based, and Chromium is open source anyway. The problem here is the ubiquity of 'Google' the search engine, not Chrome the browser.

webdev,Scraping keywords from webpages - method suggestions wanted,"Hi All,

I'm making a keyword scraper in order to do some competitor research on the top google search results. I've come here to ask for your ideas on the best ways to extract the most important keywords from a page I'll detail what I'm currently doing below.

This is all done in python using Selenium and BeautifulSoup

1. Get the text from all visible elements
2. Delete the first header and all of the following elements: footers, navs and elements with ""aria-hidden=True""
3. Flattens all inline elements so that the text is all in block level elements -&gt; just done for ease of parsing
4. Then it creates 8 lists
   1. A list where each of the h1-6 elements are collected
   2. A list for roughly the first 200 words measured from the start of the first h1
   3. A list for all elements after the start of the first h1
5. I then return a dictionary to my keyword scraper which has all of the lists above plus the title, url and meta description

Then I run my langauge processing which is a combo of SciKit learn and SpaCy.

I have three methods currently working to extract keywords:

* TF-IDF -&gt; TfidfVectorizer from sklearn
* Noun-Phrase extraction -&gt; I'll post my matcher below but this is a custom pipeline for spaCy
* Named entity extraction -&gt; spaCy as well, super basic just collecting important types of named entities like person, product etc...

Here is my matcher:

    patterns = [
                # Optional Adverb(s) + Adjective(s) + Noun(s)

webdev,How I solved common Prisma ORM errors,"I have been using Prisma ORM for the last 2 years, and I have experience with troubleshooting different types of error.

In this post, I want to share it with you, so you don’t have to spend hours figuring out what I’ve already learned.

**Why Prisma?**

I have been using Prisma to interact with the database for all my SaaS products. So far, I’ve built six SaaS products, and I hope to build more in the future (some of them are [BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app), [Wuf](https://usewuf.com), [Userdesk](https://userdesk.io), [Inboxs](https://inboxs.io), [Hivoe](https://hivoe.com)).

I've used Prisma in Next.js web apps, node.js servers, and cron jobs.

The key goals of using Prisma are:

* keep under control your database schema
   * define tables and types
   * apply migrations
   * query your database with type safety
   * avoid typing errors
* protect from SQL injection
* leverage pooling

**Common issues**

Despite being a stable product, sometimes you can encounter some issues.

Below I describe two common errors:

* migration errors
* query errors

Let’s start with the first one.

**Error with data migrations**

Sometimes your migrations emit an error, that’s not very simple to debug, like this one.

    Error: ERROR: prepared statement ""s2"" does not exist

You usually get this error when you run `npx prisma db push` (apply your schema changes to the database) or `npx prisma generate` (generate the types from your schema).

But what does this mean?

This error happens when using a relational database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (one of the most popular, and advanced open-source SQL databases on the market).

Specifically, a prepared statement in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows you to execute a query plan that is prepared and stored by the database server for reuse. It improves performance and security, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values.

Prisma ORM leverages the prepared statements as part of its database query execution process, under the hood (but you don’t have to know or master prepared statements to use Prisma).

The main issues arise with the confusion between the different database connections string configurations, pooling and PgBouncer.

Let me go straight to the solution, then I explain you the different parts.

The main solution I’ve found is to use two connection strings, one to run the migrations and the second for the execution of your web application / node.js server.

First, identify the correct connection strings for your database.

The connection string to run the migrations is the direct access to the database (no pooling or PgBouncer), like for instance

    postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

Save this connection string as an environment variable called `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.

    DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=""postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

Secondly, get the connection string with the pool, for instance:

    postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName

Get this connection string from your database hosting provider, the parameters might be different.

Save this connection string as an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL`.

    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

The second step is to update the Prisma configuration to use these two environment variables.

Open the file `schema.prisma` and update the section `datasource db` to include this:

    datasource db {
      provider  = ""postgresql""
      url       = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
      directUrl = env(""DATABASE_DIRECT_URL"")
    }

Now, run the usual commands like `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate` locally to ensure that everything is working correctly, and run your application locally.

If all is good, push the modifications to your hosting service and trigger a new deployment for the modifications to take effect.

Prisma is now correctly configured and you should not have the same issue again.

**Query performance issues**

Recently, I got the ""stack depth limit exceeded"" error message.

    PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid `prisma.table.findMany()` invocation: Error occurred during query execution: ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: ""54001"", message: ""stack depth limit exceeded"", severity: ""ERROR"", detail: None, column: None, hint: Some(""Increase the configuration parameter \""max_stack_depth\"" (currently 2048kB), after ensuring the platform's stack depth limit is adequate."") }), transient: false })

This means that the usage of memory exceeds the database configuration for a specific query.

I ran this SQL command on my database and found this value:

    SHOW max_stack_depth;
    ---
    2MB

I had a query that was returning 1900+ records to aggregate some values.

For each record I have to recalculate the sum of certain values.

When this happens you have two options:

* increase the `max_stack_depth` value in your database
* refactor the logic in the code to avoid to run that big query
* optimize the query

I tried to increase `max_stack_depth` because it was the quickest solution (not the best one), but my database is hosted on DigitalOcean and I didn’t have the permissions to run the `ALTER` command:

    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_stack_depth = '4MB';
    ---
    permission denied to set parameter ""max_stack_depth""

(I contacted DigitalOcean via a support ticket and they promptly provided a solution, I can alter the value using their web API).

Then, I started to analyze the problem.

The first thing I tried was to run the same query as plain SQL against the database using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and it perfectly worked.

This was suspicious, it means that probably Prisma was executing a query too complex and expensive.

Then, I refactored the code, using the Prisma method `$queryRaw` to run the same query, and it worked!

At this point, I didn’t want to manually define all the type for the values returned by the query, and I thought of using a new cool feature of Prisma called [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

This way I can run a Raw Query against the database with the types automatically generated by Prisma for me.

So, in the end, I refactored to code, and avoided to increase the value `max_stack_depth` that would have increased the memory consumption in general.

**Conclusion**

I hope that this post was useful, and it avoids you from spending hours on troubleshooting these kind of errors with Prisma.

Overall my experience with the tool has been very good and exciting, and I see how they are releasing new versions, features, and improvements.

You can find the [documentation of Prisma at this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs).

As a side note, I’m not affiliated with Prisma in any way, I’m just a happy user of the product.

webdev,Advice needed: Looking for a Freelancer to Build an AI-Powered LL.M.-Matching Website – What Should I Look For?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently planning a website that helps users find the perfect matching offer on my site. The idea is to provide general information on the landing page, and then users can input their preferences via an AI chatbot (the best example i can find is Fiverr Neo). Based on their answers, the bot will suggest matching offers from a database. The rest of the site will offer detailed information about the individual offers.

I've already set up a WordPress site on google cloud and have a rough idea of how this could work technically. Now, I’m looking to hire a freelancer to bring this project to life. Before I proceed, I need some advice as i have never worked with freelancer before.

What should I look for in a freelancer?

What skills should they have? (e.g., WordPress, Dialogflow/OpenAI API, database integration, UX/UI design)

Are there specific certifications or portfolios I should check?

Should I hire someone specialized in AI, or will a skilled web developer suffice?



Budget and Timeline:

What’s a realistic budget for a project like this?

How long would it typically take to build, assuming the requirements are clear?



# Communication and Collaboration:

How can I ensure the freelancer understands my vision?

Should I prepare a detailed question catalog and database structure beforehand, or can they help me with that?



Technology and Maintenance:

What should I set up technically to ensure the site is easy to maintain in the long run?

Should I plan for ongoing collaboration with the freelancer for updates and maintenance?

How to stay safe and handle rules or password? 

I plan to run the project on WordPress , hosted on google cloud and integrate the AI chatbot (Dialogflow or OpenAI API), but I’m open to better alternatives if suggested.

webdev,I want to publish an Azure function from a Monorepo,"I am a long term Azure functions user and I have properly created, published, and maintained infrastructure that relied on Azure functions. My process is usually very similar.

I scaffold a basic Azure function (version 4, typescript, http trigger) from the Visual Studio Code Azure extension, I modify the default function with my code, build it with npm run build which is just a tsc command, run it with func start, test it by hitting the API with Postman, and then it's time to publish it to my Azure dashboard on my Azure account.

To publish this correctly functioning Azure function, I run a command like this that actually creates the function instance `az functionapp create --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --consumption-plan-location LOCATION_CODE --runtime node --name FUNCTION_AZURE_NAME --storage-account STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --os-type Linux` , then I run something like `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the root directory of the function repo to actually push up the function to my Azure account.

I recently decided that it would be more convenient to start putting all of my Azure functions into 1 monorepo. It was getting hard to keep track of all of the Github repos of single purpose Azure functions. I used NX to make this monorepo.

I found this project [https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure](https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure) , which allows you to scaffold Azure functions into an NX repo. I ran `npx create-nx-workspace@latest` to create the repo and followed the prompts to make a blank repo.

I made the Azure function in question with these commands:

    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:init FUNCTION_DIRECTORY
    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:new FUNCTION_NAME --project=FUNCTION_DIRECTORY --template=""HTTP trigger""

The function works great locally and I'm able to run it just fine with the NX supplied build and run commands. I can hit the APIs locally with Postman, just like when I scaffolded the functions with the Visual Studio Code extension. The problem is that when it comes time to publish the function to my Azure account, the NX supplied publish command does nothing. It doesn't even error, it succeeds with 0 functions uploaded to Azure.

My best theory on why this is happening lies in the build output structure for @ nxazure/func as opposed to the build structure of the Visual Studio Code extension. The Visual Studio Code build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    └───src
        │   index.js
        │   index.js.map
        │
        └───functions
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

But the @ nxazure/func build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\packages\MYFUNCTIONDIRECTORYNAME\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    │   tsconfig.base.json
    │   
    └───packages
        └───bTSOrdAddrsCreate
            │   _registerPaths.js
            │   _registerPaths.js.map        
            │   
            └───src
                └───functions
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js    
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

With the `func` command, you only need to run `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the same directory as the dist folder and the function will be automatically uploaded to your Azure dashboard/account. Maybe that command expects the `dist` folder to have an `index.js` file within the first level of the folder? I'm not quite sure what the publish command is actually doing under the hood.

In short, how do I successfully execute a publish command for a function build in an NX monorepo that was scaffolded with @ nxazure/func? If there is no way to do it via a simple command from the parent directory of the function or at the root of the monorepo, is there a roundabout way to compile the function to a zip and use some command to upload that to my Azure account/dashboard?",warpanomaly,1h3y2eb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,2024-12-01 07:31:58,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3y2eb

webdev,"Tried building a critical and complex home page using several AI autocomplete tools, and here are my findings","( i am hoping, this is useful for this group, and if its not , i am happy to take it down )

I used BlackBox AI, V0, and Claude simultaneously. I have paid subscriptions for V0, Claude, and ChatGPT, while BlackBox seems to use ChatGPT by default without linking it to my chat gpt account.

**Winner:** For me, Claude was the clear winner, though it’s missing a few features compared to the others.

**What I learned about time savings:** I’m not great at creative coding from scratch, so using these tools made things much easier. It would have taken me 3 workdays to achieve what I did in a 4-hour session split between the tools. Although AI-generated code still needs review—I wouldn't fully trust it—making things responsive using AI saved significant time compared to if I had written everything manually or cleaned up an HTML template. Going forward, I think I can be 3x more productive with Claude, especially now that it understands my project context.

**BlackBox AI:** The main reason to explore BlackBox AI was its VS Code integration, which the others don’t offer. I started generating code on the website, then moved to the VS Code extension. Unfortunately, even with the extension, the improvement process was slow, and ultimately it delivered about 1/10th of the results of Claude or V0.

**Advantages:** Easy code export, since everything’s already local.

**V0:** V0 feels like me—it gets overwhelmed and forgets past discussions. Fixing a bug at one step only to see it return after another adjustment was a common frustration. The interface is clean, and the ability to resize the screen was useful for comparing mobile vs. desktop views. However, some persistent issues included:

* Compilation errors were frequent, though reporting them usually led to fixes. Ideally, it should self-correct.
* Filters would sometimes render incorrectly after a few more feature additions.
* Exporting code is made unnecessarily difficult. It’s not much better in Claude, but with V0 it seems intentional.
* Deployment is easy but seems intended to lock users into the V0 ecosystem, which becomes problematic when scaling to 100-200 files, no more easy way to export except 1 file at a time.

**Claude:** Claude’s UI is cleaner, and it understands my requests better, making adjustments seamless. There were no compilation errors, and changes were stable. The output was visually clearer, and I'm starting to trust the quality of the changes it makes. Although export isn’t straightforward.

Overall, Claude’s consistency and quality make it my preferred tool. It’s stable, efficient, and I think I can use it to be significantly more productive moving forward.",HurryFormal7067,1h3webg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,2024-12-01 05:41:26,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3webg

Bonsai-CLI will streamline web development for agencies or solo developers. I think it will truly 10-100x my development speed, for websites or web apps.

Bonsai-CLI allows you to generate a beautiful web app in seconds, using pre-built and designed Tailwind/Alpine components. All the copy, images, layouts, components, templates, styles can be configured by AI in a matter of seconds.

It’s built specifically for Roots WP stack at the moment, in the future it could support more stacks.

Once you have a [Roots.io](http://Roots.io) site up running, you can run two commands to create a new landing page–

`wp acorn bonsai:init`

`wp acorn bonsai:generate bonsai`

At the moment, the landing page is fairly basic. I’m going to add all of my custom built components to it. Once Bonsai-CLI is done, it’s going to be able to build full on web apps in a matter of seconds. That’s the goal.

webdev,Not another Slack Git integration,"While there are plenty of Slack-GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab integrations out there, many miss one important aspect.

They act as notification channels (like emails)—which is helpful for many teams—but they still leave a lot for teams to figure out themselves, such as fair code review distribution, back-and-forth communication (like I left new comments - I replied to your comments) and reminders.

This is what ReviewNudgeBot offers on top of very convenient and noise-free notifications:

* **Reminders for reviewers blocking PR progress**: When a PR is left without a review, reviewers’ comments are replied to, or a new commit is pushed to the PR, reviewers are reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Reminders for authors blocking PR progress**: When reviewers request changes, new comments are added to a PR, or a build fails, the author is reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Auto-assign reviewer**: After a few team reminders to review a PR, the bot selects specific reviewers and reminds them to review the PR. This helps resolve the bystander effect.

webdev,Is it fine to find your own way of a ‘workaround’?,"Hey guys,

I am currently developing a next js website where it has some forms using shadcn/ui

So one of the form fields has countries list, which are over 170 elements in an array. While creating them with shadcn combobox or select, the website lags for a second because of the number of the html elements loaded for each country, but doesn’t lag on normal &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;, however I need to have custom styling for it.

I did some research and came across something called virtualization with tanstack or react-window, but applying them threw many errors and it was just a headache

So what I did is, stored the array in a state with a slice(0,10) and once opened, I set the state to fill all of the countries.

Now this method works well, the combobox doesn’t lag, and everything is smooth, but is this fine to do?

I mean definitely there are better practices than what I did, but is this fine to continue with or should I reconsider my approach?

Sometimes things work smoothly this way, but makes me feel stupid in a world full of genius developers.

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I made a simple blindfold chess app,"Hi everyone, I'd like to share a side project I've been working on: [Blindfold Chess](http://playblindfoldchess.com).

**What is this app?**

It's a chess app that doesn't have a board! Play chess against the AI (driven by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)), but you must visualize the board in your head. The app provides menu-like inputs to select what pieces to move and where to move them, but it doesn't give any hints as to where the pieces are or what moves they can make. When the game's over, you can copy the moves to the clipboard and open them in an app that lets you visualize chess games.

**Why I made this app**

I learned how to play chess as a child, but I only started actually playing about two years ago. I studied a few openings back then and read two introductory books, but I've mainly just been playing casually. After a few months of playing, I challenged chat gpt to play a game of chess, and instead of showing a chessboard, it just said ""e4"". That was my first introduction to blindfold chess, and I found it highly challenging but not impossible to visualize the board, so I was interested in improving that skill. Unfortunately, chat gpt wasn't able to play coherent games and would inevitably begin making illegal moves as a game progresses.

I made my own chess AI a while back after and used that to play blindfold chess, but I've abandoned that project. Recently, after about a year or so since that last project, I began this. I'm a bit out of practice at the moment, but I expect that I'll improve over time so long as I play a game every day or so.

Surprisingly, I haven't found any apps that do what this does: provide a simple interface for playing blindfold chess. It's certainly niche, but I don't think it's so niche to the point that nobody would have made this simply for that reason. In any case, I'm curious to see if it actually gains adoption, or if I'm the only one who will actually use this on a regular basis.

**Future plans**

First and foremost, once the app has matured a bit, I'm going to make an Android app, then work to make an Android smartwatch app. I've done some preliminary performance tests and have determined that, if nothing else, a Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartwatch can handle the game in easy mode without taking too long to make moves.

After I improve my ability to play blindfold chess, I'd like to write up an article or two that discusses tactics and strategies to help you visualize the board. If there's interest, I might add a feature to play another human locally (i.e., you'd pass them the phone and they'd input their move). Technically, if two people are playing blindfold chess, they wouldn't need the phone at all, but if they disagree about where certain pieces are, the phone would provide an answer to that. I don't think I'll implement a capability to play online because of how easy it would be to cheat, but if people actually play on this app and request it, I'd consider adding it.

Perhaps it is the long unemployment stint I have been on and the rough interview loops I've been enduring or maybe I just needed the cathartic release.

Either way, I want to take those who are interested down memory lane with me and reflect on a past experience of mine that helps me through tough times like these.

It all started many years ago when I worked at a company with another developer. Lets call him Robert. Robert was by no means a super star developer but he was an amazingly nice person and was a pleasure to work with.

However, he did not show qualities I would expect of a top developer.  No great understanding of CS. Not an algorithmic god. Minimal knowledge of craftmanship aspects in software. No extensive knowledge of building systems. He was just an everyday developer.

One day Robert gets called by a FANG adjacent recruiter telling him that a team is interested in hiring him.

What was different about this situation was the recruiter did not send him through the front door.  His interview loop consisted of 3 calls. 1 recruiter screen, 1 call with the hiring manager, 1 call with the wider team.

He did not have to endure a single technical round (I don't want to go into the circumstances of why as I don't want to dox myself)

He of course takes this offer and starts a month later. I was very happy for him and wished him the best and that was that.

Fast forward to today. I am sitting here going through the trenches. 6 round loops. OA, code, system design, behavioural. The whole sh\*t fest.

Occasionally, the doubts creep in. Am I good enough ? should I throw in the towel and go into the #trades ? is my experience worthless ?

Then I always think back to our boy Robert.

Roberts rare and unique story showed me that a vast number of developers can likely excel in any position given the chance (even big tech).

I just wanted to say that you are good enough.

The interview practices we endure are nothing more than a filter to whittle down the demand.

When you fail an interview you are doing just that, failing a filter. It has no bearing on you, your ability, or your identity. Like Robert, if you could jump past all the interview mess you would be just fine (As an aside, I believe that Robert would likely not have made it through the traditional interview loop for the same position.)

Anyways, I hope you liked my story and wish you all the best if you are going through it also.

Lastly, I realise this post comes across bitter and jealous. It is not my intention (although perhaps I am a little). I am just a beaten-down dev struggling through it. I wish Robert the best and hope he is happy and killing it.",Invisible_Wetface,1h3deuo,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,2024-11-30 14:13:55,50,0.8,50,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3deuo

webdev,How to make LLM update code in the code editor seamlessly,"So I have a project I'm working on and it will require an LLM to update existing code and write it back to the editor,where I'm having issues is finding a good way to update anywhere within the code without Messing up unchanged ones, I know converting the source code to AST can help when doing function/class wide updates it has easy as transversing the nodes and identifying which function or classes require change.

But for use cases where the updates are limited to few lines of code or for code that are just scripts with no classes and functions,I can't really come up with a good solution to update the code with  messing up other lines that aren't affected, I've tried searching on Google to see similar implementations or articles on it but all of them only talk about how to parse and transverse AST.",FickleSwordfish8689,1h3b2pu,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3b2pu/how_to_make_llm_update_code_in_the_code_editor/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3b2pu/how_to_make_llm_update_code_in_the_code_editor/,2024-11-30 11:56:33,0,0.4,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h3b2pu
webdev,What tools or physical items help you learn?,"I noticed for me it’s easier to think when I stand or walk around my room, so I was thinking maybe I should buy a standing desk.

Also, if I’m learning some algorithm, it’s easier to visualize it if I draw on a physical whiteboard, like many of YouTube videos do explaining the algorithm. 

Or maybe an iPad but it’s expensive. 

So I’d love to hear your tools or physical items which help you learn and understand, basically an investment to become better ",lponkl,1h3ajvz,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3ajvz/what_tools_or_physical_items_help_you_learn/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3ajvz/what_tools_or_physical_items_help_you_learn/,2024-11-30 11:19:46,4,0.75,4,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h3ajvz
