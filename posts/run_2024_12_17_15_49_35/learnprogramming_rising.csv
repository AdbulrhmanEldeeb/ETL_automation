learnprogramming,Should i become a fullstack dev?,"Hi, im a uni comp sci student and love programming ive been coding since i was 14 however only ""logic based"" stuff, ive been thinking lately about what type of programmer i actually want to be im not too good at making things look good or honestly any front-end stufff however i think i could learn, just not liking it as much. Back end seems like the easyest choice then but it seems companies are in search of full-stack more than anything and with the comp sci job market in the state its on it allmost seems like the only option.

learnprogramming,"I have a CS degree but suck at programming, looking for advice on moving forward in life.","I have a degree in CS, no experience, overall suck at programming and am looking for help.

  
I understand that my only chance of getting a job in this field is to have created some outstanding project that would impress the hell out of a recruiter to the point where they could confidently assume I am proficient in my ability to design/build things. Currently this is not what I am as a developer at all.

I have dabbled in many different areas attempting to build projects and either get stuck and quit, lose interest and quit, or just feel too overwhelmed to even start. I've tried game dev and some full stack applications so far and honestly haven't accomplished much. I believe my problem is that I rely too hard on AI to write code for me. I know this is kind of a controversial thing to say, as many people who are established professionals use AI to help them write code all the time. But the problem is I'm letting AI write code I don't really understand. I'll tell myself I understand it, but later down the line when it comes to fixing something or adding something new I can't do it.

I believe a lot of my inability to program comes from my lack of programming principles. In school I learned some theory, some basic programming in C, C++, Java, and Python. In my spare time I've attempted to learn React/JavaScript, Godot, Spring boot, and databases like MongoDB and Postgresql.  I've found that generally speaking I seem to be more interested in low level code and the C++ language, but when it comes to jobs involving these things it seems the main industries are quant and embedded systems which I have no foundation in at all, and don't even know how to start learning them.

I've tried learning through YouTube and online courses and have found that these just don't work for me. They are either too slow and boring or too fast and not explanatory enough. I know most people say to just learn by trying to build things, but I don't even know where to begin half the time. 

I have neglected learning through reading books outside of the ones I have read during my degree. I think I need to change my method of studying to something else besides watching videos and maybe do more reading so if anybody has an books they recommend that genuinely helped them be more confident in programming I would appreciate any suggestion. 

Thank you for reading.",Big_Organization_181,1hg444i,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hg444i/i_have_a_cs_degree_but_suck_at_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hg444i/i_have_a_cs_degree_but_suck_at_programming/,2024-12-17 05:54:49,77,0.91,77,0,59,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hg444i
learnprogramming,How do you guys retain what you've learned?,"Rn i am taking an Data science python course and just finished learning about NumPy and moving over to pandas. However while rn i have learned and even practiced a bit with NumPy, by the time i'll reach the end of the course i'll most likely forget many of the topics i've learned. This has happened before with me when i was learning about algorithms. 

The course is pretty big so there is a whole lot of to cover and while the basics i've understood, the more advanced concepts is what i'll forget by the time i'll have to give the test to get my certificate. 

  
So my question how do you guys retain everything that you learn? Do you learn a concept and then keep practicing until its at your finger tips or do you write notes for later? I find writing notes to be very tedious and it makes learning a chore. It was fine for college, but when learning myself i don't feel like notes are very productive.

learnprogramming,How do I convert a base 2¹²⁸ number into a denary string?,"I honestly don't know where I'm supposed to ask this, which is why I'm asking here. I'm trying to write my own BigInt implementation in Rust, and I'm using an array of unsigned 128-bit integers. My idea is a base 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 (2¹²⁸) number system, where each digit is a `u128` in the array (`arr[0]` is the unit's digit).

The problem with my idea is that I have no idea how I'm supposed to convert this type of number into a string. I can't just sum up the _digits_ multiplied by powers of 128, that's the whole reason I'm writing a BigInt implementation in the first place...",prawnydagrate,1hgac2l,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hgac2l/how_do_i_convert_a_base_2¹²⁸_number_into_a_denary/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hgac2l/how_do_i_convert_a_base_2¹²⁸_number_into_a_denary/,2024-12-17 13:13:44,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hgac2l
learnprogramming,Files organization in a python project.,"I am developing some physics project, and the directory dedicated to computation looks something like

    computation/
        Physics/
            __init__.py
            utilScripts.py
            mainCalculation.py
        Results/
            case1/
                case1.txt
            case2/
                case2.txt
        calc1.py
        calc2.py
        plotResultsQuantity1.py
        plotResultsQuantity2.py

Where `calc1.py` and `calc2.py` use the Physics module to obtain different results. For example in `calc1.py` it might be interested in testing how the simulation looks like as I change the initial conditions, whereas `case2.py` does the usual simulation (whatever that means) but outputs some very specific plot at each step in the simulation (which I achieve by appropriately wrappinng a method defined in `mainCalculation.py.`

Finally, `plotResultsQuantityN.py` has a file selector that gives a choice (in this example, between `case1.txt` and `case2.txt`) so that it can plot `QuantityN` from the different data sets. For example in `plotResultsQuantity1.py` I might be plotting the derivative of the file that I choose, where as in `plotResultsQuantity2.py` I might be interested in calculating the integral.

Now the project has gotten fairly big, and the amount of files has grown really fast in the last couple of weeks. I think now it would a good time in which I should reorganize the directory so that utilization is easier in the future.

What would be a nicer way of organizing this? I was thinking of

            plotResults1.py    
            plotResults2.py
       calculate.py
       plot.

Where `calculate.py` looks something like

    from Calculations import calc1

    calc1.main()

if I want to reobtain the calculations done in `calc1.py`.

Is this a nice way of doing it?

learnprogramming,How to loop datasource in UI.Vision,"I created a functioning script that opens a page, selects options 1 and 2 from a.csv file, and submits; it then loops and repeats the process. Everything has been wonderful up to this point. Just one issue: it does not utilize row 2 from try number 2.

So, for example, row one options 1 and 2 are orange and fruit, respectively, whereas row 2 options 1 and 2 are carrot and vegetable. However, when I execute the script, even if I loop it ten times, it will continue to publish orange and fruit rather than attempting 20 additional entries.CSV file.

I'm posting my basic code here in case someone can spot the problem and fix it so that I may attempt the loop with data from the following line on successive tries.

learnprogramming,Data Processing automation Tool ? ,"Hello everyone. I'm a data science graduate
 
I remember once working with this tool like 2 years ago ( maybe library, or a package downloaded from github) that helps automate data preprocessing. 

You would run the library in jupyter notebook and the output of the cell will be the table (if you're workign with a table) and you would perform the treatment manually on the table. And when you run it, the code of the process you did will be generated. 

I've been searching for it for so long, it's starting to feel like i was on a good fever dream and it's not coming back. 

Does anyone recognize it?
