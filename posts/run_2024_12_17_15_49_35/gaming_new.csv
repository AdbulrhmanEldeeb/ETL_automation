gaming,Is framerate blindness a thing?,"So I started playing Yakuza Kiwami 2 a few weeks ago and I'm loving it. But it was an absolute pain to get working.

- controller prompts were incorrect
- kept opening far too large on the second monitor

Eventually I gave up with trying to get the controller to work and now I turn off my second monitor when playing. But I also noticed last night that I had been playing the game at 40fps for at least a few days after I had to tweak some driver settings. The game itself is set to uncapped, but my monitor had changed from 120 to 40. I understand not noticing a change between 60 and 120, cause I haven't for most games. But a change beween 40 and 120 should have been easily noticeable.

I've said in the past to friends that I can play games as low as 30fps depending on the type (sprite-based, puzzle, etc), after that it gets too noticeable for me. But there's something wrong if I didn't notice I was playing at 4fps for several days and only realised by accident while in a completely different app.",Safebox,1hg8oc7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hg8oc7/is_framerate_blindness_a_thing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hg8oc7/is_framerate_blindness_a_thing/,2024-12-17 11:31:33,0,0.34,0,0,61,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hg8oc7

gaming,Gaming with Gemini: Have any of you tried it?,"Just got done trying out sharing my screen with Gemini 2.0 while gaming. I played Forza Motorsport, Madden 25, and Rocket League. It's really neat being able to get near real-time feedback on what's going on in your game while playing. Though it's not always accurate.

  
Forza Motorsport: 

\+ It gave me information about the telemetry on screen and explained them in detail if I asked. 

\+ Explained what's happening during race when asked. It explained what penalty I got and why (specifically telling me which car I collided with)

\+ Suggested the next race to pick

\- Inaccurate fairly often. Got what place I was in wrong a couple of times and a couple of other information was wrong

  
Madden 25:

\+ Can provide a logical play call for specific scenarios. Suggested I call a run play at the end of the game while I was winning.

\+ Can read the defense (zone or man)

\+ Can tell you what route is likely to be open

\+ I got it to do some play-by-play commentary for a little bit. But it was too slow and sometimes inaccurate on what actually happened at times.

\- Often inaccurate with information.

Rocket League:

I was getting destroyed so I didn't ask it much. The only thing I asked was what just happened and it said the orange team scored when I was the one that scored on the blue team.

gaming,Impressions of CoD: Black Ops 6 multiplayer from a person who hasn't played CoD since 2009,"To be completely precise, I have never played CoD multiplayer and have always stuck to the single-player campaigns. The last game in the series I played was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which was 15 years ago. Since then, I have been indifferent to the series, but I have heard that the new CoD games are popular precisely because of the multiplayer

When I saw that a temporary trial of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer was available on PSN, I decided to give it a try and... was extremely disappointed. At first, I was unpleasantly surprised by the overloaded interface and background videos while waiting for the game, where they show close-ups of the operators. The wait seemed quite long for such a popular game. The cosmetic sets seemed completely garish, awkward and tasteless. The graphics and gameplay also didn't make any impression, especially compared to really cool multiplayer games like The Finals.

gaming,What is the best combat system in an action game?,"I was just thinking about Assassin's Creed 2, a game I haven't played in a very long time. But I do remember that it was from before when the explicit indicators that someone was about to attack you was introduced. So it was on YOU to watch the enemies actions and predict their attacks. Time didn't slow down or anything and the enemies weren't slow. Their attacks could be quick and difficult to predict. So I remember having a really fun time with the combat in that game and I don't really know why AC2 and ACB aren't talked about for their fun, challenging, and well balanced combat.

There's also another game that I haven't played in a very long time. People used to talk all about how the Arkham games had the best combat system but I thought it paled in comparison to the most fun and fluid yet still challenging combat system, the best combat system in a game I have ever seen, the combat system of Sleeping Dogs. Now maybe I am remembering the combat too fondly since it was so long ago that I played it. And practically every single other thing in the game was done better by Rockstar in their GTA games. But the combat tho..... that shit was to die for🥵. Like, who would have thought that you could implement Kung Fu into a video game and not make an absolute clusterfuck of a system, but also actually make it good??? Fun, fluid, and challenging. A simplistic fundamental system that anyone can pick up yet made complex by the numerous combos you could learn as you progress in experience. The story, the money, the outfits, the cars..... everything in that game was just an excuse to facilitate a game that centres around what it was *really* made for; hand to hand combat by means of Kung Fu.

Like am I wrong about that? Because I don't hear people mention the combat in that game. Am I just fondly remembering a game that I played when I was a dumb incompetent kid? Or does it still hold up as an adult?

gaming,What would be a good setting for a new Assassin's Creed game?,"It's true, we complain a lot about Assassins Creed. Whether its the fact that Ubisoft likes money (gasp), the games are historically inaccurate (true), or that certain demographics are forced (that is a subjective argument that I'd like to ignore for this topic.

That being said, the settings of the previous AC's have several things in common: a land with a prolonged conflict, between classes, ethnicities or religion. Neither party has control over the whole map and fighting occurs sporadically and locally. Usually the map involves different cities and the newer games involve naval battles. You also meet up and coming scientists and philosophers and new technologies become available. That being said, I hereby present my idea:

The Netherlands during the 80 years' war 1568-1648).

Hear me out. During this period the Dutch had their ""golden age"", mastering the seas, even though they had a war of independence with Spain. The Dutch were protestant, Spain catholic, which lead to regional warfare where the occupied south practiced Catholicism and the north Protestantism. Several cities were sieged with new inventions, like the Dutch using pumps to drain water protecting the besieged cities. With regards to art, science and philosophy; Jheronimus Bosch and Leeghwater come to mind and also the fact that the VOC was founded, the first publicly owned company with a very dubious past. It was also a time when many of the amazing buildings we are still mesmerising over were being built and when ""the new world"" was still new (the Dutch founded New York in 1624).

That being said, it would help if Ubisoft would try to not make all the Dutch people speak Gernan.

gaming,Games with Japanese Cyberpunk Body Horror Aesthetic,"Let's talk about this, because it is one of my all time favorite aesthetics to explore and view. Biomech horror (specifically of the Japanese variety), prime examples of what I'm referring to:

Baroque

Observer

Dread Delusion

Hibernaculum 

Garage: Bad Dream Adventure 

Elemental Gearbolt (PS1)

Volfoss (PS1)

Galerians (PS1)

Hellnight (PS1)

Nemu Lu Mayu - Sleeping Cocoon (PS1)

Darkseed

Lust From Beyond

Scorn 

Axiom Verge

Golden Light

Alien Crush

R-Type

Angel's Gear



Notable mention of:

Koudelka (PS1)

SMT games, they have a lot of influence here sometimes

Wizardry Dimguil, it's more dark fantasy than the others with some INSANE creature designs

Phantasy Star, FF final bosses, Contra, anything Berserk/FromSoft



Specifically Baroque + Garage grab the aesthetic more than anything else I've played and I wish there was more adaptation of crazy grotesque influenced grime + cable aesthetic. Basically anything as a direct video game influence of any Tsukomoto or Yoshihiro Nishimura movie, with a splash of Akira. I have been researching into this genre for years now and I feel I have maybe covered everything and there is nothing left to find, so PLEASE let me know your suggestions!

gaming,The Souls-like genre is becoming oversaturated - agree or disagree?,"The souls-like genre has really blown up over the past 5 years or so. Before then it was mostly Fromsoft games (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, etc), with a few lower quality imitators (The Surge, Lords of the Fallen, Mortal Shell, etc).

There are a lot of souls-likes now. Like, too many maybe, to the point of oversaturation. The soulslike genre is starting to feel like how the rhythm genre felt a decade ago, before it imploded on itself and died. It’s not unexpected for developers to shift towards making games in this genre, especially after Elden Ring was so successful, and it’s not even that the games themselves are low quality like before. Titles like Lies of P, Black Myth Wukong, and Thiasma are genuinely excellent games.

I think it becomes an issue of innovation and repetition. The genre seems to be nearing its peak in terms of mechanics and innovation, or at least as far as devs are willing to take it. Most games in the genre play like Dark Souls 3, a game that came out nearly a decade ago. The most innovation the genre has seen is incorporating deflects like in Sekiro and Lies of P. Even Elden Ring, which many would consider to be the peak of the genre, other than the open world, is mechanically identical to DS3. I don’t think anyone can deny that these games aren’t high quality and fantastic, but they all play very similarly, and it seems like it’s going to be difficult to advance the genre further than where it’s at. 

And yet, because the genre is successful, games are likely going to be pumped out until the genre dies. Unlike shooters or sports games, I don’t think this genre can survive long term while recycling its own mechanics and ideas over and over again. Fromsoft, who are undeniably the top of the food chain in this genre, even seem to be running out of ideas for actual gameplay innovation, and are pushing the enemies difficulty further in bizarre ways such as delayed hits, leading to controversial bosses like the final boss of the Elden Ring DLC and quite a few others from that game.

Maybe it’s burnout on my part. I’ve been playing these games for over a decade, since Demon’s Souls on PS3. I was able to see the genre advance to where it is now, and to me, it’s been stagnant for at least the last 5 years. I wasn’t even able to finish the Elden Ring DLC as it felt so samey to everything else that’s come out in the last few years, and by the time I beat the final boss, I just shelved the game and had no drive to explore the rest of the DLC or to start up a new run with the new builds introduced in the DLC, which would be unheard of just a few years ago. 

I don’t expect that this topic will be well received given how popular the genre is right now, and again, it’s not like the games coming out are bad by any means (and indeed, are routinely game of the year contenders now). But I also would not be surprised if the genre has mostly died out by 2030, particularly if innovation isn’t ramped up. But I wouldn’t even know how to suggest innovation, the genre has potentially reached a peak in that regard. Anyways, interested to see what others have to say on the subject.

Did anyone else find the number of bugs increasing in the final few zones? Did anyone else feel like those parts of the game felt less polished or more rushed?

Just curious how others felt. This was a game that was almost a 10/10 for me — and one that really surprised me mechanically, since I don’t really like any of the gameplay elements in other games/on their own — but the friction as I got later on really pulled things down.

gaming,Microsoft's $100B Acquisitions: Apparently the New-Original IPs are staying Xbox-Exclusive (for now),"**Note:** As of now I only own PS5 and may setup (budget issues, lol) a PC in next couple of years if non-PS games really become attractive to me. Even though I'll get downvoted but I personally feel that there should be some exclusives attached to a brand if a brand is targeting a platform/hardware system. Since MS has spent 100B on acquiring studios, its simply not possible to keep everything exclusive as PS is the moneymaker in software as well. But I observed a very cool thing. I've seen that apart from few exceptions (Hellblade 2 &amp; Licensed IPs), Xbox hasn't announced new-owned IPs for Playstation, YET. Yes, lots of games 1st party games are announced for PS but those were already the games which had their previous parts released on PS and weren't closely associated with Xbox brand. Saying that, following is what I've observed. \[*I'm excluding PC and Nintendo from this discussion as Nintendo seems to be on another plane while PC has been adopted by even Sony*\]

* **New Original IPs:** Exclusive to Xbox for now
   1. Starfield
   2. Avowed
   3. Perfect Dark
   4. South of Midnight
   5. Clockwork Revolution
   6. Everwild
   7. Redfall
* **Signature IPs:** Have always been associated with Xbox (or MS in case of Flight Simulator)
   1. Halo Infinite
   2. Forza Horizon 5
   3. Forza Motorsport 2023
   4. State of Decay 3
   5. Fable 2025
   6. Gears E-Day
   7. MS Flight Simulator 2020 &amp; 2024
* **Owned IPs:** Announced or released for PS
   * COD: Black Ops 6
   * Diablo 4
   * Doom: The Dark Ages
   * The Outer Worlds 2
   * Sea of Thieves
   * Deathloop
   * Ghostwire: Tokyo
* Exceptions
   * Hellblade 2 - Still seems to be exclusive even though part 1 was released on PS, so it's a bit difficult to associate this brand with Xbox. May become multi platform
   * Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle - Licensed IP. Would have been nice for a good xbox game to be exclusive but since branding is the main thing so it may not have much of an impact.
   * Blade - May become multi-platform. It's a Marvel brand so no point of pushing it to become Xbox's brand
* State of Xbox - Rumors/Confirmations/Observations
   * GamePass seems to be the core brand for MS Gaming and future
   * Pushing for everything to be ""This is an Xbox"".
   * There's still one more console that they'll release as per Sarah Bond

I think having these 14-15 big exclusive IPs can still be realistic to manage and will also add prestige to xbox brand just like PS has God of War, Uncharted, LOU, Intergalactic, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, Infamous, Astrobot, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Resistance, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Returnal, Days Gone and many others.",blinkyretard,1heqz2v,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,2024-12-15 11:46:20,0,0.24,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heqz2v

gaming,"6 Decades of gaming, 6 Decades of Male Main Characters","Gaming as a whole has been oddly male oriented for decades, even after the gaming census a couple years ago and all data collected showing nearly 48% of ""gamers"" are women, men still seem to be the vocal majority. Recently during the game awards and this year, we've seen a bunch of trailers with females as the main protagonist (which i have absolutely no issue with, considering Lora Croft paved the way for some badass characters).

The vocal minority of social media trolls immediately jumping on the 30 second-5 minute trailers as "" woke "" or "" agenda driven "" has really made me wonder why are we so oddly angry about this now?  Take Witcher 4 for an idea, all i see is comments about people being angry that the STORY DRIVEN narrative is now Cersi's perspective even though that's the only direction it should have went. 

Some incredible games have came with female leads

Tomb Raider

Horizon Zero Dawn

The Last of Us

Cyberpunk 2077 (V is canonically female)

Bayonetta

Yet the gaming community is so wrapped up in this toxic understanding that gaming companies are pushing any sort of agenda. Of course companies have the right to produce anything they like, and the fact that most of these misogynistic apelike men masturbated to Lora Croft growing up in their miserable bedrooms, and most likely still do, what is it about now that makes you so unnecessarily loud. We pride companies on following their own values.

Just irritated how video games have fallen into this absolutely abysmal state because everyone is sucked into the abyss of politics they have NO idea about.

The PC version significantly improves lighting. Characters’ faces appear more lifelike with balanced illumination, and the shadows are sharper with better depth, making scenes with Aerith and Cloud stand out even more.

Background Details
The environments look much clearer and more refined. Effects like the glowing bokeh in Aerith’s scene appear smoother, while Cloud’s surroundings benefit from sharper textures and greater detail.

Texture Quality
The PC version enhances textures across the board. Aerith’s hair shows individual strands, and Cloud’s outfit looks crisper and more detailed, making the characters feel even more realistic.

Color Grading
Colors on PC are richer and more vibrant, with improved contrast. It avoids the slightly washed-out look seen on PS5, resulting in a more visually dynamic presentation.

Ambient Occlusion &amp; Effects
Small details, like shading in clothing folds and subtle creases, are much more refined.

[https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27096](https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27096)

[https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/](https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/)

From Famitsu:

**--Even though there is an online main mode, why did you include the single mode ""Old Amasia Investigation""?**

**Futami**　I didn't want to make a game that would become unplayable if online play were to become unavailable in the future, so I prepared a single mode. Of course, we intend to continue the service, and I don't want it to be taken in a negative sense, but I wanted players to feel reassured that this is not a game that they will no longer be able to play. I also wanted to draw a contrast as a story. In the main story, the player and their own Magus will depict the drama of each player. However, it is not conveyed from within the game how the player interacts with other Magus. So, by looking at the relationship between Alba and Ada, I wanted players to be aware of the relationship between themselves and their own Magus.

**--It has increased a little recently, but most online games cannot be played again once the service ends, so that is a nice consideration.**

**Futami**　Of course, we want to continue the service, but we wanted to get rid of the feeling that the game would become unplayable once the service ends.

**--Will it be possible to play the game completely offline from the beginning?**

**Futami**　No, the introduction to online play is absolutely necessary, and it is unlocked once you have progressed to a certain extent. It is a mode that can be played even after the service ends, but it is not set to be playable completely offline from the time of release.

　Of course, we are considering how to deal with that situation, but we are only making it possible to deal with it, and we do not want to change our stance that it is basically a ""mode that is useful for online play,"" so at this time online play is also required.

From GamerNE:

\--This game is an online-only title, but I think it's quite rare for an online-only title to be sold as a one-time purchase.

Futami: That's right... I think what everyone is worried about on that point is, ""Will I no longer be able to play the game once the service ends?""

However, I would like to make it clear that even if the online service ends, the game will still be playable.

\--What do you mean?

Futami: It's true that currently, online play is required to play this game, but we've already prepared a way to make it possible to play offline. The reason it's required to be online is because we don't want to store data locally to prevent so-called cheating.

Of course, since the game is primarily online, there will be limitations to what you can play, but please rest assured that the packages and games you purchase will not be completely wasted.",JaSonic2199,1heahcu,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,2024-12-14 19:32:43,42,0.77,42,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heahcu

\*\*\*

""On this day the 11th of October 2024, we announce SUMMER ETERNAL.

  
We recognize we are writing the opening words of our story at a time of apocalyptic material conditions for game creators across the world.

Our art has been dressed down into an industry,and this industry has been pilfered by corrupt executives, by the vulgar profiteering of corporate bodies moving like leviathans in the dark, burning human fuel in their insatiable lust for money.

It is not pencil-pushers and moneylenders who make games. It is the relentless passion of the workers that creates an art form capable of saying something true.

  
As creators and game makers, we have too long been led away from the truth, away from the right to define ourselves as artists in service of the definitive art form of the future, one that has made us dream since we were children.

Instead, the disposability culture operating at the ruthless core of this industry wants us to think of ourselves as cogs in the machine: rudimentary craftsmen, disposable career workers, inert producers of made-to-order marketing-driven ""content"" — empty calories leaving the soul hungry.

The Profiteer knows that by keeping your dignity low, he will keep you crawling on the treadmill of passion until he lays you off for the sake of the red number in his book.

We make games because we have to. It is our calling. Because we have no choice but to see the transformative potential of this youngest medium of human interaction. You can't turn away once you've seen the light,Or it will always feel like everyone else in the world is doing something without you, there in the light you try to abandon but can't, because — oh, the horror — it comes from inside you.

All art is communication — dialogue across time, space and thought. In its rawest, it is one mind’s ability to provoke emotion in another.Large language models— simulacra, cold comfort, real-doll pocket-pussy, cyberspace freezer of an abandoned IM-chat — which are today passed off for “artificial intelligence”,will never be able to offer a dialogue with the vision of another human being.

Machine-generated works will never satisfy or substitute the human desire for art, as our desire for art is in its core a desire for communication with another,with a talent who speaks to us across worlds and ages to remind us of our all-encompassing human universality. There is no one to connect to in a large language model. The phone line is open but there’s no one on the other side.

The peddlers who aim to get rich quick from this scheme will always PLAY THE FOOL to any ethical or artistic argument. This is why we must push back against Big Tech's encroachment on the territory of our art,against increasing corporatization and alienation of game creators from their work, against the robbery of rights from workers, performers, artists and all contributors to this complicated and MULTI-FACETED medium.

Our mission is to unite world-class artists and creatives in a truly independent game studio which will always prioritize artistic integrity over personal comfort, profit margin, short term interests and Big Tech profit-bubbles.

There we will be able to embark on that treacherous road of building a cultural megaproject, a Role Playing Game with complexity and ambition worthy to rival our wretched and wonderful world.

In this we are committed to pursue the highest caliber of literary quality.

Here we stand, bound by our love for games and devotion to our craft, ready to bleed and weep and ride the cavalry into machine gun fire one more time.

For this we will need all the support and help from you, our readers, colleagues and future visionaries. Come walk the desert with us.

We will not take any of your support for granted.We have seen the suffering wrought by the hunger for power, the terror of greed and envy, the complicity of the averted eye. We have also seen the triumph of the human spirit, of solidarity in the striving, of making something never before seen and seeing its miracle unfold in the world. We have seen poverty, and we have seen plenty. We will make mistakes, we will win and we will fail, but we will never forget what we are doing this for.  
  
Yours in every season,

gaming,Witcher 4 Controversy ,"The Witcher 4 trailer and the discussions around it really have me thinking, we aren’t ever gonna solve the problem with bickering in gaming are we? I mean I have seen so many comments complaining about people who are complaining that they “don’t want to play as a girl” than I have of actual people complaining about playing a girl. It’s got the point where people are so ready for outrage and bigotry that they pre-empt it, which in turn causes the bigotry and complaints they didn’t want to see. Now I am not saying there aren’t some weird bigots out there because there are. But man we are so ready for L takes that we start to complain about them when they don’t exist and almost breath life into them. 

I thought the trailer was great and it hyped me up. It’s sad to see the state of the gaming community, I think social media has a lot to blame for this tbh. I personally don’t like forced inclusivity, you know the kind where the protagonist is a minority and the devs harp on about their gender, ethnicity, cultural background or sexual orientation more than they do the game mechanics or story, ye that I dislike. This however, isn’t that. It’s been very obvious where they were going after the Witcher 3 and this feels like a natural progression.

gaming,What are some notable absences from TheGameAwards trailer showcase?,"I would start with two obvious ones: GTA VI.. Rockstar Games dont need those shows really, they can shadowdrop on a monday at 7 am and still sell hilarious number.. Switch 2 .. same story Nintendo does their own stuff, whenever they want to. .

But.. for me most notably: 

What about the new Fable? Shouldnt there be some gameplay by now? This game has been in dev for ages.. (also since Playground games works hard on this.. is Forza Horizon on ice?)

Judas (from Ken Levine, Bioshock founder) should also be playable? No Trailers? Should we be worried? A new Bioshock game is also in develoopment right now... 

 I thought we might get a few hints about new Marvel games.. Wolverine? Blade? 

No news from the KOTOR remake.. 

I thought about Devil May Cry aswell,but Capcom had Okami and Onimusha so that was great.

Silksong?

Kojima was there.. but no new Death Stranding 2 infos... sus?

Doom Dark Ages?

(i think i am still missing a few bigger ones, will maybe edit)

gaming,Why are people calling the Intergalactic premise/aesthetic unoriginal?  What about Uncharted and the Last of Us was original to you?,"
I know it’s cool to hate on Naughty Dog at the moment but to try and bash this trailer by calling the premise unoriginal is hilarious to me.  

Uncharted and The Last of Us are both phenomenal franchises but they both HEAVILY borrow themes and aesthetics from existing media, and that’s part of their charm.  Naughty Dog do not make experimental, avant-garde games.  They design games in environments we’re familiar with from films, literature and other video games and they do it better than anyone else - that’s precisely the reason they’re so popular.

The only reason this is now suddenly an issue is unfortunately obvious following the discourse surrounding Naughty Dog lately but it’s so frustrating because all I want to do is engage in a positive discussion over what is a really fucking impressive trailer. 

The technical achievements alone in that trailer are absolutely outstanding.  The animation, the voice work, the fucking AWESOME original soundtrack.  That’s what we should be discussing here surely, and I hate that some people are writing off a trailer like that because of pre-determined personal bias.",Finellaclark,1hdlxh4,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,2024-12-13 20:49:00,0,0.44,0,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdlxh4

gaming,Balatro’s Success got me thinking of some other unorthodox roguelike ideas,"A poker inspired rogue-like becoming one of the most lauded indies of recent memory is definitely not something that was on my 2024 bingo card. But it got me thinking… what are some other genres that haven’t been explored by the often dubbed “over explored” genre of roguelikes?

Specifically, I thought of bowling and darts. Choose to start off a run with a specific bowling ball or dart set with their own unique playstyles. Upgrade your rolling or throwing techniques with rogue-like abilities. Add cool interactions between the bowling pins or the way darts are scored. If there are any hidden games like these please inform me as I would love to check them out. 

Additionally I was thinking that maybe the rogue-like genre could be a good way to reintroduce the old-school arcady street sports games from the 2000s. The industry has pivoted away from them for whatever reason but maybe put it under the umbrella of the popular rogue-like genre and we could get a spiritual successor to those nostalgic games.

I feel a few weeks ago, Palworld's popularity was steadily dying and that the initial hype was more 'trend' than substance (not that Palworld is a bad game, but that the launch hype was something that they likely would never get close to replicating again).

But now after the lawsuit, at least in my head, I feel like Palworld as a franchise has gone from 'indie one hit wonder' to something more meaningful and long-standing. It feels like the fight against Nintendo makes Palworld even that much more legitimate of a gaming universe going forward... The full release of Palworld is going to go viral again merely off of all the new lawsuit drama lol

gaming,The industry’s AAA revenue problem,"After the very real issue of layoffs and the sometimes toxic revenue model of the industry was brought to the forefront at The Game Awards last night I thought I would create a post to have a constructive discussion on the state of the industry if we can (please try).
The industry has a genuine problem.   The cost of what we consider AAA or even AA game development is at an all time high.   The old model of just selling a game for $70 and hoping to sell enough copies to make money doesn’t work anymore.  If this model was retained, the baseline price tag of most games should really be $120 for example…but consumers don’t want that. Companies are mandating either micro transactions, live-service, etc as a way to even just stay in business let alone profitable.  Gamers generally don’t want that either…but it has worked. There’s nothing wrong with profit; it often helps funds next projects.   No one is staying in this business if they are not making profit. We have seen how many companies have gone out of business even when gaming switched from SD to HD graphics with the 360 era.   Companies are less likely to take risks on new IP because they don’t want to lose money.  We have seen larger companies like Microsoft make massive acquisitions of several smaller studios and have said it’s bad for the industry; but how many of those companies would have eventually gone the way of Midway and just gone out of business eventually.   If you’re still reading this; thank you…just wanted to put some thoughts out there to have some focused discussions…not rants, discussions hopefully.

If you know of any hard but fair game, whether niche or popular, feel free to name it. 

Here are just a few guidelines though:
- single player would be better

- no rogue likes/lites or bullet hells because I just don’t really like them sorry

- the game must still be somewhat fair. I don’t want inflated difficulty just for the sake of « ahah my game is absolutely unbeatable »

-I’ve already played fromsoft games so no need to recommend those

gaming,"Has there ever been a game recommendation website that behaves similar to how social media sites recommend friends based on ""mutual friends"", where it will recommend games based on ""mutual games"", however the games are reverse-weighted?","Specifically, I was thinking of a sort of unique algorithm, where it would weight games based on reverse-popularity (or at least a toggle feature for it).

So, a game like Super Mario World on SNES, or Sonic on Sega Genesis would have a very low weight, due to it's popularity (measured by how many others have the game favorited).

Whereas, a game like Gain Ground on Sega Genesis, or Xardion on SNES would have a very low weigh, due to their popularity, and the fact that me and 3 other people have played them.

My thinking is, say I had 100 of variety of games ""favorited"". Of those, if I have 20 niche games, and it pairs me up with someone who also has some of those games in their list, it would stand to reason, we have a very similar taste in games (with the other lower-weighted games help support it), and should have a very high likelyhood of enjoying what other games the other person has favorited that we are unaware of.

The website can also offer suggestions independent of other users, by stack ranking your list against the popularity of other titles, using the same algorithm.

gaming,A reveal: I'm so ready for this eventuality,"Theres a microchip floating through space.  Something happened to it, but what?  

You hear a voice, Stephen Fry's voice actually:

""Oh, what do we have here?  You seem to have had a very, very, bad day.  I know just the ...thing... that might - just - help.  Ah!  And here it is now.""

A spaceship is heard arriving off screen and a glowing blue cord with a little circle at the end flows out of it after a pop.  The string grabs the Microchip and pulls it towards the still off-screen ship.  Slowly, the ship is revealed and with it a familiar silhouette pulling the cord.  It's SACKBOY!

""Its been awhile, Sack-Thing,"" Stephen Frys voice says again.  \*Sackboy begins waving his arms around and nearly (and iconically) slaps the Micro-Chip back out into space\* ""Yes, Yes, its great to see you too but be careful!  We'll reminisce later, first things first little sack-thing, can you Imagine any way to help this other-thing, whatever it is?""  

Sackboy thinks for a moment before jumping up in excitement and opening up his pop-it and creates a Sackbot from thin air.  Using his Pop-It-Cursor, he opens the Sackbots Microchip Brain and places the mysterious space microchip inside it.

Immediately, a pair of round blue eyes pop up on the Sackbots previously empty wooden face, with some glitching.  No other features appear.

""Ah yes!  Wonderful idea!  Hello new friend, can you hear me?""  The Sackbot jumps in surprise at the narrative voice, but nods a yes.

""Can you tell us what happened to you?""  The Sackbot thinks and shakes its head, ""no"".  

""No? Well, then perhaps we should just start, with your name, can you tell us that?""

The Sackbot thinks again, narrowing its solid blue eyes and says, with a question,

""I...am...Astro-Bot?""

gaming,Game narrative idea,"This is just a loose overview not a beat by beat. 

1. Player is working for a mentor performing assignments. To keep it simple let's say getting to and destroying guarded broadcast towers which are (they are told) being used to subjugate villagers. 


2. As they are partway through completing one of these quests, something gets their attention about this being not quite as believed. Further investigation unveils that these are _not_ subjugating people but form a defence network. 

The player, instead of helping people, is endangering them. The guards are also villagers protecting their defences. In fact the very mentor who directed them is a villain.

3. Although they don't have direct interaction with the mentor until the end, the enemies along the way work for the mentor. 

The player now desires to undo the damage they have done but, unsurprisingly, the villagers don't trust them so that's an additional hurdle. The player killed their friends and neighbours so at best they will get a begrudging compliance. 

4. The final boss is the former mentor (yes, this has been done before such as in Assassin's Creed 1) who has gained power in the background after the player helped them. The player does not want to fight and maybe kill the mentor but is left with no alternative. 

Thoughts? Yes I'm sure this has been done before. ",TwinSong,1hd15b5,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hd15b5/game_narrative_idea/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hd15b5/game_narrative_idea/,2024-12-13 01:36:42,0,0.43,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hd15b5

gaming,Idea: Ranking games by their devs,"This is an idea I've had for a month or two now, and I can't imagine I'm the first person to suggest something like this:

People want to be able to experience works of art made by artists they like.  But with video games, the art in question is being developed by potentially hundreds or thousands of people, and it's harder to ascribe authorship to any one person.  Yes, AAA gaming still has the rare Hideo Kojima or Sam Lake, but it's more common for people to follow game companies- which is fine in the short term, but once enough developers leave or get laid off, it turns into the Studio of Theseus.  And all the while, the big publishers want us to focus on the franchise itself rather than the people behind it.

So what if you could keep track of all the individual game devs from project to project?  My idea here is a website that would keep track of games and their devs, and be able to compare them based on how many devs are shared.  So for instance you'd be able to select Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, and find out that they shared (wild guess) 85% of the same devs.  The most obvious challenge is how much weight you give to certain devs, since a game's director is probably more responsible for its vision then, say, a guy who modelled some of the enemy bicycles.  I know basically nothing about how responsibility is divided up within a studio, but just for example you could have the director given 25% of the credit, the department heads another 25%, and the remainder split among everyone else.

I feel like a lot of people would have the same kinds of problems with this that they do with systems like RottenTomatoes, but respect for artistic vision in AAA gaming is in such dire straits, I'd think any version of this would be an improvement.",MiloHawkins,1hcn5np,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,2024-12-12 15:10:54,0,0.32,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcn5np

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am heading off now ... thanks very much for all your questions, it was fun to do my first AMA and I hope I answered everything to your satisfaction!

You can judge the quality of my insight by what is announced tonight, so I raise a can of Red Bull to any of you who are staying up late to watch it!

For everyone that’s not though, we’ll have coverage all through the night (or at least from after 4 am, when it ends) and continuing into the morning. 

Whether this is a milestone in the current generation of consoles or just another wet squib, I hope everyone gets at least a couple of announcements to interest them and that The Game Awards 2024 sets us up for a more optimistic 2025!

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Hi, I’m David from GameCentral and I’m part of the Metro judging panel for The Game Awards, one of many contributing to the nominations and winner ballot for this year’s event.**

I’ve been leading Metro’s video games coverage for over a decade now and can discuss every element of the games industry as long as it doesn’t involve sports or driving a car in a straight line!

GameCentral has been contributing to The Game Awards for several years now and, unlike almost everything else about the games industry, it doesn’t tend to have that many leaks about its reveals. There are some [official confirmations already though, and a lot of unsubstantiated rumours, so it’s going to be fun to speculate on](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/11/game-awards-2024-predictions-gta-6-split-fiction-rumours-22170224/) what could be the most important night of the year for gaming...

I can’t tell you who we voted for at The Game Awards, and it would be undiplomatic for me to talk about who might win, but if you want to **Ask Me Anything else about the event -** [**in particular what I hope and expect in terms of new trailers and announcements**](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/12/half-life-3-rumoured-one-game-awards-2024-megaton-announcements-22173667/) \- you can tune into our AMA on Thursday 12th December at 5 pm GMT.

gaming,Are we ever going to get a sense of normalcy back for the AAA gaming space?,"Just saw a post that explains how Activision has a patent in place for a system that maximizes exposure of players with bought skins towards non-paid skinned players. Just reminds me of how desperately greedy every AAA company as seem to turn into. It's as if 
 
-The push for live service for every single company in the industry. 

-Ubisoft's yearly pumping out of same formulaic copies for every IP they have, becoming worse and worse every time till they get to the point where the entire company is looking to sell

-Xbox's constant fumbling of so many first party studios that they've bought out and subsequently shutdown, that's if they were able to finish their projects and release their flops of games. 

-Sony's obsession for high 
profile/cinematic/high fidelity games to get block buster sales numbers. Apparent push for live service games when single player games were what made them get the lead in the I dustry in the first place. Why does it seem

-Rockstar's refusal to develop any games outside GTA and RDR to utilize their extremely monitored online modes for years/decade to come

-EA's total flop of battlefield/battlefront do to short sighted decisions of the company, and there entire scorched earth approach towards shutting down so many studios

-So many god damn broken releases with studios having to deal with outside forces that always end up prioritizing money so far from the actual quality of the product. Even outside of that, we have constant stories of infighting in long standing studios that one way or another have an inherent lack of direction and leadership to get a working product out. This makes the lack of quality in a lot of games an issue involving terrible leadership in developer studios as much as outside interference from share holders.

Can make the list twice as long but you get the picture. It's crazy just how fucked the industry is, especially with how many studios have shut down during and after COVID, and I honestly don't believe the aftermath of COVID has had the most affect in this regard. These companies have been going down this route throughout the late 2010's and took it to overdrive this generation. I mean just look how far Sony has fallen from before, it's good damn mind blowing how much they are fumbling this generation, it's as if anyone in the company with any sense of the industry were lobotomized. 

With the pending recession thats bound to happen soon, along with the aftermath of so many studios shutting down in the past 5 years, I feel like decades of progression and development of the industry itself from now to at least the 90's is going to be totally lost. There are a handful of high profile leaders in the thick of it that are rumored to be developing new studios as we speak, but the economy is turning to shit and these kinds of studios need proper funding to get through and I just don't think many publishers are going to have reasonable demands anytime soon.

I can't help but to feel we aren't going to back to a sense of normalcy in the AAA space. We got some AA studios that have show up, plenty of indie's, but I for one miss the kind of quality, tightly and fully developed games we used to have back in the ps2-ps3/xbox-xbox360 and some of the PS4 eras (where the momentum for monitizaion really picked up). I personally don't believe the amount of indie's, majority of them on early access most of its life on the market, makes up for the lack of experiences we used to have before hand in the gaming space. And I don't believe that's speaking with rose-tinted glasses, as much as reddit likes to preach otherwise.",NamedFruit,1hc87kj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,2024-12-12 00:11:19,0,0.26,0,0,49,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hc87kj

gaming,Why are most new games that aren’t AAA titles coming out as early access?,Don’t get me wrong there are a few gems that are still in early access that are well worth the buy. My biggest issue is a lot of these games shouldn’t even be released because they’re early alpha builds at best. Damn near unplayable due to numerous bugs and glitches. I know deadlines and impatient shareholders are some reasons for early access releases. I just wish devs would go back to the way things used to be and release the finished game on launch. Early access to me feels like a cop out where the dev can keep a small team working on the game for its future updates. Then use the rest of the dev team to start working on their next game. If I wanted to play a game where all the content isn’t available from the get go I’d play an MMO or a live service game.,Southernchef87,1hbo2o7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbo2o7/why_are_most_new_games_that_arent_aaa_titles/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbo2o7/why_are_most_new_games_that_arent_aaa_titles/,2024-12-11 07:15:36,0,0.29,0,0,22,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbo2o7

gaming,Why doesn't Steam get involved in Android Gaming/Emulation?,"Mobile gaming is appareantly the biggest market in gaming: [Global increase State of Mobile Gaming Industry | GO-Globe](https://www.go-globe.com/state-of-mobile-gaming-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20the%20Mobile,2.8%20billion%20mobile%20gamers%20worldwide.). The reasons are clear. Everyone has a smartphone, but not everyone has a PC fit for gaming or a console. So the obstacles for getting into gaming are pretty low.

Sadly the Playstore mainly constists of garbage games, with a free-2-play and in-app-store monetization model. This model does not aim for good gameplay, but for pulling your money out of your pocket. There are some pearls standing out, like Dead Cells, Slay the Spire and so on, which are direct ports of their pc/console counterparts, but as they have upfront cost, appareantly the big mass does not want them or does not find them in the pile of thrash, that the Playstore is. Since they don't generate enought revenue, the willingness of other publishers to port their already existing games to Android is also neglectable.

Now comes the neat part: If you checkout r/EmulationOnAndroid , basically the whole gaming history, with the exception of the latest consoles, is available on Android through emulation. Using **Winlator** or similar, it is even possible to emulate PC games, without much hassle. I have seen videos of Skyrim, Witcher 3 and even Cyberpunk getting played on High End Android devices. Since this is possible, this eleminates the need for porting games, you can just play the PC version, if you want to. As i understood it, the Steam Deck does the same. It creates a compatibility layer for PC games for the Steam Deck hardware/OS, they were not initially made for.

Now comes the big question: Since such feats can be accomplished by just a few developers worldwide, why is lets say Valve/Steam so not interesed in this topic? They already have a mobile app, with Steam Link a powerful editor for mobile controls and the compatibility layer through their Steam OS. If they tie these parts together they could have a third platform, they could distribute their games for. Imagine you buy a game on Steam and you could play it on PC, on the Steam Deck AND on Android!

It is definitely technically feasible, as it was already shown by others. So why does no one use that potential?",dibade89,1hbntng,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,2024-12-11 06:57:57,0,0.1,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbntng

Unfortunately, Pathfinder was also a tactical RPG D&amp;D style with all the elements i can't suffer in games.

Coming back to it now there’s just no player base numbers to fill up the lobby so you have to resort to smaller games in different modes like “frontlines”.

gaming,My thoughts on TGA Nominees having now played them,"I finally played all of the TGA GOTY nominees thanks to Black Friday deals and I wanted to share my thoughts as award season approaches 

Balatro (9/10)

This game is a masterclass in deceptively simple design and It’s astonishing how easy to lose hours to its “one more run” hook. 

If you’ve avoided it because you think it’s “just poker” or “just a card game,” you’re seriously missing out and doing yourself a disservice. It’s a deeply engaging experience that I think you should try if you haven’t 

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (9/10)

While there’s some debate about its eligibility, for me personally there’s no denying that SOTE delivered one of the absolute best gaming experiences of the year. 

This expansion earns a spot on my Mount Rushmore of DLCs, right alongside Blood and Wine, Shivering Isles, and Phantom Liberty.

Astro Bot (9.5/10)

This. Game. Fucks.

As a fan of classic Nintendo 3D platformers, this felt like a love letter to the genre with a modern twist. 

My only complaint with the game is that I just wanted more of it at the end of the short run time to a platinum trophy. 

The final challenge run and the themed X, Square, Circle, and Triangle levels were brilliant and I’d kill for more levels of that difficulty and quality

If this game was just an appetizer, I can’t wait to see what Team Asobi has in store for the main course. If not for my ultimate favorite this year, this would have been my pick for GOTY.

Black Myth: Wukong (7.5-8/10)

While I enjoyed my three playthroughs of BM: W, I don’t think it quite reaches the same level as the other nominees. 

That said, for the developers’ first big swing, this is a fucking crazy impressive showing. I’m excited to see where they go next as this was an incredibly solid starting point and a downright great game in its own right 

Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (8.5/10)

As a huge fan of the original FF VII, the remake series has been a delight for me. 

The visuals are stunning, and it’s fucking sweet seeing the locations I remember in full 3D recreations. 

However for me it ultimately suffers from some modern open-world fatigue (developers seriously need to retire map towers and their equivalents lmao) 

Despite that, it’s a standout gaming experience, and I can’t wait for Part 3.

Metaphor: ReFantazio (9.5/10)

Jesus Christ, this game.

The characters, world-building, and narrative are utterly fantastic. 

At 40 hours in, it’s easily my GOTY—though, of course, a poorly executed ending could change that. 

My only (minor) gripe is that the soundtrack, while great, doesn’t quite hit Persona levels of perfection.

Final Rankings:
1.	Metaphor: ReFantazio
2.	Astro Bot
3.	Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
4.	Balatro
5.	Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
6.	Black Myth: Wukong

gaming,I’ve Had Enough of The Diablo 4 and PoE 1 &amp; 2 Discourse,"About a month ago I got back into Diablo 4 and while it’s not perfect by any means it’s a fun, turn your brain off, action RPG. While playing for a month I remembered I pre-order POE2 early access a while back and also was incredibly excited to try it out.

Since then I’ve been switching back and forth between them and have been having a blast because ultimately I understand, that while they occupy the same genre, they are two completely different types of ARPG.

Diablo 4 is a fast paced power fantasy with a lot of high quality polish. POE2 is the spiritual successor of the Diablo 2 formula. It’s a slower more methodical ARPG that requires more thought, with a lot of customization for how you want your builds.

Both are serviceable to their audiences, and both have incredibly loyal fanbases. An while comparisons are inevitable and fair in some cases. Certain sects of each fanbase, like children, look for constant opportunities to shit on the other acting as if there is this “one true” ARPG.

The ARPG community is similar to the JRPG community in that, you have these incredibly vocal voices, who do not make up the majority of players, set these arbitrary “rules” on what constitutes a true game of the genre. So anything that goes against these “rules” is deemed as not a “true” this or that. 

Which then creates this very negative, and unhealthy mindset, that limits your ability to accept anything new or genre pushing. To someone like me, this type of behavior is shallow and embarrassing. Not to mention it’s hypocritical given that most ppl like games within genre for different reasons. 

If it were up to these types we’d still be stuck in the 90’s.

MUST HAVES:

- A talent/skill system that allows for high build variety. Something between Elden Ring and PoE.
- Multiplayer. Not so much in MMO, maybe MMOlite, or something that doesn't rely on multiplayer, but supports it and is an integral part of the game.
- Character Customization. Doesn't have to be super in depth.
- Somewhat active community. I don't want to play a game that's practically dead. 


OPTIONAL FEATURES:

- PvP. I can take it or leave it but it will be cool if it had something like it.

My major complaints with this game are that it feels more like an interactive story where I sometimes get to open doors by pressing X and then moving my thumbstick to the left.  When I finally get to see some actual gameplay, it’s mostly stealth. Indiana Jones should be an adventure game, not a stealth game.   Combat when it happens is okay but there’s way better combat in games out there. 

The one thing I do like about combat is there’s lots of options for weapons just lying around that can be easily picked up.  Another thing that’s really the only thing keeping me playing is that the story feels like a real Indiana Jones story, so I keep playing just to find out what happens next. 

Anyway I’m not here to hate on the game, I’m just trying to find out why people love it so much. If I understood that maybe I’d enjoy it more too.  In the meantime I feel like this is a game I’ll play once and never pick up again.

gaming,Should I get a gaming PC?,"Hi! Just like the title says, Should i buy a gaming PC? I currently own a digital PS5, Xbox Series X, and Steam Deck. Along with a PS3 hooked up to play some older exclusives. I've never owned a gaming PC but have played PC games back in the early to mid 2000's. I wasn't really concerned with PC gaming up until I got the Steam Deck and was floored with the how cool and versatile it is. I also have a Steam Deck Dock so I can hook it up to my TV. It does well for what I use it for. But I think I would like to get a gaming PC to play some older games but with much higher resolution and frames. I also was super impressed by Steam sales, people are not lying when they say you can rack up a library for the price of one game on PlayStation or Xbox. I also have both ps plus premium, and xbox game pass ultimate. So I'm not missing any online action when it comes to those systems. But if I could play online for free on PC for most games, that would save me money in the long run. Plus I think I would like to have options ultimately. So for the people in this subreddit who own a lot of consoles and a gaming PC, is it worth it for you?

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: my thoughts,"Funny no one is talking about it yet. I play on GFN turning everything up to ""supreme"" (I guess ultra is not good enough anymore). It is a very nice looking game. No expense spared (quoting from another Spielberg movie).

Using the opening scene of the first movie as a tutorial is ingenious. Puzzles and actions are good, but I do not think that is what is going to make or break the game. I am hoping for great set pieces and a good story (which is what the reviews said it has).

I have xbox game pass ultimate, so this is already include in the sub but so far (which admittedly I am not that deep into the game yet) I like it.

I think we need more single player, well written narrative based, AAA adventure games. A very much fresh take from the online service games that become more like a job, or the souls like ""can't-beat-without-practice-for-weeks"" beat-them-ups.

gaming,Why people act like every Xbox game is on PlayStation right now?,"Dont get me wrong guys, i get all the talk and i especially get the doubt (now everything is an ""what if this goes to PS at some point, and i get it)

And i also dont really care about esclusivity at all, im a all platform owner and i would like to own just one lol.

But recently, especially when people ask what console to buy, i've noticed that people tend to say like ""PlayStation since it has Xbox games anyway""

Now, it is true that they've ported some games here and there, and we have some future games confirmed, but as it is now is **far** from having any decente number to say ""all"". 

Just looking at this year, Xbox released 5 fp games (not counting Ara on PC). Of these, only 1 is multiplatform. And is Cod, a game that was always multiplatform. Indiana Jones will be multiplatform but is a 4-6 months exclusive, still i can see the point.

But also looking at next year, out of 6 announced fp games, only 2 are confirmed for PlayStation and yet again they where always multiplatform. Cod and Doom.

I think is kind of dishonest to push people to a console with the promise of playng everything when is clearly not true. You cant play Starfield on PlayStation, you cant play Halo, you cant play Gears, Flight Sim, Age of Mythology, Hellblade 2, Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, Towerborne ecc.

I get that they might get ported in the future, but that's a theory and not a fact.

Anyway, enjoy gaming on all platform!

GoldenEye is obviously considered a high mark of the series and the N64 era, but I, as a fan of the series, even enjoyed the Nightfire, Agent Under Fire and even the terrible multiplayer of Quantum of Solace on the 360. Bond, like Indiana Jones, is a great protagonist/seires that when written well, could have an amazing return to console.

gaming,Easy open world games like Mario Odyssey?,"My five year old son loves video games and while I’ve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I’ve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There’s basically no way to play that game wrong. It’s a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There’s a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.

We’ve tried some other games to varying success, but I’m looking for more options. We are also somewhat system agnostic as I have the means to provide him with different systems.

1. Kirby and the forgotten lands: probably his second favorite. Very youngster friendly. However, it’s not a sandbox and the linear nature frustrated him sometimes (no going backwards, game forces you in a certain direction).

2. Super Mario world 3d and bowser’s fury: the difficulty was a bit too high for 3d world after the first world and suffers the same linear design issue. Bowsers fury was great but ultimately short for him.

3. Animal crossing new horizons: youngster friendly art and design but honestly not in game play. It seems simple, but is heavy on reading and understanding the motivations of progression (paying off your house, earning money, etc.) it also has the issue of not being able to start from scratch and my island is already pretty decked out. He can start his own tent but the island is still the same as my decked out one.

4. Yoshi’s crafted world: great difficulty for kids but again… not open world

5. Captain Toad Tracker: fun bit too difficult as the puzzles get harder

6. Sonic frontiers: way to clunky. He lost interest pretty much right away because of terrible controls.

7. Zelda: breath of the wild: too difficult for him for progression

8. Pokémon: his reading needs to be polished a bit more for him to really get it.

9. Spider-Man: Miles Morales: hilariously is super fun for him to just swing around the city. He even started getting good at fighting, but the puzzles grind him to a halt and then I have to play all those parts.

Anybody have any suggestions that I’ve missed?

gaming,Multiplayer Teamwork/Minigame Game Recommendations?,"I have grown exhausted of all the ""kill the other people!"" Games. A lot of them are great, well made games. Don't get me wrong. But, I am sick of the sweat. The skill ceilings and the absurd amount of stress they can sometimes bring about instead of joy. I work a full-time job and have fully accepted I will never be on the same level as someone who's either naturally gifted (which I am not), or has the majority of their day to practice (which I do not). So, I ask in hopes that some of you might have some amazing recs!

When I say MP Teamwork, I mean things like Vermintide 2. Deep Rock. Ready or Not. Phasmophobia. The list goes on forever, but I hope you get what I mean. The mission of the game is not ""Kill the other people!"" It is ""All of you are on the same team, working towards the same goal."" Or hell, the examples I listed were just violent (for a lack of a better word) games. Chill games like Party Animals, or other ""minigame"" style experiences are also welcome!

Multiplayer is my favorite type of game to play. I am incredibly anti-social in real life despite wanting social interaction, so it's nice to sit back and play games with other people. It creates this sphere where I am interacting and hanging out with others, but there's really no pressure, and it's a bubble I like to exist in. Thus my preference for it over singleplayer games. But, trying to find games like the ones I'm searching for-outside of the ones I already listed-feels like pulling teeth.

This game is one of the most brilliant games I ever played. And a short one, which I appreciate having now a toddler.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

For me this game was as marking as Outer Wilds, or Subnautica. Two games with surprising aspects you shouldn't know about prior to playing them.

Yes they have screwed up a couple of times over the last year chasing trends in the free to play marked, trying to be both the new trendsetters with Roller Champions and BattleCore Arena while still trying to take players from Fortnite and Warzone with Xdefiant.   
  
But besides that, they have also released a bunch of good and great games in form of Assassins Creed: Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla and Mirage, Far Cry 5 and 6, Rainbow Six Siege, The Crew 2 and Motorfest, Riders Republic, Anno 1800, Prince of Persia, TrackMania, Settlers, Star Wars Outlaws and more. Yes, not all aspects with Outlaws was great, but in the end it was a good game, that has gotten better with the latest patches. 

And there lies the flaws with UbiSoft today, their shareholders demanding a quick return on their investment, not allowing the devs to actually do their job and create something and finish it, but half ass it out the pipeline, just as the majority of AAA have been doing the last couple of years. Because when we all got house arrest during the pandemic, and start buying games along with new generation of consoles, wall street suddenly understood that it might be some money to earn on us geeks out here. 

But what they failed to understand is that quality and art takes time, unlike Ford and Apple who can crounch out x amount of cars and phones each hour. So when they investment didnt return a profit the next morning, they started to push on the companies, that again started to push their devs, who in return needed to push unfinished builds to marked. So when we yell at AAA devs creating bad products, we should instead yell at the finance in the background for not having the patient too wait for a complete product.

TAA in my opinion is the worst looking one and always made my PC lose a ton of frames instead of using fxaa or something but the visual quality and detail games have done according to this video is that extreme TAA is almost necessary due to it being relied on entirely to mask how badly rendered things are. Other than that, the optimization standard is for 30 fps so that is mainly what games apparently are optimization for as a standard in the industry buy mainly if those games are on console.

I was starting my playthrough of SMTV and going around and eventually get to this one red enemy that they warned me were strong.

Engage this second one and in it's opening move it hits my whole team with an Almighty attack and wipes me out in one go.

I lost 2 1/2 hours of gameplay lol. First time in a long time I've lost that much gameplay it nearly brought tears to my eyes lol. I had gathered so many demons and leveled them. *sigh*

I know SMTV Vengeance adds some new stuff so I don't know if these red enemies are new or not, it's been so long I forgot most of the original game.

Anyway...make sure to regularly save. What's making me kick myself is I recently had passed a save point and I'm in hindsight mode of WHY DIDNT I SAVE?!

Which one should I get? My wife is worried our oldest would take over the Xbox, but there are tons of Gamepass games on there. All three seemed to work fine when I tested them, one of the Switches had some cosmetic damage(like a bite or indention in the corner??) and the Xbox seemed a bit dusty in the vents, but I'm sure I can clean that and put a case on the Switch.

I feel odd buying used stuff for Christmas presents, but these seem like really good deals.

Should I even get either option? I'm a bit worried something could be wrong with either system.  
There was something sticky on one of the switches, but I was going to clean it up real good if I got it.

The Xbox I also don't know how to check if it's banned already and I would have to get controllers.  
The Switches I would need protective cases, screen protectors and games are more expensive outside of gamepass.

EDIT- How would I go about thoroughly testing these systems?",RageInducedGamer,1h9bewy,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9bewy/nintendo_switch_lite_or_xbox_series_s_for_my_kids/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9bewy/nintendo_switch_lite_or_xbox_series_s_for_my_kids/,2024-12-08 05:02:25,0,0.4,0,0,52,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9bewy

But it looked similar maybe, but I played it in like 2010, and I assume cause of the way he installed it then that it was already a ""dead"" game, tho lots of people seemed to play it at the time.

gaming,Game console just for LAN?,"EDIT: Some people keep saying other companies CAN do this already. Yes they CAN but they aren't. There are many reasons why they don't but that is a different discussion. 

Also, to reiterate, I'm talking about a game console, not a PC. This means a curated OS specifically engineering for local play, controller driven, self contained system. 

The difference here isn't just the console but the licensing relationships and inhouse development studios that enable this console to function as intended. 

=================

Would you be interested in a game console that was specifically marketed for local multiplayer?

priced similar to a switch, and whose games are specifically made with couch co-op, local system link multiplayer, and LAN parties in mind. 

This specific market segment has been long abandoned and I believe there is a desire, especially among older and much younger gamers, to play games together. 

The system would leverage existing local multiplayer title licenses along with building a strong portfolio of purpose developed games. The idea would be to leverage inhouse studio licensing at higher rate fees for 2nd party systems to help cover the cost of the console. The inhouse studios would also help ensure continuity of local multiplayer cross-console play.
