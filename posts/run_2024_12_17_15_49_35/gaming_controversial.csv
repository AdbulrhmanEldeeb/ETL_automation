gaming,Impressions of CoD: Black Ops 6 multiplayer from a person who hasn't played CoD since 2009,"To be completely precise, I have never played CoD multiplayer and have always stuck to the single-player campaigns. The last game in the series I played was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which was 15 years ago. Since then, I have been indifferent to the series, but I have heard that the new CoD games are popular precisely because of the multiplayer

When I saw that a temporary trial of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer was available on PSN, I decided to give it a try and... was extremely disappointed. At first, I was unpleasantly surprised by the overloaded interface and background videos while waiting for the game, where they show close-ups of the operators. The wait seemed quite long for such a popular game. The cosmetic sets seemed completely garish, awkward and tasteless. The graphics and gameplay also didn't make any impression, especially compared to really cool multiplayer games like The Finals.

Maybe it's just not my thing or I'm missing something, but I really don't understand how someone can continue playing this game when there are way better titles",VOIDYOUTH,1hfqy2z,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hfqy2z/impressions_of_cod_black_ops_6_multiplayer_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hfqy2z/impressions_of_cod_black_ops_6_multiplayer_from_a/,2024-12-16 19:15:44,0,0.41,0,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfqy2z

Venom himself is exceptional in the game, WAY better than Hardy's version and he's actually sinister and intimidating and Tony Todd (rest in peace) did an exceptional job with the voice.

My only real complaint is that it seems like we will not get any more with this Venom in this franchise and.......the fact that we only got a little bit to play as Venom to escape and kill Kraven......I wish there was a lot more time in the game to play as Venom.

- controller prompts were incorrect

But a change beween 40 and 120 should have been easily noticeable.

I've said in the past to friends that I can play games as low as 30fps depending on the type (sprite-based, puzzle, etc), after that it gets too noticeable for me.

It's really neat being able to get near real-time feedback on what's going on in your game while playing. Though it's not always accurate.

  
Forza Motorsport: 

\+ It gave me information about the telemetry on screen and explained them in detail if I asked. 

\+ Explained what's happening during race when asked. It explained what penalty I got and why (specifically telling me which car I collided with)

\+ Suggested the next race to pick

\- Inaccurate fairly often. Got what place I was in wrong a couple of times and a couple of other information was wrong

  
Madden 25:

\+ Can provide a logical play call for specific scenarios. Suggested I call a run play at the end of the game while I was winning.

\+ Can read the defense (zone or man)

\+ Can tell you what route is likely to be open

\+ I got it to do some play-by-play commentary for a little bit. But it was too slow and sometimes inaccurate on what actually happened at times.

\- Often inaccurate with information.

Rocket League:

I was getting destroyed so I didn't ask it much. The only thing I asked was what just happened and it said the orange team scored when I was the one that scored on the blue team.
