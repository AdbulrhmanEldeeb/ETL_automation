webdev,Can I do web development on a low-spec work PC using a USB setup?,"
So, I have a lot of free time at my current job (receptionist). Honestly, the pay is great, and since I‚Äôm still in college, I feel really lucky to have a job that‚Äôs both chill and well-paid. This is pretty rare in my country (Argentina).

I do web development, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything in the field yet. I was thinking of using my free time at work to code, but the work PC has really low specs, and it‚Äôs even worse with the job‚Äôs programs running in the background.

The specs are:
	‚Ä¢	Intel Core i3 7020U (2.3GHz)
	‚Ä¢	4GB RAM (usually at 90% usage due to work programs).

I was wondering if it‚Äôs possible to set up everything on a USB drive using portable versions of the tools I need. Do you think I could work on some MERN stack projects or any kind of web development with this setup?",Lau_Szutner,1hg553u,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hg553u/can_i_do_web_development_on_a_lowspec_work_pc/,https://i.redd.it/pne3wrccyc7e1.jpeg,2024-12-17 07:04:25,0,0.49,0,0,44,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,Question,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cj3OmAnJDAXUKpPHgLDKvZFPUHKovPiCMWu3NwedGgQ.jpg,t3_1hg553u

webdev,"Opportunity to kick off a charity initiative for my company, no resources available, what should I consider?","Hey all,

As a side project I have been asked by the executive team to kick off a charity for the company. **I am not a webdeveloper or have any experience in this, just a guy with hands and half a brain and a task.** Naturally, it will start small and then grow over the years, long term working with celebs and the like, charity auctions and livestreams etcetc. They have tons of money to throw away but want a roadmap to show them next week and a proof of concept doable for Q1. Something like a regular donation system is fine for the start of the year.

I will have to ask for budget as we go but basically will rely on Fiver or freelanced web devs for the project.

Before I kick it off I did want to ask experienced webdevs who may have done this type of work what considerations I may need to bring to them during the roadmap prez to make the rollout easier?

I thought of;

\- Payment system, what will we use?

\- Legality of donation/system worldwide

\- Legal terms to write out with the legal team

\- Will it be a subdomain of our normal site (charity.SITENAME.com), or a whole new website, or a subdirectory of our site (SITENAME.com/charity)? **What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?**

webdev,The recent WP hacks along with Matt's tantrums &amp; antics have made me realize one thing as a WP Designer:,"I am constantly in shit. 

Now I used to be a developer in React (both Web and React Native) but took a huge break from that trying to focus more on my mental health and figuring out what I want to do which turned out to be design and illustration. I used to hate WordPress because I didn't know much about as a developer with his nose in the air. 

As a designer now, of course I use WordPress for myself and found some clients so I can make a living. I am grateful for this ecosystem and it's community. 

But I'll be damned if I don't mention how insecure I feel as of late. There have been so many hacks in the system and I don't see much people really reacting as hard I would expect them to so it either tells me that these hacks are a norm in the system or that we are better off acting ignorant of it all. 

To top off the fact that Matt's antics show how much of a joke he takes this project and it's community for, it makes me really wonder if I should invest more in WordPress by learning PHP and getting deeper into the development aspect of it since lacking in that aspect might put so many clients at risk under my name and brand, or if I should just translate my design skills into going back to the JavaScript environments. 

Either way, however, I know I will have to learn cybersecurity because it's not like WordPress is the factor of being hacked, a lot of systems get hacked. It's just that Matt being the cherry on top of this whole episode I'm witnessing just destroys so much confidence I had for WordPress. 

Anyway, I guess this post might be useless and I'm just hoping to relate to someone who is more of a web professional than I am.

webdev,How can I have two totally different themes in the same project with MUI and Tailwind?,"I have two different products in the same repo, but their designs are different. Most of the componentes are shared but some features are different.

The problem I‚Äôm facing is dealing with the UI, specifically theming conflicts. I have setup two MaterialUI themes, and also two Tailwind presets, each with their own color variables. And depending on which project I want to run, it selects the right theme.

But it‚Äôs not as reliable, because often when I change something in product A, it breaks product B, with the MUI themes it‚Äôs better but with Tailwind it happens often. For example, a component is styled with tailwind classes and used in both products, one needs a border and the other doesn‚Äôt. Of course one way to solve this would be to check which product uses which classes but the code is unmaintainable and messsy.

Another common issue that I have is: Product A primary color is a dark color and product B is a light color, so they need different text colors.


How would you deal with this?

Ideas I have:

1. A components library, so instead of manually styling them in the project itself, I create a separate repo only for the UI, and in there I can do the variants logic in a more isolated way. This would bring a new repo to maintain tho and a new workflow we may not have the space for.

2. Maybe stop using Tailwind to style the components, and focus more on MUI since I can then have different designs for each. One issue with this, is I can only use MUI components and I already have many custom ones.

Not sure if there is a way to easily create the Product A and B variants of a component and use them based off the environment variable the defines the project.

It can‚Äôt be too troublesome tho, I need a way to easily create and maintain components.",PatchDev_,1hg8i0v,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hg8i0v/how_can_i_have_two_totally_different_themes_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hg8i0v/how_can_i_have_two_totally_different_themes_in/,2024-12-17 11:19:02,2,0.67,2,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hg8i0v

webdev,Trying to figure out the right migration strategy from React/Node to NextJS,"Hi all,

Mostly a backend developer here, but I created a website using a React frontend (hosted in S3/Cloudfront)) and a Node server serving JSON data (on a single EC2 instance) which fetches data from an RDS DB. 

The website has a lot of dynamically created pages (think of a site like goodreads, serving pages about Books) and while I'm okay with most content being fetched async after page load, I want to serve the pages with metatags so search engines and social media can create better previews and index the content better.

I'd like to move over to NextJS for that reason. I'm quite new to the idea of NextJS, however, and I'm having trouble wrapping my head around what it replaces. Every article I find involves replacing React apps with NextJS, but it seems to me that rather than that, it actually replaces the Node app and simply has you moving your React app into the server app.

Is that about right or am I totally wrong here?

From that understanding, it seems like my setup should move from:

    React app:
     - book-page.jsx
     - book-client.jsx (which fetches data from Node App)
    Node app:
     - book-api.js
     - book-db-client.js (which fetches data from SQL)
    SQL DB (RDS)
     - Book tables 

To:

    NextJS app (hosted on EC2 or using AWS Amplify?):
     - pages folder (has the react app):
         - book-page.jsx
         - book-client.jsx (maybe no need for this anymore?)
     - pages/api
         - book-api.js
         - book-db-client.js (which fetches data from RDS)
    SQL DB (RDS)
     - Book tables

webdev,Shopify App- how to track user among several stores who have my app?,"Am I trying to achieve the impossible? Please read whole thing.  
  
I have a mobile app where user can store their receipt data. And a Shopify app, which basically shows a button which when clicked, shows a QR code for first time Auth. So, I am using device fingerprinting to track the user, update the database, etc. 

Problem:  
1. Is fingerprinting the only way to Auth for cross-domain verification? I don't want my users to scan QR again and again for verification. I was looking into cookies, but they are useless for cross domains.   
What else is possible? Chatgpt says iframe cookies are also mostly blocked by default in most browsers.  
  
2. This device fingerprinting is valid only until the cart page, so there is no way for Shopify to know which order belongs to which user. So I tried to connect the cart token with the device fingerprint -&gt; then Shopify looked up for that token. However, the token changed from cart to checkout, and now I don't know what else I can do to make sure the order checkout sends the data to the right user in my database.   
What other attributes I can use which remain constant and are solid identifiers?

webdev,Always check the  node engine in your local vs pipeline when building you app - rant,"Hey, devs

I‚Äôm in the middle of migrating my corporate app to MFE. 

For the past 2 days I couldn‚Äôt figure out why my local build shows different files vs pipeline. 
I checked everything:


- env variables
- different file naming 
- played with optimization
- played with how webpack use build commands
- checked the deployment settings

Build after build, whatever I did it showed same result - files are different. The file names and structure come from content hash and I was 100% not matter where you run it - it should be same.

Besides the fact that files are different - the MFE modules that I needed were not in the pipeline build.

At this point I was 99% sure the Skynet took over and it‚Äôs trying to drive me crazy. 

And then I took a glance at our node image - it was called node14 so I naturally assumed it had node 14 under the hood.

Can you imagine my face when I console logged the node engine and saw the magic number - it was running under node 10. I quickly changed node on my local to 10, did the build and finally saw same file structure.

At that moment I started jumping like a little girl. It was really driving me nuts for the last coupe of days

Moral of the story - always consider engine check when doing builds.

webdev,best way to save worker results in microservice architecture,"I'm currently developing a graphql api in nodejs with graphql-yoga that needs to query and process large amounts of data from an external service. 

To ease the load on my api service I thought of using bullmq to create a multi purpose worker microservice to which I can offload expensive tasks from my main api server. 

Now I'm wondering what is the best way to get the worker result data back to my main application. The data the worker produces should end up in the postgres database that the api service uses and it also downloads some files that I want to save in a bucket.

there are a few approaches that I thought of:

1. Give the worker access to the db and a bucket to save the data directly.
This approach goes against my understanding of an encapsulated microservice architecture.

2. Put the result data back into another bullmq queue and let the api server write the data to the database. But how would I handle the files I want to save in a bucket?

3. create endpoints on the apiserver for the worker to return its data. I do not want to have internal graphql endpoints to pollute my schema. I discovered that maybe grpc could be a good fit for this but never used it.

Is any of the approaches even viable? Maybe there are other ways to achieve this that I don't know about, I would really appreciate some input on this :)

It's a cool idea but and I know I could just try it by myself and have fun with it - been thinking if anyone battle-tested it already and could share some opinions :)",Sziszhaq,1hg5bgr,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hg5bgr/anybody_with_any_experience_with_wasp/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hg5bgr/anybody_with_any_experience_with_wasp/,2024-12-17 07:17:12,2,1.0,2,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hg5bgr

webdev,Devs who freelance - need input on client management tooling,"Hey fellow dev freelancers!

I'm looking for a client management solution that would actually work for developers. Current situation: managing multiple clients, each with their own requirements gathering, tech stack discussions, GitHub access setup, deployment processes, etc.

Current pain points:

* No standardized way to collect technical requirements
* Project setup varies per client (some need AWS access, others use their own infrastructure)
* Managing access to different tools/platforms for each client
* Tracking where each project is in the setup phase
* Juggling different communication channels (Slack/Discord/email)

I've looked at general freelance tools (Dubsado, HoneyBook), but they seem more geared towards creative freelancers. What I really want is something where I can:

* Create custom workflow templates (e.g., different flows for web apps vs APIs)
* Automate repetitive tasks (repo setup, project board creation, etc.)
* Track technical requirements and dependencies
* Handle contracts and payments
* Give clients visibility into the technical setup process

Right now I'm cobbling together Notion + Jira + various docs, but it feels inefficient. Wondering if there's a more dev-focused solution out there?

If not, would you use something specifically built for managing development clients? What features would you want to see?

Curious to hear how other dev freelancers are handling this. Are you using any specific tools or just going with the flow?",ifstatementequalsAI,1hfljvp,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hfljvp/devs_who_freelance_need_input_on_client/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hfljvp/devs_who_freelance_need_input_on_client/,2024-12-16 15:26:35,12,0.76,12,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfljvp
