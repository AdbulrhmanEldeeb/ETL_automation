movies,Question about the movie Die Hard (1988),"
In the movie Die Hard John McClane spends 30+ minutes trying to alert the police that there’s a hostage situation at Nakatomi Plaza. When they finally arrive and set up a perimeter, he seems quite relieved but once he observes the police get ready to enter the building he immediately switches to aggravated and criticizes them saying “no, no, you macho assholes.” and radios down something about “I told you what kind of guys you’re dealing with!” He even seems exasperated when they try to breach the building with the armored vehicle. 

I guess I’m having a hard time following the logic. Did I miss something? What kind of response was he expecting? 

The only thing I could come up with was he was expecting some kind of negotiation scenario.

When he sings that creepy-ass song, did people laugh or was it quiet? I thought it was freaking terrifying. I'm not a Nic Cage fanboy. I like him and I know he does some wacky movies and has a certain . . . edge.  But did the people who are really into him see this as different, or just Nic Cage being Nic Cage?

movies,"December 13-15 Box Office Recap: 'Kraven the Hunter' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' massively flop. Meanwhile, 'Moana 2' crosses $700 million worldwide, and 'Interstellar' finally crosses $200 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/xi19z0g5ta7e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f

The man finally came around.

***Moana 2*** was still on top of the box office, although the gap between it and ***Wicked*** is becoming smaller. We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures. ***Kraven the Hunter*** ended the SSU on a new low, while ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** finished outside the Top 5. In limited release, ***Nickel Boys*** had a solid start, while ***September 5*** disappointed.

The Top 10 earned a combined $87.6 million this weekend. That's up 27% from last year, when ***Wonka*** debuted on top.

***Moana 2*** threepeated on the top spot, earning $26.4 million. That's a 48% drop, which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop. After a record-breaking opening weekend, the legs are proving to be quite front-loaded. The film has earned $337.3 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $500 million domestically. And depending on how much it drops against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***, it could miss $450 million domestically.

***Wicked*** was still on second place, but it's getting close to ***Moana 2***. It earned $22.6 million this weekend, which was just 38% down from last weekend. The film has amassed $359.1 million, and it's now poised to earn more domestically than ***Moana 2***. It could start overtaking it next weekend, assuming it doesn't have a bad drop against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***.

Debuting in third place, ***Kraven the Hunter*** flopped with just $11 million in 3,211 theaters. That's the worst debut in the SSU (Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe), and one of the worst for a Marvel property. Hell, it even debuted below ***Kick-Ass*** ($19 million), another R-rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

This is not really a surprise. I mean, where do we start?

The SSU has earned a cumulative $2.1 billion worldwide. But the *Venom* films account for $1.83 billion of that, which is like 86% of its gross. The other two films, ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***, were critical and commercial duds, becoming Internet's laughingstock. Even the ***Venom*** films are already losing good will among the general audience. Basically, it's a universe with absolutely nothing to offer, where the bar keeps going lower and lower. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times...

But how could ***Kraven*** open below ***Madame Web***? On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released, ***Kraven*** barely felt like a comic book movie. The trailers emphasized brutal action, but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks. The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider-Man, yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story. With no signs of Spider-Man.

For some reason, Sony decided that ***Kraven*** warranted a big budget. The film was originally set at $90 million, which rose to $110 million due to the strikes (although some reports say that it actually cost $130 million). That's almost on par with the previous ***Venom*** film, and it's way too high for a C-lister. Especially when they made it R-rated. Sony is aware that this universe isn't working; [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kraven-the-hunter-sony-marvel-universe-spider-man-box-office/) reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe, choosing to focus on ***Spider-Man 4***, ***Beyond the Spider-Verse*** and the ***Spider-Noir*** series. They admitted defeat before the film even came out.

There was some slight hope that J.C. Chandor's presence would also lead to a competent film. But that was not the case; it's currently at an awful 15% on RT. Nothing but a paycheck. 

According to Sony, 71% of the audience was male, which is higher than usual for a comic book title. 40% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a horrible ""C"" on CinemaScore, which is even worse than ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***. If you think these numbers look bad, just wait for the second weekend drop. Even with the holiday season, it's unlikely ***Kraven*** can hit $30 million domestically. A comparison could be ***Star Trek: Nemesis***, which also opened on December 13. After disappointing with $18 million, it closed with just $43 million. If it follows the same trajectory, ***Kraven*** will finish with just $25 million. Yike.

After its rough drop, ***Gladiator II*** slightly recovered. It dropped 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. Looks like ***Kraven*** barely had an impact. The film has earned $145.7 million, and it should finish with close to $170 million.

Barely cracking the Top 5 was ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, which flopped with just $4.5 million this weekend. There's no point in even comparing it to the ***Lord of the Rings*** trilogy, which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend.

While ***The Lord of the Rings*** is a massively popular franchise, there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel. To understand how anime has a ceilling; last year, ***The Boy and the Heron***, with all the buzz it could achieve, made $46 million domestically. That's far less than what other animated films can earn. Warner Bros. knew this couldn't be a big moneymaker, which is why they only spent $30 million on the film, and released it in just 2,602 theaters.

It has been reported that the film's existence was fast-tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien's novels. Although with the recent announcement of a ***Hunt for Gollum*** film coming in 2026, it was clear ***Rohirrim*** wouldn't really be a priority. If people were on the fence over this film, the film's middling reviews (51% on RT) indicated that this wasn't worth it.

According to Warner Bros., 68% of the audience was male and 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a lukewarm ""B"" on CinemaScore, far worse than any Middle-Earth film. This is not gonna last long in theaters; it'd be a surprise if this earned over $15 million lifetime.

Despite being available on Prime Video, ***Red One*** dropped just 39% this weekend, adding $4.2 million. The film has earned $92.4 million, and it's fighting to hit $100 million.

It took 10 years, but Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** has crossed $200 million domestically. The IMAX re-release added $3.6 million, which was just 21% down from last weekend. Fantastic all around.

***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** fell 67% this weekend, adding $1.6 million and taking its domestic total to $13 million.

***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** eased just 14% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $36.6 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer***, which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend. That allowed it to increase again, earning $790,954. The film's domestic total stands at $1.9 million, and it will need some Oscar buzz here.

***Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem*** finished outside the Top 10 with $737K during the weekend ($2.3 million four-day).

A24's ***Y2K*** lost 160 theaters and fell 68%, earning $684,957 this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $3.7 million, and it's gonna miss $5 million.

Paramount released ***September 5***, an awards hopeful, into 7 theaters. But the film earned $80,802, which translates to a very underwhelming $11,543 per-theater average. The film will expand nationwide on January 17, 2025, but this is a very weak start.

Amazon MGM's ***Nickel Boys*** debuted in 2 theaters, and earned $54,794 this weekend. That's a solid $27,397 per-theater average, and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl*** debuted in one single screen, earning $50,300 this weekend. That's a fantastic per-theater average, making it the fifth highest of the year. It will hit nationwide in January.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** was once again topping the overseas box office. It added $57 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $716.8 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), UK ($33.5M), Germany ($24.8M), Mexico ($23.5M) and Brazil ($21.1M). It's gonna the billion milestone, but it's taking some time in getting there.

***Wicked*** added $21.5 million, and its worldwide total is now $525 million. It debuted in Germany with $4 million, which is the best for a Broadway film. The film's best markets are the UK ($55.2M), Australia ($20.1M), Korea ($12M), Mexico ($9M) and Philippines ($5M). It will hit its final market, Japan, on February.

***Kraven the Hunter*** also flopped overseas. It earned just $15 million, taking its worldwide debut to just $26 million. For comparison, ***Madame Web*** earned $49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just $100 million. There's a strong chance ***Kraven*** finishes below $60 million worldwide.

After missing the mark domestically, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** also flopped overseas, earning only $4 million overseas. That's a paltry $9.9 million worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Smile 2* | Oct/18 | Paramount | $23,021,692 | $68,967,012 | $137,991,092 | $28M

- Paramount's ***Smile 2*** has closed with $137 million worldwide. While that's a 37% drop from the original, it's still a box office success. Reception as a whole was much better than the first, with Naomi Scott earning praise for her performance. ***Smile 3: This Time It's Personal*** should be coming anytime now.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

***Moana 2*** will cede the top spot, and it's a battle between a lion and a hedgehog.

Disney is releasing ***Mufasa: The Lion King***, five years after the 2019 remake earned over $1.6 billion worldwide. Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins, and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar. This is a strong IP, but this is uncharted territories, given that this is a completely new story with new songs. It's not gonna come anywhere close to that $1.6 billion gross, but we'll see how much it can make.

The other release is ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3***. The franchise is going strong, and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow, which drew hype among the Internet. The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film, and the pre-sales look very strong so far. With the holiday corridor, another increase is pretty much imminent.

In limited release, A24 is opening Brady Corbet's ***The Brutalist***. It stars Adrien Brody as László Tóth, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States, where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life. The film has received fantastic reviews so far, and it's poised to become a big Oscar player. Look for a healthy run, even if the 215-minute runtime might be too much for many.

movies,Just finished Oblivion. Legitimately really enjoyed it.,"I'm not going to sit here and say it was the best movie ever. Nor do I have any knowledge about the books the movie is based on. But I had a lot of fun with the movie. (This is my first movie review, plus I'm pretty tired, so I apologize in advance for how disjointed it may feel)

I'll start with what I disliked, which honestly wasn't much:
There were issues with the pacing and the dialogue, I found some performances a little stilted, and some twists were more expected than others (the Tet being evil was obvious from the get go).

As for the positives:
Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, and Morgan Freeman delivered great performances I thought. I found myself actually being super absorbed in the plot, and it wasn't too difficult to follow (like a lot of sci-fi can be), which I liked. I think what everyone can agree on when it comes to this movie is that both the score and the visuals were absolutely top notch. The fact that the movie came out in 2013 blows my mind a little. 

Overall, I thought the movie was a solid 8/10. I can't say I'm totally sure why the movie gets as much hate as it does. Who knows? Maybe I just enjoyed it because I'm a huge Tron fan, and this feels similar.

movies,"It’s that time of year again, time to rewatch A Muppet’s Christmas Carol. So in the spirit, what classic film do you wish the Muppets would make a Muppet retelling of?","The only criticism I have of the Muppet films that retell classic stories is that there aren't more of them. A Muppet's Christmas Carol and Muppet's Treasure Island (Bless you Tim Curry) are two of my favourite comfort films of all time. Recently my friends and I have been trying to work out what film would be the best to have a Muppets version of.

It's surprisingly hard to think of the best one, but my pick would be Misery. Ms Piggy is made to play Pyscho Annie and her kidnapping the writer (not sure if Kermit or a human actor would work better) and forcing them to write her a book would be amazing to see!

What do you all think? Any of you reckon you can top Misery?",Born-Captain7056,1hfyx7s,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfyx7s/its_that_time_of_year_again_time_to_rewatch_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfyx7s/its_that_time_of_year_again_time_to_rewatch_a/,2024-12-17 01:07:19,392,0.91,392,0,522,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfyx7s

movies,"Catherine O'Hara is simply spectacular as Kevin's mom in the Home Alone movies. She made the most out of a thin role, giving it more humor and depht than it deserved.","If you go through the Home Alone movies, the bond between Kevin and his mom is the heart of the Film. They have a love-hate relationship in which Kate (O'Hara) always sees the bad in Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), because he's a kid  who allows his emotions to get the best of him when he's bullied by Buzz or cursed at by his no good Uncle, but she also has a lot of love for him. But when Kevin is lost or left by the wayside, it's the mom who bears the guilt and tries to figure out what went wrong as well as acknowledging her mistakes. 

One thing I felt lacked in Lost in New York was the mom's subplot. I loved the Catherine O'Hara and John Candy's scenes in the first movie, great chemistry and O'Hara's character got to do a self-examination. 

The sequel, O'Hara is given less to do but the crux of the film continues to be the bond between Kevin and his mom. It's no accident that she's always the one whom Kevin runs to whenever he misses his family. The father is an after-thought in all of this. 

And Catherine O'Hara is superb as Kate. She gives a true depiction of motherhood, one which isn't perfect and it's often flawed but the love and care is still there. And O'Hara is an incredible comedienne and juices up a part which could have easily been another generic mom role.",Davis_Crawfish,1hfmgpm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,2024-12-16 16:07:01,1294,0.94,1294,0,176,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfmgpm
