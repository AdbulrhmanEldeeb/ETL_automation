pcgaming,1440p vs 4k - My experience,"I just wanted to give you my perspective on the 1440p vs. 4k debate. For reference, my build has a 3080 and a 5800X3D. This is pretty comprehensive of my experience and is long. TLDR at the end.

**Context:**  
So, I have been playing on a 27-inch 1440p 240hz (IPS) for years. I was an early adopter, and that spec cost me 700 bucks 4 years ago (just after I got my 3080), whereas on Black Friday this year, you could find it for 200 bucks. Recently, I decided to purchase one of the new 4k OLED panels - specifically trying both QD-OLED and WOLED tech, both of which are at 32-inch 4k 240hz, and with the WOLED panel having a dual-mode to turn into a 1080p 480hz panel (albeit a bit blurrier than proper 1080p due to a lack of integer scaling). I ended up settling on the WOLED as the QD-OLED panel scratched and smudged too easily, and I am moving in a few months. I do wish the WOLED was more glossy, but that's a topic for another time. I am using the WOLED 4k panel to evaluate the following categories.

**Image Quality:**  
For reference, with my 1440p monitor, if I were to outstretch my arm with a closed fist, it would touch the monitor, and with this 4k panel, I typically sit 1-2"" further. This is roughly 30""

When it comes to use outside of gaming, whether web browsing or general productivity, it is night and day. This is the first resolution I have used where you can't see jaggedness/pixelation to the mouse cursor. Curves in letters/numbers are noticeably clearer, and the image is overall much easier on the eye. Things like the curves in the volume indicator are clear and curved, with no visible pixel steps. 4k is a huge step up for productivity, and funny enough, the whole reason I wanted to upgrade was over the summer at my internship, our client had 4k monitors for their office setup and I immediately noticed the difference and wanted to try it for my at-home setup. If you code or are an Excel monkey, 4k is SO much better.

As for gaming, the image quality bump is substantial, but not quite as game-changing as it is with text and productivity use. My most played games in 2024 were Overwatch and Baldur's Gate 3, so I will be using those as my point of reference. In 1440p, I had to use DLDSR to downscale from 4k to 1440p in BG3 to get what I considered acceptable image quality, and figured that since I was doing that I might as well jump to 4k, so that's exactly what I did. Frankly, once you realize how blurry both native TAA and DLAA are on 1080p/1440p, you will never want to play that again. Of course, older games don't have this blur but in turn, look quite jagged. The pixel density of 4k serves as an AA all on its own. DLDSR is a cool tech but inconsistent in terms of implementation with different games, and you have a \~6% performance loss versus just playing at 4k due to DSR overhead.

I do want to note here that image quality is a lot more than just PPI. While 32"" 4k is only 25%-ish more ppi than 27"" 1440p, the added pixel count brings out a lot of details in games. In particular, foliage and hair rendering get WAY better with the added pixels.

**Performance:**  
It is no secret that 4k is harder to run than 1440p. However, the system requirements are drastically lower than people talk about online here. I see plenty of comments about how you need at least a 4080 to run 4k, and I think that is not the case. I am on a 3080 (10GB) and so far, my experience has been great. Now, I do think 3080/4070 performance on the Nvidia side is what I would consider the recommended minimum, a lot of which is due to VRAM constraints. On the AMD side, VRAM tends to not be an issue but I would go one tier above the 3080/4070 since FSR is significantly worse and needs a higher internal res to look good. Now, I know upscaling is controversial online, but hear me out: 4k@DLSS performance looks better than 1440p native or with DLAA. That runs a bit worse than something like 1440p w/ DLSS quality as it is a 1080p internal res as opposed to 960p, on top of the higher output res (A quick CP2077 benchmark shows 4k w/ DLSS balanced (EDIT:performance) at 77.42 fps whereas 1440p @ DLSSQ gives 89.42). Effectively, a 14% loss in fps for a MUCH clearer image. If you simply refuse to use DLSS, this is a different story. However, given how good DLSS is at 4k nowadays, I view it as a waste.

As far as competitive titles go, it depends on the game. I have played competitive OW for years and picked up CS2 recently. I am ok at OW (dps rank 341 and 334 in season 12/13 end of season, NA), and absolute trash at CS2 (premier peak 11k currently at 9k). I have recently moved to using Gsync with a system-level fps cap in all titles, as opposed to uncapped fps. Don't want to get into the weeds of that here but I do think that is the way to go if you have anything \~180hz or higher, though I admittedly haven't played at a refresh rate that low in years. CS2 can't quite do a consistent 225 fps (the cap reflex chooses when using gsync) at 4k with the graphics settings I have enabled, but it does get me very close, and honestly, if I turned model detail down it would be fine but I gotta have the high res skins. In OW2 with everything but shadows and texture quality/filtering at low, I easily get to the 230fps cap I have set. That being said, in OW I choose to use the 1080p high refresh mode at 450fps, whereas visibility isn't good enough in CS2 to do that. Not sure how some of those pros play on 768p, but I digress. At 1080p my 5800x3d can't put above \~360hz on CS2 anyways, so I play at 4k for the eye candy.

240hz to 480hz is absolutely and immediately noticeable. However, I think past 240hz (OLED, not LCD), you aren't boosting your competitive edge. If I was being completely honest, I would steamroll my way to GM in OW at 60hz after an adjustment period, and I would be stuck at 10k elo in CS2 if I had a 1000hz monitor. But, if you have a high budget and you don't do a lot of work on your PC and put a LOT of time into something like OW or CS, may as well get one of the new 1440p 480hz monitors. However, I would say that if over 25% of your gaming time is casual/single-player stuff, or over half of your time is spent working, go 4k.

**Price/Value**  
Look, this is the main hurdle more than anything. 4k 240hz is better if you can afford it, but if you don't see yourself moving from something like a 3060ti anytime soon for money reasons, don't! 1440p is still LEAGUES ahead of 1080p and can be had very cheaply now. Even after black Friday deals are done, you can find 1440p 240hz for under $250. By contrast, 4k 160hz costs about $320, and the LCD 4k Dual mode from Asus costs 430. My WOLED 4k 240hz was 920 after tax. While I think the GPU requirements are overblown as DLSS is really good, the price of having a ""Do-it-all"" monitor is quite high. I was willing to shell out for it, as this is my primary hobby and I play lots of twitch games and relaxed games alike, but not everyone is in the same financial position nor may not have the same passion for the hobby. Plus, if you have glasses, you could just take them off and bam, 4k and 1440p are identical.

**TLDR:**  
4k is awesome, and a big leap over 1440p. Text, web use, and productivity are way, way, way better on a 4k monitor, whereas for gaming it is just way better. I would say that to make the jump to 4k you would want a card with at least 10GB of VRAM, and with about a \~3080 in terms of performance. DLSS is a game changer, and even DLSS Performance at 4k looks better than 1440p native in modern games. For FSR you would probably want to use Balanced.

If you are still on 1080p, please, please upgrade. If you have 1440p but can't justify the $ to jump to 4k, try DLDSR at 2.25x render for your games. Looks way better, and can serve as an interim resolution for you, assuming your card can handle it. Eyesight does play a role in all this.",SBMS-A-Man108,1hfx8ym,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hfx8ym/1440p_vs_4k_my_experience/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hfx8ym/1440p_vs_4k_my_experience/,2024-12-16 23:48:10,0,0.38,0,0,61,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfx8ym

pcgaming,What do you think the unique value proposition is going to be for the NVIDIA 5000 series?,"So it's pretty clear so far that the 5080 will have 16GB VRAM, with the 5070 going for 12GB VRAM.

I don't think NVIDIA will make any changes to these numbers.

So my question is what's the unique value proposition here? Some kind of DLSS 4 FG 2.0 which will be exclusive to the 5000 series?

I say this because the way communications have been going it seems like the best way to proceed as a consumer is as follows:

* Buy a 4050-up to-4080/4080super if you're buying into new gen GPUs/upgrading
* Buy a 4090 instead of a 5080 because the 5080 will probably not have that big of a difference and you get more VRAM with the 4090. Or wait for the 5080ti since that'll obviously have 24GB VRAM. At least I hope so.
* Buy a 5090 only if you are upgrading from a 4090 and want the best GPUs.

pcgaming,"I just launched the demo for my base-builder, Final Outpost: Definitive Edition - run your town and defend it from hordes of zombies outside...","Hi everyone,

I started working on this hobby project in 2018, which I released as a super bare-bones MVP on the App Store in 2020. It kind of popped off (at least compared to my expectations). Since then while finishing university I have been working on the game during holidays with my brother and a couple of friends. We made a bunch of huge updates to the game and brought it to Android.

I decided to go full-time on the project with my brother last October and we've really increased the quality of the game since then so that it feels like a really polished professional project. That game has now reached 1M downloads on mobile.

But the thing is, it really feels like a game more suited to the PC audience. It never had gatcha mechanics, just a 'support the devs' selection of optional items to buy. The game was always fully playable for free. It's depth and complexity has now also reached the level where we feel like it's a game worthy of Steam.

So since June, we've been working on a new version with a bunch of new content, features and mechanics, including a trading system and a card-based meta progression. This new game is called Final Outpost: Definitive Edition and I just released the free demo on our Steam page.

Demo here! [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066310/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066310/)

I own a Legion Go, which gives me a bit of flexibility instead, and I end up playing longer there on my sofa. I feel stupid for that, as my pc is so much more powerful. 

I guess I'm old now...lol.

pcgaming,Hot take: gpu benchmark should be done using a realistic system according to the price of that gpu,"**EDIT**: i understood why it makes sense to benchmark this way and thanks for explaining it. I wish i could close this discussion now but I'll just keep getting passive aggressive comments subtly saying why I'm a dumbass for having an opinion and a genuine question. But that's reddit for you. Good night I'm going to bed 👋


I'm gonna get a lotta hate but seeing arc b580 benchmarks with 9800x3d pisses me off. *Yes I know* it is done to find the absolute maximum performance of a gpu, so why does everyone do it? We already get solid numbers from TPU,HW,LTT etc but a 250$ gpu should be paired with a system that goes well with it(according to budget)
