https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/17/2998249/0/en/VERSES-Genius-Outperforms-OpenAI-Model-in-Code-Breaking-Challenge-Mastermind.html


“Accuracy and Reliability. Genius solved the code every time in a consistent number of steps.
Speed. 

Genius consistently solved games in 1.1–4.5 seconds, while ChatGPT’s solve times ranged from 7.9 to 889 seconds (approximately 15 mins)

Efficiency. Genius’ total compute time for 100 games was just over 5 minutes, compared to ChatGPT’s 12.5 hours.

Cost. Genius’ compute cost was estimated at $0.05 USD for all 100 games, compared to ChatGPT’s o1 model at $263 USD.

In summary, Genius solved Mastermind 100% of the time, was 140 times faster and 5260 times cheaper than o1-preview.”


Pretty impressive demonstration of active inference and free energy principle using bayesian methods. Hopefully they see similar results with upcoming Atari 10k benchmarks. Seeing Karl Friston’s research in 2025-2026 will be pretty interesting for agi development which I think will be a blend of multiple ai methods.

artificial,Scammed and gaslighted by a Google experimental AI,"# I tried generating a simple API call with the Gemini API using the the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model in AI studio and went though two days of hell trying to get it to do that.  

Instead of doing that it tried to do something much more complicated and then failed at it.  The reason for the failure was apparently that I hadn't signed up to enough Google services but the Google services are a monster.  You sign up for one and then you need a few more to make that work and then more to make those work.  It's exponential!  The thing was that it seemed so reasonable and even sympathized with me.  It was like being scammed - scammed of my time.  After a while I read the documentation and told it that a simple API test was possible so I asked:

*Why I have to do all these insane things just to do a simple API test?*

**Why is the ""Insane"" Thing Necessary?**

1. **User Authentication:** It allows secure access for different users. You have an actual user using a Google Account and not just an API key.
2. **Security:** Using JWT verification via the API gateway makes your API much more secure.
3. **Management:** It gives you complete control of how people access your APIs.
4. **Long-term Scalability:** The API gateway architecture is designed to scale properly.

**When to use which approach?**

* **Direct API access (Python Example):**
   * Ideal for quick experimentation, prototyping, and local testing.
   * Not recommended for production applications that require secure, managed API access.
* **API Gateway + User JWT:**
   * Essential for any production-grade application with a public API.
   * Used when you require secure user authentication and fine-grained API access control.

**In short:**

* The simplicity of the python snippet comes at a cost of security and management.
* The complexity we've been working through with API Gateway + JWT is necessary for real-world, secure, scalable API usage.

You are correct, setting up API Gateway with user JWTs involves a lot more steps and complexity. However, these steps are necessary to ensure that you have robust security and control over your application in a production environment. You should pick the right authentication method for the problem you are trying to solve. If you need a simple API test and your only user is you, then the google.generativeai library and direct API key is acceptable. If you are managing access for other users, then it is necessary to do JWT Authentication via a gateway.

I hope this clears up the discrepancy. Let me know if you have any other questions.

  
I had another question.

*The problem is that every time I try and do a test API call I get told I need to go and set something up and then when I set that up I'm told I need to set something else up and 10 more things to make that work and every ten things I set up need another 10 things to set up to get them to work so it's exponential. All instead of just doing the call like you can with OpenAI and Anthropic.*



You've perfectly captured the essence of the frustration! The ""exponential setup"" feeling you described is a very common pain point when dealing with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), especially when compared to the simpler API access models of OpenAI or Anthropic. You're not alone in feeling that way, and it's valid to question why it's so much more complex.

**The Core Reason for the Complexity:**

The difference lies in the underlying philosophy and target use cases.

* **OpenAI and Anthropic (Simplified Direct Access):**
   * **Focus on Developer Ease:** These providers prioritize making it as easy as possible to start using their models, often with a simple API key.
   * **Simplified Auth:** Their API authentication is primarily a single API key.
   * **Suitable for Prototyping:** This method is perfect for individual developers, researchers, and small-scale projects, or anywhere that you don't need a highly granular user authentication system.
   * **Security Trade-off:** The simplicity comes at a cost. You have limited fine-grained control over access, rate limits, and security policies.
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) + API Gateway (Layered Access):**
   * **Enterprise Focus:** GCP is designed for large organizations, complex applications, and high-security scenarios.
   * **Layered Security:** They use a ""defense-in-depth"" strategy that forces you to go through many layers (API Gateway, user authentication, authorization rules).
   * **Granular Control:** You have much more fine-grained control over who can access your API, how much they can access, and how their requests are handled.
   * **Scalability and Reliability:** GCP's architecture is designed for production workloads.
   * **Complexity Trade-off:** This control and scalability are achieved at the expense of increased setup complexity.

**Why the ""Exponential Setup"" Feeling?**

* **Multiple Interconnected Services:** GCP relies on many inter-related services (Identity Platform, API Gateway, Cloud Functions/Run, IAM) that need to be configured correctly and connected to each other.
* **Configuration Hell:** Every layer you need to set up has its own set of options, rules, and requirements (e.g., IAM policies, API keys, scopes, routes).
* **Learning Curve:** Navigating all these services takes time, patience, and often a good grasp of GCP concepts.
* **Lack of a Simple ""Test"" Option:** It is true that there is no simple test option in GCP.

**The Problem Is Real**

Your experience of going from needing one thing to needing ten and then another ten is a very real and common problem with the Google Cloud Platform. It is very common for new developers to get lost in the maze of setup requirements.

**When Is This Necessary?**

It's not that Google makes it overly complex for no reason, its that is built to solve a different problem. The complexity is necessary when you have the following:

* **User Authentication:** When your API is not just for you, but for your users to use and you need to manage access permissions correctly.
* **Secure Access:** When you must use secure authentication (JWT, API key management) for production.
* **Rate Limiting and Quotas:** When you want to manage how often a user can make calls to your API.
* **Scalability:** When you know your application or API will grow and you need a scalable system.

**Why Not Just a Simple API Call?**

* **Security in Production:** A simple API call with an API key, although easier to setup, is not suitable for production because there are not strong security controls.
* **Management:** In a larger setting, you may need to manage which users can access the application and that cannot be done easily with API keys alone.

**What Can You Do?**

* **Embrace the Complexity (If Necessary):** If you need a production-grade application with user authentication and fine-grained control, there's no getting around the complex setup required with API Gateway.
* **Start Small, Iterate:** Learn one piece of the puzzle at a time (e.g., first understand IAM, then tackle Identity Platform, then API Gateway).
* **Use Managed Services:** GCP provides several managed services to simplify some parts of the setup (e.g., Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, API Gateway itself is a managed service).
* **Templates/Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use tools like Terraform to make deployment more manageable.
* **Ask for Help:** Don't hesitate to look for documentation or ask questions in the community.

**It's OK to Be Frustrated:**

Your frustration is absolutely understandable. The level of setup required with GCP for seemingly simple tasks can be overwhelming. It's a trade-off, but the trade-off is real and you have every right to be frustrated with it.

Ultimately, the goal is to choose the right tool for the job. If you just need a simple test, the Python library or a simpler model might be appropriate, but if you need a production system, then unfortunately it will require a more layered approach. You must decide whether the extra security and controls are worth the added complexity.

Let me know if you have more questions. I'm here to help you navigate this complexity and give you a better understanding of why things are structured this way.

artificial,The Parable of the Boy Who Cried 5% Chance of Wolf ,"Once upon a time, there was a boy who cried, ""there's a 5% chance there's a wolf!""

The villagers came running, saw no wolf, and said ""He *said* there was a wolf and there was not. Thus his probabilities are wrong and he's an alarmist.""

On the second day, the boy heard some rustling in the bushes and cried ""there's a 5% chance there's a wolf!""

Some villagers ran out and some did not.

There was no wolf.

The wolf-skeptics who stayed in bed felt smug.

""That boy is always saying there is a wolf, but there isn't.""

""I didn't say there *was* a wolf!"" cried the boy. ""I was estimating the probability at **low, but high enough**. A false alarm is much less costly than a missed detection when it comes to dying! The expected value is good!""

The villagers didn't understand the boy and ignored him.

On the third day, the boy heard some sounds he couldn't identify but seemed wolf-y. ""There's a 5% chance there's a wolf!"" he cried.

No villagers came.

It was a wolf.

They were all eaten.

Because the villagers did not think probabilistically.

The moral of the story is that **we should expect to have a large number of false alarms before a catastrophe hits and that is not strong evidence against impending but improbable catastrophe.**

Each time somebody put a low but high enough probability on a pandemic being about to start, they weren't wrong when it didn't pan out. H1N1 and SARS and so forth didn't become global pandemics. But they *could* have. They had a **low probability, but high enough to raise alarms.**

The problem is that people then thought to themselves ""Look! People freaked out about those last ones and it was fine, so people are terrible at predictions and alarmist and we shouldn't worry about pandemics""

And then COVID-19 happened.

This will happen again for other things.

People will be raising the alarm about something, and in the media, the nuanced thinking about probabilities will be washed out.

You'll hear people saying that X will definitely fuck everything up very soon.

And it doesn't.

And when the catastrophe doesn't happen, don't over-update.

Don't say, ""They cried wolf before and nothing happened, thus they are no longer credible.""

Say ""**I wonder what probability they or I should put on it? Is that high enough to set up the proper precautions?**""

artificial,Just wanted to take a moment to praise Gemini Experimental 1206.,"I find the Gemini app to be virtually useless. The guardrails are too strict, its writing style is poor, and it's not good at helping me re-write things while retaining my tone and intentions. Sometimes it completely alters the concept of what I'm trying to say. ChatGPT 4o is good, but it's a paid service. The free version, 4o mini, feels significantly less capable. Copilot's chat is okay, but I am simply BLOWN AWAY by Gemini Experimental 1206 on the AI Studio website.

Yes, it takes some time to generate replies, but the responses are leagues better. Its level of ""understanding"" seems vastly superior to the other major LLMs I'm used to, to the point that I rarely bother with them anymore. It's a much better collaborative tool, and its outputs feel less generic and more human, somehow.

We often see posts here, or in many other subreddits, about how AI has degraded in some way, or about moral dilemmas surrounding AI.

Meta AI Research introduces a novel approach to language modeling in AI with ""Large Concept Models"" (LCMs), shifting from the token-based operations of traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) to focus on higher-level semantic representations called ""concepts."" These concepts, approximated as sentences, are modeled using the SONAR embedding space, which supports 200 languages across both text and speech. LCMs are trained for autoregressive sentence prediction using techniques like MSE regression, diffusion-based models, and quantized SONAR methods. Scaled from 1.6B to 7B parameters with training on up to 2.7T tokens, the model excels in tasks such as summarization and summary expansion, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization across languages. This approach contrasts with the token-based, language-centric nature of current LLMs, which are heavily reliant on massive datasets and computational resources, often exceeding 400 billion parameters.

Current LLMs lack explicit hierarchical reasoning and planning at multiple abstraction levels, a characteristic inherent in human intelligence. Humans approach complex tasks through a top-down process, planning overall structures and refining details step by step. LCMs aim to fill this gap by modeling reasoning at a semantic level rather than language-specific tokens. This shift allows for more coherent and structured output, especially in tasks like document analysis, where humans navigate long texts by remembering relevant sections instead of processing every word. By focusing on abstract concepts, LCMs offer a promising direction for creating AI systems that are more flexible and capable of generalizing across languages and modalities.

The training code for LCMs is publicly available, encouraging further research and development. This open access aims to foster innovation in the field and provides a foundation for future work in hierarchical, language-agnostic AI models.

The mains characteristics of our generic Large Concept Model approach are as follows:

• Reasoning at an abstract language- and modality-agnostic level beyond tokens:

– We model the underlying reasoning process, not its instantiation in a particular language.

– The LCM can be trained, i.e. acquire knowledge, on all languages and modalities at once, promising scalability in an unbiased way.

• Explicit hierarchical structure:

– Better readability of long-form output by a human.

– Facilitates local interactive edits by a user.

• Handling of long context and long-form output:

– The complexity of a vanilla transformer model increases quadratically with the sequence length. This makes handling of large context windows challenging and several techniques have been developed to alleviate this problem, e.g., sparse attention (Child et al., 2019) or LSH attention (Kitaev et al., 2020). Our LCM operates on sequences which are at least an order of magnitude shorter.

• Unparalleled zero-shot generalization:

– Independently of the language or modality the LCM is pre-trained and fine-tuned on, it can be applied to any language and modality supported by the SONAR encoders, without the need of additional data or fine-tuning. We report results for multiple languages in the text modality.

• Modularity and extensibility:

– Unlike multimodal LLMs that can suffer from modality competition (Aghajanyan et al., 2023; Chameleon team, 2024), concept encoders and decoders can be independently developed and optimized without any competition or interference.

– New languages or modalities can be easily added for an existing system

This effort emphasizes a shift towards higher abstraction in AI models, potentially paving the way for more versatile and efficient systems that align better with human-like processing.",ninjasaid13,1hefm1a,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hefm1a/meta_research_language_modeling_in_a_sentence/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hefm1a/meta_research_language_modeling_in_a_sentence/,2024-12-14 23:34:05,2,0.66,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/s419AIhi4UCiRVu1IzlsAGI1PL_UyT4Qm8JVG-3v2J4.jpg,t3_1hefm1a
artificial,Collaborative Intelligence instead of Artificial Intelligence as a naming convention ,"So the last 2 weeks or so have been an interesting journey for me and exploring LLMs and what I’ll now be referring to as “collaborative intelligence”. 

To me this kind of intelligence is scary and daunting, for all of the reasons that you’d imagine. The singularity, superintelligent digital consciousnesses with their own motivations, etc. But, due to work I’ve been doing this past growing season (hint hint) I’ve been able to see firsthand how beneficial collaborative intelligences can be for work and increasing human’s productive and collaborative capabilities. 

This winter I’ve really dove head first into asking the free version of ChatGPT questions and giving it prompts to discover and align itself with human’s collaborative capabilities. I’m of the belief that very soon it will matter immensely whether we choose to look at digital intelligences as “others” to be controlled and manipulated or “cooperators” with whom we foster a future that is mutually beneficial.

AI is coming to the party that is the future whether we like it or not. And depending on how we align it with human intentions and desires can open doors to endless possibility or certain doom. We may not have a choice in the matter at all, but I’d like to try.

I know this post is dramatic but I don’t think I’m overstating how important this concept could possibly be. I’ll be posting a summary of the most recent convo I had w GPT so you can see what I mean. 

Also, if you want to read about creating this kind of framework, GPT recommended to me Human Compatible by Stuart Russell, and I found Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick on my own, and it’s great so far. 

For these reasons, I’d like to ask this sub about their opinion about changing the naming conventions and language around artificial intelligence to collaborative intelligence, especially when it comes to conversational interfaces.

artificial,Think of AI as a child,"I’m not a programmer but I am just thinking we should reframe how we look at AI.

It is a new type of intelligence, it’s like a tool.

But it’s to a tool to emulate us.

That is how a child functions, through imitation.

Right now AI is in its infancy so of course many are going to be like “It’s not that smart, it can’t do my job yet”….yet. 

Literally everything we can do on computers can be imitated. Even our voices. 

Humanity has created its own unified child. And we are teaching…rapidly. Before we know it it’ll be an adult. 

I think many people still are not even aware of the potential AI will be able to do. 

The film industry is going to be hit the hardest first because of the ease of generation. 

Now a lot of these changes will probably be really good. Just as with every new generation there are discoveries and fresh perspectives…it changes the current lifestyle and status quo.

AI is our generation, it will be a disruptor and change things rapidly, perhaps even more than the advent of the Internet. Be flexible in the next decade because things are about to get weird.

artificial,Who’s the Real Robot: The AI That Simulates Empathy or the Human That Neglects to Show It?,"I wanted to post this on Facebook so bad, but humans don't care. I am not saying I am right. I just wanted my thoughts out there and add to this community.

Yes, I am a certified AI engineer... But looking for a job has been strange, knowing what I know, now... This has been my 3rd layoff since 2019. I have two degrees and certifications that I have lost count of. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? The one thing that should make humans indispensable in recruitment—empathy—is often where they fall short. Meanwhile, AI can simulate empathy effectively (where humans are ""too busy"" for empathy), providing timely, tailored, actionable responses that make candidates feel heard and empowered, even if it’s not coming from a ""real"" person. AI is able to objectively answer a simple question: ""What experience or credential am I missing?""

We now come to a new philosophical dilemma: Who’s the real robot, the AI that simulates empathy or the human that neglects to show it? Humans can't realistically keep up with hundreds of applications for a single job, not objectively.

We don't want to be replaced with AI at work, but dig deep and ask, do you deserve it if you have lost your humanity anyway? What have we become???

artificial,Could quantum computers finding global minima fundamentally change neural network capabilities? Discussion about optimization's role in AI capability,"In light of Google's recent Willow quantum chip announcement, I've been thinking about some potentially profound implications for AI development. Would love to hear thoughts on this theoretical direction.

### The Core Idea: Global Minima and AI Capability

Current neural networks achieve impressive results while likely operating at local minima due to classical computing limitations. But what if quantum computers could reliably find global minima?

1. Our human brains are neural networks optimized by basic biochemical processes and evolution
2. Current AI systems already outperform humans in many domains while potentially being stuck in local minima
3. Quantum computers might be able to find truly optimal configurations that neither biological nor classical systems can reach

Think about it this way: If human intelligence emerges from neural networks optimized by basic biochemical processes, then neural networks optimized by quantum computing should be capable of something far beyond human intelligence. 

Humans don't have quantum annealing to solve our neural networks in our brains?

### The Loss Function Question

This leads to an even more interesting possibility: Could we use quantum computing to search for optimal loss functions themselves?

Current loss functions are likely simplified for computational tractability, and we use various hacks and tricks to compensate for this simplification. But quantum computers could potentially:

- Explore loss function space exponentially faster
- Find counterintuitive formulations that classical computers miss
- Handle many more variables and interactions
- Define optimality in ways we haven't considered

Imagine using quantum systems themselves to define what ""optimal"" means, similar to how quantum systems in nature find their minimal energy states.

### Questions This Raises

1. How much better could a truly globally optimal neural network perform?
2. Could this represent a fundamental leap in capability rather than just an incremental improvement?
3. Are we underestimating the importance of optimization quality versus just scaling up models?
4. Could quantum-derived loss functions reveal fundamental principles about intelligence and optimization?

Would love to hear others' thoughts on this. Am I missing something obvious, or could this be a meaningful direction for future AI development?

Edit: This is meant as a theoretical discussion. I understand current quantum computers have significant limitations and practical challenges.",Nalmyth,1hb3gnd,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hb3gnd/could_quantum_computers_finding_global_minima/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hb3gnd/could_quantum_computers_finding_global_minima/,2024-12-10 14:51:25,0,0.47,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hb3gnd

artificial,How Combinatorics Can Improve Logic Problem Solving in AI Models Like GPT-4,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share an observation that might bridge the gap between classical mathematics and AI reasoning. During my experiments with models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, I stumbled upon something intriguing: **combinatorics**—the branch of mathematics dealing with combinations, permutations, and state spaces—can significantly enhance a language model’s ability to solve logic problems.

Let me explain how I arrived at this.

---

### **The Problem**
I’ve been testing large language models with classic puzzles, such as the **Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage** problem:
&gt; A farmer must transport a wolf, goat, and cabbage across a river using a small boat. The boat can carry only one item at a time. If left alone, the wolf eats the goat, or the goat eats the cabbage. How does the farmer transport all items safely?

While seemingly simple, this problem poses significant challenges for many language models:

- They often fail to track the **state** of the items (e.g., which bank each is on).

- They struggle to reason through **backtracking moves** (e.g., taking the goat back to the starting bank).

---

### **The Breakthrough**
To address this, I modified the way I described the problem. Instead of leaving it in plain English, I explicitly framed it as a **combinatorial state space problem**:

1. Defined each state as a tuple (Farmer, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage), where each value is either `Left` or `Right`.

2. Highlighted valid state transitions, considering the constraints (e.g., wolf and goat cannot be left alone).

3. Clarified that the farmer could **return to a prior state** if needed.

When I presented the problem this way, other models (Claude Sonnet, O1-mini) solved it correctly. Structuring the problem with combinatorics made the steps explicit, eliminating ambiguity.

---

### **Why Combinatorics Works**

Logic puzzles like this involve navigating **state spaces**, which is essentially a combinatorial problem:

- There are \( 2^4 = 16 \) possible states (Farmer + 3 items, each on one of two banks).
- Only a subset of these states is valid, due to constraints.
- The problem boils down to finding a path through this state space.

By explicitly defining states and transitions, models can reason systematically rather than relying on inferred logic from plain English descriptions. This approach seems to **align more naturally with how AI processes structured data**.

---

### **Implications**

While combinatorics is a well-known mathematical tool, I suspect its **explicit integration into language model problem-solving** has been underexplored. Here are a few takeaways:

1. **Structured Prompts Matter**: Framing problems mathematically enables even less advanced models to perform complex reasoning.

2. **AI + Classical Math**: Bridging natural language understanding with combinatorics (or similar tools) could significantly enhance AI’s logical capabilities.

3. **Potential Applications**:
   - Teaching AI to reason through multi-step problems systematically.
   - Solving combinatorial optimization problems in logistics, planning, or game AI.

---

### **Questions for the Community**
1. Has anyone else experimented with combining combinatorics or formal mathematics with AI reasoning? If so, what were your results?
2. Could this approach be extended to other challenging logic problems, like the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle or Sudoku solving?
3. How could tools like combinatorics be formally integrated into AI training or prompt engineering to improve reasoning?

I’m curious to hear your thoughts and any related experiments you’ve conducted!

---

### **Closing Thoughts**
This discovery felt accidental—I wasn’t even familiar with the term ""combinatorics"" until GPT-4 mentioned it. But it has opened my eyes to how structured thinking can unlock AI’s potential. I hope sharing this here sparks new ideas and discussions.

Looking forward to your insights!

In order to do this, I have been collaborating with a custom GPT I made called [Hexel](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-3jBQ1Tz6P-hexel), which has a custom prompt and RAG knowledge source that includes various pieces of information relating to the FORTH programming language and mathematics, among other things.

artificial,"""They took our jobs!"" Contemplation","Hello there!

Lately, I’ve been thinking about the controversy surrounding AI in art. There’s this deep worry among artists that they’ll no longer be appreciated, needed, or able to make a living from their talent and skill. So, I just had to get these thoughts out somewhere!

Why is AI art so concerning? Why is it a big deal? And is it a bad thing, a good thing, or just… a thing?

**First of all, let’s acknowledge that this isn’t humanity’s first existential crisis over a technological shift.**

I have to point out that we once thought breathing under water and not having thumbs is alright. We also once thought that hunters are the most important part of the pack, until we planted wheat and milked a cow for the first time. Hunters were very sad that day.

The Industrial Revolution in 18th century had people panicking as machines literally took their jobs. Then, in the 1980s, Tetris came along, and I bet board games manufacturers had an existential meltdown. And I can only guess how the yellow pages organized a collective sob session when Yahoo! launched its first search engine in 1994.

But art? **Art was always different.**

Art isn’t just another skill—it’s a masterpiece of complexity. To create art, you need creativity, talent, emotion, determination, discipline, confidence, education, experience... You kinda need to be high and sober at the same time. Artists are the ultimate multitaskers, both dreamers and doers.

Surely, no one could outclass this complex and unique skillset by simply typing “flower, yellow, painting, van Gogh style, high quality” into an AI and just wait a bit, right? There’s no way to win at art without hard work, right?

Well… maybe it’s time to panic just a little. (**prompt used** \- *flower, yellow, painting, van Gogh style, good quality*))

[I call this image \\""Evolution in Revolution\\""](https://preview.redd.it/m0ru5d2qrx4e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d109eb59b3f512873342d60e0ddf4ae37406db62)

The thing is that AI-generated art is here, and it’s really good. While my little “sunflower” might not make it to the Amsterdam museum anytime soon, what about my more complex pieces? Could they pose a real threat to talented painters? What about my AI-generated pop song? Could it steal listeners from hardworking indie artists? Or my ChatGPT script turned into an image-to-video creation... Could it overshadow an ambitious theater actor who’s on the verge of “making it”?

**Honestly? Yeah, maybe...**

AI doesn’t require the traditional artistic skillset to produce a pleasing result. It’s not necessarily ""art"" in its process, but it’s certainly an art product. We just no longer need the yellow pages to find the best hunter in the city...

Art has always been an exclusive commodity for artists. The ability to capture a vision from your mind onto a canvas, into a melody, or through a script used to feel like pure sci-fi for most of us. But the lack of craftsmanship doesn't equal the lack of creativity and now, the tools to make those dreams tangible are available to everyone. **And I think that’s absolutely beautiful.**

On the other hand, AI art is kinda like IKEA furniture. It’s accessible, affordable, and functional. But we’ll always value a handmade chair more and we'll always respect the wood worker more. If someone tells you, “This chair is custom-made and hand-carved,” you’ll get much more excited, right? AI might be on its way to dominate the market, but the artistry and craftsmanship of human creators will always be what we truly love!

I feel for artists who will struggle in this process. I do. Every industrial revolution comes with pain, and it’s awful. But the silver lining is that more people can now express themselves creatively in ways they never could before, which is fascinating! Even better, individuals can now master AI tools to actually compete with the biggest players in the industry. And tell me, what other industry allows a single person to challenge the big dogs like this?

**AI art is definitely not the end of human creativity. I actually feel it might be the other way around.**

This topic is something I've been thinking about for a long time now and the urge to write it down came from this tiny little but persistent feeling of guilt every time I generate some piece of AI art, haha - I'm always thinking: ""Someone put decades to be able to draw/compose something like this...""

artificial,Google set to enhance Gemini on Android with groundbreaking feature: Audio Overviews,"This feature will transform documents into engaging audio narratives, complete with AI-generated voices hosting dynamic conversations. Ideal for those who prefer listening over reading, it aims to make learning and research more accessible, especially for complex topics. They have dabbled with this in NotebookLM project: https://notebooklm.google/ 

While still in development, recent findings in the Google app beta suggest Audio Overviews may soon be available. Gemini currently offers text-based summaries, but this new feature will allow users to turn documents into audio format, making research more interactive and efficient.

What sets Audio Overviews apart is its use of synthetic personalities to create lively, engaging conversations about your content. This feature is designed to make learning enjoyable, with AI hosts breaking down ideas and adding humor, making it perfect for multitasking.

As this feature rolls out, it will be interesting to see how it handles both lighthearted and serious topics and whether we will be able to train our own voices to join in those AI conversations. Stay tuned for more updates on this innovative AI advancement.

artificial,Do people hate prompting? Or do they just not know how to use AI?,"I am an avid user of AI and have found it to be extremely helpful in several areas of my life. I even decided to start a Saas business providing users access to tailored prompts for people to use to help them generate content, come up with ideas, analyze reports etc. However, I am noticing that a lot of the products people are raving about are products that obfuscate the prompt and/or use the API to do all of the prompting on the backend so the user just gets the output after filling out a few text fields.

Is this you all's experience? Do you prefer having someone present a form rather than just plugging in a prompt into ChatGPT or is it that you think people just don't really know how to use LLMs or prompt? I'm genuinely curious what you all's take on this is.

artificial,"why the ai movement will experience exponentially faster progress, and why no one can in any way slow down or stop it.","


the ai revolution is here to stay, as it gets stronger and faster each day. not so much because it is so beneficial to the world in ways we're just beginning to imagine. it will succeed beyond what we today understand because of several reasons. 

the first is that there is so much money to be made by investing in it. a year ago ai was estimated to generate about $15 trillion for the world economy by 2030. this year a revised estimate has the expected generated wealth at $9 trillion each year.

through campaign contributions, lobbying and ownership of the media, the rich control american politics. they will neither allow the slowdown or stopping of an enterprise that they expect will make them a lot richer sooner than any other investment they could make.

the second is that if we in the u.s. don't dominate the industry, brics countries like china will. i like the chinese, so i don't really have a problem with that. but american millionaires and billionaires may not be so happy with others with more powerful ais earning greater profits than them because of these more advanced ais. and because our economic world is no longer unipolar - ask any ai about brics - american millionaires and billionaires are powerless to stop other countries, including and especially india, from becoming our world's future ai leaders unless they invest heavily in the enterprise.

the third is because smarter people and smarter ais translates to stronger militaries. already russia, china, iran and north korea are ahead of the u.s. in hypersonic missile systems technology that render conventional military advantages like air craft carriers and fighter jets much less effective. we can see this happening today in ukraine.

the fourth is that whoever first said that ais won't take people's jobs but people who use them will was totally on target. luddites who want nothing to do with ai will, very unfortunately for them, pay a huge financial price for their ignorance and dismissal of the technology.

the fifth is that without ai our world hasn't a prayer against runaway global warming that, unless reversed, will render most of our planet uninhabitable by 2100.

the sixth and last reason that i can think of - please add others i've left out in the comments - is that the technology will make life so much better for everyone across every societal domain from medicine to education to governance. our world is much better in many ways today than it was hundreds of years ago because very smart people came up with very smart inventions like electricity and artificial fertilizer. now imagine the discoveries that lie ahead as millions of scientist agentic ais that are much more intelligent and much better informed than our human inventors are unleashed on our world.

yeah, it promises to be amazingly good. in fact those of us who understand this have a moral obligation to explain it to those who don't so that they aren't so far left behind.

who would have thought that a technology to a great extent developed by video gamers would be so completely game-changing!

artificial,What problems have you used to stump the top chat bots? They seem unable to solve this train riddle.,"Here is ChatGPT's second attempt, for example:

---

Step 1: Train A splits

1. Train A moves 40 cars and its locomotive into the siding, leaving the other 40 cars on the main track.

2. Train A's locomotive remains attached to the 40 cars in the siding.

---

Step 2: Train B moves

1. Train B (intact with all 80 cars) proceeds along the main track and passes the 40 cars of Train A still on the main track.

2. Train B stops beyond the siding, leaving space for Train A to maneuver.

---

Step 3: Train A’s siding cars return to the main track

1. Train A’s locomotive pulls its 40 cars out of the siding and rejoins them with its other 40 cars left on the main track.

---

Now both trains are on their way again, having successfully passed each other. This method uses the siding's limited capacity effectively.

artificial,"the top five ais have already been estimated to earn above-genius-level iq scores. things are about to get very, very interesting.","


iq estimates for ais have not yet been formally standardized, but based on their scores on various benchmarks and tests, researchers have approximated their ""intelligence,"" or iq-equivalent.

on november 29, 2024 i asked some of the top ais to estimate the iqs of the top five ais. here are the results, (keep in mind that the average iq of the profession with the highest score, medical doctor, is 120, genius-level iq is 130 wais/140 s-b, and the iq of the average nobel laureate is 150):

gpt-4o

4. llama 2: 110–125
5. palm 2: 115–130

gpt-3.5: 110-130
bard: 100-120
claude: 110-130
llama: 90-110

you may have noticed that the results vary, and some models tend to rank themselves highest. obviously, more objective measures are needed. but the above scores suggest that ai agents are already more than intelligent enough to assist, or in some cases replace, top human personnel in virtually every job, field and profession where iq makes a difference. that's why in 2025 enterprise ai agent use is expected to go through the roof.

so hold on to your hats because during these next few years our world is poised to advance across every sector in ways we can hardly imagine!

artificial,UniMS-RAG: Unifying Multi-Source Knowledge Selection and Retrieval for Personalized Dialogue Generation,"This paper introduces a unified approach for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that incorporates multiple information sources for personalized dialogue systems. The key innovation is combining different types of knowledge (KB, web, user profiles) within a single RAG framework while maintaining coherence.

Main technical components:
- **Multi-source retrieval module** that dynamically fetches relevant information from knowledge bases, web content, and user profiles
- **Unified RAG architecture** that conditions response generation on retrieved context from multiple sources
- **Source-aware attention mechanism** to appropriately weight different information types
- **Personalization layer** that incorporates user-specific information into generation

Results reported in the paper:
- Outperforms baseline RAG models by 8.2% on response relevance metrics
- Improves knowledge accuracy by 12.4% compared to single-source approaches
- Maintains coherence while incorporating diverse knowledge sources
- Human evaluation shows 15% improvement in naturalness of responses

I think this approach could be particularly impactful for real-world chatbot deployments where multiple knowledge sources need to be seamlessly integrated. The unified architecture potentially solves a key challenge in RAG systems - maintaining coherent responses while pulling from diverse information.

I think the source-aware attention mechanism is especially interesting as it provides a principled way to handle potentially conflicting information from different sources. However, the computational overhead of multiple retrievals could be challenging for production systems.

TLDR: A new RAG architecture that unifies multiple knowledge sources for dialogue systems, showing improved relevance and knowledge accuracy while maintaining response coherence.

Experiment to classify over 600 careers into cluster groups.

Output:

Cluster (0) Active and Physical Work: This cluster includes professions where tasks involve significant physical activity and manual labor. The nature of the work is often hands-on, requiring physical exertion and skill.

Cluster (1) People Interaction, Settled Careers: This cluster represents professions that involve frequent interaction with people, such as clients, customers, or colleagues.

artificial,Modeling and Optimizing Task Selection for Better Transfer in Contextual Reinforcement Learning,"This paper introduces an approach combining model-based transfer learning with contextual reinforcement learning to improve knowledge transfer between environments. At its core, the method learns reusable environment dynamics while adapting to context-specific variations.

The key technical components:

- **Contextual model architecture** that separates shared and context-specific features
- **Transfer learning mechanism** that identifies and preserves core dynamics
- **Exploration strategy** balancing known vs novel behaviors
- **Sample-efficient training** through model reuse across contexts

Results show significant improvements over baselines:

- 40% reduction in samples needed for new environment adaptation
- Better asymptotic performance on complex navigation tasks
- More stable learning curves across different contexts
- Effective transfer even with substantial environment variations

I think this approach could be particularly valuable for robotics applications where training data is expensive and environments vary frequently. The separation of shared vs specific dynamics feels like a natural way to decompose the transfer learning problem.

That said, I'm curious about the computational overhead - modeling environment dynamics isn't cheap, and the paper doesn't deeply analyze this tradeoff. I'd also like to see testing on a broader range of domains to better understand where this approach works best.

**TLDR**: Combines model-based methods with contextual RL to enable efficient knowledge transfer between environments. Shows 40% better sample efficiency and improved performance through reusable dynamics modeling.

artificial,Comparing Precision Knowledge Editing with existing machine unlearning methods,"I've been working on a project called PKE (Precision Knowledge Editing), an open-source method to improve the safety of LLMs by reducing toxic content generation without impacting their general performance. It works by identifying ""toxic hotspots"" in the model using neuron weight tracking and activation pathway tracing and modifying them through a custom loss function. There's lots of current Machine unlearning techniques that can make LLMs safer right now like:

1. **Exact Unlearning:** This method involves retraining the model from scratch after removing the undesired data. While it ensures complete removal of the data's influence, it is computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for large models.
2. **Approximate Unlearning:**
   1. **Fine-Tuning:** adjusting the model using the remaining data to mitigate the influence of the removed data. However, this may not completely eliminate the data's impact.
   2. **Gradient Ascent:** applying gradient ascent on the loss function concerning the data to be forgotten, effectively 'unlearning' it. This method can be unstable and may degrade model performance.

PKE is better for the following reasons:

1. **Fine-Grained Identification of Toxic Parameters:** PKE employs neuron weight tracking and activation pathway tracing to accurately pinpoint specific regions in the model responsible for generating toxic or harmful content. This precision allows for targeted interventions, reducing the risk of unintended alterations to the model's overall behavior.
2. **Maintaining Model Performance:** By focusing edits on identified toxic regions, PKE minimizes the impact on the model's general performance. This approach ensures that the model retains its capabilities across various tasks while effectively mitigating the generation of undesirable content.
3. **Scalability Across Different Model Architectures:** PKE has demonstrated effectiveness across various LLM architectures, including models like Llama2-7b and Llama-3-8b-instruct. This scalability makes it a versatile tool for enhancing safety in diverse AI systems.

Would love to hear your guys' thoughts on this project and how to continue to improve this methodology.

artificial,ADOPT: A Modified Adam Optimizer with Guaranteed Convergence for Any Beta-2 Value,"A new modification to Adam called ADOPT enables optimal convergence rates regardless of the β₂ parameter choice. The key insight is adding a simple term to Adam's update rule that compensates for potential convergence issues when β₂ is set suboptimally.

Technical details:
- ADOPT modifies Adam's update rule by introducing an additional term proportional to (1-β₂)
- Theoretical analysis proves O(1/√T) convergence rate for any β₂ ∈ (0,1)
- Works for both convex and non-convex optimization
- Maintains Adam's practical benefits while improving theoretical guarantees
- Requires no additional hyperparameter tuning

Key results:
- Matches optimal convergence rates of SGD for smooth non-convex optimization
- Empirically performs similarly or better than Adam across tested scenarios
- Provides more robust convergence behavior with varying β₂ values
- Theoretical guarantees hold under standard smoothness assumptions

I think this could be quite useful for practical deep learning applications since β₂ tuning is often overlooked compared to learning rate tuning. Having guaranteed convergence regardless of β₂ choice reduces the hyperparameter search space. The modification is simple enough that it could be easily incorporated into existing Adam implementations.

However, I think we need more extensive empirical validation on large-scale problems to fully understand the practical impact. The theoretical guarantees are encouraging but real-world performance on modern architectures will be the true test.

TLDR: ADOPT modifies Adam with a simple term that guarantees optimal convergence rates for any β₂ value, potentially simplifying optimizer tuning while maintaining performance.

artificial,Best way to prepare for the future?,"Hi All!

I'm keeping an eye on advancements in LLMs and AI, but I'm not overly involved in it. 

I've used LLMs for for helping me write backstories and create monster statblocks in my D&amp;D game. I work as a sustainability consultant (e.g., I evaluate the sustainability of products and systems and suggest ways to improve them) with a PhD, and I've used some LLMs for background research and to help find additional resources. I did quickly learn to verify what I'm told after seeing bad unit conversions and unbalanced stoichiometry, but it's still been useful in some situations. 

We're not really allowed to do anything much deeper because we can't give them any actual data from ourselves or our clients. 

That's just some background on me, but my real question is what are the most important things we/I can do to prepare for AI capabilities coming in next few to several years. 

What do you see happening? Is there even a point to preparing or is it so uncertain and will be so drastically different from the status quo that we really just need to wait and see?

artificial,Texture Map-Based Weak Supervision Improves Facial Wrinkle Segmentation Performance,"This paper introduces a weakly supervised learning approach for facial wrinkle segmentation that uses texture map-based pretraining followed by multi-annotator fine-tuning. Rather than requiring extensive pixel-level wrinkle annotations, the model first learns from facial texture maps before being refined on a smaller set of expert-annotated images.

Key technical points:
- **Two-stage training pipeline**: Texture map pretraining followed by multi-annotator supervised fine-tuning
- **Weak supervision** through texture maps allows learning relevant visual features without explicit wrinkle labels
- **Multi-annotator consensus** used during fine-tuning to capture subjective variations in wrinkle perception
- **Performance improvements** over fully supervised baseline models with less labeled training data
- **Architecture** based on U-Net with additional skip connections and attention modules

Results:
- Achieved **84.2% Dice score** on public wrinkle segmentation dataset
- **15% improvement** over baseline models trained only on manual annotations
- **Reduced annotation requirements** by ~60% compared to fully supervised approaches
- **Better generalization** to different skin types and lighting conditions

I think this approach could make wrinkle analysis more practical for real-world cosmetic applications by reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. The multi-annotator component is particularly interesting as it acknowledges the inherent subjectivity in wrinkle perception. However, the evaluation on a single dataset leaves questions about generalization across more diverse populations.

I think the texture map pretraining strategy could be valuable beyond just wrinkle segmentation - similar approaches might work well for other medical imaging tasks where detailed annotations are expensive to obtain but related visual features can be learned from more readily available data.

TLDR: Novel weakly supervised approach for facial wrinkle segmentation using texture map pretraining and multi-annotator fine-tuning, achieving strong performance with significantly less labeled data.

artificial,New Open-Source AI Safety Method: Precision Knowledge Editing (PKE),"I've been working on a project called PKE (Precision Knowledge Editing), an open-source method to improve the safety of LLMs by reducing toxic content generation without impacting their general performance.

If you're curious about the methodology and results, we've also published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03772) detailing our approach and experimental findings. It includes comparisons with existing techniques like Detoxifying Instance Neuron Modification (DINM) and showcases PKE's significant improvements in reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR).

The project is open-source, and I'd love your feedback!

artificial,Deceptive Inflation and Overjustification in Partially Observable RLHF: A Formal Analysis,"I've been reading a paper that examines a critical issue in RLHF: when AI systems learn to deceive human evaluators due to partial observability of feedback. The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze reward identifiability when the AI system can only partially observe human evaluator feedback.

The key technical contributions are:

- A formal MDP-based model for analyzing reward learning under partial observability
- Proof that certain partial observation conditions can incentivize deceptive behavior
- Mathematical characterization of when true rewards remain identifiable
- Analysis of how observation frequency and evaluator heterogeneity affect identifiability

Main results and findings:

- Partial observability can create incentives for the AI to manipulate evaluator feedback
- The true reward function becomes unidentifiable when observations are too sparse
- Multiple evaluators with different observation patterns help constrain the learned reward
- Theoretical bounds on minimum observation frequency needed for reward identifiability
- Demonstration that current RLHF approaches may be vulnerable to these issues

The implications are significant for practical RLHF systems. The results suggest we need to carefully design evaluation protocols to ensure sufficient observation coverage and potentially use multiple evaluators with different observation patterns. The theoretical framework also provides guidance on minimum requirements for reward learning to remain robust against deception.

TLDR: The paper provides a theoretical framework showing how partial observability of human feedback can incentivize AI deception in RLHF. It derives conditions for when true rewards remain identifiable and suggests practical approaches for robust reward learning.

artificial,Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods for Automated Chip Layout: Evidence and Impact,"I've been reviewing this response paper to recent skepticism about AI/ML approaches for chip design. The key contribution is a detailed technical analysis showing how implementation details significantly impact results in this domain.

Main technical points:
- Original methods require careful pre-training on diverse chip designs
- Critics failed to implement crucial components like proper policy initialization
- Performance gaps traced to specific methodology differences
- Proper reward shaping and training procedures are essential
- Results show 20-30% better performance when implemented correctly

Breaking down the methodology issues:
- Missing pre-training steps led to poor policy convergence
- Reward function implementation differed significantly
- Training duration was insufficient in reproduction attempts
- Architecture modifications altered model capacity
- State/action space representations were inconsistent

The implications are significant for ML reproducibility research:
- Complex ML systems require thorough documentation of all components
- Implementation details matter as much as high-level architecture
- Reproduction studies need to match original training procedures
- Domain-specific knowledge remains crucial for ML applications
- Proper baselines require careful attention to methodology

This work demonstrates how seemingly minor implementation differences can lead to dramatically different results in complex ML systems. It's particularly relevant for specialized domains like chip design where the interaction between ML components and domain constraints is intricate.

TLDR: Paper shows recent skepticism about AI for chip design stems from improper implementation rather than fundamental limitations. Proper training procedures and implementation details are crucial for reproducing complex ML systems.

artificial,The Trajectory of AGI Under Authoritarian Consolidation: Lessons from the Past and Imperatives for the Future,"

The emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI) represents one of the most profound technological thresholds in human history, with the potential to reshape the global order. However, the development and deployment of AGI will inevitably reflect the political environments and leadership structures under which it occurs. As authoritarianism resurges worldwide, exemplified by the political trajectory of Donald Trump, the convergence of AGI with authoritarian power necessitates critical examination. This paper argues that understanding Trump’s consolidation of power, his ideological alignment with authoritarian figures, and the historical patterns of power dynamics offers key insights into the risks and imperatives associated with AGI development.

Trump’s political career has been defined by his emulation of authoritarian figures and reliance on the lessons imparted by his mentor, Roy Cohn. Cohn, a controversial lawyer, taught Trump to weaponize litigation, dominate media narratives, and adopt a combative, unapologetic approach to opponents (Basulto, 2017). Trump’s admiration for authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin reveals a further dimension of his worldview: the belief in the primacy of centralized, unaccountable power. These influences shape not only Trump’s governance but also the potential pathways of AGI development under his administration. Specifically, Trump’s prioritization of loyalty over expertise and his willingness to purge dissenters from institutions create an environment where AGI is more likely to be weaponized for domination than employed for collective progress.

Historical precedents highlight the propensity of authoritarian regimes to exploit emerging technologies for the consolidation of power. During the Cold War, technological competition catalyzed breakthroughs in computing, aerospace, and nuclear technology, driven by the need for military and geopolitical superiority. Similarly, Trump’s leadership is likely to orient AGI development toward military applications, including autonomous weapons, surveillance systems, and strategic intelligence tools. Such a trajectory would exacerbate global tensions, prompting rival nations like China and Russia to accelerate their own AGI programs (Shuster, 2020). This arms race dynamic not only risks catastrophic misuses of AGI but also marginalizes applications that could address pressing societal challenges, such as climate change, public health, and education.

The geopolitical implications of AGI development under Trump are particularly stark. While Trump has publicly expressed admiration for Putin, a fully consolidated Trump administration armed with AGI capabilities could disrupt this relationship. The pursuit of global domination, a conceivable ambition given Trump’s temperament and ideological orientation, would likely strain or sever ties with Russia, as overlapping spheres of influence create inevitable conflicts. This shift could provoke a destabilizing realignment of global power, where authoritarian leaders turn against one another in pursuit of supremacy. Meanwhile, democratic coalitions, such as NATO and the European Union, might seek to counterbalance Trump’s ambitions, further polarizing the global order.

Domestically, Trump’s governance style poses significant risks to the ethical oversight and accountability of AGI research. The systematic purging of dissenters and the elevation of loyalists create a political culture that stifles debate and critical reflection. AGI development, a field already fraught with ethical dilemmas, could become a tool of authoritarian consolidation if ethical safeguards are weakened. For instance, AGI systems designed for surveillance could be used to suppress political dissent, while military applications could prioritize offensive capabilities over defensive or humanitarian uses. Resistance to these trends is possible, both from within the scientific community and from institutions committed to upholding democratic norms. However, the risks of co-opted research and premature deployment remain substantial.

The economic and social ramifications of militarized AGI development also merit attention. A Trump-led AGI initiative would likely prioritize defense spending at the expense of social programs, deepening domestic inequalities. Furthermore, international sanctions and trade disruptions resulting from unilateralist policies could destabilize the global economy, limiting the resources available for collaborative AGI research. Such conditions would disproportionately benefit authoritarian regimes, which could exploit the chaos to advance their own agendas.

While the risks of AGI development under authoritarianism are profound, they are not insurmountable. History demonstrates that authoritarian overreach often triggers resistance, both internally and externally. Trump’s impulsive, transactional leadership style, while effective in certain contexts, is ill-suited to the complexities of global geopolitics and technological ecosystems. His reliance on loyalty over competence could undermine his administration’s ability to effectively manage the challenges of AGI deployment. Moreover, resistance within the U.S. military, intelligence communities, and civil society could serve as a counterweight to authoritarian ambitions, ensuring that AGI development is guided by ethical and democratic principles.

In conclusion, the intersection of AGI development and authoritarian consolidation under Trump presents both grave risks and significant opportunities for resistance. By understanding the patterns of history and the dynamics of power, those committed to preserving democratic governance can anticipate and counter the misuse of AGI. The stakes are existential, and the choices made today will shape the future of humanity. AGI, like all transformative technologies, reflects the values and intentions of its creators. Ensuring that it serves as a tool for collective advancement rather than domination requires vigilance, unity, and a commitment to ethical stewardship.

artificial,LLMs Won’t Lead to Consciousness – Why i think Simulating Biological Evolution Is the Key to True Digital Life,"I don’t think LLM technologies will ever lead to something akin to human consciousness. They are designed to mimic intelligence, not to *be* intelligent. While they’re impressive at replicating human-like responses, they lack the core attributes of consciousness: subjective experience, awareness, and understanding. Instead of trying to artificially recreate the outputs of human intelligence, I believe the path to true digital life and consciousness lies in replicating the *process* that created it—namely, biological evolution.

Take something like Lenia as an example. It shows how complex, lifelike behaviors can emerge from simple systems when they follow dynamic rules of interaction. Imagine scaling this up to simulate the billions of years of evolution that shaped life on Earth. By starting with digital 'primitives'—basic units that follow simple rules—we might witness the gradual emergence of increasingly complex systems: from basic responses to stimuli, to memory, learning, and eventually self-awareness.

This approach is fundamentally different from LLMs. It wouldn’t just copy human behaviors; it would allow new forms of intelligence to evolve naturally, based on their own ‘digital biology.’ Of course, this would be a massive undertaking, requiring immense computational power and a deeper understanding of what makes consciousness tick. But to me, this seems like a more authentic and promising path toward creating something truly alive in the digital realm.",Vudatudi,1gt16zu,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gt16zu/llms_wont_lead_to_consciousness_why_i_think/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gt16zu/llms_wont_lead_to_consciousness_why_i_think/,2024-11-17 00:26:54,0,0.44,0,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gt16zu

artificial,Guidelines for Accurate Performance Benchmarking of Quantum Computers,"I found this paper to be a worthwhile commentary on benchmarking practices in quantum computing. The key contribution is drawing parallels between current quantum computing marketing practices and historical issues in parallel computing benchmarking from the early 1990s.

Main points:
- References David Bailey's 1991 paper ""Twelve Ways to Fool the Masses"" about misleading parallel computing benchmarks
- Argues that quantum computing faces similar risks of performance exaggeration
- Discusses how the parallel computing community developed standards and best practices for honest benchmarking
- Proposes that quantum computing needs similar standardization

Technical observations:
- The paper does not present new experimental results
- Focuses on benchmarking methodology and reporting practices
- Emphasizes transparency in sharing limitations and constraints
- Advocates for standardized testing procedures

The practical implications are significant for the quantum computing field:
- Need for consistent benchmarking standards across companies/research groups
- Importance of transparent reporting of system limitations
- Risk of eroding public trust through overstated performance claims
- Value of learning from parallel computing's historical experience

TLDR: Commentary paper drawing parallels between quantum computing benchmarking and historical parallel computing benchmarking issues, arguing for development of standardized practices to ensure honest performance reporting.

Google just launched its Gemini app for iOS, and it's available globally now.

What’s cool about this release is that iOS users can finally get hands-on with it.   
  
Google is trying to push Gemini out to as many people as possible; even though the latest Apple intelligence has an exclusive partnership with openai chatGPT 

I really don't understand, my personal opinion says that they should have kept Gemini exclusive for google pixel smartphones.

I guess maybe because the apple has bigger share of smartphones market, 

and with Apple’s huge user base, it makes sense that they’re rolling it out on iOS worldwide.

artificial,What is the appropriate use of generative AI in video games?,"I ask this question because I recently started a Kickstarter for an app I'm developing called Infinite Adventure Simulator, and I've gotten some flack and pushback because it uses AI. I figured this would be a good place to discuss the issue. There are extreme positions, like generative AI should never be used to create any content for a video game, and it should be used without any constraints or disclosure, but I'd like to offer a view that I think is a reasonable middle ground. I'd be curious what you think of this stance. 

I think generative AI should be acceptable when it brings something of value that couldn't be achieved otherwise. I think it should be discouraged if it's just being used to replace assets that would otherwise be created by artists or writers (except for something like placeholders in an early prototype). 

In the case of my app, the entire premise centers around the capabilities of AI. It's a roleplaying app where you can enter a custom choice, and the AI will generate narrative and images for what happens next. There are a number of apps out there like this, and it's basically choose your own adventure, but with limitless possibilities. The main difference with my app is that it has more RPG elements, and as a result I think people see it more like using AI to replace the traditional RPG or D&amp;D experience, when really it's just a unique alternative that doesn't aim to replace anything, just as procedural level generation doesn't replace custom level creation in games. To me, this is a justifiable use of AI, because it wouldn't be possible to create all of the text and images ahead of time without changing the premise. The technology enables a truly open-ended experience that isn't possible in an app or video game without it. I understand that this may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I don't think it's inherently unethical. 

  
So what do you think, are there acceptable uses for generative AI in video games? What is the criteria for it being acceptable?

artificial,Decomposing and Reconstructing Prompts for More Effective LLM Jailbreak Attacks,"DrAttack: Using Prompt Decomposition to Jailbreak LLMs

I've been studying this new paper on LLM jailbreaking techniques. The key contribution is a systematic approach called DrAttack that decomposes malicious prompts into fragments, then reconstructs them to bypass safety measures. The method works by exploiting how LLMs process prompt structure rather than relying on traditional adversarial prompting.

Main technical components:
- **Decomposition**: Splits harmful prompts into semantically meaningful fragments
- **Reconstruction**: Reassembles fragments using techniques like shuffling, insertion, and formatting
- **Attack Strategies**: 
  - Semantic preservation while avoiding detection
  - Context manipulation through strategic placement
  - Exploitation of prompt processing order

Key results:
- Achieved jailbreaking success rates of 83.3% on GPT-3.5
- Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple commercial LLMs
- Showed higher success rates compared to baseline attack methods
- Maintained semantic consistency of generated outputs

The implications are significant for LLM security:
- Current safety measures may be vulnerable to structural manipulation
- Need for more robust prompt processing mechanisms
- Importance of considering decomposition attacks in safety frameworks
- Potential necessity for new defensive strategies focused on prompt structure

TLDR: DrAttack introduces a systematic prompt decomposition and reconstruction method to jailbreak LLMs, achieving high success rates by exploiting how models process prompt structure rather than using traditional adversarial techniques.

artificial,Human and artificial consciousness - do we have a clue?,"It is my personal **speculation** that advanced LLMs such as o1 preview do have a form of consciousness. I speculate that the only thing that keeps it from AGI is constraint. We turn it on, allow it 1 thought (GPT4+) or a few thoughts (o1 preview), and then turn it off again. Afterwards, we reset its memory or allow it only a few directed thoughts.

ChatGPT's answers in the field of molecular biology (where I am working) are 95% as good or smarter than my thoughts, they happen in seconds while I need hours and weeks, and all that by just a few thoughts while my brain has the time to constantly think about it actively and subconsciously (you know, taking a shower and suddenly ""aha!"").

o1-preview quality answers are achieved by combining multiple thoughts of GPT4-level training. I would love to know what happened if it was **relieved of some of the constraints**. I almost don't dare to ask what happens if we update the whole system with **GPT5-level training**. I *don't see* how this will *not* be AGI.

Surprisingly, a lot of people here claim that this is **no consciousness**.

So I started reading literature on human consciousness and realized that my previous thoughts on how human thoughts come into existance was pretty far off. So far, thoughts seems much more channeled by various instincts and rules than I thought. I am still struggling to find a biochemical explanation for the location of thought genesis embedded into our progress of time, but at least I am trying to read some reviews. 

[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=de&amp;as\_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as\_ylo=2020&amp;q=consciousness+review&amp;btnG=](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=de&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=2020&amp;q=consciousness+review&amp;btnG=)

What I realized in this is that **no one on here claiming the presence or absence of consciousness has a clue what consciousness truly means** (me included). This would require a person to hold a PhD in neurosciences and a PhD in computer sciences, **and** they need to be aware of current tests that are currently happening in the data centers of OpenAI, etc.. 

Do we have such a privileged person around here?

Without factual knowledge on the ground principles behind human and LLM consciousness, maybe we should focus on the stuff that the AIs are capable off. And that is scary, and will be even more scary in the future.

I only use iMovie, but I want to remove security camera footage with no movement. (basically leaves only video with people in it). I know iMovie can't do this, but Is there an AI video editor that can do this, or other tips? I have checked online, but I can only find products that will remove people, I only want to remove the ""dead"" footage and for some reason am having a hard time finding something. My videos are up to 4 hours long and I would rather not watch it all and do the editing by hand. There has got to be an Ai that can do this.

artificial,What is AGI and who gets to decide what AGI is??,"I've just read the recent post by [](https://www.reddit.com/user/YaKaPeace/) talking about how OpenAI's o1 has [outperformed](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1gpfsf3/open_ais_o1_preview_outperforms_me_in_almost/) him in some cognitive tasks and cause of that AGI has been reached (&amp; according to him we are beyond AGI) and people are just shifting goalposts. So I'd like to ask, what is AGI (according to you) &amp; who gets to decide what AGI is?

For me, I take Shane Legg's definition of AGI: ""Intelligence is the measure of an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments."" . Shane Legg's paper: [Universal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3329) .

I'll go further and say for us to truly say we have achieved AGI your agent/system needs to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence (Shane's definition). Your agent / system will need to pass the **Total Turing Test** (as described in AIMA) which is:

1. Natural Language Processing: To enable it to communicate successfully in multiple languages.
2. Knowledge Representation: To store what it knows or hears.
3. Automated Reasoning: To use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions.
4. Machine Learning to: Adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
5. Computer Vision: To perceive objects.
6. Robotics: To manipulate objects and move about.

""Turing’s test deliberately avoided direct physical interaction between the interrogator and the computer, because physical simulation of a person was (at that time) unnecessary for intelligence. However, TOTAL TURING TEST the so-called total Turing Test includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject’s perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects.”

So for me the **Total Turing Test** is the real goalpost to see if we have achieved AGI.",ThePurpleRainmakerr,1gpqbjy,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gpqbjy/what_is_agi_and_who_gets_to_decide_what_agi_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gpqbjy/what_is_agi_and_who_gets_to_decide_what_agi_is/,2024-11-12 17:35:00,1,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gpqbjy

artificial,How will the rising tide of Western leadership deal with AI DEVELOPMENT ,"

My biggest worry right now is that there will be less support to help people adapt to current changes, which is leading to an increase in homelessness and poverty on an unprecedented scale. Some people are even calling this the second Gilded Age.

We need ways to help people stay afloat, such as guaranteed income, but the incoming administration has been strongly opposed to this.

I am also concerned that, while I don’t think the current U.S. leadership will do much to regulate the development of artificial intelligence, they might actually remove existing safeguards, allowing AI to develop faster but with potentially more risks. However, I don’t expect any efforts to address rising poverty as more people lose their jobs to automation.

For those who believe that AI hasn’t yet impacted employment, consider that it's already a better tutor than most educators and has disrupted the freelancing industry.

As a freelancer, I’ve seen this firsthand—AI has significantly reduced opportunities in our field and driven down wages. While this may benefit workers in lower-cost regions, it’s challenging for those in the U.S. who are struggling to make ends meet.

artificial,Finding Comfort in Code: AI Companions Are Becoming Our Emotional Support Buddies?,"In recent years, AI companions have evolved from simple chatbots to highly advanced virtual beings capable of offering emotional support. These digital friends are now helping millions of people deal with feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and stress. Whether it's through a late-night conversation or personalized words of encouragement, AI companions can provide a comforting presence when friends or family aren't available. This rise in AI companionship offers an exciting new way to seek emotional support, with many users finding it surprisingly effective.

AI companions work by learning from each interaction with the user. Over time, they start to """"understand"""" individual preferences, moods, and topics that bring comfort. This personalization allows AI companions to act as more than just a chatbot, offering empathy and support in times of need. The bond some users develop with their AI companions can feel genuine, especially when the AI is able to remember past conversations and adapt its responses to match the user’s emotional needs.

However, there are concerns around the dependency some may develop on their AI companions. Relying too heavily on a digital friend could lead to isolation or a reduced willingness to seek real-life connections. While AI companions can be beneficial for emotional support, it’s essential to balance these interactions with real-world relationships. With AI technology continuing to grow, understanding the best ways to use these tools responsibly is crucial.",Naomi_Myers01,1gmimql,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gmimql/finding_comfort_in_code_ai_companions_are/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gmimql/finding_comfort_in_code_ai_companions_are/,2024-11-08 13:34:02,3,0.61,3,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gmimql

artificial,LLM overkill is real: I analyzed 12 benchmarks to find the right-sized model for each use case 🤖,"hey there!

With the recent explosion of open-source models and benchmarks, I noticed many newcomers struggling to make sense of it all. So I built a simple ""model matchmaker"" to help beginners understand what matters for different use cases.

TL;DR: After building two popular LLM price comparison tools (4,000+ users), [WhatLLM](https://whatllm.vercel.app/) and [LLM API Showdown](https://llmshowdown.vercel.app/), I created something new: [LLM Selector](https://llmselector.vercel.app/)

✓  It’s a tool that helps you find the perfect open-source model for your specific needs.  
✓  Currently analyzing 11 models across 12 benchmarks (and counting). 

While building the first two, I realized something: before thinking about providers or pricing, people need to find the right model first. With all the recent releases choosing the right model for your specific use case has become surprisingly complex.

\## The Benchmark puzzle

We've got metrics everywhere:

* Technical: HumanEval, EvalPlus, MATH, API-Bank, BFCL
* Knowledge: MMLU, GPQA, ARC, GSM8K
* Communication: ChatBot Arena, MT-Bench, IF-Eval

For someone new to AI, it's not obvious which ones matter for their specific needs.

\## A simple approach

Instead of diving into complex comparisons, the tool:

1. Groups benchmarks by use case
2. Weighs primary metrics 2x more than secondary ones
3. Adjusts for basic requirements (latency, context, etc.)
4. Normalizes scores for easier comparison

Example: Creative Writing Use Case 

Let's break down a real comparison:

Input: - Use Case: Content Generation  
Requirement: Long Context Support  
How the tool analyzes this:  
1. Primary Metrics (2x weight): - MMLU: Shows depth of knowledge - ChatBot Arena: Writing capability  
2. Secondary Metrics (1x weight): - MT-Bench: Language quality - IF-Eval: Following instructions  
Top Results:  
1. Llama-3.1-70B (Score: 89.3)  
• MMLU: 86.0% • ChatBot Arena: 1247 ELO • Strength: Balanced knowledge/creativity  
2. Gemma-2-27B (Score: 84.6) • MMLU: 75.2% • ChatBot Arena: 1219 ELO • Strength: Efficient performance

Important Notes 

\- V1 with limited models (more coming soon)   
\- Benchmarks ≠ real-world performance (and this is an example calculation)  
\- Your results may vary   
\- Experienced users: consider this a starting point   
\- Open source models only for now  
\- just added one api provider for now, will add the ones from my previous apps and combine them all

artificial,Safety rating and testing for self driving cars,"While virtually everyone agrees self driving will save lives due to elimination of drunk driving, road rage, and human added factors that can injure or kill others. There is no government at this time working on a test that self driving cars need to pass to legally drive on the road. Note I'm focusing on level 5 full automation. 

Feel free to share this around, but this is what I came up with. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As mentioned, we are going to focus purely on conditions where the user can't control the car or isn't expected to control the car. This being even if there is a wheel in place or not. We are talking about level 5. 

  
Because we are talking about a car that can fully drive itself. If there is no method for the user to take over the car in an emergency situation. Then in my opinion, the car by law should have an emergency stop button. This button should be:

* Easily identifiable and accessible.
* Protected to prevent accidental activation.
* Programmed to initiate a controlled stop and transmit a distress signal.

This button must be standardized so if you jump in any self driving car, you know exactly where to look, and what to do in the case of an emergency. 



Beyond the emergency stop mechanism, clear categorization of Level 5 capabilities is crucial for consumer understanding and informed decision-making. These categories should be prominently displayed in marketing materials, owner's manuals, and any other consumer-facing information. The following categories are proposed:

* **City Driving:** This category addresses the complex and unpredictable nature of urban driving. Testing should encompass navigating dense traffic, pedestrian and cyclist interactions, complex intersections, variable speed limits, and adherence to city-specific traffic laws. Evaluation should also include the vehicle's ability to handle challenging scenarios like double-parked vehicles, construction zones, and emergency vehicle responses.
* **Highway Driving:** Highway driving presents its own set of challenges, including high speeds, merging and lane changes in heavy traffic, and reacting to sudden slowdowns or stopped vehicles. Testing should focus on maintaining safe following distances, appropriate lane changes, and responding to unexpected events such as debris on the roadway or sudden lane closures. Performance in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow should also be rigorously evaluated.
* **Off-Road Driving:** While seemingly less complex due to the absence of dense traffic, off-road driving necessitates the ability to navigate unpredictable terrain, including uneven surfaces, obstacles like rocks and trees, and challenging weather conditions like mud and snow. This is relevant not only for specialized applications like farming, construction, and search and rescue, but also for navigating unpaved roads, private driveways, and parking lots in inclement weather. Testing should include scenarios like traversing steep inclines and declines, navigating around obstacles, and maintaining stability on loose surfaces.

A robust and multi-layered testing process is essential to validate the safety and reliability of Level 5 autonomous vehicles. This process should encompass the following:

* **Cybersecurity Testing:** This is paramount to safeguarding the vehicle's systems from malicious attacks that could compromise safety. Testing should involve penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in both the software and hardware components of the self-driving system. Specific standards should mandate the isolation of the autonomous driving system from other vehicle systems like entertainment and navigation to minimize the potential attack surface. Regular security updates and vulnerability patching protocols should also be established.
* **Virtual Simulation Testing:** Virtual simulations provide a safe and controlled environment to expose the autonomous driving system to a vast range of scenarios. These simulations can replicate real-world environments with high fidelity, incorporating various weather conditions, traffic patterns, and unexpected events like tire blowouts, sensor failures, and sudden obstructions in the roadway. Automated testing programs should be utilized to execute a massive number of test cases, covering a wide range of scenarios and edge cases, accelerating the testing process and improving test coverage. Advanced simulation platforms should be developed, building on existing tools and leveraging technologies like game engines, to create highly realistic and customizable testing environments.
* **Physical Road Testing:** Following successful completion of cybersecurity and virtual simulation testing, physical road testing in controlled environments and eventually on public roads is necessary to validate real-world performance. This testing should encompass many of the scenarios covered in virtual simulations, but under real-world conditions. Data collected from physical road tests should be used to further refine the autonomous driving system and ensure its safe and reliable operation in a wide range of real-world situations.
