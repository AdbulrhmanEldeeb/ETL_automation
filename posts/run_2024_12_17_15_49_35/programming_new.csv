programming,My snake game got to 57 bytes by just messing around and basically refactoring most of the code,"This byte reduction was different than the others.

Usually, I have an idea in mind of how to reduce a byte and I try to manipulate the code to make it work.


This time I was bored so I looked at the code again just because I wanted to remove the usage of the BP register because I thought ""it had potential"", you can see the PR where I managed to do so without increasing the byte count [here](https://github.com/donno2048/snake/pull/68), then after quite some time I realized a way to abuse this in such a way that would use another register (DX) to store some values without adding any bytes and thought it has some potential too because the DX initialization takes 3 bytes and could maybe be reduced somehow...

I merged the PR as it made the game a little slower even though it didn't save any bytes because I couldn't think of a way to optimize the initialization of DX, but then I realized that the initialization of DX isn't the problem, it's the solution to another problem.

The way I initialized AX up until now was with a `MOV` which is quite a waste to just set AX to 0, but I had to use a `MOV` for the `LDS` initialization, because the first byte of the `MOV` was 0xB8, but if I initialized DX there I would solve the problem and I would be able to set AX in less than 3 bytes.


The problem is that `MOV DX,` won't have 0xB8 at the beginning so I have to use `MOV AX,`, but no problem, I can initialize AX to the value I want in DX and do a `XCHG`, but then I'm left with just one byte to set AX to 0 which is impossible (and that was the reason I didn't commit that into the original PR). 

But, then I realized, we can set `DX` to 0 with just 1 byte so that after the `XCHG` AX will already contain 0.

I planted a `CWD` right between the `MOV` and the `XCHG` so that DX will be set to the MSB of the wanted value in DX which is positive so the MSB is 0.

I reverted the changes made from the first PR and merged the [new one](https://github.com/donno2048/snake/pull/69).

BTW, this time I couldn't just use the 0x0 dummy byte as that would set DX wrongly, so I had to use `LDS DI, [BX+SI+0x0]` which apparently can't be parsed correctly by nasm even with `-O0` because it always drops the 0x0, so I had to hardcode it.",Perfect-Highlight964,1h89eyl,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h89eyl/my_snake_game_got_to_57_bytes_by_just_messing/,https://github.com/donno2048/snake,2024-12-06 19:23:50,760,0.94,760,0,79,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h89eyl

programming,This PR replaces is-number package with a one-liner with identical code. Author argues this tiny change saves 440GB weekly traffic. JavaScript micro-package debate ,"A debate occurred between the author of the is-number package (and is-odd, is-even, and 1500more) and a PR author over micro-libraries. https://github.com/micromatch/to-regex-range/pull/17


The PR proposed replacing the 'is-number' package with its inline code. While the code is &lt;1KB, the full package with README/license is ~10KB. With 70M weekly downloads, this simple change saves 440GB of npm bandwidth weekly.

The author of 'is-number' called the PR ""useless"" - despite it being his own code just moved inline. Some of his other packages include 'is-odd' which depends on 'is-even' which depends on... you guessed it, 'is-number'.

The debate:
Pro micro-packages: Well-tested, auto-updates, saves dev time
Against: Security risks, fragile dependencies (remember left-pad?), unnecessary bloat

TL;DR: JavaScript's micro-package ecosystem might be getting out of hand. Sometimes the simplest solution is just writing the code yourself. Or standards library when?

programming,Announcing rust-query: Safe relational database queries using the Rust type system,"[rust-query](https://github.com/LHolten/rust-query) is a new type-safe database library for Rust that provides an alternative to traditional SQL by deeply integrating with Rust's type system, offering compile-time guarantees for database operations without requiring direct SQL writing. The library features explicit table aliasing, null safety through Rust's Option type, intuitive aggregates that guarantee single results per joined row, type-safe foreign key navigation and unique lookups, multi-versioned schema support with type-safe migrations, and encapsulated row IDs tied to transaction lifetimes, all while using SQLite as its backend database engine. It allows developers to write database queries that feel native to Rust, with the schema defined using enum syntax that generates the necessary database API code, enabling safe and intuitive database interactions with strong compile-time checks.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",Balance-,1h4dovu,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h4dovu/announcing_rustquery_safe_relational_database/,https://blog.lucasholten.com,2024-12-01 21:12:34,16,0.7,16,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h4dovu

programming,New language: Universal Scripting Language (.usl) ," 

Hi there,

I‚Äôm custom rom-developing my watch. I‚Äôm at the point where the scripts are written and I‚Äôm learning vscode to implement the build. 

I‚Äôm a leading global researcher for multiple domains such as AI, science, biomedical development, blah de fucking blah. No one cares. 

I‚Äôve invented a new coding language called Universal Scripting Language. (.usl), that can utilize 400+ coding languages in one setup. It got its MIT license, so I don‚Äôt know if I need the Apache 2.0 as well but, whatever happy to have both if needed. I‚Äôm building the IDE currently with scheduling and automation built in. The first test was to see if it could run itself which it did. Very cool to see. I think I recorded that part. It‚Äôll be used within my watch build in some really cool ways. I hope you‚Äôll find it interesting. I‚Äôm including the interpreter and translation software into the watch so you can mod to your hearts content and help develop cool shit. 
I‚Äôve got the syntax ready and the beginnings of an O-Reilly-inspired book for it in the works. 

Anyway. Would anyone be interested in the progress of this? I‚Äôm a literal shutin who‚Äôs bedridden often with muscular dystrophy and schizoaffective disorder but I‚Äôm also happy to show how it‚Äôs coming along. It‚Äôs designed to help you live as long as possible. I have trouble with hallucinations and being unable to sleep (no rem anymore) and working is all I know how to do. I can‚Äôt seem to work normally anymore. 

If I could figure out a way to make a living creating cool shit I think I have the production gear to do a legit series on it, if you would like a video or podcast I‚Äôve done both. Streaming is doable but I can‚Äôt talk while working. It lets you listen to music or online stuff. I would just need to ask for some guidance on what you would like to see, what to look out for‚Äîcommunity stuff. 

After the watch is released, artificial kidneys are ready as are universal donor blood types from any stem cell. I‚Äôm just a bit stuck in my house at the moment. (Sorry if this is meandering‚Äîmental illness is hard to explain through.)

Thanks.
