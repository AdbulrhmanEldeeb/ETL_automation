movies,Question about the movie Die Hard (1988),"
In the movie Die Hard John McClane spends 30+ minutes trying to alert the police that there’s a hostage situation at Nakatomi Plaza. When they finally arrive and set up a perimeter, he seems quite relieved but once he observes the police get ready to enter the building he immediately switches to aggravated and criticizes them saying “no, no, you macho assholes.” and radios down something about “I told you what kind of guys you’re dealing with!” He even seems exasperated when they try to breach the building with the armored vehicle. 

I guess I’m having a hard time following the logic. Did I miss something? What kind of response was he expecting? 

The only thing I could come up with was he was expecting some kind of negotiation scenario.

movies,The Holdovers Was A Christmas Surprise,"If you're looking for a new Christmas movie to put on this season and haven't watched the Holdovers, I'd highly recommend it.  I put it on later at night, after watching a show for some background noise and ended up being pulled in with its funny but comforting atmosphere.

I'm not a huge fan of Alexander Payne his movies tend to be enjoyable but nothing that really stands out, but the chemistry here in The Holdovers works really well.  I'm in-between the ages of the younger student Angus and the older mentor Paul, so I could see it from both sides.  People coming to terms with their lives and the people they may or may not want in them.  Even the cook Mary gives us a great perspective on the outside looking in on these characters lives and why everyone is important and has a story.

movies,“Nintendo Deer Hunter 3”,"It’s that time of year again when I feel the compulsion to put forth that Bad Santa is not only the greatest Christmas movie of all time but an American Movie classic worthy of being in the same discussion as Godfather II, Citizen Kane, Goodfellas etc..etc. The cast is impeccable with zero misses, everyone of the actors brings their A-game and are hitting homers left and right. In my humble opinion this results in best career performances by a number of these actors including Thornton, Scott, Ritter, Bernie Mac, Leachman (who barely speaks) and of course The Kid. The quotable quotes are present in every scene “I’m 92 pounds you asshole”, “you know, thin fingers not fat sausage fingers” “ass clown” “I slept with an unclean woman” etc.. the list goes on. This is one of those movies that combines a unique and extremely compelling premise with great comedic performances and mixes in just enough heart to give it perfect balance. The 91 minute runtime is another feather in its cap as we are seemingly plagued by 2.5 hour or more run times in everything that’s come out in the last 10 or 15 years.

I’m 99% sure it was also released with a release date for part 2 slated for March 2024. Well it’s now blown past that. 

Now in the last week come two more news drops. One that we can now not expect part 2 until “At least” 2026 and that also Miles Morales voice actor has not even recorded any lines but not even just that, he hasn’t even got a clue about a script or been approached about coming back yet.

movies,Why is Frank Darabont underappreciated? ,"Frank Darabont is a fantastic filmmaker. 

The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are considered cinematic classics. They are also both crowd pleasers - it's funny, I've yet to meet anyone that has a bad word to say about either film! 

Aside from this, The Mist (also based on a Steven King story) is considered a beloved contemporary horror film. With arguably one of the greatest endings in horror film history. 

He made the wonderful 2001 film The Majestic. An underrated spellbinding Jim Carey drama. 

He was the show runner on The Walking Dead - which saw huge early success, thanks to his efforts - before stepping down prematurely. He was also the show runner on Mob City, an underappreciated (and sadly cancelled) period gangster drama. 

He was the writer on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Tales from the Crypt, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, The Blob remake, and Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. 

He's directed episodes of The Shield and the upcoming final season of Stranger Things. 

But through all this acclaim, and with such a robust and impressive resume, he's not a household name. Even among cinephiles - such as you and I - his name is not lauded as much as I feel it should be. 

I know he's become somewhat disillusioned with Hollywood and has taken a step back. However, this shouldn't stop him from achieving more love, more reverence, more accolades. 

So, I ask you why? Why is Frank Darabont underappreciated? 

In fact...do you even think he is?! Perhaps it's just me. 

But I believe he belongs in a pantheon of under appreciated filmmakers with an infamous body of work. Robert Zemeckis, John Badham, possibly even John Millius.

movies,"So, I watched Lord of the Rings: The War of Rohirrim","I watched it yesterday in Germany with English dub. I have to say I was positively surprised, tough it was definitely not perfect.

There was a lot of stuff me and my nerds liked. Mostly the low-fantasy-story itself and how well it fit into the lore and how respectful it was with the source. There were lots of tiny anecdotes to the og-movies, that were easily missed if it weren't for us to point them out after the movie. The characters are all likeable and believable. The protagonist is no Marry Sue, but there is also not a lot of growth, more just problems to avoid and solve, but because she is no demi-god, like Legolas, she fits very nicely and tension is definitely there.

But the same can not be said about her father, the first big negative point in this movie. He starts of strong, good King, leader, makes great decisions and so on. He even wears a helmet, wish his sons would have done the same, would definitely helped one of them. Spoiler:&gt;!But when they reach Gondor, he becomes a bit weird. More or less a demi-god who can take pushes from giant beasts, give punches that kill a man and not freeze to death in the cold winter for days, walking around half naked. It felt a bit like a peasant who would retell the story and did not fit in this very low-fantasy story.!&lt;

Now the biggest negative, the animation. If you know the original animation from 1978, you definitely see some parallels. Why? Because I am very sure it is rotorscoped. The absence of of motion blur is very confusing for the eyes in the first 20 minutes. There is some instances, where it definitely shows. The backgrounds are very close to the original. But they are often also very weak, but I rather have them save on backgrounds, than anywhere else.

Now even tough this sounds very negative in total, I must point out it is still a lovely movie. My friends and me agreed it was enjoyable and a positive experience, be it the one guy who never saw the original movies or the other who literally read the Silmarillion. I am almost certain this movie will get bashed to bits from critics, but I encourage you to watch and make your own picture, because I am pretty sure many of you will enjoy just like we did.

movies,Found Something Shady,"Recently, someone promoted their short film/feature film (https://youtu.be/5Wbu1eEeMCw). The said person stated that the said film has won so many awards, that he can't even remember, including Cannes Film Festival awards &amp; New York Film Festival awards (in plurals).

This tingled my spider senses, and I tried to scan the internet for the same.

I found that the maker of the film has made multiple social media posts claiming the same, both on his studio's Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/arjunpicturesprod?igsh=MTc5bDhtazJhMWxreA==) as well as on YouTube (https://youtube.com/@arjunpicturespvtltd).

He made similar claims for his new project, too (#KK).

Upon a closure look, I found that both ""World Film Festivals in Cannes"" (https://www.instagram.com/worldfilmfestivalincannes?igsh=MXR1ZG0wZGNrNXJ0bA==) &amp; ""New York International Film Awards"" (https://www.instagram.com/newyorkintfilmawards?igsh=MWJjM2swcWtzajd0cA==) are completely unrelated to Cannes Film Festival &amp; New York Film Festival, respectively, and in my opinion, seems to be trying to impersonate/ imitate and/or to mislead people into thinking that they are the real ones.

These are their so-called websites as well: 
https://newyorkinternationalfilmawards.com/

Now, my query is, can these entities impersonate the likeness of the real ones this easily? Is this even allowed?

movies,"John Wick, Equalizer &amp; dumb henchmen - do you enjoy them?","Hey!

There are countless examples in addition to the ones mentioned above, not only in movies but also TV-shows like Punisher and Daredevil. The hero enters room of 20 henchmen, who either don't know how to aim with a gun or for some reason run towards the hero with their gun so they can easily be disarmed and killed. Or they stand in a circle around the hero, taking turns to attack instead of ganging up.

The colour temperature is mostly warm (orange). And finally the closing song kicks off with the lyrics: feels like fire""

movies,Just finished Oblivion. Legitimately really enjoyed it.,"I'm not going to sit here and say it was the best movie ever. Nor do I have any knowledge about the books the movie is based on. But I had a lot of fun with the movie. (This is my first movie review, plus I'm pretty tired, so I apologize in advance for how disjointed it may feel)

I'll start with what I disliked, which honestly wasn't much:
There were issues with the pacing and the dialogue, I found some performances a little stilted, and some twists were more expected than others (the Tet being evil was obvious from the get go).

As for the positives:
Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, and Morgan Freeman delivered great performances I thought. I found myself actually being super absorbed in the plot, and it wasn't too difficult to follow (like a lot of sci-fi can be), which I liked. I think what everyone can agree on when it comes to this movie is that both the score and the visuals were absolutely top notch. The fact that the movie came out in 2013 blows my mind a little. 

Overall, I thought the movie was a solid 8/10. I can't say I'm totally sure why the movie gets as much hate as it does. Who knows? Maybe I just enjoyed it because I'm a huge Tron fan, and this feels similar.

I recently watched *The Bra* (2018), and I absolutely loved its calm and slow-paced storytelling, almost like a visual melody. The movie had no dialogue, yet it managed to say so much through its visuals, pacing, and atmosphere.

I find these kinds of films really captivating—ones that focus on visual storytelling, subtle emotions, and minimalism, without relying on spoken words. They’re almost meditative to watch.

I’m hoping to discover more films in a similar vein. Do you know of any other calm, slow-paced movies—preferably dialogue-free or with very little dialogue—that evoke a similar feeling?

One question I may have just missed:

Does it ever explain why Cage is railroaded so hard and basically sent to death when he seems to be quite the successful recruiter/PR guy?

And a theoretical question:

Any theories as to why they don’t just hunt more alphas for alpha blood to gain the power again? While Cage still has the power he says to Rita “Go find an alpha, kill it, get blood in your mouth (lol) so you get the powers. If you aren’t back in X amount of hours hours with a successful mission I’ll kill myself and we try again”. Then the one with the most recent save point (I assume if they die they go back in time to when the other would still have the power?) goes on the omega hunting mission until success or until they lose their power. If she loses the power during a mission Cage kills himself and gets Rita the power again by repeating the process.

movies,Queer (2024) - Help settle a debate,"So my bsf and I just saw Luca's new film, *Queer*. We both enjoyed it but found ourselves getting into a disagreement over a pretty big plot point.

  
To start, I should say that I *literally* just finished reading Burrough's novel a couple of hours before we saw the movie. It was so fresh in my mind that I could quote half of the movie as it was happening. Throughout the book, I was struck by how unreciprocated Lee's love/lust/obsession for Allerton was. Allerton seemed extremely passive in their relationship, never initiating anything sexual or physical. There is a moment where Allerton expresses that he likes the sex sometimes after Lee asks, but this is starkly juxtaposed to all the times when Allerton appears to be disgusted or annoyed with Lee's sexual advances. I honestly feel confident in saying I think Allerton is straight and the only reason he sometimes likes the sex is because of the stimulation. I also definitely think that there is no chance that Allerton loved (or even liked) Lee back.

  
Anyways, I went into the movie with the expectation that their story would be relatively the same. And generally, it was very similar. However, I came away with a very different interpretation of their relationship. This is where my opinion diverges from my friend (who has not read the book).

  
To her, the movie is about Lee being a creep to a straight boy. She looks at the one or two moments where Allerton outright shies or rejects Lee's touch as evidence for this. She thinks that Allerton is ""definitely straight"" and only finds pleasure in sex with Lee because it's sex (very similar to my interpretation of the book). Additionally, she believes that Allerton leaving Lee in the forest is indicative of a lack of passion and care from Allerton's side.

  
I could not have a more different view. I think it is very clear that Allerton not only genuinely enjoys sex with Lee specifically, but also is in love with him. The reciprocation of lust is really obvious in the two in-detail sex scenes we get. During the first scene, Allerton seems happy to kiss Lee back and get a BJ, and when he's finished he instantly starts to get Lee off, something we never see Allerton take the initiative to do in the book. In the second scene, when Lee and Allerton are in the hotel, Lee touches his ribs as a way to start sex. In the book, Allerton shooed Lee away and only conceded to having sex when he was reminded that he 'owed' Lee for the week. In the movie, Allerton seemed very into everything happening and seemed blissed out afterward. I also think, throughout the film, the little smiles, content looks, and casual affection sometimes shown, indicates that he also feels love for Lee. I believe this love is repressed and he does not want to acknowledge it. This is why he leaves Lee, because they just had an experience where they were truly able to be together because of the drugs, and now he doesn't know how to deal with those intense feelings and so he runs.

We can’t come to an agreement. What do you guys think?

* Jim and Aurora have kids, and how would those kids have dealt with their lives? Would they have resented their situation and sabotaged the ship? Also, if they don't wake up other passengers, there could be a risk of inbreeding!
* What if Jim and Aurora decided to wake up more passengers but ended up waking the wrong ones and it backfires when the new passengers are hostile?
* The movie shows Aurora forgiving Jim, but realistically, forgiveness isn’t that simple. What if she grew bitter over the years and sought revenge?
* Jim passes away, leaving Aurora alone. She is unable to figure out how to wake another passenger like Jim did. Over time, she goes mad and maybe commits suicide. Yikes, that would be scary!
* The entire passenger population wakes up far too early. With limited resources, the ship descends into chaos, leading to starvation, riots, and widespread death.
* The darkest scenario I imagined is the ship malfunctioning, trapping everyone inside with no way out. They’d be awake but unable to escape, turning the ship into a floating prison.
* Cannibalism: If resources become critically scarce, they face unimaginable choices, including cannibalism if one dies or if hostility arises among awakened passengers.

movies,Why don't they (seem to) make movies like Austin Powers anymore?,"This is obviously a subjective claim, but it seems to me like goofy parodies like Austin Powers, the Scary Movie franchise, Shrek, etc. have gone entirely away. I'm just wondering if anyone else feels that way, and why that might be?

Today, I was listening to a Quincy Jones album and my girlfriend walked in and said it sounded like Austin Powers music, and I told her sure as shit it totally was! Then we sat down and watched Goldmember from start to finish and our faces were about numb from laughing. I just really appreciated the crafting that went into the bits and Mike Myers' ability to blend subtle comedic moments with totally over the top scenes. The film was full of cameos (OMG, Beyoncé!), people making fun of themselves and each other-- and above all, it was funny but not at all in a dark way, like some recent films I've really enjoyed ('Don't Look Up' is what comes immediately to mind). 

So, I'm wondering where this type of film is in today's world? I understand there is a certain level of nostalgia involved in writing this post. But I think there's something else there too. My girlfriend and I discussed it, and clearly there are some jokes that probably wouldn't make it today, but I also feel there is plenty to make fun of in today's films/tv that would absolutely hit with audiences. I've seen some satires lately which I found incredibly funny (thinking 'The Curse' [Showtime], or 'White Lotus' [HBO]) but what makes these hilarious is the examination they do on the self conscious behaviors of entitled people, and that can get pretty dark. Every commedy I've seen in the last decade or so has been this way-- good but more cerebral, and certainly calling social mores into question.

Anyway, I guess I just haven't seen a good parody in a while, and I'm wondering why not. If you have a suggestion, please please let me know, I'm dying for some decent stuff right now. SNL is a bit hit and miss for me, but it's about the only thing I can think of that makes fun of modern trends in life/politics/media without getting very heavy. And please pardon me if I'm ranting-- I'm happy to go back and watch my turn-of-the-millenium parodies by myself if nobody else cares for them!

movies,"December 13-15 Box Office Recap: 'Kraven the Hunter' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' massively flop. Meanwhile, 'Moana 2' crosses $700 million worldwide, and 'Interstellar' finally crosses $200 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/xi19z0g5ta7e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f

The man finally came around.

***Moana 2*** was still on top of the box office, although the gap between it and ***Wicked*** is becoming smaller. We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures. ***Kraven the Hunter*** ended the SSU on a new low, while ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** finished outside the Top 5. In limited release, ***Nickel Boys*** had a solid start, while ***September 5*** disappointed.

The Top 10 earned a combined $87.6 million this weekend. That's up 27% from last year, when ***Wonka*** debuted on top.

***Moana 2*** threepeated on the top spot, earning $26.4 million. That's a 48% drop, which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop. After a record-breaking opening weekend, the legs are proving to be quite front-loaded. The film has earned $337.3 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $500 million domestically. And depending on how much it drops against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***, it could miss $450 million domestically.

***Wicked*** was still on second place, but it's getting close to ***Moana 2***. It earned $22.6 million this weekend, which was just 38% down from last weekend. The film has amassed $359.1 million, and it's now poised to earn more domestically than ***Moana 2***. It could start overtaking it next weekend, assuming it doesn't have a bad drop against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***.

Debuting in third place, ***Kraven the Hunter*** flopped with just $11 million in 3,211 theaters. That's the worst debut in the SSU (Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe), and one of the worst for a Marvel property. Hell, it even debuted below ***Kick-Ass*** ($19 million), another R-rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

This is not really a surprise. I mean, where do we start?

The SSU has earned a cumulative $2.1 billion worldwide. But the *Venom* films account for $1.83 billion of that, which is like 86% of its gross. The other two films, ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***, were critical and commercial duds, becoming Internet's laughingstock. Even the ***Venom*** films are already losing good will among the general audience. Basically, it's a universe with absolutely nothing to offer, where the bar keeps going lower and lower. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times...

But how could ***Kraven*** open below ***Madame Web***? On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released, ***Kraven*** barely felt like a comic book movie. The trailers emphasized brutal action, but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks. The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider-Man, yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story. With no signs of Spider-Man.

For some reason, Sony decided that ***Kraven*** warranted a big budget. The film was originally set at $90 million, which rose to $110 million due to the strikes (although some reports say that it actually cost $130 million). That's almost on par with the previous ***Venom*** film, and it's way too high for a C-lister. Especially when they made it R-rated. Sony is aware that this universe isn't working; [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kraven-the-hunter-sony-marvel-universe-spider-man-box-office/) reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe, choosing to focus on ***Spider-Man 4***, ***Beyond the Spider-Verse*** and the ***Spider-Noir*** series. They admitted defeat before the film even came out.

There was some slight hope that J.C. Chandor's presence would also lead to a competent film. But that was not the case; it's currently at an awful 15% on RT. Nothing but a paycheck. 

According to Sony, 71% of the audience was male, which is higher than usual for a comic book title. 40% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a horrible ""C"" on CinemaScore, which is even worse than ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***. If you think these numbers look bad, just wait for the second weekend drop. Even with the holiday season, it's unlikely ***Kraven*** can hit $30 million domestically. A comparison could be ***Star Trek: Nemesis***, which also opened on December 13. After disappointing with $18 million, it closed with just $43 million. If it follows the same trajectory, ***Kraven*** will finish with just $25 million. Yike.

After its rough drop, ***Gladiator II*** slightly recovered. It dropped 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. Looks like ***Kraven*** barely had an impact. The film has earned $145.7 million, and it should finish with close to $170 million.

Barely cracking the Top 5 was ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, which flopped with just $4.5 million this weekend. There's no point in even comparing it to the ***Lord of the Rings*** trilogy, which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend.

While ***The Lord of the Rings*** is a massively popular franchise, there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel. To understand how anime has a ceilling; last year, ***The Boy and the Heron***, with all the buzz it could achieve, made $46 million domestically. That's far less than what other animated films can earn. Warner Bros. knew this couldn't be a big moneymaker, which is why they only spent $30 million on the film, and released it in just 2,602 theaters.

It has been reported that the film's existence was fast-tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien's novels. Although with the recent announcement of a ***Hunt for Gollum*** film coming in 2026, it was clear ***Rohirrim*** wouldn't really be a priority. If people were on the fence over this film, the film's middling reviews (51% on RT) indicated that this wasn't worth it.

According to Warner Bros., 68% of the audience was male and 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a lukewarm ""B"" on CinemaScore, far worse than any Middle-Earth film. This is not gonna last long in theaters; it'd be a surprise if this earned over $15 million lifetime.

Despite being available on Prime Video, ***Red One*** dropped just 39% this weekend, adding $4.2 million. The film has earned $92.4 million, and it's fighting to hit $100 million.

It took 10 years, but Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** has crossed $200 million domestically. The IMAX re-release added $3.6 million, which was just 21% down from last weekend. Fantastic all around.

***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** fell 67% this weekend, adding $1.6 million and taking its domestic total to $13 million.

***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** eased just 14% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $36.6 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer***, which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend. That allowed it to increase again, earning $790,954. The film's domestic total stands at $1.9 million, and it will need some Oscar buzz here.

***Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem*** finished outside the Top 10 with $737K during the weekend ($2.3 million four-day).

A24's ***Y2K*** lost 160 theaters and fell 68%, earning $684,957 this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $3.7 million, and it's gonna miss $5 million.

Paramount released ***September 5***, an awards hopeful, into 7 theaters. But the film earned $80,802, which translates to a very underwhelming $11,543 per-theater average. The film will expand nationwide on January 17, 2025, but this is a very weak start.

Amazon MGM's ***Nickel Boys*** debuted in 2 theaters, and earned $54,794 this weekend. That's a solid $27,397 per-theater average, and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl*** debuted in one single screen, earning $50,300 this weekend. That's a fantastic per-theater average, making it the fifth highest of the year. It will hit nationwide in January.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** was once again topping the overseas box office. It added $57 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $716.8 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), UK ($33.5M), Germany ($24.8M), Mexico ($23.5M) and Brazil ($21.1M). It's gonna the billion milestone, but it's taking some time in getting there.

***Wicked*** added $21.5 million, and its worldwide total is now $525 million. It debuted in Germany with $4 million, which is the best for a Broadway film. The film's best markets are the UK ($55.2M), Australia ($20.1M), Korea ($12M), Mexico ($9M) and Philippines ($5M). It will hit its final market, Japan, on February.

***Kraven the Hunter*** also flopped overseas. It earned just $15 million, taking its worldwide debut to just $26 million. For comparison, ***Madame Web*** earned $49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just $100 million. There's a strong chance ***Kraven*** finishes below $60 million worldwide.

After missing the mark domestically, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** also flopped overseas, earning only $4 million overseas. That's a paltry $9.9 million worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Smile 2* | Oct/18 | Paramount | $23,021,692 | $68,967,012 | $137,991,092 | $28M

- Paramount's ***Smile 2*** has closed with $137 million worldwide. While that's a 37% drop from the original, it's still a box office success. Reception as a whole was much better than the first, with Naomi Scott earning praise for her performance. ***Smile 3: This Time It's Personal*** should be coming anytime now.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

***Moana 2*** will cede the top spot, and it's a battle between a lion and a hedgehog.

Disney is releasing ***Mufasa: The Lion King***, five years after the 2019 remake earned over $1.6 billion worldwide. Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins, and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar. This is a strong IP, but this is uncharted territories, given that this is a completely new story with new songs. It's not gonna come anywhere close to that $1.6 billion gross, but we'll see how much it can make.

The other release is ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3***. The franchise is going strong, and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow, which drew hype among the Internet. The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film, and the pre-sales look very strong so far. With the holiday corridor, another increase is pretty much imminent.

In limited release, A24 is opening Brady Corbet's ***The Brutalist***. It stars Adrien Brody as László Tóth, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States, where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life. The film has received fantastic reviews so far, and it's poised to become a big Oscar player. Look for a healthy run, even if the 215-minute runtime might be too much for many.

movies,Filmmakers who ended up as a PERFECT match to adapt an IP,"When Peter Jackson decided visual effects technology was good enough to produce an adaptation of *Lord of the Rings*, he began lobbying for the film to get made, thinking *some big name experienced director* should, and would, take up the challenge. Thankfully, that never materialized, and Jackson himself, to his own surprise, ended up in the director's chair. As it turns out, his passion and reverence for Tolkien's beloved classic proved to be the guiding light of the films production. It was Jackson who insisted on maintaining the three book story line as three films, while the studio was pushing for two. It was Jackson who made sure every cast and crew member *had a copy of the LOTR near by*, to consult as the ""Bible"" of the production. It would seem the stars had aligned, and that Peter Jackson was the perfect man for the job, spearheading a groundbreaking production, the most ambitious the world had ever known, shooting all three films simultaneously, a game changer for the industry, and delivering a trilogy that both resounded with a broader audience, and pleased hardcore fans of the source material. 

But as perfect a match Jackson had been to direct *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, there was yet another property even closer to Jackson's heart. As a boy, it was *King Kong* that lit the fire inside him and kindled his desire to become a filmmaker. Peter was obsessed with *King Kong*, and even attempted to re-make the film using home-made stop motion puppets and a super 8 camera as a precocious nine year old boy. It must have felt like destiny, some 35 years later, when Universal entrusted Jackson with their iconic property, and he found himself at the helm of a full fledged two-hundred-million dollar remake of the very film that, for him, started it all. Peter Jackson was born to make *King Kong*.

It's a phenomenon that seems to bend the odds, when a movie director all but manifests that one project that fulfills a lifelong dream. Denis Villeneuve had long desired to adapt the unadaptable masterpiece that is Frank Herbert's *Dune*. He wasn't shy about it either. Indeed, after hearing Denis talk about his vision for translating the labyrinthine text into the language of cinema, fellow director Christopher Nolan said that he knew then and there Villeneuve was the right man for the job, even back before he was a serious candidate. Of course, Villeneuve's spectacular results are the proof that Nolan was right. 

Of all the directors I follow, none speak more eloquently and intelligently about film than Guillermo del Toro. His knowledge is immense, his insight is profound, and I'll listen to any interview I can get my hands on. Anyone who shares my sentiments knows that del Toro is singularly fascinated by one film: James Whale's Frankenstein. For del Toro, Frankenstein is a work of unrivaled pathos and beauty. When he speaks about it, he brings a depth of understanding and appreciation to the picture that one could hardly anticipate. I was elated when I heard he would be directing his own version. 

I believe these are significant moments. They give me hope that there's still some synchronicity at work in this world. That there is plenty of opportunity for us each to find our own moment, when we are perfectly suited for the task in a way unique to ourselves. 

What other movies do you think represent such connections? When the director seemed hand picked by the turn of providence to realize the project they'd always known would be the one?

movies,The handmaiden (2016) needed a third plotwist.,"Watched the movie today. Visually beautiful. The plot is another retelling of the simple story of ‘people in cahoots working together and acting as strangers to fulfill a certain goal.’

The first plotwist was really nice. You don’t see it coming because the first third of the movie is told from the pov of the victim (initially), who is oblivious to the scheme and presented in the bad person light. 

The brief giggle at the asylum door was a very nice misleading touch. It was in my opinion the very scene that made the second plot twist work.

With the way things ended, the movie is nice. A solid 8. But a third plot twist would’ve made things better.

In a hypothetical third act, the count is revealed to be the definitive puppeteer. À la Aizen Sosuke. All along, he is aware of the girls’ intentions to double cross him a certain point. And ends up putting them both in the asylum.

I know it wouldn’t have made sense considering the overreaching theme. The movie is set in patriarchal Korea and Japan, with every male character being a crook, a pervert or both. It’s about women triumphing in a world dominated by men. Women doing without men.

It ends with a joke where Pugsley offers to trade his Amy Fisher card for Joel's Debbie card.

Neil Patrick Harris plays the father of a young girl and he narrates a flashback story about him as a kid hoping to get an NES for Christmas in the 80s and doing everything he could to get his hands on it. The movie has great humor, rarely is a joke just a flat out dud, I laughed out loud several times (which takes a lot) the story is heartwarming, everyone including a bunch of child actors does a great job. For me, this will be a new Christmas classic I'll probably watch every year. I related to a ton of it and it's got so many quick subtle jokes that I'll probably find something new to laugh at every time.

movies,Interpreting the ending of Solaris (1972) (Spoilers!),"I just gave Tarkovsky's Solaris a rewatch. I always interpreted the ending to be that Kris chose to go to the surface of the planet and is now living in the simulation of his memories, for better or for worse. It's simultaneously joyful and sad. On one hand he gets to see embrace his father again and return to a time and place that brought him joy. On the other hand, it's a world of his own memories and who knows what kind of nightmare he can create for himself. A classic ""what dreams may come...."" scenario.

Now I'm wondering if the Kris we see on the island is in fact not the ""real"" Kris at all. Earlier they had broadcast his brain waves to the planet in an attempt to communicate with it. What if the Kris we see at the end is just a duplicate, created by Solaris from his transmitted brain waves? The ""real"" Kris could have decided to return to Earth or to an unknown fate. 

I have not read Lem's book nor seen Soderbergh's version since its release. Do either of those allude to the above possibility?

movies,"Finally Finished. Watched 505 Movies This Year! If Anyone Cares, Here's A Top 5 (Mostly) From Each Decade.","\*Posted in r/moviecritic as well.

As the title says, I made a goal this year to watch 500 movies this year, roughly 40-50 from each decade to broaden my movie horizons, and while it required DAILY dedication, I finally finished today. In fact, I watched 505 as I also viewed a few bonus movies.

I built the list from Best Picture winners from the big award shows. (Academy Awards, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, etc.) I also used every “Top 100” list I could find, and even used a helpful post here on Reddit that compiled the top 250 based on users scores, which helped find foreign movies.

I made a rule for myself that I had to finish every movie, even if I hated it. (Which gave me the chance to change my mind on a few, like “Holy Motors,” etc.)

So, here’s my Top 5 from each decade, except the 20s which only got 4, and the 2000s, which had too many great movies and gets 11. The movies are only listed in order of title length, except the first one, which was the best in my opinion.

Very excited for next year's viewing list, which is the exact opposite of all this critical acclaim and made up of almost exclusively my Arrow Video Boxsets and Vinegar Syndrome purchases. (Although I am only doing 400 for an easier pace.)

\*EDIT\* I did include an image that showed the list of the 505 movies I watched. As I said in comments, if anyone wants the excel file for their own list, let me know and its all yours.

\*EDIT\* I made a mistake with the date for Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I have it listed as 1998, but it is actually 1988. My bad.

He plays as a teacher who was formerly a military 🪖 soldier and used to be a rebellious student and is now teaching a class of troubled teens that were under performing. The stories with these teens had an interesting background. One that lost his parents and living with his grandmother, 2 brothers living with an alcoholic father, a Tomboy girl that wanted her fathers attention, etc. There's even a scene that touches on teen suicide where he went and bought drugs then later jumped off a balcony and landed in a coma which is a sensitive topic and how the father expressing his neglect about his sons, because his wife went off in an affair was very sad too.

Also, the scene where Donnie went and kicked all the MMA fighters butts in a locker room to help rescue his student was an awesome fight scene and the near climatic ending where he fought all those guys invading the school was nice too.

Overall, a decent quality martial arts film.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Vatican City,"Hello there,

this is the last day of my journey through the filmised Europe. Following the official list of european countries by the Council of Europe in an alphabetical order, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in a given country once a day for more than 50 days. Towards the end, things got really complicated again: As the calls for the UK not to be treated as a single country became louder and louder, I broke it down again. Unfortunately, the turnout was very limited, so I would say that if I had to do it again, I wouldn't unravel it again. But we do have a winner: Alongside *Hot Fuzz* (winner for England), *Hunger* (winner for Northern Ireland) and *The Halfway House* (winner for Wales), the winner of the Scotland round has now clinched overall victory for the UK - congratulations go out to ***Trainspotting***.

Basically, this UK final would also have been suitable for the final of this whole project. At the same time, that might have been a very sad participation rate for the final, so I'm glad that one country is still missing - a country that some people were looking forward to, as I could see from the comments: Today, to round things off, it's all about **Vatican City**. And for one last time, I may announce the relevant rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions and hope to see you again in the final thread, where I will anounce the winner of this round!

movies,"Catherine O'Hara is simply spectacular as Kevin's mom in the Home Alone movies. She made the most out of a thin role, giving it more humor and depht than it deserved.","If you go through the Home Alone movies, the bond between Kevin and his mom is the heart of the Film. They have a love-hate relationship in which Kate (O'Hara) always sees the bad in Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), because he's a kid  who allows his emotions to get the best of him when he's bullied by Buzz or cursed at by his no good Uncle, but she also has a lot of love for him. But when Kevin is lost or left by the wayside, it's the mom who bears the guilt and tries to figure out what went wrong as well as acknowledging her mistakes. 

One thing I felt lacked in Lost in New York was the mom's subplot. I loved the Catherine O'Hara and John Candy's scenes in the first movie, great chemistry and O'Hara's character got to do a self-examination. 

The sequel, O'Hara is given less to do but the crux of the film continues to be the bond between Kevin and his mom. It's no accident that she's always the one whom Kevin runs to whenever he misses his family. The father is an after-thought in all of this. 

And Catherine O'Hara is superb as Kate. She gives a true depiction of motherhood, one which isn't perfect and it's often flawed but the love and care is still there. And O'Hara is an incredible comedienne and juices up a part which could have easily been another generic mom role.",Davis_Crawfish,1hfmgpm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,2024-12-16 16:07:01,1298,0.94,1298,0,176,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfmgpm
movies,It's now ten years since Peter Jackson directed a non-documentary film,"The third Hobbit film came out ten years tomorrow, and there's no sign of him directing anything else any time soon.

I think those movies are ever-so-slightly underrated (I stick up for the EEs as the best versions, as unnecessary as an even *longer* version of that story might sound). But it's hard not to think something about their troubled production, and maybe the ways Hollywood has changed over the years, broke something in old PJ.

Not that he hasn't been keeping busy at all. They Shall Not Grow Old was a really good documentary, and Get Back is essential viewing for Beatles fans. Not to mention his part in getting their 'new' song made. He seems happy enough tinkering with his pet interests.

It's a little sad though to think back on when the LOTRs came out and he was gearing up for King Kong and was still in his early 40's, you could imagine he was only just getting started. But now he seems more or less retired as a director and accepting that LOTR is probably what he'll be remembered for.

In a way, that's fair enough. LOTR is more than most people achieve. Still, it would be nice to see him back and doing something new, even if it's just shooting another horror movie in his backyard like he used to talk about doing.",Critcho,1hflaki,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,2024-12-16 15:14:39,732,0.89,732,0,242,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hflaki

movies,"""Constant questioners"" whilst watching a movie - annoying, or no?","I was watching a movie with a friend on the weekend, and he has this IMO extremely annoying habit of constantly asking questions during the movie. Like 'why did they do that?' 'what was that for?' 'what's he planning with that' etc etc.

Suffice it to say, I find this extremely fucking annoying and I told him so in no uncertain terms. His response was to play the victim like ""Man, why so aggressive?"".

The thing is, constant questioners IMO, basically know they're being annoying and do it anyway. We're watching the same movie. We're up to the same point in the movie since we're watching it together. I don't have any knowledge of the movie you don't, unless you weren't paying attention - but even still, that is not on me to rectify for you, you need to pay attention.

And even still, he asks questions I couldn't possibly have the answer for and it's strongly implied the movie will answer them for you anyway as long as you keep watching. Like, why ask me that question when you know I don't know the answer? The movie hasn't given us the information yet but you know it will later!

movies,Neil Breen's Influence on Megalopolis,"Did Neil Breen have an influence on the script for Megalopolis, direct or indirect?

To clarify what I mean, I highlight a number of similarities between Breens work and Megalopolis:
- In Breens movies, every attractive woman wants to sleep with Breen, resulting in a romantic subplot or love triangle. In Megalopolis, Wow, Julia, and Vesta all sleep and/or want to sleep with Ceasar.
- In Double Down, Niel Breen has constant flashbacks to his dead girlfriend. In Megalopolis, there are four random flashbacks to Caesar's dead wife.
- In Breens movies, there are many disjoint plots taking place simultaneously. In Megalopolis, there is the plot between Caesar and Cicero amd the bank takeover plot with Wow and Shia Labeouf to name two.
- In Breens movies, Breen is always endowed with supernatural power. One of the biggest selling points of Megalopolis is that Caesar has the power to stop time among others.
- In Breens movies, the villains/antagonists are corrupt politicians and/or corrupt businessmen. In Megalopolis, the main antagonists are Mayor Cicero and the banker Crassus.

I'm not claiming that Neil Breen wrote the script to Megalopolis.

movies,Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?,"Question, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

I must admit, I've been going on a binge on Warren Beatty films recently and I still can't believe he has done only 23 films. and having done a post before, he has turned down a lot of roles and had some unrealized projects. Looking at his filmography, he was productive from 1961-1975, but after that he became more inconsistent with his projects, pretty much taking years before he does one.

From what I read, Beatty was a bit of a perfectionist and to the detriment of the crew, who takes his time and was go multitude of takes.

I will say, I think Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Reds, &amp; Bulworth are masterpieces, and Dick Tracy is fun. However, he is also notable for some real stinkers, Ishtar is middling but it really tanked his image. Town &amp; Country is bad and it pretty much put him into exile and Rules Don't Apply, his comeback, reaffirmed that exile.

Overall, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

movies,City of Angels (1998) and correcting a 25 year injustice. ,"This will be kind of  rant but its story time.

When the movie City of Angels came out in 1998 it also had the song Iris by Goo Goo Dolls came out.  This was in the era of MTV still airing music videos and 10 year old me really liked the one for Iris. 

I figured out that it was on the soundtrack for this movie so I tried to rent it at the local movie store, Blockbuster had not yet made it to my town and this was a small mom and pop shop run by a family. 

When they saw the 10 year old boy me trying to rent City of Angels, the guy decided that I would not like this movie and I should rent something else instead.  At the counter he swapped it out for some C tier action flick i dont remember and my mom didn't really seem to care about this. 

So I never got to see it. Years passed and I forgot the title, but occasionally I'd hear that song Iris and remember that there was a movie out there somewhere that I was denied. 

It haunted me. 

25 years later. My fiancee and I are talking about songs we want to play at our wedding.  He turns on the song Iris. This set me on the quest. I could not get past this unforgivable betrayal of a movie I never got to see. 

Finally. I got it. And we are now about to correct a 25 year wrong. 

This got me thinking and I want to ask

movies,Lindsay Lohan is phenomenal in The Parent Trap,"
I just watched The Parent Trap for the first time, and she seriously surprised me. She should’ve been nominated for a golden globe, at the very least.

She’s so believable as twins it’s crazy. She gives each of the twins subtle characteristics that make them feel like 2 completely different people. I mean they actually felt like real twin girls, who were separated at birth. The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which “twin” was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. 

Every single line delivery of hers is incredible. Every single joke lands.

There’s a certain scene about 20 mins into the movie, where the 2 girls discover that they’re twins. There’s a specific line that she delivers that absolutely broke my heart, and brought a tear to my eye. She delivers this line with a single tear and a voice crack, and it was fantastic. It’s so subtle, but packs a big punch. Never in a millions years, did I ever think I’d start to tear up watching The Parent Trap, of all movies…

She’s so good, and the movie seriously surprised me. I would definitely watch it again

movies,Coco felt like a time machine for me. ,"I am 24 years old atm. I have not seen an animated Pixar picture in a long time. Now I watched Coco, just to see if they are still my cup of tea. I have to say, it felt like traveling back in time to some degree. 

Because when entering the world of Coco, I felt the wonder of child-me again. I wanted the film to explore every inch of its tale, show me as many parts of its universe as possible and meet more characters to learn about their story.

It was the most innocent but still a very true and sometimes hard hitting story about the meaning of death for both sides, the living and the dead. It's pretty awesome how Pixar managed to get those very dark and adult themes told in a movie mainly aimed at a very young audience. 

Also, the movie looks beautiful. The shadows, the lights and the very strong colours make it a visually pleasing experience. What really caught me off guard was the detail on some characters. The wrinkles on Coco herself are borderline photorealistic.

movies,The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull opening is one of the weirdest things ever,"Never been a fan of Indiana Jones, didn't grow up on his movies, seen only the first one on TV at some points. Started watching them in order and just finished The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.

So this is the grand return of the character to the big screen and Harrison Ford's return to the role. Indiana Jones always struck me as a less cliched action hero. Sure, there's a pulpy feel to his adventures and they're generally pretty light hearted, but he still feels less like a typical invincible soldier with a machine gun type of an action hero and more of a everyman, an archeology professor who rarely uses his gun, who's not in it for the money or glory, who often gets captured, gets hit during brawls and is afraid of snakes.

And one of the first things he does in this movie is survives a nuclear explosion. Now I've always heard about the fact that Indiana Jones hid from a nuclear explosion in a fridge, but I've thought that it was either a meme I didn't understand or a climactic moment in one of the movies. But no, this is literally happening in an opening, he randomly stumbles upon a nuclear testing site and hides in a fridge to miraculously survive. And then the movie actually starts. Like, due to the law of drama, him being fired due to red scare(isn't 1957 too late for McCarthyism?) feels more dramatic than him living through a nuclear explosion without even breaking a bone from that flying fridge.

I know that this movie is not very well liked by the fans(it is okay-ish, though the CGI is pretty cheap, the nuclear fridge is dumb and also Indy being dumbed down and trusting Mac about ""I've left you to die with the soviets, but I'm actually a double agent"" and then ignoring the fact how he openly thirsts for the treasure in the El Dorado is ridiculous).

I didn’t have one of the cases of people singing thankfully, but even that would have been better. I go to the movies once or twice a month, and surely enough every time there’s people who can’t shut their mouths. A comment or two is fine, I’ll lean over to my friend and whisper if I need to, but having entire conversations is absurd. Sometimes people in the back will legitimately have conversations at full volume! I like sitting in the back because it gives me a headache to be super close to the screen, so I guess it’s on me a bit when people around me talk. With that said, I go to a lot of relatively small theatre rooms and I bet anyone could hear it with the volume they’re at. I hate feeling like the asshole when it comes to telling people to be quiet, but sometimes it just comes to that. Today I had to (politely) shush someone and she kind of just scoffed and laughed it off. Later when I left she gave me and the person I was with a totally nasty expression. Like, I’m sorry but how am I the asshole here. I can’t remember if it was always like this, but I feel like it’s gotten worse since streaming had gotten popular and people are used to watching in their homes.

What are the themes? At first, you would think that the script was inspired by a bad date with the annoying kind of atheist who also wouldn't let her leave the apartment. Take that kind of uncomfortable, creepy, scary experience and keep amplifying it until it turns into horror. 

  
Then there's the fact that both actresses were raised Mormon and have apparently distanced themselves from it. I read a few comments from ex-Mormons who said that the movie really resonated with them. And Mr. Reed, as horrible and dishonest as he is, does raise some points about Mormonism which are both true and troubling. I can see how a woman raised in a very conservative religious family would look at the men of her family and be reminded of Mr. Reed. In other words, I think the movie may aim to subtly subvert adherence to high demand, high control religions such as Mormonism. 

  
I'm curious about Mr. Reed's motivations, planning and methods. Why and how does he go about running this house of horror? 

  
I note that Mr. Reed lets slip the occasional weird comment like when he says ""blueberry pie"" instead of ""Lou Gehrig's disease"" in a way that might be seen as mocking her father's death but then he pulls back. What was happening there?

movies,"Castle in the Sky by Hayao Miyazaki, a great Japanese animation that was inspired by Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. One of my favorite animated films.","https://preview.redd.it/a4c7wxlm647e1.jpg?width=1678&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=967c5786118484fbeeb2e02ff27f82c84978ee9f

Castle in the Sky (天空の城ラピュタ), also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky, is a 1986 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

Laputa is an ancient civilization that once stood so imposing and grand, above all and everyone, but now lies completely deserted and in ruins, surrounded by the environment. Tree roots surround the entire castle, and the human architecture is covered in greenery, with animals and streams running through it. It is as if the natural world is reclaiming what is rightfully its own, and Miyazaki is telling the viewer that the world is not ours, and that humans only have the sense of grandeur that we get because the natural environment allows us to, and that if we are not careful, it may very well pull the rug out from under us and take back what belongs to it.

It was inspired by the book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.

Laputa is a flying island described in the 1726 book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. With an adamantine base, which its inhabitants can manoeuvre in any direction using magnetic levitation. The island is the home of the king of Balnibarbi and his court, and is used by the king to enforce his rule over the lands below.

The film is a strong critic of the use of technology for militarism and the desire for domination. The villain Muska, like Sheeta, is also a descendant of the original inhabitants of Laputa, uses the stone to open a secret gate and assumes power in the flying city. And he desires world control through the power of weapons in Laputa.

The impractical and dangerously authoritative behavior Gulliver details in describing the Laputians is often alluded to throughout Castle in the Sky as the reason for Laputa’s eventual abandonment and ruin. Considering that Miyazaki had read Gulliver’s Travels and often uses his films as a vehicle for political commentary, it would be remiss to dismiss such parallels. Whether intentional or not, Miyazaki effectively adapts warnings regarding absolute sovereignty’s control over scientific innovations to the Cold War era.

Hayao Miyazaki's films, in addition to the beautiful images, are known for criticizing militarism and defending the environment, as happened in the film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which talks about a great war that devastated humanity and the environment.

I don't know where to ask such a specific question, and whether it's more suited for a film subreddit or a historical subreddit, but I'll try anyway.

From the first minute of the movie, one shot has this breast star that Patton is wearing. It looks like [The Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown](https://www.identifymedals.com/database/medals-by-period/pre-ww1-medals/the-order-of-merit-of-the-bavarian-crown/). What makes this peculiar is that this is a royal Bavarian order that stopped being awarded after the end of WW1. It is not in the list of awards Patton received nor is Patton in the list of recipients of this award anywhere. Did the film make a mistake here and just put any old decoration? It seems like an odd mistake when they got all his other decorations perfectly correct, and why would they just randomly have this specific royal Bavarian order to put on?",cheese_bruh,1hf5frc,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf5frc/pattons_decorations_in_patton_1970/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf5frc/pattons_decorations_in_patton_1970/,2024-12-15 23:28:39,1,0.53,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fBAR_s5hyciOOQ0rpj5zaKrmn28QVJROJE6VOSE1bKg.jpg,t3_1hf5frc

movies,Swiss Family Robinson (1960) - A great adventure and is similar to the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams and Robinson Crusoe.,"Swiss Family Robinson is a 1960 adventure film starring John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran in a tale of a shipwrecked family building an island home. It was the second feature film based on the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss.

The film is not a classic, it is a more naive and fun adventure. It's as if Robinson Crusoe got lost with his family on an island.

The book The Swiss Family Robinson (Der Schweizerische Robinson) is a novel by the Swiss author Johann David Wyss which was inspired by the book Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and inspired the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams

The basic story is a husband and wife want to get away from the rat race and are traveling by ship from their home in Switzerland to New Guinea to start a new life. But before they arrive they are caught in a bad storm and are shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. The captain and crew must have seen it coming and deserted early, leaving the family, with three sons, to fend for themselves.

They do the best they can to salvage useful items and supplies from the wrecked ship and set about building their new home. It ends up being a quite elaborate 3-cottage cluster in a very large tree with nicely spread limbs.

The family finds a number of animals, a Tiger, a small elephant, and several others that lead them to think it might be a land bridge, so they build a small boat and set sail to try to go around the island. Another shipwreck and an encounter with a band of pirates results in their rescuing a teenage girl as her grandpa is captured.

In the end the pirates return, the Family Robinson work hard with improvised defenses to hold off the pirates and, when it seems the pirates will prevail a ship arrives and starts shooting at the pirates and their ship to save the day.

When it was all over the parents decided they wanted to stay in this ""New Switzerland"" with the prospects of additional settlers.",cleopatraandcaesar63,1hf45fa,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf45fa/swiss_family_robinson_1960_a_great_adventure_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf45fa/swiss_family_robinson_1960_a_great_adventure_and/,2024-12-15 22:27:04,5,0.62,5,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hf45fa

movies,I'm gonna open a can of worms here...,"...but what do you think about Mr. Pink's opinion on tipping culture in America, in the movie Reservoir Dogs? I've come across a lot of opinions here on Reddit as well as other social media platforms, and my friends IRL. Most of them seem divided between whether one should tip at a restaurant or not, if yes then how much, and then if the minimum is also increasing every year seemingly. 

I resonate with some of the points Mr. Pink said, like when he said he'd like to do something about it eg if there's a paper to sign or party to vote, but he seemed generally in disagreement with the society who decided who he should tip or not. 

PS. No hate or disrespect to anyone making a living off those tips, but just want to initiate a genuine conversation.

Also PS. I'm not from America, so it's not something I've seen and experienced all my life. I have been living in America for 2 years but different people have different opinions and hence I want to pick your minds too.

movies,"How do you feel about fantasy franchise being turned into ""isekai"" by Hollywood?","(PORTAL FANTASY) Examples like Sonic the Hedgehog, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Barbie, A Minecraft Movie, Monster Hunter. Some people were saying there is a movie called Master of the Universe that did the same.

Is there a name for Hollywood making non-isekai movies into isekai (or whatever you wanna call the genre)?  
It's usually the fantasy world comes to Earth, or humans from Earth travel to the fantasy world.

Do you think they do it so the ""average"" cinema goer can enjoy it more, or connect to it?

How do you feel about it? As a fan, and sometimes non-fan.

Whether I like the franchise (Super Mario Bros.) or not (Minecraft), every time I see it, it makes me roll my eyes, and makes me think like it's a lazy way to approach the story.

There are some successful (box office) movies that don't do this, like Detective Pikachu, Dungeons and Dragons, Warcraft, Lord of the Rings, Resident Evil, that don't do this and people still go and watch them.  
(Haven't watched Dungeons and Dragons, and Warcraft, but based on trailers they seem 100% set in their fantasy world).

movies,The Polar Express - Who is the intended audience?,"I don't think it's made for kids. The dark tone of it and weirdness of certain things seems intentional and is prominent enough that there's no way it could be made for kids. But I also don't think it's made for adults either. There is enough kids stuff in it to make that obvious. I feel like it's more of an art project that doesn't really have a specific intended audience. A movie that tries to capture both the joy and wonder of a kid at Christmastime, as well as the sadness that comes with being an adult longing for that time. 

Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is decent and definitely a holiday classic. And I know there's a whole range of analysis about the story, the characters, the aesthetics, and what it all means. But it kind of seems to occupy its own place among Christmas movies. It has that feel good quality of a deep meaningful Christmas movie. There are some cheerful moments. But it also has this dark melancholic unsettling tone throughout it that you can't ignore. And there are definitely some weird aspects to some of the characters and things that happen. 

I don't think many adults sit down during the holidays to watch this movie. Nor do I imagine anyone putting this movie on for their kid to watch either.

movies,Rewatched Mad Max: Fury Road. I don’t get the hype,"I watched *Mad Max: Fury Road* about a month ago. I thought it was really cool and a good movie overall. Soon after, I checked its critic scores and was blown away by how high they were. I read up on people's opinions about it and it was just non-stop praise. Like yeah, It was good, but THAT good?! I went back and watched it again. 

I still don't get it.

OK before this gets downvoted into oblivion, I DO get why people like this movie; I like it too!! The pacing and choreography is insane, clever and subtle feminist themes, and everything done practically made for a great and more engaging viewing experience.

BUT

Is it really THAT good? I mean character development is kind of non-existent and I never really felt connected to any character or cared about what happened to them (I also never watched a Mad Max movie before, but I feel my criticism is valid), it lacked substance, and it was so abundant with and reliant on action that it never felt like the stakes were high, and scenes without action felt empty and stilted.

I understand that the movie puts less emphasis on certain aspects because it knows what it wants to be; I actually think that this kind of self-awareness in a film is rare and extremely important in putting a good project together. However, when people say that this is THE BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER MADE, I have to be harsh!

I don’t really want to argue (ok maybe a little), I want to hear from you guys on why this movie gets the praise it does and where I might be missing it.

TLDR: Everyone say movie is best movie. Me no see how movie is better than good movie.

movies,The Lies (and Deaths) of Christopher Nolan,"I’ve noticed a major plot point in many of Nolan’s movies often revolve around lies and false realities being deployed either selfishly or selflessly. 

Memento is about a serial killer taking advantage of his faded memory and creating a completely false narrative in order to avoid confronting his role in the death of his wife. 

In The Prestige, there is a constant game of lies played between Angier, Borden, Olivia, and Sarah all in the name of one-upmanship and dedication. A film not only about illusions themselves but also the balance of art and relationships, and the obfuscation of the true ugly nature of how these illusions operate and the massive physical and mental toll they take on the performer, such as Angier’s constant suicidal water tank trick, recreating for himself over and over again the same experience that led to the death of his wife.

At the end of The Dark Knight , Gordon and Batman decide to lie to the public about Harvey Dent’s final moments and intentions in order to avoid a scenario where all optimism had disappeared from Gotham. This is mirrored by Alfred choosing to set Rachel’s letter on fire, hoping to avoid an even deeper heart break within Bruce who’s already grieving from her death.

A large plot point in Inception revolves around Cobb making Mal come to terms with the false world they live in, ultimately making her naturally untrustworthy of her surroundings even upon coming back to reality, leading to her (wait for it) death.

Interstellar is in large part about the lies you tell others in order to make them feel safe, such as Coop (dead wife) not being forward with the extent of his mission to his children, Coop not being forward with the extent of his role and fate in the mission over Gargantua to Brand (Hathaway), and Professor Brand (Caine) not being forward with the probability of Plan A ever working. By contrast, the supposedly brave and virtuous Dr. Mann lies about the prospects of his planet in order to save himself at the expense of humanity.

Nolan’s often known for having a fascination with time manipulation and fractured narratives and he also gets a lot of flack for overly theatrical and complicated screenplays but I find his fascination with people’s perceptions and how they either accept fake narratives or create them for others to be what really makes me appreciate him as a writer. Just an unabashed interest in the psychological that I find to be endlessly entertaining.

There was another common plot point that comes up a lot in Nolan’s movies but I can’t remember it now.

There were days when I could hardly save myself from film suggestions, double nominations and debates about whether a film complied with the rules or not. And there were days when I was mentally on the verge of dropping out because it seemed impossible to find even one film. (Both times I would like to thank the respective participants).

Towards the end, things got particularly strange again in terms of participation: after I was almost criticised for counting the UK as a country and not wanting to have any geographical duplications, the participation rate in the England-thread was still very high and then really dropped. Some people even seemed to be angry that I dared to name Northern Ireland individually - that lead into a shower of downvotes. But I don't want to complain: We have found four candidates for your favorite movie set in the **United Kingdom**.

And this is how it is played: Below you will find four comments from me - these are the respective winners from the individual rounds. The winner is the film mentioned in the comment with the most upvotes (minus downvotes). You may comment on my comments, ***but please refrain from suggesting new films***. The only exception I will accept for this: If there is a UK film that could not be attributed to England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, this is an opportunity to put it in the race.

I'm very excited, how this will work out - thanks a lot in advance!

movies,A Christmas Prince (2017),"I just watched this Netflix Christmas movie for the first time and it's left me with some questions. 

One, the tiny nation of Aldovia has so many orphaned children they can fill an enormous and stately orphanage. What happened a generation ago to kill all these children's parents? The statue of the late king shows him in military uniform - was he a war hero? When was the war in Aldovia?

The second bit of world building was in the climax of the movie where &gt;!the King's secret note in the acorn Christmas ornament changed the law to allow non-blood relations to still be in the royal line of succession!&lt;. Aldovia has a Prime Minister, which suggests it is a constitutional monarchy, but this plot makes it seem like the king is the head of both the executive AND legislative branches of government. The head of this nation had extraordinary, unchecked power - perhaps the result of the hinted-at civil war?

The last question is about the posh accents of the entire royal family. All of the official royal decrees and ceremonies are held in English. There's no sign of a native Aldovian language. Is Aldovia a colony of the British Empire? What happened to the Native Aldovians and their language? Could this perhaps be the seed of the conflict that led to the former king becoming a war hero, and the leagues of orphans in the care of the state?

I'm currently translating the cut scenes from the long version of the movie God is a bullet.

One scene of the movie is in Spanish between what appears to be a waitress and Maika Monroe.

Could someone translate this for me? Because my Spanish isn't in great shape, and the background music is preventing google translation and deepl from working properly.

The subtitles included in my media don't have the translation for this part.

movies,What Horror Movie Sub-Genres you’re not a Fan of and Why?,"Horror Movie Sub-Genres I’m not a Fan of and Why are:

Found Footage - Because of the shaky camera and a completely saturated market.

Just way too many low-effort movies in this genre. Similar plots, shaky cameras that doesn't really add anything (except in good ones), and such. The (sub)genre is just filled with too much of garbage, while it's still possible to find a gem

Body Horror 

Demon Possession - Because it’s the exact same movie. And I think a lot of them forget what's actually scary about the idea of demonic possession, which is the thought of not being able to control your own body and the threat of damnation, not just weird contortions and little girls shouting blasphemy with the voice of several grown men.

It's just getting overdone now with little to no innovation in the subgenre. Every single one pretty much feels the same and has a very similar story to tell. 

It always feels predictable, and the religious allusions made in the film are just annoying. It's one of the few horror sub-genres that I can't take seriously.

Initial encounter. Slow build up of strange behavior. Eventual blow up. Speaking in tongues and obscene language unusual for that person. Gets tied down in exorcism. Holy water. Screaming, writhing and contorting. Faith breaks through at the last minute and they're saved! Rinse, repeat. The possessed person always acts the same and the arc of the struggle always feels the same.

Home Invasion - Because a character usually has to do something beyond stupid to let the home invasion happen or they have the upper hand over the invader and don't kill them off until it's too late.",Amber_Flowers_133,1heuh6m,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,2024-12-15 15:09:25,0,0.39,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heuh6m

movies,Smile 2 (2024) My expectations where tripled what I expected! What did you think of the film?  ,"WARNING! Naturally, spoilers. If you haven't seen the film, do not proceed. 



&gt;!Ever since the first film, I jumped on reddit almost as fast as did with the sequel now, giving it heavy praise. I was shocked a good portion thought it was kind of laughable. The scares are important sure, but what Smile 2 provides is just unsettling anxiety. Thankfully the ammount of jump scares were JUST enough but not too much, which I admit the first film might of had just a little too much of. For example, when Skye (Naomi Scott) looked in her closet there was a dozen of people she knew smiling at her. I thought ""ok any moment they will rush and the movie goes on"" They rushed alright. But they just got closer. The scene which was less than a minute felt like a eternity. I was so uncomfortable (in a good movie way) I was just thinking common man what what WHATS gonna happen"". Then they get even closer but stacked on top each other. Honestly that made me smile in real life and giggle for a slight moment. The acting in this movie is superb. Naomi Scott was brilliant. I couldn't help thinking how hard it must of been to act it all out, but she brilliantly executed her performance. She made it feel so realistic. There was two jaw dropping (and i mean literally) moments in the film where i stood still silent in awe. The very beginning when Joel got hit by the car in the beginning. But better yet, the f&amp;$%ing ending! The moment I realized reality set in realizing 7,000+ people are about to all get the curse, DUDE I just instantly imagined a sequel for a world apocalypses movie lol. !&lt;

&gt;!Honestly, idk why but I loved both films. I never get excited for a sequel as much as I did this. As a matter of fact, I'm going to create a SCP dedicated to this ""demon"" or ""curse"".

movies,"I have a soft spot for ""Die Hard 2"" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three ""Die Hard"" entries.","There's no way, of course, that ""2"" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by ""Vengeance"" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.

But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.

I'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest ""Die Hard"" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",Mst3Kgf,1hetrq0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,2024-12-15 14:33:34,376,0.88,376,0,280,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hetrq0

movies,logistics in get out ,"to start out this is not a complaint post or me trying to get some super clear logic from a fictional movie. there's no way of knowing the answer to my question but I'm curious about others thoughts 

what do folks think that the people who stole black peoples bodies in get out generally did after they had their new body? do we think the community/cult who was in on this had rules on what you did afterwards? clearly they would have to be pronounced as dead otherwise they'd be missing and being white (and wealthy) there would have actually been serious efforts made to find them.

then there's the fact that they'd be seen as black by those who were outwith the group and would therefore have people treat them differently. my theory was that they saw this as an opportunity to sort of retire from society sort of how rose's grandparents were living with their family and posing as staff in the house when others were visiting. I know some people will think it illogical that they'd want to be in black bodies due to the racism in society but personally I think the types of people that were doing this probably held a respectability politics sort of mindset where they'd assume that because they'd act 'proper' they would be fine.

i also wonder if the people in the sunken place could communicate with the person piloting their body

movies,Get out,"I’m rewatching get out. Jesus. I know we’ve decided already that this movie set the bar too high, which is part of the reason some people feel Jordan’s subsequent movies don’t hold up. But rewatching it only for the second time makes me cold. 
The story presented touches on a topic in racism that always bothered me. The coveting and use of the strengths and abilities black people possess while simultaneously looking at them at no more human than those we aren’t. It’s trippy as fuck to think that they’d believe their mindset in the body of what they believe to be superior genetically would make a better person. It literally speaks to the inability to see the value in our consciousness and that disturbssss me. Roses grandfather losing to Jessie Owens. People at the auction describing how they used to be. The abilities they used to have and comparing them to his. Ugh. 
Roses obsessive need to be on Chris’s side whenever he felt uncomfortable by the weird shit was triggering. Using it as a method to hide his identity and lure him into that false sense of security that he never even really felt was crazy. I never felt more anxious than watching her bring him back into the house once the auction was over. 
And let’s talk about that fucking auction. I think what bothers me most is how sealed Chris fate is at that point . What appears like ignorance to Chris is really also lack of need to hide their true intentions. The way rose brings him around the event to introduce him to everyone , most auctions people move through. Seeing Chris being dragged from group to group, touched and questioned was disturbing to say the least . 
When Chris is having the procedure explained to him I could cry. The sunken place in its entirety is the opposite of what I fear in death. Which is the lack of consciousness. I can’t imagine playing back seat in your own body. I’m not sure how comparative to a vegetative state it is but the trauma in being moved and speaking without your own permission had to be greater than one can imagine. Seeing the color return to the eyes of Andre supports this. While I wish he managed more words lmao it took the rewatch for me to realize he has been essentially raped and used all 
with his knowledge and had no ability to stop it. 
  Rose having a real bedroom with the photos of the people she kidnapped was a choice. I can’t decide  if I appreciated the change in her character upon the reveal but I can say it was entertaining ? The conversation between she and rod and the fact that she had been Chris’s biggest ally during this ordeal. How she went from I love you to smiling during what was supposed to be her death. 
 One thing that always confused me was grandpas  ability to rationalize coming out of the sunken place quick enough to shoot rose and know there’s no way to prevent going back and kill himself. Also rose’s stupidity in not realizing the flash would take grandpa out the sunken place as it had done to Logan hours before. Handing over her gun was .. a choice 😭. Overall I really loved the movie. It was as entertaining as heartbreaking and moving &amp; thought provoking. I choose to believe since the other ending wasn’t the Final Cut it just doesn’t exist.

movies,Can you name this movie?,"It’s an action movie that people watch near Christmas because it happens around that time of year. 

It’s about the relationship between a white cop and a black cop that become friends over the course of the movie. 

The white cop’s character is largely driven by issues stemming from his wife, while the black cop is just a normal street cop that unexpectedly gets mixed up in something bigger. 

They are going up against an international criminal gang led by a charismatic, well-spoken, suit-wearing sophisticate of a bad guy. 

The bad guy’s main henchman is a physically imposing mercenary who is very blonde. 

The very blonde henchman is seemingly defeated in an epic one-on-one physical brawl with the white cop, but actually pops back up again at the very end to be shot simultaneously by both the white cop and black cop, killing him.

movies,I honestly like the other Terminator films after T2 because the likeness of Judgement Day but in different formats is a part of the Terminator franchise.,"I am thinking that I am one of the few people here who acknowledges this but I feel that every Terminator film, even after the ones of T2, bring something new to the concept of Judgement Day.

Sure, every single one brings the same concept of T2 over and over again (Dark Fate does not have John but it is still the same concept with the new character) but I think that this is intentional.

Since the very beginning with T1, there has been the concept about the debate between free will and determinism where the Kyle Reese goes back in time to save Sarah but he impregnates her with John and the result is the photo that she gets in the future. 

Because of this, Judgement Day still happens but it was delayed.

The same goes for T2 with the concept of 'No Fate' which apparently shows the dilemma between free will and the determined future where the characters still are able to prevent Judgement Day but it is delayed until a new Terminator comes.

This eerily reminds of the game Bioschock Infinite which shows the concept of Infinite universes and the idea behind constants and variables which basically says that even though the timing of the event did not come, it will still come in different forms and it is still a constant - hence, the determined need to bring  Judgement Day.

So in a way, T3 is still the same like the previous films except Judgement Day still happened meaning that not even John could escape his fate.

In Genysis, I liked the idea of trying to blend a little bit of the butterfly effect where even though Judgement Day was prevented, Skynet took a new format and I liked the parallel where we have become so dependent on technology that we have become slaves to it.

So that concept of technology being a literal threat and a literal idea that is possible was a good concept.

Same goes for Dark Fate.
Sure, the writing could have been handled better instead of just killing John at the very beginning

But I think I understood the idea behind Legion because it is still Skynet but with a different name.

From my perspective, it was just another manner of the butterfly effect. Skynet still exists and will exist in the future but somehow, the butterfly effect makes it have a different name but the intention is still determined.

The only thing that I really did not like it how the Terminator that killed John somehow developed empathy towards humanity without the proper programming and has basically maintained a relationship for years without his family never questioning his literal existence.

I just do not understand when people criticise when they expect something different than T2 because from my understanding, T2 is bound to happen over and over again in different formats.

Or the fact that people want something different because the other films are indeed different but are still the same story with different details and chapters but still telling the same story overall.",sammyjamez,1heq335,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,2024-12-15 10:42:00,0,0.3,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heq335

movies,Actors you may not have realised were British,"I want to mention five British actors that I didn't know (at least, not consciously) were British when I first saw them onscreen. Please add your own!

1. Hugh Laurie

Not everyone grew up watching British film and television and saw Hugh Laurie in his earlier roles—and even then, depending on your generation, you may not have recognised him when he became popular in American media (I didn't, at least). If your first exposure was his role as Stuart Little's dad in the movie of the same name; or as House, MD in the popular hospital drama; you might be forgiven for thinking he was an American actor.

2. Gary Oldman

A man of many faces (and voices), Gary Oldman has been in so many blockbuster movies—and is often touted as an example of characters who looked familiar but you just couldn't quite put your finger on who was playing the part... From Zorg in The Fifth Element to Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman trilogy, it may have come as a shock to some people to see (and hear) him as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter franchise.

3. Gillian Anderson

I'm a huge X-files fan. In fact, for the last year or two I have been doing a\[nother\] rewatch! Growing up, I had no idea that Gillian Anderson was a British actor. She played the part of Dana Scully so well (in my opinion), I am sure many were hoodwinked into thinking she was another fantastic American television actor.

4. Henry Cavill

Before he played Geralt of Rivia, Henry Cavill showed up in all sorts of places; but his notable role was Clark Kent / Kal-El in the mid 2010s movie, Man of Steel. At the time, I had no idea he was British. Henry's a real nerd (self-proclaimed, like many of us), and I look forward to his upcoming involvement in Warhammer 40K. :)

5. Tom Holland

This man. He's becoming quite legendary. If you haven't seen The Crowded Room, I highly recommend that you check it out. Bursting onto the screen\* as Peter Parker in Captain America: Civil War (and then of course the Spiderman movies which followed), I would hazard a guess that many fans were oblivious to the fact that Tom's a Brit. He nailed the part of Nathan Drake in 2022's Uncharted.

\* Before anyone comments that ""bursting onto the screen"" implies an actor's debut, I am aware that Tom Holland played roles prior to Peter Parker. But it wasn't until then that by all accounts his popularity began taking hold. There's no arguing it was pretty bursty, right?

Bonus: Kaya Scodelario

I sat down recently and started watching Guy Ritchie's Netflix show, The Gentlemen. If you haven't seen it, stop reading Reddit and go fire it up. It borders on hilarious, with all the Guy Ritchie grit and wit you would expect. Anyway, there is a ""businesswoman"" called Susie Glass (rhymes with arse, not ass). It took me a minute to figure out where I'd seen her before—except she didn't have a British accent. If you've seen the Maze Runner movie trilogy, you'll know what I'm talking about: Kaya played Teresa, a major part in all three films, and it was a real trip to realise that she's actually British.

I hope you enjoyed my breakdown of five (plus one bonus) British actors that when you first saw them you may not have realised they were not American.

Netflix is best enjoyed while shoveling popcorn in my mouth and doing something else with my time, like scrolling on my phone or playing a video game. … or even “chilling”. They just don’t hold my attention well.

Meanwhile I can go to the theater and even do a double feature with full attention, I’m respecting the presentation and effort of a big screen release. It has more impact. Don’t get me wrong my home theater still has a punch but Netflix quality is still below par.

Netflix is basically the old “straight to dvd“ but now it’s straight to streaming, which I guess makes sense given the climate of entertainment these days…. But most of the memorable movies for me have premiered in theaters or get a justified release…

movies,I finally had the courage to go to the cinema on my own and I'm so glad I did,"Hey all, I love going to watch movies in the theatre as I truly believe it can make a huge difference for many films compared with watching at home. Unfortunately I don't always have friends or family that want to join but I've always felt too socially uncomfortable to go by myself as I feel people will judge me.

I just recently decided I should give it a try and man am I happy I did. Some movies are great to watch with friends, but sometimes it's awesome to be able to fully focus and engage with a film without being distracted by others, especially at the theatre.

movies,Re-watched Close My Eyes,"I came here to rant about the goodbye party wrestling sequence.

So I'm wondering if the critics may have been a little more kind had another actor played his part, and if the general movie going audience also thinks this a possibility. Even if youre a fan, you gotta admitt . . . he's pretty much taken over the 'family-friendly tough guy' role.

movies,With AI restorations on the rise in recent years I am becoming worried about the future of movie preservation.,"I will preface this post with something positive before I discuss my concerns. The truth is that as long as there are fans of art there will be people who will properly preserve it. If you want a movie in a particular form/ cut, with the original theatrical audio mix, with every special feature ever released for that movie, and in the best/ least compressed presentation possible then there are many places online where you can access it. This post isn't referring to crazy people like me that will seek out that material. This post is aimed at people that I refer to as “casuals” or the people that aren't as crazy as me about this sort of stuff. The people that just want to watch a movie with the click of a button rather than buying a physical disc or searching for an obscure torrent. 



I want to start my concerns about this phenomenon by stating that I am not a gloomy type of person. I see some of the benefits of AI technology when it comes to movie restorations, but my perspective changed after December 12th, 2024. That day I went with a friend to see a one night only screening of Interstella 5555 (2003). That presentation of the movie is the worst my friend and I have ever seen, which is saying something because that movie is cursed with sub par home media releases. The version that my friend and I saw that day was AI upscaled. It ruined all of the details in the image. Every shot in the movie looked like someone rubbed Vaseline on random parts of the screen. It was pretty much unwatchable. (Here are some examples of what my friend and I saw that night: [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1gfqxge/interstella_ai_remaster/), [Example #2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b_sL6bSRhWw), [Example #3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pX_Ss4BrepE)).



I knew this sort of stuff had happened before like with the recent Blu-ray release of [I Love Lucy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdhJMOTPVw) and the [4Ks that James Cameron has released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxOqWYytypg&amp;pp=ygUXamFtZXMgY2FtZXJvbiA0ayBpc3N1ZXM%3D), however the difference with those is that most of them (except The Abyss) have some other decent release while Interstella 5555 is stuck with a sub par DVD and Blu-ray releases.



Then there is the issue of movies staying in circulation. If this version of Interstella 5555 is the only one available on streaming or a new Blu-ray release then what will “casuals” who have never watched this movie think. Will they think that the movie shouldn't look like that or will they think that the movie is supposed to look like a Vaseline smeared mess?



AI is a very helpful technology for movie restoration but it has become very obvious to me that studios are not using this technology properly and are getting extremely lazy with it. I will put it to you this way, you use a hammer to strike nails and you use a wrench to screw bolts. You can use a wrench to strike nails and you can use a hammer to screw bolts but the tools will do those tasks horribly if used in this manner. Use the right tool for the job and everything will be fine. After that night, I realized that these studios aren't doing that for whatever reason and that it is up to us to keep the art that we love alive.

movies,Are We Supposed to Believe the Actor Is the Character?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about acting and how we experience it as an audience. When I watch a movie, am I supposed to believe the person playing the part is the character they’re portraying? Or is it enough to just see the actor doing their job—sometimes really well—but never fully disappearing into the role?

Take Timothée Chalamet, for example. I haven’t seen his Bob Dylan portayal yet, but when I do, am I supposed to feel like I’m watching Bob Dylan? Or will it just be Timothée doing a solid impression of Dylan? Similarly, with Adam Driver, I really like the guy and his work, but I’m always aware it’s Adam Driver. Whether he’s yelling about the Rebellion in Star Wars or breaking down in Marriage Story, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s him delivering a great performance, not me being fully immersed in the world of the character. DDL became Daniel Plainview for example. I know I know DDL is like fucking insane but shit, he raises the bar. 

Shouldn’t great acting make me forget the actor entirely? Shouldn’t I feel transported—like I’m in a dark IMAX theater, alone, completely immersed in the story and the character? Or is that asking too much? Maybe it’s enough to just appreciate the craft, even if I never fully lose sight of the actor behind it.

I’d love to hear how others feel about this. Do you find yourself believing in the character, or are you always aware of the actor? Is there a specific performance where you did feel like the actor completely disappeared? Or is that level of immersion more about the movie as a whole than the acting itself?",spacepants1990,1he7zbp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,2024-12-14 17:37:33,0,0.2,0,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he7zbp

movies,I just finished watching all the Rocky movies ,"Holy shit man. These are some of the greatest movies I ever watched. 

The first movie is good, but it is pretty boring I can’t lie. It doesn’t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight. But man, something about that fight made it all worth it. I can’t describe it, just watching that iconic montage and fight made it feel like I didn’t waste my time. 

From there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn’t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I’m glad they gave Rocky’s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.

movies,tom hanks ruined the soundtrack version of the polar express theme.,"one of my all time favorite christmas movies is 2004's the polar express. and given how this year marks the film's 20th anniversary, you better believe that i made sure to watch it this year.

one of my favorite parts of the movie is when the train arrives at the north pole. they made the very smart decision to have the polar express theme play at that part. it's a really good song with great lyrics and a fast pace that mirrors the fast pace of the titular train.

when you listen to the soundtrack on a CD or a vinyl or on Spotify or however you listen to it, the version of the song on the soundtrack is different. in the soundtrack version, they have tom hanks as the conductor randomly interjecting. and to me, this ruins the song.

for starters, as talented as he is, tom hanks cannot sing. or maybe he can. i don't really know because he isn't so much singing as he is sing talking. also, like i said, he randomly interjects and i feel that it ruins things.

this is the fourth (or third, depends on what status you grant Northern Ireland) time I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a country in the country called UK. After England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's now **Wales**' turn before the grand finale. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1he6u1d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he6u1d/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he6u1d/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-14 16:43:32,5,0.61,5,0,30,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he6u1d

However, from what I have read and seen, he seems to be a rather divisive figure in Hollywood.

movies,Educating Rita is the most beautiful film about self-determination and friendship,"So Educating Rita (1983) sees Blood Brothers author Willy Russel's updated take on the classic George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. He really subverts the narrative into something special and important. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are just phenomenal and arguably at their very best, as the middle class professor and his working class student, who also works as a hairdresser, in the 1980s. He is teaching her how to pass a literary course, with the narrative building up towards that final exam.

The three key themes I identified were self-determination, friendship, and social class dynamics. 

Now, Pygmalion is the classic tale of a working-class woman being educated and transformed into a member of upper class society by a wise professor.

The ending is quite dark, and it makes a point of how Eliza Doolittle feels she has lost her identity and it's exceedingly bleak. This was famously changed into a happy ending for the wonderful and far more famous musical My Fair Lady. Both have their charms , but I'll take the politically charged Pygmalion any day.

Now, what I love about Pygmalion is Russel kind of flips the roles on a psychological level. Caine's professor character Frank is far more vulnerable than hard-nosed Rita. He struggles with alcohol addiction and Rita's transformation kind of breaks him. He can't stand losing her, what she was (his pet project), as he's so unhappy in his life, otherwise.

Throughout the movie we see Rita taking more control over her life and doing what she wants instead of what society expects of her. She ditches the oppresive husband who wants a baby and breaks out of her shell to become a popular and highly regarded student at the university. She smashes the exam and gets a distinction. 

In an absolute Tour de Force of a monologue, Rita explains why she decided to carry on down that path. She explains that she had 'a choice' and made it, after considering it. She then talks about all the potential she has now the exam is over and how she can choose to do pretty much anything she likes and doesn't feel held back like before. A complete 180 from the Rita we saw at the start.

In both characters, Russel is exploring the idea of self-determination. Frank makes every wrong decision and falls apart as the film progresses. And Rita seems to make every right one.

Through this journey, we also explore their friendship amid the backdrop of the middle and working class dynamics in 1980s Liverpool (you couldn't pick a better time or setting to explore this). 

Throughout the movie, you get a whiff of palpable romance but I think that's just because Walters and Caine's chemistry is just so good. At the very end, the characters look like they may kiss as they're about to embrace to say goodbye, but no, thankfully they give eachother a nice big hug.

Frank takes a bold new step and transforms his life by jetting off to Australia. 

Then, in the final shot, Rita is walking off down the corridor. In an earlier scene, Frank implored Rita to come with him. Rita turns and looks back, you can tell she's thinking about going. But then she decides to carry on striding forward to make her own way in life.

movies,Best realistic fights in movies? Bonus points for martial arts focused films ,"I was recently watching the latest batch of Cobra Kai episodes and thought that this show has jumped the shark for some time now. Sure the original Karate Kid movies are over the top and cheesy as hell but the whole appeal of this series was that it brought it all down to Earth and made them feel almost believable, like they could have happened. But they couldn't help themselves from leaning into cheesy, overly choreographed movie karate/tae kwon do. 

That got me thinking, what are  some movies that have a lot of fighting in them that remain somewhat grounded? No over the top kung fu, no fake martial arts. Just technical fighting and good cinematography to sell it. I could think of some examples, like last year's ""The Killer"" which was sort of an anti John Wick film, with fight scenes without jumping around, no telegraphed swings, no spinning kicks or anything, just people mostly shoving/punching/grappling until someone wins. I couldn't however for the life of me think of a martial arts focused movie that manages to remain grounded somewhat.

movies,"Unforgiven is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies as a director ever. I mean imagine deconstructing the gunslinger image that made you a star, and stripping away the glamor behind the Wild West.","https://preview.redd.it/yicntwi7lq6e1.png?width=219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4058b385363489b27ba3d34b8e628fe804990207

William Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.

https://preview.redd.it/9eglkeoplq6e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb95dfb6da04b33733c5019ea3b5560fbd7cafb



But much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the  sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207

Characters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.

It is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.

And it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it. And Freeman is as reliable as ever as the soft spoken Ned.",LoneWolfIndia,1hduhu8,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,2024-12-14 03:59:59,2472,0.92,2472,0,222,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hduhu8

movies,"How much ""profit"" does a movie have to make to actually be profitable?","I've seen movies that made $30 million in ""profit"" against a budget of $150 million be considered a ""commercial flop"". 

I've read that a film's budget should be doubled to account for marketing costs, so that $100 million budget film that made $300 million actually resulted in a $100 million loss. 

That can't be a rule of thumb, right? I always figured the ""double for marketing"" only applied to the tentpoliest of tentpole movies. 

An example: A Series Of Unfortunate Events (2004) grossed $211 million on a budget of around $140 million. Going by the double for marketing rule, that's a horrendous box office failure. Even if you stake out a half for marketing rule for mid-level productions, the film barely broke even. 

But there was at one point in time a sequel in the works. I wouldn't think they'd entertain the idea of a sequel if the first one barely broke even at best or blew $150 million at worst. So the oft-stated double for marketing rule or half for marketing rule that I just made up couldn't possibly apply to this film, right?

It's not as if this film came out in the 2020s, when studios were trying to status-quo their way through the post-pandemic film industry shakeup. Duds were still duds in the early 2000s when this film came out. 

So how exactly does profit work in Hollywood? Not everyone can be Paranormal Activity or Avengers: Endgame, and we've all seen movies that made a couple milly in profit get 3 or 4 sequels. It's clear they made enough money from the first one to warrant sequel(s), so a multiple of the production budget for marketing is not a universal rule.",Danielnrg,1hdr76o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,2024-12-14 00:58:58,0,0.43,0,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdr76o

For numerous reasons my wife and I rarely go see a movie at the theater.

I understand that they might be afraid of losing  revenue but there are people like myself that are not going to the theater who would be providing additional income.

movies,Alternate ending to Turning Red ,"I used to love Turning Red but I don't anymore. When I washed it for the second time the flaws in it became a lot more visible:

If the concert was happening on the 25th instead of the 18th, how did May and her friends go so long thinking it was the 18th? Did they not double check? Do nobody tell them?

If they stopped being friends for a while, why did Miriam keep Mei's pet toy?

Why did they suddenly love Tyler if he was a 4*Townie? Just because he likes the same band as them doesn't mean he's a good person.

Keeping these flaws in mind, here is how I would have done it:

At the party, Mei and her friends (Miriam, Priya, and Abby) hear that 4*Town's Toronto concert has been cancelled. Mei attacks Tyler after he insults her family and doesn't stand up for her friends when her mother blames them for everything. The ritual goes off without a hitch and her red panda form is sealed away.

When Mei returns to school the following Monday, she is shunned by her former friends, who are still mad at her for throwing them under the bus. She is heartbroken until Tyler approaches her and apologizes for his past behaviour. Mei extends an offer of friendship, which he gladly accepts, and the film ends with the two walking happily into the sunset.

I believe 2004 was a good year for movies, but when I went on IMDb, I was kind of shocked to find out that Paul Giamatti wasn’t even nominated for his role in the movie. 

But regarding Best Picture award, admittedly, it’s been a while since I’ve seen The Aviator, Finding Neverland, and Million Dollar Baby, (haven’t seen Ray yet)but between Sideways and Million Dollar Baby (the Oscar winner), what do you think is the better movie? And why?

movies,2025 might be one of the most interesting years for mainstream cinema and maybe a new creative resurgence in filmmaking.,"The last 5 years honestly had been probably one of the roughest eras in mainstream cinema creatively and  as far as what was getting made and how they were being treated particularly as far as theatrically released or original mid budget movies goes.

And part of the fact was covid's impact towards the film industry and led up to the major studio's  misguided push towards streaming and the Netflix route of ""throwing whatever at the wall and seeing what sticks and not give a lot of marketing into while the execs and shareholders who greenlight these movies get all the nice fat checks  in the world. I think it's starting to die out a little bit though thankfully.

 Like guys remember 8-Bit Christmas on HBO max? or the Chip n Dale movie on Disney+? What about No One Will Save You on Hulu? that one movie that a lot of genre fans raved about the week it came out  only to feel like it was buried afterwards and used as filler for a streaming service? *crickets chirping*

But anyway that the majority of  theatrical mainstream movies and the  industry leaned towards a more toxically nostalgic shift  for reboots/remakes/rehashes of IP's from 10-50 years ago. Like Indiana Jones 5 with an 80-year old  Harrison Ford or the umpteenth reboot of The Exorcist  with a 90-year old Ellen Burstyn and a reboot of Twister of all things. 

But looking at next year, yeah there's going to be some movies that looked like it was approved for shareholders like reboots to Final Destination and I Know What You Did Last Summer, A reboot of the Jurassic Park reboot (Universal still hasn't learned i guess), and Hollywood taking a dump on Chris Sanders' legacy by making live action versions of his movies to make a quick buck for nostalgic manchildren. 

But there is some interesting mix or IP's and original stuff . And some of the original stuff are from directors like  Ryan Coogler, Koganada, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, James L Brooks, Joseph Kosinski, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Sure  the schedule could change and  are they going to be homeruns? Who knows but even then it starting to regain my confidence towards mainstream movies again and maybe it's going to start a new resurgence in getting more quirkier or high concept movies made again from the majors.",gearwest11,1hdjul2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,2024-12-13 19:15:10,0,0.29,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdjul2

movies,What are your thoughts on watchmen chapter 1 and 2 is it a perfect adaptation ,"The animated Watchmen chapters I and II are a true love letter to the original graphic novel, staying incredibly faithful to the source material. The visuals capture the gritty, noir-like atmosphere of the comic perfectly, and the animation brings the artwork to life in a way that feels close to the original. The pacing mirrors the comic’s episodic structure, and the dialogue stays true to the sharp, complex exchanges that define the characters.

While this faithfulness will undoubtedly resonate with long-time fans, it also raises an interesting question: is it too faithful? The adaptation feels almost like a direct retelling, which can leave little room for new interpretations or creative risks. For those familiar with the comic, it offers a nostalgic experience, but does it stand out as something more than just a faithful retelling? Could it have pushed boundaries or expanded on themes in a way that feels fresh? It nails the essence of Watchmen, but does something still feel missing?

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 3 - Scotland,"Hello there,

I've really been on a Reddit journey through filmed Europe for quite a while now and yes, it makes me wistful that it's coming to an end... but it's going to get wild here at the end. I've arrived at U, and I have to say: Sorry, UK, but this concept of a country made up of several countries is just confusing and I'm in favour of any (non-violent) way to clean up this mess somehow.

But since I don't want it to become too political, I've come up with an idea: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will each have their own thread and at the end the overall UK winner will be chosen from the individual winners. England and Northern Ireland are now more or less through and today we are looking for movies set in **Scotland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hdfvxo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-13 16:22:45,4,0.57,4,0,54,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdfvxo

movies,"Depictions that were considered historically or scientifically accurate at the time, but not anymore due to later discoveries","Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.

For example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the Titanic sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the James Cameron movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.

The public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of Jurassic Park . The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.

movies,Why I'm Frustrated with the Coyote Vs. Acme Crowd,"It’s not just about the fact that Coyote Vs. Acme is likely lost forever—that’s frustrating, yes—but what really annoys me is how some people keep reacting to *The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* as if Warner Bros. is releasing it. They're complaining that *this* movie is coming to theaters while Coyote Vs. Acme isn’t, and it’s honestly infuriating.  

Let me break this down for you:  

1. **Warner Bros. is NOT releasing this movie.** It was sold to an indie distributor. If it hadn’t been bought, it might have suffered the same fate as Coyote Vs. Acme. Thanks to this sale, it’s now getting a theatrical release, but that’s not because of WB.  


2. **This is a traditionally animated Western film in theaters!** Let’s be real—these movies don’t usually do well at the box office. Judging by the marketing's view counts, it’s probably heading toward being a flop unless it gets serious support soon. Releasing the trailer on the same day as the Game Awards? Not the best move. But instead of helping this film succeed, some people are whining about Coyote Vs. Acme. You’re not helping.  


3. **This movie has had a rough journey.** It started as an HBO Max exclusive during the pandemic, set to eventually air on Cartoon Network. Then production was halted during the WB Discovery merger and David Zaslav’s infamous tax write-off spree. Only after being sold did work resume, and now it’s finally getting a theatrical release. It had its premiere during the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and was extremely positively received. It is also the first real original Looney Tunes movie on the big screen. It's not a short. It's not a collection of shorts. It's a full-length, fully animated movie with an original story.


So, to all those targeting this film: Stop complaining about how a movie you didn’t even know or care about didn’t get released for a second. Instead, show some support for a movie that actually *did* survive against all odds. This could’ve easily been lost media too.  


If you actually care about what’s happening at Warner Bros. Discovery—or even about movies like Coyote Vs. Acme—then PROVE IT. Support The Day the Earth Blew Up. This is your chance to send a message.

When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beats some of the bad guys, but he's hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he's gonna die but he's afraid of it).

movies,Nickel Boys review,"Nickel Boys: 

Boy oh boy, where do I begin. They told RaMell Ross that he wouldn’t pull this off, that people wouldn’t adapt to the style. Well I’m here to tell you, they were dead wrong. Nickel Boys is creatively astounding. Movies that are so unique don’t come around often and this is unique with a capital U. 

The cinematography is the obvious place to start here. This is an experiment that passes with flying colors. Every frame will be burned into your brain that you’ll see them when you close your eyes. This camera work is like nothing I’ve seen ever seen before and it’s executed to sheer perfection. 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure detail and effort that pays off massively. Don’t take your eyes off the screen cause not a single frame can be missed. Nickel Boys is a vision of artistic excellence. 

Onto the acting. Credit to all the actors and actresses involved cause they were all in danger of being over shadowed by the creative choices made, but man oh man do they hold their own. Pure emotion on display. A gripping but grounded tale. 

RaMell Ross is cinema’s Einstein. Everything about Nickel Boys is innovative and inspired, a truly staggering cinematic achievement. I felt like I was witnessing cinema history… I’m not saying it’s for everyone and Nickel Boys is a movie that will inevitably divide audiences. That said I think this movie is generational, and you can say I’m taking the bait but I have never witnessed something on this scale before and I’m deeply elated with what I have seen.

movies,Kubo and the Two Strings is an unbelievable achievement in filmmaking ,"Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika – the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can’t believe this movie is real. I’m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.

Stop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of “Chicken Run” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit” (which I love, btw) – we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that’s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo’s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)

Also stop motion characters are usually dressed in tight clothes and have steady hairdos to make them easier to animate – but in Kubo, they’re using kimonos and have long hair; plus, there are animal characters and one of them is a MONKEY with fur. That means the animators had to move the kimonos and each hair strand (or the fur, in the monkey’s case) individually for every frame. And they placed that monkey in the middle of a snowstorm!!! They had to manipulate every single piece of that fur 24 times to end up with a second of footage.

Kubo is a very touching and beautiful film too, and I recommend it for its storytelling appeal as well. But I’m mostly here to praise the achievement by itself.

movies,If you had to say... who is the greatest actor of all time and why?,"I have watched thousands upon thousands of movies in my years. All genres of all decades. I've thought about this a lot, and I'll give my answer from a position of being a self-proclaimed ""movie connoisseur"".

There's hundreds of amazing actors that have done incredible works, but when it comes to picking a ""best"" I had to do a lot of sifting and made some very difficult choices of dropping the top players.

I won't give this accolade to anyone purely based on their merits or personal successes in the film industry. I don't how care how big their award closet is or how many top-grossing films they starred in. Although awards correlate with great acting, they are in no way indicative of who the greatest actor is in my humble opinion. 

There's good actors, great actors, and incredible ones. Then there's actors that seem to transcend acting in a movie and literally become the characters (and I'm not just talking about method acting). I'm talking about actors that have you convinced you're not watching a script come to life, but instead your watching someone's life.

I believe it is a toss up between these 2. My first pick is Daniel Day Lewis. When I watched him in The Phantom Thread, I was convinced he must be playing himself because there's no way thats an actor pretending to be someone else. Then I saw him in Gangs Of New York and ofcourse my favorite movie, There Will Be Blood. Completely different characters and each felt like they  were played by different actors. Given his reputation I'm sure it's no surprise to many that hes a contender to be one of if not the best actor ever and he deserves that recognition.

The second I'm sure will be very controversial to many, especially given the hundreds of names of big actors. I'm sorry, but it has to be Robin Williams. Yes, I said Robin Williams.

If you've ever seen one of his movies (or if you haven't seen one in a long time), I can assure you that you'll see what I mean and where I'm coming from. Every movie Robin is in feels like someone just bought a camera and filmed his life for a while.

Nothing felt acted, every word feels lived. Every action is heart-felt.

Starts off with a guy robbing a small town bank. When he leaves he makes a slick getaway to his truck a few blocks away. He finally gets in his pick up truck, where he removes a fake beard and moustache, his trucker hat and vest. He might of removed some stuff while walking to the truck (can't fully remember).

It then goes to two boys who are hanging outside their place with three Latino kids. One is a young girl who doesn't talk. The Latino kids parents arrive home and those three kids leave. Then the robber guy almost runs into the two young boys and yells at them, and their mom says hey watch it.

Robber guy goes in his apartment/house and looks for a place to hide his money. He looks in the freezer and various other spots before eyeballing a little attic thing in the ceiling. That's all I saw. It's buuuugging me. Robber dude looked a little like Steve Buschemi.

Regents Park is a two and a half hour walk from Canary Wharf. And London has so much parkland that the city is technically classed as a forest so I'm sure he could have found a closer spot to play Choplifter.  
Lol, live update while I watch.  
After the pickup in Regent's Park is a no go due to them being swarmed by infected, Flynn then tells Doyle he needs to get to Wembley Stadium . . . which is another 2 hour 50 minute walk :)

How did you view this movie?,"I went into Mother! knowing absolutely nothing about it other than it starred Jennifer Lawrence. I watched it cold. I thought to myself Jennifer Lawrence is everywhere on social media, TV interviews, Insta Reels, and of course movies.  I thought to myself I will know if it is a good movie or not base on whether or not I become absorbed in it and forget that it's Jlaw acting in it. Well about a tenth of the way through I realized she was completely absorbed by the role. And the weirder the movie got the more she, the actress, disappeared into it. At first, as things got more and more out of hand, I thought it could turn out to be a weird dark comedy. But things never stopped getting out of hand. Every time I thought it had gone too far, it went even further. It literally took me to the very end to figure out what was going on and even then I had missed a lot of the message. I can tell I liked it and it was a good movie because I'm still thinking about it. Man what a ride it was! I'm dying to hear other people's thoughts and reactions to this movie.

Edit: Interesting. This appears to be a movie one either loves or hates. Very little middle ground. The vast majority of movies are unable to generate this kind of response - creating such a divide. That says something. Most movies I watch are just diversions, forgotten about the next day like a finished comic strip. This one lingers, generating strong feelings one way or another. That seems to me one of the defining qualities of art. So, if nothing else this movie is art.

movies,What do you think happens next?,"What are some of your theories that happens next after the movie is over? This could be for canned sequels or movies that ended but still seemingly have more to the story.

For example, after The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Spidey gets back to it. Harry is still crippled, so he hires Spencer Smythe to help him with Oscorps and on the side they plot to take down Spidey. Harry recruits other villains while recovering and eventually takes the helm of the Sinister 6.

After Alex Garland’s Civil War, Jessie follows in the path of Lee. She gets pretty big and Joel and her go around continuing their job. Joel recognizes he harbors resentment for Jessie basically getting Lee killed and leaves her on her own. Without overhead she gets into more compromised situations taking great shots but ultimately dies young before the war ends.

movies,Den of Thieves is a great heist movie,"I get why people call it Heat for dirtbags, and that's part of the film's charm. I also think it's a great heist movie that stands strong on its own terms.

Here are a few things I love about it:

\- Gerard Butler's Big Nick eats a donut from a crime after his wife kicks him out.

\- The movie does a great job at highlighting how much the criminals have to lose if they fail (50 Cent's character especially).

\- The heist sequence mines tension out of the simplest moments, such as cops asking the criminals (who are posing as cops) for ID. It shows that bureaucratic procedures can be just as nail-biting as gunfights. 

\-Butler's character follows Pablo Schneider's to a gun range and they show off their shooting skills to each other. After Schneider shows up in Butler's apartment, smiles, and walks out. It's a fun way of showing that they're on to each other.

  \- It recreates the Heat diner scene but moves it to a BBQ joint, but instead of having cops and robbers have meaningful conversations about life, they just antagonize each other.

\- The guns are very loud and the bullets are piercing, which is effective in highlighting the danger of firearms.",WorldsBestWrestling,1hcw2h7,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,2024-12-12 21:35:11,32,0.7,32,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcw2h7

movies,Dumbest decisions that unravelled entire movie plots? ,"The butterfly effect is an interesting concept when seen depicted on screen: the idea that a single seemingly insignificant decision can cause a ripple effect leading to a massive consequence. In film, a lot of the time this is usually what causes a downfall, especially in the crime genre. Also usually in the crime genre, it’s usually because of extraordinarily dumb decisions that spark a chain reaction. So what are some of the best examples of dumb decisions that led to an unraveling of a films plot? 

Though there’s a multitude of reasons that added up to cause its downfall, one of my favourites is Artie Piscano’s decision to keep a ledger of his travels to and from Las Vegas despite being specifically told not to. On the one hand it’s pointed out no one could have possibly known about the bug in the store that captured him loudly and recklessly announcing that he had the ledger, especially given that the bug wasn’t even there in relation to the skim, but on the other hand Artie was told very pointedly do not keep a ledger and he still did because the bosses knew what it’d cause if it was ever discovered. Sure enough, at the conclusion of the movie as well as the other points converging the ledger is the silver bullet the FBI needs to sink the whole thing.

movies,Why do movies don't show real props and processes of elaborate things?,"I know the title is a bit confusing but I don't really know how to frame it. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, but I don't know where else to ask it.

What I'm referring to is things like in the Spider-Man movies. The way for the mask to look so perfectly fitting when Peter is using it, is by using a some sort of plastic mold in the front, so that it has the perfectly round shape on top, the straight shape on the sides without the ears popping out, and the chin shape at the bottom. However, in all movies with all 3 spidermen, whenever they take off the mask or whenever the mask is shown separately, it doesn't have that, it just shows the mask as if it was just the fabric, with no shape. Also, the way that the mask fits so perfectly with the suit and doesn't look separated at all is that it really isn't separate, the whole suit is one piece. However, in the movies they show it as if it were separate parts like the mask, the torso, the gloves, and even the the feet as if they were boots.

And what I said about processes, what comes to mind is hair, mostly for men. A lot of times there are actors who in a film have a hairstyle that clearly requires things like hairdryer and product, but according to the movie, the hair just naturally is like that by just drying it with a towel. One example that comes to mind (even though it is in a show and not a movie) Harvey Specter in Suits. Another thing is that an actor has his hair styled a certain way, and then puts on a baseball cap or does a lot of physical activity or gets his hair wet either because of rain or by falling in water, and after that, the hair is still the same. That's literally impossible. And I know a lot of people are going to say ""duh, it's a movie, it's not real"", and I know that, but I think a bit of realism would be appreciated by some.

This is just something that I have been curious about for a long time.",santivega,1hcr93z,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,2024-12-12 18:08:55,0,0.22,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hcr93z

movies,What over-30-year-old movie's quality have you come to appreciate greatly over most made in the last 30?,"I watched the original The Wizard of Oz the other day and hadn't seen it in a while, and, now that I'm much older, was just absolutely in awe at the acting, casting, production quality, set designs, script, camera work, the fact that it not only had color in a 1939 film, but the use of it was better than most movies (for example, a horse that changed colors, ruby red shoes, changing from B/W to color, yellow brick road, green witch, etc.), the fact that it was also a musical... and so on.  I was blown away that it *didn't* get best picture that year (it lost to Gone With The Wind, which I have not yet seen, but based on what I have seen of it, seems wild that it beat TWOO).  

It's no wonder it's a classic and can still be watched to this day and loved.  The true effort and creativity (originality) that went into it is almost unfathomable.  This is also considering the resources and technology (or lack thereof) they had at the time to make such a film.  I miss it as films today seem so low-effort, and are all effects and shock value (which isn't inherently a bad thing, but considering some of the best movies I've ever seen had little to none, it says a lot) with little substance and poorly put together.

So just before the end, a film from the 60s lands [on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) once again.

When I realise that I won't be drawing your attention to this list so often anymore, I'm getting a little wistful. Even if the watchthrough is still to come, my Reddit journey through the filmed Europe is slowly coming to an end... But what an end it is! To be honest, the UK, a country made up of several countries, is actually giving me a bit of a headache. Yesterday we found the first contender for your favorite movie set in UK, when we took a look at movies set in England. But while in the case of England it is strange that it should be a country and at the same time part of a country, its status as a country is in the end comparatively undisputed... and by that I mean the comparison with **Northern Ireland**, which you can read about on Wikipedia after all:

&gt;**Northern Ireland** (Irish: *Tuaisceart Éireann* \[ˈt̪ˠuəʃcəɾˠt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ\] Ulster Scots: *Norlin Airlann*) is a part of the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland that is variously described as a country, province or region.

As an outsider, I just want to shout out: ‘Jeez, finally decide on something!' But to keep the peace and because I'm going to declare a UK winner at the end anyway, I'll leave it that way. But I'll also keep to the usual rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Sing Sing review ,"Sing Sing: 

Now that’s how you make a movie. A completely grounded script that makes you feel emotions on such a deep level that didn’t know was possible from a movie. You can feel the tension in scenes like watching a caged tiger pace up and down staring at you. 

Colman Domingo puts in the performance of a century. The subtleness of his actions, to his breaking point in the movie. He goes to lengths that are completely elegant and alluring. His character work here is truly groundbreaking, like I said when his character reaches that breaking point you feel it all, everything his character is feeling you feel so powerfully. Clarence Maclin does supporting acting and then some. He makes you feel uneasy with the way he walks and his facial expressions but you always feel there’s something underneath the hard exterior. A perfect portrayal of character that’s desperate to protect himself from where he is. I forgot I was watching actors on a screen, everyone totally disappears in to their roles. 

The camera work here is something to behold. The hand held shots are exquisitely displayed. The cinematography like an artists gallery on display. The editing as well is of the highest quality. The score like a melodic symphony that graces your ears. The true essence of the dialogue will leave you hooked on every sentence, every word. 

From its captivating opening to its heart lifting end this movie will you make your heart and soul rise from your body. Everything is orchestrated to perfection. Well and truly revolutionary on all levels.

movies,I really miss Philip Seymour Hoffman,"He just absolutely brought it every time. I recently watched Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, and while not particularly a movie I enjoyed, he didn't fall short of a great performance. Particularly the scene talking to his brother at the bar. I was on a binge last year of his filmography, and I was blown away by I Love Liza as id never seen it before. Such a raw story, raw emotion, he portrayed something perfectly, albeit something I haven't been through and would never want to (as someone who suffers severe depression and is a lover I think losing a lover to suicide would be the hardest thing I could ever imagine). Although I've only watched it maybe twice total now I would consider it a comfort film for me now (is that fucked up?). The sniffing gasoline is both sad and hilarious at the same time, which I think it's intended to be and very well done. I don't want to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.. but when he grabs that pillow I have never felt a gut punch in a movie as hard as that. He was such a talent, and I am truly sad we will not see him in any new roles. A love letter to Philip: Thank you for sharing your talents, we will never stop watching.

1. The Substance (very fun and extra points for originality)

2. Alien: Romulus (also very fun)

3. Wicked (defying gravity! Wonka × Maleficent x Harry Potter)

Honorable mentions that also need a shout-out:

- Anora (admittedly I didn't really get this one but it's a humongous emotional roller coaster that I think again about from time to time)

- The First Omen (refreshing to see evil Christians in a horror movie)

- The Wild Robot (heartwarming and a surprise from DreamWorks)

- Robot Dreams (quite relatable, teaches a good lesson)

Not out yet but I'm looking forward to:

movies,The Most 80's 80's Movie,"Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. 

  
I figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. 

  
So, for example....

  
Back To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. 

  
Top Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks ""80s""

  
But Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there.

movies,"Opinion / discussion: examples of iconic actors (and well written roles I guess) are those who only played a very small movie part, but feel like were much bigger! ","I posted this is r/television, but then thought maybe there are examples in movies too! Original post below:

For example: I was amazed to learn that Shelly Long, who played DeDe Pritchett (ex wife of Jay) in Modern Family, only appeared in 8 episodes (out of the total 250)! I really couldn’t believe it when I read that. I would have never guess that and felt like she really made such an impact that I felt she was in way more episodes.

Another example is for me is Kathy Bates who played Jo Bennett in the office for 8 episodes as the CEO of Sabre (out of 188 episode total). Or can you imagine Game of Thrones without Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo? He was only in 11 episodes out of 73. 

Obviously as the title says it’s not only the actor but also how well written te part is, but still execution is key.

How do you guys feel about this opinion? Or do you feel it’s mostly how well written it is? Do you have any other examples?

movies,Challengers is possibly the worst movie I've seen this year. Why do people love it?,"I'm surprised to see that the critical reception for this movie was so high. Just had the displeasure of watching it in a flight and it was insanely boring.

First of all: it's artificially long. It's only over 2 hours because of excessive slow mo and cuts. That part near the end where Patrick gets warned for stalling and then it takes like 2 minutes for him to serve was infuriating to watch.
The soundtrack is all over the place, some random electronic beatsuthat are suddenly cut off.

The characters are all extremely unlikeable. Art is a major pushover with basically no will of its own, Patrick is a nihilistic womanizer, but Tashi takes the cake. She's probably the most selfish, shallow, self-absorbed and unnecessarily rude/hostile character I've seen in any film for the past years. Her entire purpose is to sow discord, she doesn't care about anyone but herself, she insists she's not a homewrecker but she spends the film symbolically and literally doing that

The plot goes absolutely nowhere, the whole fllm was just a vehicle to see which character you'd end up hating the most.

I saw this movie when I was young, trying to find it on google but to no avail.  
Most of the movie takes place in a building,  
List of things I can remember about the movie.

1. The group was inside the vent, trying to get to the rooftop, but one person was unfortunately killed by the ants in the vents.
2. I remember a zipline scene while hanging trying to get to the other side, a big Ant tried to get someone, he had a gun but he missed, the ant caught up and they both fell down. the man died.

movies,David Lean’s “Brief Encounter” and my paradoxical experience watching “classic” films,"I have a hard time placing my genuine thoughts towards judging older films from before the 60s, mainly stuff around the Hays Code era, as a lot of them maintain a place in the film canon by having been ahead of their time, or at least timeless enough to still be watchable in 2024. Having seen Brief Encounter last night, I didn’t fall in love with it but there are some sparkingly modern filmmaking techniques and creativity that must’ve been distinct at the time. I’m thinking of shots like the dream sequence Celia’s character has when reflected in the train window, it has this ethereal quality to it with the ornate lights that would feel very fitting to a new release today, and the “madness tilt” zoom on her when she contemplates suicide after the man leaves. Plus the whole recontextualisng of the beginning is very slickly done and easy to love. However, and this may be the jaded part of refusing myself emotional attachment to it, but like lots of classic revered titles I can’t tell if I like it for the film or the filmmaking. It’s difficult to decipher where my investment in the story ends with a recognition of how ahead-of-its-time a certain film was. 

This could be a wider humbug I have when it comes to my personal assessment of films in the “canon” and at the risk of overcomplicating matters, but when they have such a long reputation and are held up in every conversation about being essential viewing and/or revolutionary, it feels like an inevitable shadow on the film as I’m watching. I’m not just watching Brief Encounter, I’m watching David Lean’s universally acclaimed 1945 classic Brief Encounter. 

If this post ends up sounding more like an overly verbose rephrasing of “letting expectations hamper my viewing experience” then apologies for that, but it’s an issue I encounter regularly whenever I dip my toes into this circle of the movie world.

movies,The Wackness (2008) nails the 90s New York atmosphere. ,"If you don't know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it's worth the hour and 40 minutes.
 

First of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography.  The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. 

Most of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my view you could see Dr Squires trying to help Luke so he doesn't become him. I think the movie shows that if Luke is in the same direction he is in he will end up like Squires. Honesty Luke and Squires have the best chemistry and scenes together. And the way they written Squires wife relationship and Luke and Stephanie relationship is great.
 
It also has a great soundtrack. If you love 90s hiphop the film and actually fits in with the movie well. 

And the movie has great commentery. The movie portrays 90s New York problems well with Rudy Giuliani drug war aganist weed as a supporting part of the story. 


The only problem i have is Josh Pecks acting. I think this is one of those rare times where a character is written well but the actor isn't great. Josh Peck does more better in comedic roles and his acting isn't good in this film. I don't know how you describe it but Josh Peck has trouble portraying a pot head in this story.

At the beginning of the movie Vincent is walking through a airport and bumps into a character played by Jason Statham.  They both drop identical briefcases and then exchange them.  We then follow Vincent on his journey but we have never revisited what Jason’s character may have been off to.  It’s provides perfect foreshadowing for a second movie loosely based on the plot of the first one (drama with drug cartels, law enforcement, litigation etc).  I always thought that Michael Mann would revisit this moment.  He could start a movie with this exact scene again and then follow Jason’s character as Vincent walks off.  Thoughts?

movies,Recent movie styles/trends that you don't like? ,"I've noticed that most movies tend to become more of the same, especially this:

\- Action movie that tries to be nitty gritty? Lower the colors, make everything green/gray and film shaky hand style during the adrenaline/fight scene. During the 2000's, the movies would try to at least choreograph an admirable fight scene and the camera 's point of view would be at least steady

\- There are almost no epilogues for romantic movies. They basically roll the credits as soon the couple kiss. We don't get a moment to catch our breath or appreciate whatever is happening and boom the credits starts. The epilogues doesn't even need to be a 5 minute if you want to cheapen the budget. Just a minute or something to show what the future holds. Even the side characters doesn't really get their side plot resolved or hear about it what happened.

\- Movie intro. In the 90's en 00's, we would hear music, the introduction names start, we see the main character start their morning/life/moment and there is a minute of no talk. We just get a sense of what their life is before the main plot starts. Now it's bam, immediately start and it takes us a lot more minutes before finding out the gist and we have to remember everything because of possible plot relevance. And the title comes just before the credits roll.

\- Car riding scenes: 80's and early 90's could get away with this because the technology wasn't quite there yet: Green screen driving. Back then, they could hide this by filming in the dark and have the character sway the wheel furiously from left to right and back to indicate he/she is driving all while telling us the problem in thoughts. Nowadays they film with a green screen, especially when we see it from sideways. The scenery is also a bit blurry, giving us a stark contrast when the characters and the car itself is in crisp 4K quality. I see this style getting back more and more.

What is your thing that you don't like, that has been happening lately? I'm not asking about the main character grabbing a toast from a full breakfast spread and heading off examples.

movies,Meet the Fockers 4,"With the recent announcement of Meet the Fockers 4 being in production, I would like to share the two ideas/predictions I had for what the plot will be. My girlfriend and I love the movies so we’re really excited for this fourth installment (I literally had not watched it until last year, safe to say I loved it). Also, regardless of what the movie is about, my girlfriend had a great idea for the name: “Everything’s Focked”. I’ll start with the best prediction my girlfriend and I came up with and then I’ll throw in the second backup guess. The most likely thing that we see happening is a repeat of the first movie, but instead with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro WORKING TOGETHER to do the same thing that was done to Ben years ago. We pictured Stiller (or Greg) having a daughter, and him going through the same situation that Deniro (or Jack) was going through in the first movie. We think that either 

A.) Robert deniro will help stiller to investigate his daughters new bf with all of the gadgets and such he possesses
or 

B.) Greg realizes that he’s acting exactly like Jack, and even when he tries to stop himself, he can’t help but see the similarities (when it comes to their daughters)

The last throw away idea we had was a huge family reunion, where we see all of the aunts, uncles, and cousins from the Focker family, and they have to interact and get along with the cousins and such from the Byrnes family. Anyways, that was our ideas. Lmk what you think and whether you agree! Honestly, I think the first idea is very likely, and if it’s not done, then i think it would be a miss that they definitely should’ve taken.

movies,Deja Vu (2006),"So I just watched this, and I'm confused about the third act.

The movie very strongly suggests that there is only one, immutable timeline in the manner of 12 Monkeys.

We learn that the main character's partner is inexplicably killed in the ferry attack. Later we see the scientists send a warning back, which is intercepted by the partner and explains why he was killed. This is one timeline then: that note was *always* there for the partner to find

When the main character himself goes back in time, everything he does is stuff that already happened. His finger prints were found all over the house because he'd *always* traveled back in time to touch stuff. The bloody tissue was on the garbage because he'd *always* gone back in time to leave it there, etc. In this scene he realizes that this has always happened this way and then... suddenly changes things?

Did I miss something, or is this a glaring plot hole? He's been trying to use his knowledge of the future to change things for half the films runtime, only to be consistently thwarted with the realization that he'd *always* done those things. His foreknowledge consistently fails him because by trying to apply it, he's just ensuring that things happen the way they already happened. So how is he able to just suddenly change things at the end?

movies,The Real Reason Landa Kills Hammersmark - Inglorious Basterds,"Landa mentions after capturing Aldo that he was a detective before the war. I think this is supposed to be a clue for us that he can figure out what happened at the bar. He sees shoes on the ground, blood from a low impact shot, knows that whoever the shoes belong to was shot low, then laid on the ground for a while. 

He sees the corpse of Wilhelm ( guy with newborn son Max) lying not far away, with no weapon, and with some of his detective work, notices that Wilhelm has been shot from a low angle with a low-caliber pistol, from the spot where the blood and shoes are. He sees the napkin which confirms that Hammersmark knew that she was killing an un-armed man with a newborn son. 

Landa has already been shown not to kill without reason, and he seems to genuinely care about some people (like Shoshanna and the soldier at the end of the movie who is killed by Aldo). I think he proves to himself that Hammersmark killed a drunk, unarmed, and fearful new father, and regardless of what comes next, decides that she deserves to die for those actions. 

When Landa is asked what happens to Hammersmark, he says she got what she deserved. I think many would assume it's because she is a traitor, but that would make him a hypocrite a few moments later when he chooses to betray the Nazi regime. I think what he really means is that she got what she deserved for killing Wilhelm.

I was watching Elizabeth (1998) and am confused about a particular scene.
A Duke from France who happens to be the nephew of Mary of Guise comes to England to ask the hand of Queen Elizabeth for marriage. 

She of course is reluctant because of her ongoing affair with Lord Robert. 

Then during a party, she goes to the room of the Duke and catches him in a dress. He is drunk and dressed like woman. Does this imply that he was gay ? Or is this just a lord doing lord things. 

Also, she proceeds to extend her hand to be kissed by the Duke but he is obviously embarrassed by this. He reluctantly agrees and does not even kiss it properly. 
Why ? Can men in dress not kiss the hands of a Queen ? Why was he embarrassed and so reluctant for this.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-jc-chandor-1236083842/) (20/100):

&gt;Punishingly dull.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):

&gt;I’ve seen much worse comic-book movies than “Kraven the Hunter,” but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn’t stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That’s a dereliction of duty, but it’s one I didn’t commit on purpose. I simply hadn’t bothered to think about it.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):

&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don’t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, “Kraven the Hunter” might be very, very bad (and by “might be” I mean “almost objectively is”), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today’s audiences might consider as “good.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):

&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

&gt;Crowe’s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there’s not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it’s best that this misbegotten series quits while it’s just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

movies,Just got done rewatching The Green Mile.,"The Green Mile is my favorite movie of all time, along with Fight Club and another Darabont/King film, The Shawshank Redemption. But what Mile has over Shawshank is the supernatural and stronger religious themes. 

I love all the characters here, with my favorite being Paul Edgecomb. His character arc and relationship with John Coffey is so sad, but also so sweet. The way he starts to believe in miracles and actually offers John a way out is such compelling character writing. As is his relationship with Brutus and Dean. 

Wild Bill is a threatening antagonist, and you truly learn to hate him. Very satisfying seeing him get what he deserves.

John Coffey is a true miracle of God. A man who heals and helps people, and who sees the good and bad in everyone on Earth. His death had me bawling like a baby, and his dialogue is some of the best in the film. His execution is my personal favorite scene in film history for how well-executed and emotional it is.

movies,"""John Q."" (2022), featuring Denzel Washington, feels very much of the moment right now","I was in High School when John Q. came out and it really was the first movie to expose me to the US healthcare system.  As a healthy teenager with an upper middle class upbringing, my only first hand knowledge of health care system was getting shots, physicals, etc.  Nothing major.

Watching this movie opened my eyes to the horrors of our health care system and has stayed with me all these years.  I know it isn't a great movie by any means but it made an impression on me of a man who would do anything for his child in a system you expect to help him.

The books can turn into a franchise, honestly. Movie #1 could be The Maze of Bones, Movie # 2 could be One False Note and Movie # 3 could be The Sword Thief and so forth. Perhaps the Vespers vs. Cahills storyline could be built up in a movie or two and the final movie could have the Vesper family face off against the Cahills.

movies,"Pedro Almodóvar's style and writing doesn't translate well in English in ""The Room Next Door""","I wanted to like Pedro Almodóvar because Almodóvar was my childhood idol when I became obsessed with Cinema and I identified with his vision. His worldwide success after Todo Sobre Mi Madre was exciting because the world could see his genius. 

For years, I've been wanting to see Almodóvar cross over into English and after I got to watch ""The Room Next Door"", it might be a case of his style, his trademark, doesn't translate well into English. 

Because the way he writes and directs didn't change, it's always been slightly theatrical, big yet subtle at the same time when it comes with his writing, and in Spanish and the way Spanish actors accostumed with Almodóvar are, it works, yet in English, it's distracting. It's more wooden and stagy and some of the dialogue comes off as contrived. 

Yet I wouldn't call ""The Room Next Door"" a bad film, because of the use of colors, the direction, the way Almodóvar shoots scenes with symbolism and the importance of sets, and, of course, Tilda Swinton is excellent (as usual) as a dying woman who chooses euthanasia. She is fascinating and you can't take your eyes away from her. Julianne Moore is good, it's just, she's more of an observer, she exists to support Swinton, and as a result, her character ends up being underwritten. John Turturro shows up a few times to spout stuff about the world ending, I didn't like how forced his dialogue was. At one point, I thought the film was going to create a triangle when Swinton expresses interest in attending a event hosted by Turturro and it ends up being quickly interrupted.",Davis_Crawfish,1hc0ufi,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc0ufi/pedro_almodóvars_style_and_writing_doesnt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc0ufi/pedro_almodóvars_style_and_writing_doesnt/,2024-12-11 18:51:10,0,0.38,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hc0ufi
movies,Highlander - What if Kurgan had won?  Could he really do anything?,"This is a very old movie with well know ending, so need to spoiler tag.   Don't read any further if you somehow haven't seen Highlander after 40 years.

There were lines in the movie where Ramirez (Sean Connery) warned Connor that they couldn't let The Kurgan win the prize, or mankind would enter a terrible darkness and never recover.

But what if Kurgan had beaten Connor, and won the prize?   What could he really have done to the world?  As we saw in Connor's closing comments during the ending, he became mortal.   He did say he ""knew everything"" and could basically understand everyone in the worlds feelings and intentions.

So if their worst fear came true and the Kurgan won - so what?  He is now mortal and can be killed.   How would he topple the worlds governments who were defended by massive Armies, war machines, and technology?  

The Kurgan would be the best swordsman in the world which would be meaningless in the 1980s.   He would have a great understanding of people and be able to manipulate SOME people do his bidding, but it doesn't seem like he could really surpass the level of ""local kingpin""

Any thoughts on what ""prize Kurgan"" could actually do to the world?

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 1 - England,"Hello there,

since over one and a half month I'm asking you for your favorite movie in a certain european country once a day. This was very easy for me in the last round: I can't announce a winner yet, because the 24 hours aren't up yet (I'm a bit early today, as I have plans for later - yes, there is an RL outside of Reddit), so stay tuned, but all in all, Ukraine is still and hopefully will continue to be an independent country. But when it comes to today's country, it is sometimes a little difficult to understand, at least for me as an outsider.

I know, I know, Wikipedia can never be the last source, but let's take a look on it here. When it comes to the UK, it clearly says:

&gt;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.

At the same time, you can read on another article:

&gt;Since 1922, the United Kingdom has been made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales (which collectively make up Great Britain) and Northern Ireland (avoriously described as a country, province, jurisdiction or region.

Further internet research has shown that not only for me as a non-native speaker, but also for the British themselves, it is sometimes not so clear where their country begins and their state ends. Even here in the discussion group I have even read that the UK is not a country at all, then again that it is a country made up of several countries (sometimes by one and the same person). It's all quite confusing, but I think I've found a solution that I can live with.

Today we're going to start with films set in **England**. Over the next few days, we'll do the same with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On the fifth day, the respective individual winners will then compete against each other again, so that we have a winner for the UK, but also winners for the individual ‘sub-countries’. I think that's a lot of effort, but hey, even if I think the UK members should sort out once and for all whether they want to be federal states or separate countries, I can't ignore the actual situation. In return, I ask you not to ignore the following two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Watching Dead Man (1995) and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) back-to-back is a unique experience,"*Dead Man* is an acid western in which a wounded accountant named William Blake teams up with a strange Native American man named Nobody, who happens to be a fan of the artist William Blake and believes the accountant is a vengeful reincarnation of the more famous Blake. The movie plays with western tropes, but it is mostly a somber meditation on death.

*Ghost Dog* is more modern and less bizarre, but it explores many of the same themes and features a similarly heightened reality in which a masterful modern assassin takes strong influence from the Hagakure as he works for (and then against) a bunch of old wiseguys.

They're both unconventional independent action-thrillers by Jim Jarmusch. Both feature a protagonist who acts as a personification of death, often effortlessly killing various stereotypes (cowboys, gangsters). Both films are very philosophical and artistic, but in different ways.

In addition to death and philosophy, the two films are also quite amusing. Jarmusch's dry sense of humor contrasts well with the dark plots full of murder. I like that there's nothing flashy about either movie's world. Dead Man makes the old west feel like a dirty and miserable playground for deranged weirdos, and in Ghost Dog the modern city run by gangsters looks totally mundane and unglamorous, an environment plagued by elderly has-been punks with guns.

The subdued reality of the world and its villains allows the heightened reality of the heroes to shine. There's nothing really superhuman about Blake or Ghost Dog, but the way they intensely associate themselves with death and the fatalism that breeds puts them on another level than the basic bad guys they do battle with.

movies,What is the most well-rounded (not necessarily best) film all time?,"Everyone has their favorite film, but what is one you have to admit is the most well rounded?

By definition, a well rounded film should have these attributes

1. Quality - Be a quality film, obviously. Within the script, acting, scenes and soundtrack 

2. Good Length - Have an average run time not too long or short 

3. Highly Accessible - Able to watch with almost types of audiences, including film critics and casual viewers. Not too niche of a topic or style.

4. Rewatchability - Is able to be rewatched multiple times without fatigue

—-

For me, I feel Terminator 2: Judgement day has it all. You can watch it with your dad or with film nerds. It has high cultural influence, great ending and action sequences that give it an easy rewatch. The pacing is great, and doesn’t have long drawn out sequences. The soundtrack is simple yet fits the movie perfectly. Also, While watching T1 makes it better, I don’t think it’s completely necessary for the average viewer.

movies,Ariana DeBose needs a better agent,"TL;DR: Ariana DeBose's movies after WSS aren't very good. Hopefully that changes soon. If not then she needs to give her agent the boot.

This isn't something only exclusive to her (looking at you Tom Holland, though things are looking up for you), but I'm shocked by how drastic of a downturn Ariana DeBose's career took after West Side Story. That movie put her in the spotlight and even won her an Oscar! Yet every movie she's been in after that has been panned by both audiences and critics.

I.S.S was the first movie she stared in after WSS, which released on January 2023. For the uninformed January is seen as a dumping month for movies which studios think won't do well. That movie bombed at the box office despite a low $13 million budget and received average reviews.

Then she voiced the main character in Wish. I think we all know what happened with that movie. It flopped, making $255 million on a $175–200 million budget. Don't forget movies need to make 2.5x their budget to make a profit. I remember a lot of people on social media and irl making fun of the movie's animation, story and songs. It was seen as an embarrassment to Disney, especially since it was meant to celebrate their 100th anniversary.

In 2024 she starred in Agrylle. The movie was meant to launch a new franchise but it bombed and was ridiculed by critics and audiences. I know many people see it as a low point in Vaughn's career. Tbf her role in that movie was very minor but still.

This likely went under your radar as it's a streaming movie released on Amazon Prime but she stared in a horror movie called House of Spoils where she plays an evil chef I think. Cool premise but unfortunately it's produced by Blumhouse and you know how all their recent output has been like lately. It didn't make much splash but from what I can tell it was received quite negatively by both critics and audiences.

Later this month the 8 people still invested in Sony's Spider-Manless Cinematic Universe will be seeing her again in Kraven the Hunter. Tbh I actually think this movie's reception won't too bad, or at least not as bad as Morbius and Madame Web. I can totally see people calling it a fun turn-off-your-brain popcorn flick. But I really doubt it'll get higher than a 65% on the tomatometer.

Finding out that she was going to be in Kraven the Hunter was what prompted me to write this ridiculously long post (that and the fact that I have a lot of free time.). To be completely hyperbolic, this was what broke me and caused me to write all this out. I admit that I've never seen a single movie she's been in but I have seen clips of WSS and she was phenomenal in it. She's a scene stealer man, not just because she looks absolutely stunning but because of her amazing acting and singing. She deserves a better career man. I'd hate to see such talent be reduced to such poor and ill-fitting roles.

Not all hope is lost for her tho, next years she'll be in Love Hurts, also staring Ke Huy Quan. I have really high hopes for that movie as I love Ke Huy Quan and the premise sounds really fun! She's also staring in two other upcoming movies which don't have release dates yet. Those may be good. Who knows. I hope they are. If all three of her upcoming movies end up terrible then she ought to fire her agent cause man is she squandering her skills and potential. Of course I'm not saying gonna end up in poverty if she keeps getting bad movie roles but I do think it's odd she hasn't been in a single hit since WSS.

movies,What do you think will happen when the Hobbit enters the public domain?,"J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth franchise began way back in 1937, with the release of the Hobbit. The Hobbit has been adapted twice, once back in 1977 as an animated movie, and again as a live action trilogy, between 2012 and 2014. 

However, something that often goes unnoticed, is that we're creeping up on the date in which the Hobbit novel, will be available to the public domain. In 2034, the original Hobbit novel will enter the public domain, at least according to an article I read recently. 

Given how people had issues with both the original animated adaptation and the Peter Jackson trilogy, I'm curious to know what you think of the idea that anyone will be able to try adapting the Hobbit for themselves. Do you think it's a bad idea, or could we see a more faithful adaptation come about as a result? Or do you think the market will get over-cluttered with poor retellings of the story?

I myself see a lot of potential here. A fledgling studio could use the Hobbit to turn their fortunes around for instance, or a rival major studio to WBD, could try beating them at their own game. Universal Studios, who owns the rights to the LEGO movie franchise, could easily do their own LEGO adaptation of the original book if they so wanted to. Even if the worst comes to pass and the Hobbit gets adapted into a horror movie, like Steamboat Willie and Winnie the Pooh already have, I'd still be down for a horror movie about Middle-earth. I still think that could work wonders if handled correctly.

movies,What if Sergio Leone made Leningrad: The 900 Days?,"Question, What if Sergio Leone never died and managed to make Leningrad: The 900 Days?

On what I am saying, While finishing work on Once Upon a Time in America in 1982, Leone was impressed with Harrison Salisbury's non-fiction book The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad, and he planned on adapting the book as a war epic. Although no formal script had been completed or leaked, Leone came up with the opening scene and basic plot. According to the documentary Once Upon a Time, Sergio Leone, the film opened in medias res as the camera goes from focusing on a Russian hiding from the Nazis' artillery fire to panning hundreds of feet away to show the German Panzer divisions approaching the walls of the city. The plot was to focus on an American photographer on assignment (whom Leone wanted to be played by Robert De Niro) becoming trapped in Russia as the German Luftwaffe begin to bombard the city. Throughout the course of the film, he becomes romantically involved with a Russian woman, whom he later impregnates, as they attempt to survive the prolonged siege and the secret police, because relationships with foreigners are forbidden. According to Leone, ""In the end, the cameraman dies on the day of the liberation of the city, when he is currently filming the surrender of the Germans. And the girl is aware of his death by chance seeing a movie news: the camera sees it explode under a shell .... ""

By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire $100 million in financing from independent backers, and the film was to be a joint production with a Soviet film company. He had convinced Ennio Morricone to compose the film score, and Tonino Delli Colli was tapped to be the cinematographer. Shooting was scheduled to begin sometime in 1990. The project was canceled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film.

Now, Since Sergio Leone never had a script, it's hard to know whether the film would go, but I think, given Leone's track record, I really think this film would've a been another masterpiece. I am just sadden that Sergio died just only 2 days before he was to sign on to this film, and one thing that amazes me is that Leone managed to acquired 100 Million just for this project, probably making it one of the most expensive film projects is it actually got made?

All in All, What do you think? What if Sergio Leone never died and managed to make Leningrad: The 900 Days?

How do you think the film would of been received?",FreshmenMan,1hbn3fi,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbn3fi/what_if_sergio_leone_made_leningrad_the_900_days/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbn3fi/what_if_sergio_leone_made_leningrad_the_900_days/,2024-12-11 06:07:37,0,0.36,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbn3fi

movies,"Another ""The Prestige"" post asking for some clarification","Hi everyone! I know... 9 years late to the party hahaha. I love this movie so much I had to watch it twice in once sitting.

I won't lie... I was looking for a suggestion to ""Now You See Me"" as I enjoy the over the top heist movies that don't take themselves too seriously (think Rick and Morty heist hyperbole and not Fast and Furious). I saw the movie ""The Prestige"" pop up multiple times, but since it was often coupled by overt animosity towards the person asking for movie recommendations similar to ""Now You See Me"", I had assumed it was a sarcastic recommendation, and thus also accidentally mistook the suggestion for ""The Purge"", thinking these people where being malicious with their recommendations; but I digress.

The actual question I have involves the jail scene, in which Jess visits Alfred accompanied by Lord Caldlow; whom we immediately learn is actually Angier. They have a heated transaction, and Alfred frantically grabs Jess's attention and says, ""I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise. I promise. Look"" and after he pulls the red ball out from behind her ear, he repeats, ""I promise"" and ends the transaction with, ""I love you. I love you. I love you Jess."" We're not privy to the details, but we learn that in fact, Alfred is a portmanteau of the first names of the twin Borden brothers Albert and Frederick, so that means either Albert or Frederick is in jail. Well... to be accurate, we learn that Alfred is actually the single identity born from the shared lives of the twin Borden brothers, without really learning any names. These names I've learned from extensive Google warrioring. Anyway, I'm led to believe that Frederick is the one in jail, especially since he opens by saying to Jess, ""I've missed you so much. Fallon's missed you too. We both have."" Meaning that the one in jail is not Jess's father, and that leads me to believe it is then Frederick, who is the who who has been cold to Sarah Borden, Albert's wife.

I guess I'm just confused because If Frederick is the one who is in jail, and is the one who is ultimately hanged, I just find it odd that he showed such an overwhelming amount of love and concern for Jess. Especially since he was incapable of showing that affection towards his sister in law, which led her to her eventual suicide. That didn't seem like an act to me. It didn't feel like he was just trying to use her to garner sympathy enough to get out of jail. It didn't feel like he was acting for the sake of the daughter. The scene to me felt very real, and very self-less might I add. It feel like he was truly worried about her well being and how she would cope after him. I think the magic trick with the ball—a signature ""Borden"" gesture, was meant to reassure her in a familiar, comforting manner, maintaining the illusion of stability knowing that he was at an end the moment he learned of Caldlow's true identity. And that, is where I'm confused, if that's true, why would he have that kind of feeling towards his niece. Why did he comfort her so desperately when he could even do the same for Sarah?

Oh, I guess as I further think on this as I try to organize my thoughts into a coherent Reddit post, I again want to point at his coldness towards Sarah; and I want to supplement that with the fact that he \*immediately\* chased Olivia after Sarah's passing, leading to her leaving him as well. She was unsettled by how little her death affected him, and how quickly he moved on to his mistress. To me, this leads me to believe that Frederick is not much of an actor. I don't believe he's able to fake love, and that reinforces my thought that what he shows towards Jess is genuine and true; and again, I just want to know why? Unless of course, it was not Frederick in the jail cell.",Aerothix,1hbkl85,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,2024-12-11 03:40:15,0,0.4,0,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbkl85

movies,2000s Cliche lines/tropes,"Hello all! About a while back on social media, there was a steady stream of jokes involving early 2000s movies, marvel movies, etc. where people would act and recreate cliched scenes we’ve all seen before such as: 

“He’s right behind me… isn’t he?” 

Or people stacking on top of each other to watch something from afar, 

or even the classic “I’ve got it! I’ve got it… guess I don’t have it.” Type of line.

Long story short: I’ve created a one act comedy play based on those joke lines and I’d like to try my hand at making it into a two act play for a local writing competition. Problem is, the trend is far over and I’d like to open it up to you guys for inspiration!

What’re generic cliched lines or tropes from early 2000s movies that you guys remember? 

On top of that: Was there ever a plot twist or character archetype that was so constantly used that you expected it to be in a story created around that time?

movies,I'm still confused by 'The Platform' and 'The Platform 2',"I have seen both movies, but I'm still confused on a couple of things (I'm going to reference both):

* The platform shoots to the top really fast, but what happens when the platform approaches Level 0? Does it slow down or does it immediately stop?  If it immediately stops then I don't think either the child or the panna cotta at the end of the first movie would be intact if either was sent up. The child would likely go splat on the ceiling like a squashed berry. The panna cotta wouldn't be intact either. Otherwise, the platform would need to slow down as it approaches the top, whereby some prisoners could possibly attempt to jump on? I guess this is a plot point that is just never explained?
* Does a child being placed at the bottom level at the end of the second movie confirm that the child at the bottom in the first movie was NOT in fact imaginary? THAT was the possible ending that really happened, and not the other one with the panna cotta being sent up?
* There are cannibals beneath the pit which survive on dead bodies and their parts that fall down the hole? And who are these cannibals? Are these all prisoners that descended to the bottom of the pit with a child over time? 
* Lastly, so either the platform suddenly stopping or the cannibals at the bottom are the things that make the prison completely escape proof? So if a prisoner rides the platform down to the very bottom they are simply killed by the cannibals? Or if they have a child they are just pulled off by the cannibals, the prisoner joins the cannibals, and the child is sent up and is supposedly not killed at the top by the sudden deceleration? 

Am I understanding it all correctly? Or is this just terrible writing?

movies,The Substance is way too long for what it is and suffers greatly for it.,"Don't get me wrong Demi and Dennis' performances were great and the movie was thematically strong and has some of the best use of practical effects I've seen in recent film. However, the damn movie is just too long. It's not hard to surmise what will happen once the exposition is through. Demi will recapture her youth but only a week at a time, or else? Surely she won't disobey those orders! Surely ""Remember, you are one"" is not a foreboding warning that underlines the entire theme of the movie? And there's nothing wrong with telegraphing your thematic intentions and then leaning into them, but when you do that you need to make it snappy. The middle section of the movie drags so hard because you know what's coming the whole time and instead of getting that, you get stiff dialog and a few gross out scenes. It felt like sitting at the dinner table watching the food get cold. It's being heralded for its message, which is a good one, but it's also not a complicated one and it DEFINITELY did not need almost 150 minutes to be delivered.


I'll also mention that I get what the idea was with all of the intense sexualization of Sue, but the movie falls into the trap of being popular for the things it's trying to denigrate. Sex sells and that sucks for women, but also, let's make an over the top sexualized movie and hey, look, people love it. It ends up feeling like virtue signaling mixed with hipocracy via naivete.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Ukraine,"Hello there,

I've been asking you for your favourite film every day for almost a month and a half now, and the journey is gradually coming to an end. Following an alphabetical order, in which the United Kingdom will soon be duly dissected, I arrived at the letter T yesterday. Today I can now announce the winner for Turkey: To be honest, I'm not familiar with ***Bir Zamanlar Anadolu’da*** (engl.: *Once Upon A Time in Anatolia*) yet, but it really s to touch the heart of this project and to provide an as entertaining as accurate look into the country.

When it comes to the next country, some would say that it is particularly important nowadays that films can offer us a real insight into the country's current condition: I'm talking about **Ukraine**. But please take note: Since *20 днів у Маріуполі* (engl.: *20 Days in Mariupol*) would actually be an obvious suggestion as a prominent documentary film, I would like to explicitly point out  what was always implicitly clear to everyone in the previous rounds, namely that documentaries are excluded from [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). Apart from that, the following two rules apply as always:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Can we talk about Apple TV movies?,"This week I saw three Apple TV movies:

Napoleon

Killers of the Flower Moon

The Instigators.

Whilst The Instigators was a tragic waste of talent, the first two imo were both resounding successes. Both fine, magnificent movies cinematically speaking. I’d read bad things about both (too long, inaccurate etc) but on a purely cinematic level, both these movies delivered and I applaud Apple TV for these. 

I’m genuinely excited what Apple TV can offer. The only downside is that I can only watch it in my iPhone as when viewed on my television the picture breaks up. That’s quite a major problem especially as Ridley Scott has publicly voiced his disapproval of watching movies on phones. 

Anyway, I think I might watch Blitz next. I have reservations about this one too but, seriously, after The instigators, surely it won’t be on that level of badness. It looks as if it will offer something of substance at the very least.

movies,Movies featuring producers or execs as characters,"Hey all ! I'm currently working on a project involving the criticism of Hollywood as a system. While I have lots of ideas for the outside side of things, it seems like the powers that finance don't really like to give money to people who will criticize them. Though I've noticed that movie execs with questionable morals seem to be a reoccurring theme (the three exemple that immediately come to mind are *The Player, Boogie Nights* and *Wag the Dog*).

I don't think the subject has been studied in academics yet (if it haas been, please let me know) so I need to call upon your collective intelligence to find some answers to my questions.

I'm looking for films featuring movie producers characters, not necessarily as antagonists or presented in a negative way.

movies,Biggest Filmmaker ,"Who according to you are among the Top 5 Biggest ( most influential ) filmmakers in the world currently , of this era ( 2007-present ) ?



According to me -

1. Christopher Nolan - Probably the most famous and commercially/critically successful filmmaker of this Era .
With movies like The Dark Knight , Inception , Interstellar , Dunkirk , Oppenheimer under his belt , I certainly presume that no one even comes close to his invincibility .




2. Bong Joon Ho - With masterpieces like Mother , Snowpiercer , Okja , and Parasite , he nearly misses the first spot solely on the basis of lack of global recognition compared to Nolan. But definitely on the same level on the basis of the quality of content when compared to Nolan.




3. Martin Scorsese  - This era has been sort of a second phase of Scorsese's cinematic journey imo. It feels as if in the current phase of Scorsese , he is not making movies for them to be great classics but just for enjoying the privilege of creating real "" old school "" cinema in a world which is largely dominated by movies which feels more like factory produced products for consumer's satisfaction.
His Shutter Island , Wows , Silence , The Irishman , and Killers of the flower moon are 
' breeze of fresh air ' .





4. Wes Anderson   - One of the most unique filmmakers of recent times , his distinctive style and artistic approach has cemented his position among the great comedy filmmakers of all time.




5. Denis Villeneuve  - Probably the best ' spectacle movie ' director in the world with his movies like Arrival , Blade Runner 2049 , Dune  achieving the perfect balance between being extremely well made and thoroughly entertaining .",Beefyvalkyrie,1hbae2h,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbae2h/biggest_filmmaker/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbae2h/biggest_filmmaker/,2024-12-10 19:45:54,0,0.35,0,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbae2h

movies,Hunting Matthew Nichols (2024),"I just caught this Hunting *Matthew Nichols* (2024) at the Whistler Film Festival last weekend and really wanted to put it on people's radars, especially if you love horror. [https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols](https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols)

I did not know ANYTHING about this movie before I went in to see it and that's the best way to experience it. It won me over because the story about this woman searching for her missing brother is interesting. The atmosphere is dripping. Literally because they filmed in December on Vancouver Island, showcasing really dark, rainy and super foreboding/dread tone. The deeper they get into the woods the eerier it gets. It's strangely grounded and absorbing. It's decently-shot, but what I appreciate is it's a nice slow burn. It builds and builds to one of the tensest, scariest movies I've seen in years. Closest I can compare is UNCUT GEMS,  in style, realism and oh-my-GOD tension.

It's a locally produced Vancouver indie so a lot of the audience had heard about it through family, friends or colleagues, myself included. I showed up 20 minutes early and most movies at the Whistler film fest don't have crazy lines. This one day. I barely got in via the rush line, they had 10 spots open and I was the eighth. So it was a full up theatre.

If you love Netflix crime documentaries or movies like *Paranormal Activity* and *Blair Witch Project*, give this one a go!",Count3D,1hba2w3,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hba2w3/hunting_matthew_nichols_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hba2w3/hunting_matthew_nichols_2024/,2024-12-10 19:32:39,3,0.71,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1hba2w3

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-astonishes-young-bob-dylan-james-mangolds-thrilling-musical-drama-1236199254/):

&gt;At the center of this all is a remarkable performance by Timothee Chalamet who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lyp-synching or blending of voices between actor and subject. It is all Chalamet in the same way *Walk The Line* was all Phoenix and Witherspoon, and *Coal Miner’s Daughter* was all Spacek.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-james-mangold-1236081991/) (70):

&gt;Whatever script flaws there are in terms of structure, plot momentum and an opaque central character, *A Complete Unknown* offers rewards in its lived-in performances and in the exhilarating music sequences that propel it forward. For many audiences with an affection for Dylan’s music and the era in general, that will be enough.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (39/100):

&gt;A superficial illustration of the artist’s allure, interspersed with endless, increasingly comical shots of people watching him perform and smiling beatifically.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation) (100):

&gt;Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It’s all rise, but troubled and unclear. You might not buy Chalamet’s Dylan at first; I didn’t, until that Guthrie bedside scene. There is amazing bravado in this performance.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/10/bob-dylan-movie-review-a-complete-unknown/76857860007/) (3.5/4):

&gt;“A Complete Unknown” is that rare biopic that leaves you wanting to watch it again *and* go on a Spotify deep dive, and you're apt to find new respect both for Dylan as a bluesy contrarian and Chalamet as a top-shelf thespian of his generation.

[Collider](https://collider.com/a-complete-unknown-review/) (80):

&gt;James Mangold's A Complete Unknown explores the music of Bob Dylan with fantastic care and a great performance by Timothée Chalamet.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan) (70):

&gt;Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold takes his hands off the steering wheel for A Complete Unknown, resulting in a Bob Dylan biopic that takes unpredictable turns. Rather than connecting the dots between how the world influenced him (and how he influenced it in turn), the film frames his enormous musical sea changes as personal drama for his peers. It’s formally straightforward, but its focus on the characters in Dylan’s life – rather than the musician himself, played by Timothée Chalamet – turn him into an enigma, for better or worse.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-complete-unknown-bob-dylan-movie-review-b2661910.html) (60):

&gt;Despite the drip-fed reminders of contemporary history (the Cuban Missile Crisis! the Kennedy assassination! Weren’t the Sixties wild, man!), A Complete Unknown struggles to fully engage with Dylan’s relationship to that intersection between politics and music.

Written and Directed by James Mangold:

&gt;The film follows the life and career of musician [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) from January 1961, when he moves from Minnesota to New York City, to his 1965 concert at the [Newport Folk Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival), resulting in [controversy over the use of electric instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy).",MarvelsGrantMan136,1hb6hbb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hb6hbb/a_complete_unknown_review_thread/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hb6hbb/a_complete_unknown_review_thread/,2024-12-10 17:02:33,189,0.82,189,0,146,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1hb6hbb
movies,Old Guy | Official Trailer | Paramount Movies,"&gt;Aging contract killer Danny Dolinski (Christoph Waltz) still believes he’s the best at what he does. Stuck in a boring “desk” assignment while pining for the love of spunky club manager Anata, Danny is thrilled when The Company pulls him back in the field, but only to train Gen Z newcomer Wihlborg, a prodigy assassin with a bad attitude. The mismatched pair is asked to eliminate a competing crime syndicate but uncover their employer’s true motive: removing the old guard in a full takeover. The Company didn’t anticipate that Danny's experience coupled with the kid’s brilliance would create such an unlikely bond between the two. Along with Anata’s crucial help, the duo takes matters into their own hands to take down The Company and that age has no limits!

movies,"Dear Santa was amazing and a story that finally wasn't afraid to do what it did at the end, what a treat","People are too harsh when it comes to movies, I never understood why, when I watch something I kick back, relax and have a good time unless the movie is a complete borefest (which is what usually gets all the high ratings and oscars in many cases lol)

I was very excited to watch Dear Santa because it felt like a wholesome, old school Christmas movie, all I really knew about it was the concept and that one trailer I saw, but that was enough for me.

The movie was just wholesome from beginning to end and at the end, it did it, a story that FINALLY had the courage to and we're heading into end game major spoiler territory here

&gt;!A story that had the courage to DEFY death! THANK YOU to the writers, whoever approved it, thank you!!&lt;

&gt;!I'm so tired of stories teaching us that the dead are gone and we should accept it, that we can't bring our loved ones back and all that reality check stuff. No, this is a fantasy movie, this is a world that someone imagined and in their world this kinda stuff IS possible because the worlds we create in our imagination are ours to write the rules in and the writers did just that. I'm glad that somewhere out there exists a world like this, I wish ours was one but it isn't, but I'm happy just to see this stuff.!&lt;

So not only did I enjoy this heartwarming movie from the very beginning, but it ended the way I was hoping it would ever since I learned of the main plot twist I would say.

For me, personally, as a non movie critic person, a casual guy just watching his flicks

this is my #1 new Christmas Movie alongside Klaus.

It's just wonderful.

10/10 in my book

I couldn't have asked for a more perfect movie and ending

I'm just glad I watched it alone as I watch movies that have the potential to be emotional :)

Now let the downvotes flow, I dare speak against the popular opinion after all.

movies,Actors/Actresses who screwed up a comeback arc?,"Everyone loves a good comeback story. From sports to music and especially movies. Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, the works. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?

First one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.

Another example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo.

From what i can tell. He likes the part where its a kids school life and being successful at it. Kinda. He likes the school life style of hanging out. Going on adventures. That sorta thing.

movies,La La Land’s (2016) ending sequence is one of the best uses of a no-dialogue scene in major modern film since the beginning of Up (2009),"I just finished a rewatch of La La Land and was reminded just how amazing the ending is, when Mia stumbles across Seb’s club and sees him for the first time since they parted ways all those years ago.

Despite having seen the movie before, the sequence that shows how one of them would’ve ended up unhappy if they stayed together still manages to make a strong emotional impact. In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would’ve played out in other circumstances, I can’t watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could’ve been, and ill-fated love. 

The way that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were able to convey so much emotion through just their movements and facial expressions was a testimony to their talent. Of course, the slowed down piano version of City of Stars also plays in a big role in setting the mood for this scene and is a gorgeous score. It’s hard to think of another movie that captures such a perfect balance of being bittersweet. 

I know it’s strange to compare La La Land to an animated children’s movie, but I couldn’t help but thinking about Up (2009) while rewatching the ending. The beginning of Up that shows how Carl met and lost his wife with no dialogue had people of all age groups in tears when the movie was released. These two scenes are both uniquely special in the way they’re able to convey strong emotions and make an impact on the audience while using no dialogue. 

Barring actual silent films, can anyone else think of a scene in a movie that manages to pack an emotional punch with no dialogue on the level of La La Land and Up?

The realism and detail in the transformations were ahead of their time.

But as I’m watching *Age of Extinction*, some of the shots with Transformers and humans together just feel... cheaper. The VFX doesn't seem as polished or seamless as in the earlier films. It almost looks like a video game cutscene at times, which feels disappointing compared to what they accomplished before.

movies,Hellboy: The Crooked Man is better than I expected,"I'm a fan of Brian Taylor and I love the Hellboy character, but I expected this to be a complete disaster after it got buried during its release. Honestly, it isn't a great movie, but it's completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it's pretty clear that most of what we're seeing is fake, which drags it down. 

Despite me finding it passable enough, I'm really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights. The character isn't much of a box office draw either, which is a shame as the comics are excellent.

It's especially confusing because you're just with the same five cast the entire time (plus the two main people on earth) so it's impossible to keep track of what has and hasn't happened yet.

movies,I have a question about “The substance” I seriously don’t this one thing. ,"If you haven’t noticed - spoiler ahead .

So when Elisabeth (Demi) is told about substance she is advise “you are one” with your other self, so I was watching the movie as if her consciousness has been transferred into Sue, however later in the movie I realised Elisabeth has no recollection of what Sue does when she was watching the interview on tv she was shocked and livid and clearly hearing it for the first time. Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth’s experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. 

But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it’s clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn’t? But the bigger question is if you are Elisabeth, you don’t actually get to experience being young again, you go to sleep for a week wasting away, why would anyone want to just clone themselves and keep going when they don’t get anything out of it?!

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Turkey,"Hello there,

since more than 40 days I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain european country. Yesterday, it was Switzerland's turn and it was certainly not the first try to bring the *Three colours*\-trilogy into the game, but now, finally, quasi at the last opportunity, it made the cut: ***Trois couleurs: Rouge*** (engl.: Three colours: Red) will be the next entry on our official letterboxd list. 

What comes next? Well, we'll see - here in this thread. I am following the alphabetical order of the Council of Europe's official list of European countries here, which means, on the one hand, that we're yet to get to England and the like (stay tuned), but on the other hand it also means that today we are  talking about a country that is only partially part of geographical Europe: I'm looking for movies set in **Turkey**. But even in this case, there are only two rules to follow when approaching this country from a cinematic perspective:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"December 6-8 Box Office Recap: 'Moana 2' stayed on top of the box office, earning almost $600 million worldwide after just 2 weeks. The 'Interstellar' IMAX re-release earned $4.6 million from just 165 theaters. Meanwhile, A24's 'Y2K' flopped in ninth place with just $2.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/qi1cxbn2ew5e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8

Thanks to the excellent performance last week, this was a fantastic post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. ***Moana 2*** broke the record for highest post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office, while ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II*** continued their run. As is typical with the weekend, studios avoid releasing big stuff. The biggest push was A24's ***Y2K***, which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. In contrast, the IMAX re-release of ***Interstellar*** fared much better in just 165 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 115% from last year, when ***The Boy and the Heron*** opened in North America. It's the best post-Thanksgiving weekend in history.

Without any competition, ***Moana 2*** easily held the top spot with $51.2 million this weekend. That represents a 63% drop, which is a little steeper than usual for the post-Thanksgiving weekend. It's worse than ***Wish*** (61%), ***Frozen II*** (59%), ***Strange World*** (58%), ***Ralph Breaks the Internet*** (54%), ***Frozen*** (53%), ***Encanto*** (52%), and the original ***Moana*** (50%).

Through 12 days, the film has earned $299.3 million domestically, already eclipsing the original ***Moana***. For a comparison, it had a huge start over ***Inside Out 2***, but it's now running almost $60 million behind that through the same point. It should hit $500 million for the holidays, but the $600 million dream appears to be dead.

***Wicked*** stayed at #2, dropping 55% and adding $36.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $322.1 million, and it should finish with over $450 million.

***Gladiator II*** dropped a rough 59%, adding $12.5 million this weekend. The film has earned $132.8 million so far, and it's gonna close with a little over $150 million unless the holidays surprise us.

Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** dropped 45%, adding $7 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $85.7 million. We'd like to say it will hit $100 million, but that's pretty much Joever; Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday. That's gonna kill legs.

The Indian film ***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** opened with $4.88 million in 1,245 theaters, which grows to $9.3 million in its first five days.

Paramount re-released Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** in 165 IMAX theaters. It earned a huge $4.6 million in these locations, which translates to a $27K per-theater average. IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out. These numbers took its lifetime gross to $192.6 million.

Sony/Crunchyroll's ***Solo Leveling: ReAwakening*** earned $2.4 million from just $846 theaters. Not bad for a recap of the first season.

Fathom Events released the concert film ***For King + Country’s A Drummer Boy Christmas Live*** in 1,540 theaters, for a limited 4-day run. It finished in eighth place with $2.2 million ($2.8 million four-day).

Debuting in ninth place, we find A24's ***Y2K***, which flopped with just $2.1 million in 2,108 theaters. That's a poor $1,003 per-theater average, suggesting a lot of empty screenings. It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2,000 theaters. 

This shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. The film lacked big names, with the big emphasis on its writer and director, Kyle Mooney. Mooney is definitely well known for ***Saturday Night Live***, but like a lot of stars in the show, that doesn't mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen. Horror is a profitable genre, but the film is actually a horror comedy, making it a tougher sell. A24 takes a lot of risks, but it was clear that this would struggle. Since its SXSW premiere, reviews have been mixed, and they've been worsening (currently at 43% on RT), making it one of the worst titles of the studio. It's simply a film that couldn't find an audience.

According to A24, 58% of the audience was male, and 77% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it an awful ""C–"" on CinemaScore, suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters. A run under $5 million is a possibility, and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives. Not the best years for Rachel Zegler, apparently.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever***. It fell 53%, adding $1.5 million this weekend and taking its total to $34.4 million.

Outside the Top 10, we find ***Werewolves***, a horror action title with Frank Grillo. It hit 1,351 theaters, but it flopped with just $1 million this weekend. Don't expect it to last long.

Vertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel's ***The Order*** in 603 theaters, but it only made $878,000 this weekend. Ouch.

A24 expanded Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** to 47 theaters. It added $405,910 this weekend, taking its run to $866K after 10 days. It will continue expanding.

Searchlight didn't even bother with ***Nightbitch***. Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters, but they didn't release box office numbers. Le sigh.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** continued leading the box office after its record-breaking weekend. It added $103.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $599 million. Its biggest debut was Japan, where it opened with $6.5 million. The best markets so far are France ($32.5M), UK ($27.2M), Germany ($19.7M), Mexico ($19.1M) and Brazil ($16M). A billion is imminent, but it looks like it will take a little while.

While ***Wicked*** registering strong numbers domestically, it continues performing softly overseas. This weekend, it added $26.9 million, taking its worldwide total to $457.5 million. It had very soft debuts in France ($2M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Poland ($900K). The best markets are the UK ($47.4M), Australia ($17.2M), South Korea ($10.6M), Mexico ($8.1M) and Spain ($4.5M). It will open in more markets, but it's not like it will suddenly explode. If it was performing on par with its domestic run, we'd say a billion is a possibility, but that's not the case here. 70% of its money is coming from the domestic market, which is crazy.

***Gladiator II*** added $17 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $368.5 million. The film is slowing down, and while it will hit $400 million, it won't get much further than that. Far below the original's $460 million worldwide total.

***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** opened in 31 markets, mostly Latin America, a week ahead of its worldwide rollout. To say that it performed badly would be an understatement. The film debuted with an awful $2 million. It had terrible starts in Spain ($347K), Mexico ($239K), Thailand ($146K), Brazil ($106K), and Czech Republic ($103K). Yep, not a single market over $1 million. This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Here* | Nov/1 | Sony | $4,875,195 | $12,227,851 | $13,295,076 | $50M

- Wake up babe, new Zemeckis flop just dropped. After barely one month in theaters, Sony/Miramax's ***Here*** has closed with just $12 million domestically and $13 million worldwide. Despite touting the film as a ***Forrest Gump*** reunion (Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright), the audience was uninterested. In fact, the domestic total is barely half of what ***Forrest Gump*** earned on its opening weekend back in 1994, and that's not even adjusted. Oh, Robert Zemeckis, what happened to you? To say that his glory days have passed...

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Five films, two of which are hitting wide release. But none stand a chance in topping the box office.

The first is Sony's latest addition in the Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe, ***Kraven the Hunter***. This universe has been mostly profitable, but it carries an asterisk. The three ***Venom*** films are hits, while the other two (***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***) flopped and became Internet's laughingstock. ***Kraven*** is leaning towards the latter. And for reasons beyond understand, Sony decided that this film warranted $130 million, making it their most expensive SSU film. After this, who knows what'll happen.

The other wide release is Warner Bros.'s ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, an anime prequel to Peter Jackson's trilogy. This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history... yet ***The War of the Rohirrim*** is not gonna come close anywhere close to that. Anime has a ceilling at the box office, and the pre-sales are insanely low. With a low screen count, limited marketing, and middling reviews so far, we'll see how low it can go.

Paramount is releasing ***September 5*** in limited release, before its wide release on January 17. The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events. The film has received some solid reviews so far.

Amazon MGM is releasing ***Nickel Boys*** in limited release. The story follows two African American boys, Elwood and Turner, who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida. The film has received critical acclaim, and there's Oscar buzz on the horizon. Watch out for this one.

The other one is Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl***, starring Pamela Anderson. Reviews are very positive, with Anderson lauded for a career-best performance.

movies,"Now You See Me 3 (2025) - Cast, Release Date - Parade","Now You See Me 3 wasn't delayed because of COVID like the writer claims. The head of Lionsgate notoriously was more interested in hitting specific release dates than making good movies. Writer/director Gary Ross didn't return to direct the sequel to The Hunger Games because Lionsgate wouldn't give him any time to work on the script or do pre-production prep. The sequel ended up going into production without any script at all --the director was shooting pages from the book until a shooting script was cobbled together. Catching Fire was a big hit anyway because of the goodwill generated by the first film but Lionsgate's slapdash approach to production led to diminishing audience interest and box office for the final installment (which was split into two films since that worked for Harry Potter and Twilight).

Before Now You See Me 2 opened Lionsgate announced that part 3 would be going into immediate production and be released the following year --but audiences weren't happy with the sequel which underperformed in North America. Lionsgate claimed the China box office made up for the disappointing returns in North America which clearly wasn't true because the original sequel which was to be helmed by Jon Chu again was cancelled.

In addition to completely screwing up the sequel to Now You See Me Lionsgate did the same with the sequel to the Bruce Willis action comedy R.E.D. Now You See Me and R.E.D. were both developed by Summit Pictures before that company was acquired by Lionsgate.

The visual effects are awesome, water hasn't been done better. The characters are well thought out and very entertaining, Karl Urban plays the role of Jacob very well. The soundtrack is excellent, and overall tone is suitably foreboding when it needs to be. The ""pirate speak"" could be better, but it is obviously aimed at kids.

It's got a lot of the charm of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and follows the time-tested Moby Dick format while staying fairly original. It's got a very classic feel that reminds me of the old swashbuckling pirate films of the 80s. Its a proper adventure film.

&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore’s original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).

[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien’s appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm’s Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we’ve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):

&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie’s greatest strength — The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson’s LotR in the best way. It’s packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):

&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from ""The War of the Rohirrim."" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that’s unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It’s hard to get mad at this movie, but it’s oh so easy to be disappointed.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):

&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson’s trilogy — few do — but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.

[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):

&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth’s famous legends.

\--------

Directed by Kenji Kamiyama

&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003), *The War of the Rohirrim* tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold Helm's Deep.

movies,Do Audiences Even Care About Cinematic Details Like Color and Light?,"As a filmmaker passionate about cinematography, I’ve been diving deep into the niche of film emulation—replicating the look and feel of celluloid film in digital work. I find it fascinating, almost magical, how the right colors, textures, and lighting can transform a scene. But here’s the question that keeps circling in my mind: Do audiences, especially those not involved in filmmaking, really see these subtle details? Do they feel them, even if they don’t consciously notice?

For context, I make movies purely for fun, out of passion. They’re not for money or validation, just a way to express myself. Sometimes I wish I could ask my 10-year-old self—someone who simply loved movies without knowing the technical side—if these nuanced elements would have mattered to him. Back then, I wasn’t thinking about grain structure, dynamic range, or color grading. I was just immersed in the magic of storytelling.

It reminds me of this video by Cleo Abram about football shots. She discussed how people thought the footage looked incredible—like it was shot in 8K—when, in reality, it was all about the aperture. The shots people loved were done on DSLRs with a shallow depth of field, unlike traditional broadcast cameras with their massive lenses, which prioritize a different aesthetic. When I saw the footage, I instantly recognized it was the aperture creating that ""cinematic"" look, not resolution or 8K. But it was fascinating to see how much people loved the DSLR footage without knowing why.

From this example, it’s clear that people do notice these things—but does it really matter? My assumption is that there’s a bare minimum that evolves over time as generations grow up exposed to better and better clarity. They notice the overall improvement, but they can’t pinpoint what it is—and honestly, they don’t even care. It’s not their job to know these details.

That’s the thing, right? This is also why smartphones have diminished DSLR sales compared to a few decades ago, when standalone cameras were the only option. Obviously, we in the industry know the technical reasons why DSLRs are still better than even flagship phone cameras. But that’s not the point. The point is the bare minimum.

And honestly, as an aspiring filmmaker, I feel great about this. It means I can start with a smartphone as my camera. All I have to do is figure out what the bare minimum is for how my movies need to look. Everything above that is good to have, but not necessarily a deal-maker.

Because at the end of the day, if the vibe of the movie doesn’t resonate with someone, they won’t want to watch it—no matter how good it looks, even in IMAX.

So, to the community here: Do you think the average viewer, or even a younger version of yourself, notices or appreciates subtleties like film emulation, color, or light? Or are these details more of a filmmaker's obsession? And what do you think that ""bare minimum"" standard is today?

Edit-
The reason why I ask this question is because I make movies simply because the process makes me happy. But sometimes, I find myself diving too deep into the rabbit holes of filmmaking details, losing track of the joy and starting to see perfection in those details as the only path to fulfillment—when it’s really not. That’s not who I am. Even though I make movies for myself, I wanted to understand what the audience actually feels about these things because, honestly, I’ve been exhausted thinking about it all on my own. What I really want is the clarity to know when I’ve done enough, to recognize when I’m focusing too much on the details and losing sight of myself in the process.",No-Indication9775,1ha8nph,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,2024-12-09 12:31:23,0,0.27,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha8nph

movies,Watching behind the scenes and clips of recent movies: crew wearing masks on set,"I'm honestly really curious about something that I realized watching behind the scenes. In almost all of the videos and clips I have seen, most of the people shown are wearing maks, including the director,even if the movie is filmed recently. For exemple, Smile 2, Blink twice etc They also don't wear it on the red carpet or premiere.

I wanna add  that I'm a an anti vaxxer or anti mask in any ways. I just got the flu shot and I will wear a mask when I feel sick.

I'm just curious and wondering is it because they are always traveling and meeting people? Is there a specific reason that I don't know about on set?

movies,"Revisiting ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" critiquing it on its own merit, I found it to be a pretty bad film.","This is a sort of Mandella Effect with me, but after rewatching the film only remembering bits and pieces of it when I was younger, I was surprised how small the guardian angel imagination sequence actually is. I thought this was the bulk of the 2nd act originally, but it happens after the film almost reaches its 2-hour runtime. The impact this film has in popular culture is completely dependent on those final 20 minutes.   


If you look up the plot of the film on an website, it will say a variation of ""An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.""

This, however, actually happens at the end of film.  This happens about 1 hour and 50 minutes into it. So, this cannot be the plot of the movie. This could only be the plot of the movie if the first act gave us a brief character development of George in the first act, before Clarence takes him on his excursion, where the film will spend the majority of its runtime. But that is not what happens. The plot of the film is actually more closely aligned with, ""A businessman is at financial and personal dilemma when a wealthy tycoon has sights to take over his business and have completely control over the city.""

The only reason this is listed as a plot is the impact its had in culture rather than the film on its own merit.

Other things:

The film opens with an exchange of George, Violet and Mary and children. Violet and Mary both fawn over George.

The way the film opens, you'd think this would foreshadow Violet and Mary feuding over Goerge as adults, or George having to choose one. Opening with the 3 of them suggests these 3 are going to be the main characters later. But no. Adult Violet isn't really integral to the plot at all. Kid Violet has more lines than adult Violet. The opening scene sets something up that didn't end up happening.  

A 7-year-old Violet's innocent crushes on ""a lot of boys"" is somehow offensively supposed to foreshadow that adult Violet is promiscuous. Women who are promiscuous and exotic dancers don't generally start showing signs of this at 7, and it's completely unrelated to any crushes she'd have at that age. 

They spent too much on the opening scene when the only two plot points it needed was to show that George saved the druggist from a fatal error, and George liked exploring. The druggist ended up being an insignificant character later on, so there's no need to spend so much time here. 

George is mildly surprised that Mary is ""18"" as if they just met, yet doesn't seem to remember Mary from childhood. Young Mary didn't just come into the pharmacy that one time; she knew George quite well. Young Mary whispered in his ear ""I'll love you 'til the day I die,"" so they were well acquainted with each other as children.  In fact, there is never a callback to the child years, as if the opening scene was tacked-on later.

We didn't need the narrator exposition by the angels. We didn't need to the conversation by the angels at the introduction about who George is. Clarence's first appearance could've been when he was drowning, and that would've been fine.  There's enough exposition that Clarence is an angel after Clarence saved him (or George saved Clarence) that we didn't need the opening exposition.   
  
If we already see Clarence in human form, then what was the point of the star sequence anyway, which was also horrible special effects even by 1946 standards? The movie could've opened with Clarence in human form simply could've been conversing with the two other angels off-screen.  There was no point in showing them as stars. This seems like a tacked-on reshoot when they didn't have the actors available. 

Officer Ernie spots George by the bridge and says he's been looking for him all night. George is ecstatic he's back to his normal life and leaves. However, if Ernie had been looking for George all night, then he would've stopped at Martini's Bar prior the bridge, where the patrons would've told Ernie that George left drunk. Additionally, Ernie would've found out about the accident. Regardless of his friendship with Ernie, George still should've or would've been detained for drunk driving and leaving the scene of accident. 

When Freddie opens the gym floor to engage the pool- he's told George and Mary are right over the crack.  Freddie opens this floor, and George and Mary are dancing away from the crack at this point. There're a lot of other dancers closer to the opening than they are, and manage to see and avoid it. But coincidentally, George and Mary are the only two that don't see it and fall in accidentally. The two people that Freddie targeted are the two people that happen to fall in despite them not being any more likely than any one else at the dance. What should have happened was, as soon as the floor opened, everyone started falling in. 

Finally, there's an unresolved arc for the main villain. Potter stealing the money isn't addressed, nor is he shown to be defeated overall. 

In sum, it's a badly made film, and the initial reviews are negative, but it does have an cultural impact but that's mostly because it's shown during every Christmas season through decades of rewatch.

movies,I don't agree with the sentiment that the Driver from Drive was a psychopath (SPOILERS),"Just watched the movie for the first time. Fantastic, instantly went to see what others were discussing. Seems the common consensus seems to be the Driver was sociopath/psychopath, even my friends think so.

To me, the movie was a character study on a troubled man looking for a normal, happy life, but got involved with the wrong people (and continues to.) Not a sociopath or psychopath. Probably on the spectrum. The whole movie was also showing us that he was a real human being. 

First, biggest signs of a socio/psychopath are lack of empathy and love, but he clearly has a lot of empathy and love for Irene and the child. He puts himself into danger just so he can keep them from harm. He isn't just physically or intimately in love with her, he never advances on her in a sexual way, it's a sweet and caring love. The elevator scene didn't scream lust to me (or my wife) personally, just a final kiss before he'll never see her again. The dates were always innocent with them chilling with her child. He is also very clearly distraught when Shannon dies, who again, proves to be part of the wrong friends he accidentally associates himself with. 

At the beginning of the movie, he denies a job for a lot of money from a previous client. Tells him to STFU, but ends up inadvertently taking the job because now Irene and her little boy are in danger if he doesn't.

People also mention the brutality of his kills, but all his kills in the movie come from self defense, or defense of a loved one. He was furiously stomping on the guy in the elevator because he was an active and present threat to Irene. It was a violent outburst towards his frustration at being unable to keep a person he loves out of danger. She becomes sad because she realizes she fell in love with yet another man with violent baggage that mean harm to the family.

He 100% does have a violent past. That is why he is disconnected, awkward, calculated and aware. 

He has good intentions, but fate and nature keep him away from them. He's the frog, the scorpion, and the shark in one package. He's not feigning his care for humanity. He sacrificed his only remaining bond to keep her safe. He left the money behind. Gave her a sweet goodbye voicemail. Clearly sad as he drives onto nowhere, where he'll probably get a job on the spot from a random guy again, forever and ever in this cycle.",Forhaver,1ha4h5u,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,2024-12-09 07:28:38,0,0.46,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha4h5u
movies,What did we think of Nightbitch?,"I was on the fence, leaning negative, for the first two-thirds. This is coming from someone who unreservedly adores *Can You Ever Forgive Me* and *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*. Once it hit the third act, I got it. And thank god it clicked, because it would have made me really sad to give a negative review to a movie that needle-drops ""Dare to Be Stupid"" by Weird Al.

While I still prefer Marielle Heller's previous films, this big and often baffling swing reveals itself as a deeply personal reflection on balancing artistic legacy with continuing heritage. Kudos to Heller for making a film on her terms, even if it almost turned me off completely before eventually winning me over.

I was reminded of Ari Aster's *Beau Is Afraid*. In *Beau*, Joaquin Phoenix as Aster's self-insert protagonist only finds peace when performing a play in the woods—mirroring how Aster himself might only feel at ease when creating films and seeing the world through his unique lens. Even as some audiences follow Richard Kind's character out the door wondering what the hell they just saw, they at least had the opportunity to understand how it feels to live with Aster's restless, haunting brain.

An unhinged Amy Adams gives us a similar peek into Heller's mind in *Nightbitch*. And like Scoot McNairy's character admits, I ""didn't get it"" at first. Honestly, as a single man with no kids, I still don't get all of it. But now I feel a little closer to empathizing, rather than just sympathizing, with moms in the arts.

(Side note: I saw Brian De Palma's *Phantom of the Paradise* a week ago and didn't recognize a young Jessica Harper until the end credits. Then tonight I didn't realize an older Jessica Harper plays Norma until I saw her name on the Letterboxd page. I don't know what's causing my Jessica-Harper-prosopagnosia, but as a big fan of hers, I'm hoping one of the witches at Tanz Akademie can cast a spell to fix it.)

movies,"""The Lovely Bones:"" A New Add to My Least Favorite Movies List","I just saw the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. 

I came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on ""paired with"" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl ""everyone dies"" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. 

I also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to ""everyone"" like the spirit guide describes death. The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. 

Furthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the ""cool grandma"" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a ""grown man"" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just ""live with it"" less than a year after the murder.

It's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.

Finally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the ""weird looking, creepy stranger"" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.

This movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.

EDIT: I guess I wasn't as articulate as I could have been, no I don't think they needed to show a 14 year old literally getting raped, please stop saying that's what I said or asking why I supposedly wanted to see that. My point there was, I think the film is way too flipant with how it handles rape's emotional impact by not acknowleding what happened in any way, or at the very least by rushing the girl to get over it ASAP. Girls need to show that this isn't okay and their upset feelings are valid when it happens to them. No death survivors can get anything from this movie, as they are dead. However SA survivors can. And if the point wasn't supposed to be about the girl, we didn't need to see her in the afterlife.",Due_Assist_7614,1ha2xe2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,2024-12-09 05:43:43,545,0.73,545,0,219,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha2xe2

movies,Was the main character of Kingdom of Heaven (2005) the real son of Godfrey in the movie? I think he might not have been.,"Rewatching the movie and I start to think that Bailan (Orlando Bloom) may not have been Godfrey's (Liam Neeson) real son.

I see it as Godfrey and his circle were driven by meritocracy and finding a right guy to fit into Jerusaleem to keep peace, justice and all.

After seing the smith and hearing about his talents, the hosptalier (David Thewils) asks Godfrey ""remember what we talked about on the road?"".

I think that they either
a) agreed to come back to France and pick the most deserving/fitting man to become Godfrey's heir, either while on the road or even before sailing out from the Holy Land

b) Met his real son and realized they couldn't let such a jerk inherit the.piece of the kingdom of god they were building

c) Both a) and b) + hearing about his engineering talents played the crucial part of choosing him.

It is just a presumption, but it lays into the narrative which both Godfrey and King of Jerusaleem pronounce, ""everyone can be the master of his fate here, no matter who he was in his homeland"".

Baldwin even straightly says ""a father may claim a son"" while pronouncing this whole narrative during his first conversation with Bailan.",RuslanNCAA,1ha1p10,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,2024-12-09 04:30:26,0,0.4,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha1p10

movies,District 9 is great original film.,"A recommendation post of this film suddenly popped on my Instagram feed and I thought I should give it a try. I'm glad that I did.

I knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it has aliens in it (thought that it was an alien invasion movie).

Never in my life did I imagine that a film can make me sympathize with aliens and hate humans. Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.
 
Another thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.

The ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).

The only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.

In short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.

Highly recommend if you haven't already watched it.",CYBOZAX_,1ha0t0x,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,2024-12-09 03:40:06,2276,0.92,2276,0,230,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha0t0x

movies,Was the Hag in Snow White an Illusion?,"We all know that after the huntsman fails to provide Snow White's heart, the queen then magically transforms herself into the old hag which she then uses to trick Snow White into eating the apple.

The thing that I've always been curious on is whether or not that transformation is simply an illusion or not. What I mean is does the black magic only make her appear to be an old woman but she still functions as her normal self or is it truly a transformation and she IS that old woman? Sure she acknowledges the voice change, but she also seems to run pretty damn fast for an old woman and almost succeeded in moving a boulder onto the dwarfs; also an impressive feat given her ""age"". It wouldn't surprise me if someone that powerful was able to keep her strength and endurance while changing the voice to make it believable. 

What do you all think? 

Bonus question, do you think that after her death the magic wore off? Or did she remain even in death as the hag?

Regardless, personally she remains tied for my top Disney villain (with Maleficent), and by far the scariest, particularly as a child.

movies,Onegin (1999) - Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler are excellent in this beautiful romantic drama based on the novel in verse by Russian writer Alexander Pushkin.,"https://preview.redd.it/lfizh83n9q5e1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c406dbf791527cd189be56708ea4efc41484aa1d

Alexander Pushkin's verse novel ""Eugene Onegin"" is well-known in English-speaking countries, partly due to the influence of Tchaikovsky's opera, so I need not set out the plot in any detail. It centres upon the relationship between Yevgeny Onegin, a 19th century Russian landowner, and a teenaged girl named Tatyana Larinа, the daughter of a neighbour. Tatyana falls passionately in love with Onegin and writes him a letter setting out her feelings, but he replies that he cannot return them. Six years later Onegin meets Tatyana again and discovers that she is now married to a prince. A subplot deals with a duel fought between Onegin and Vladimir Lensky, the fiancé of Tatyana's sister Olga.

Ralph Fiennes executes a stunning performance as the aloof, sarcastic disillusioned aristocrat managing a performance which combines a great deal of emotion and extreme surface passivity; Liv Tyler is at her most beautiful in one of her best performances to date as the poignant Tatiana who, as the film unfolds, evolves from passionate idealism into resignation and honour.

As for the story, the movie is very faithful to the Pushkinian attitude. The story is very character-centred, typical to Russian lit. The change in Evgenyi Onegin  is marked indeed. However, the character of Tatyana captivated me. Her faithfulness to herself and to her integrity is amazing.

movies,Looking for historical courtroom dramas,"Because of the nature of the work I do now,  I’ve become fascinated with how courtrooms are shown in tv and movies. It’s a convenient way to showcase moral dilemmas and human conflict, and it gets great performances out of actors.  

What I’m looking for, though, is movies that take place in historical versions of the standard courtroom drama. For arguments sake, by historical let’s say we mean before 1930. These courtroom settings could be either in a western or non-western country.

Two films made me think of this topic, and they coincidentally have the same lead actor and similar themes. The first one I saw was Le Colonel Chabert (1994), with Gerard Depardieu as a French cavalry officer presumed dead during the Napoleonic Wars. When he returns, he hires a lawyer to regain his inheritance from his remarried widow.    
The second, also starring Gerard Depardieu, was Le Retour de Martin Guerre (1982). In this one, a peasant in 16th century France leaves his wife and village to take part in the Hundred Years’ War. But the man who returns seems to be an imposter, and the village is divided on his identity.

movies,Galaxy Quest censorship theory.,"For those that haven't seen the movie, absolutely worth the watch, it is the best Star Trek movie made. There is a theory out there that talks about the movie censored a line to achieve a PG13 rating. A scene towards the end takes place where Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen have to navigate through a booby trap inside the ship. When Sigourney Weaver sees the trap, she exclaims ""Well, screw that!"" while mouthing the words ""Well, fuck that!"".

I have a second theory. The premise of the movie is the main characters are former actors of a show, much like Star Trek, and have washed up and struggling to get by. One day, Tim Allen is confronted by strange people at a convention. They claim that they are in danger, and Tim Allen is the only one who can help. He mistakes them as just kooky fans and agrees to meet with them thinking it is a gig. He is instead abducted and taken aboard a ship that is based off the ship on the show he was the star of.

It turns out, these aren't fans, they are a species of alien that have based their entire culture around Galaxy Quest, the TV show. Thinking the show was a factual documentary, they received the signals from earth and practically worshiped the show, replicating everything around them to be as accurate as it would have been in the show. To include how they speak.

TL;DR the aliens would have had something on the ship that would censor any curse words. The TV show was on national television in the 80's and would not have any curse words, therefore the aliens would not allow curse words.

Edit: Yes, I know the movie is known to have been more raunchy and likely has an R rated cut, this is more of a fan theory that gives it an in universe explanation.",JDubStep,1h9wx56,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,2024-12-09 00:16:35,0,0.29,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9wx56

movies,"I'm gonna defend the ""Liar revealed"" trope in Bug's life","I know people hate the ""Liar Revealed"" trope and im not gonna argue that this scene is actually a ""Masterfully done example"" of it or anything, but people always say the same thing regarding it.  ""Why do they care that Flik lied?  They have the giant bird! thats the plan now! why wouldnt that work?!?!""

But people are forgetting the overall context of Flik in the group.  Flik was a *continuous* screw-up before he went out to get the warrior bugs.  They literally sent him out of the colony to look for warriors just so they would have time to fix HIS major screw-up.  They were even arguing about what his punishment should be but couldnt figure one out cause he's apparently had, and subsequently messed up, every single job he's been given.  So they aren't discounting the bird plan because ""oh Flik lied so theres no way that plan will work.""  They're discounting it because he's literally **NEVER** had a plan that DIDNT make things worse.  

On top of that, they think him saying ""The Bird will Work"" is just him trying to cover his own Ego rather than to save everyone.  He lied about the Warrior bugs the ENTIRE time they were there and if the grasshoppers came, they would've been no help whatsoever without the bird plan.  NOT telling the truth actively put the entire colony at risk as they weren't rushing to gather extra food for the grasshoppers.  They think he kept the lie going to just protect HIMSELF, so him insisting on the bird plan sounds like he's still protecting HIMSELF over the colony.

Again, I understand people don't like the Liar revealed trope, and I won't say this is a 'groundbreaking' take on it or anything, but the ants don't think his plan will work cause he's screwed up every single idea he's ever had.

The performances of everyone in this movie was amazing, but its few films where you feel just as bad emotionally as the character does. You feel bad for them. You feel as if ""what if that happened to me?!"" and you're living it in real time.

Its not so much the actions, because a lot of people go through this. But watching the entire before and after is what the film captured well. It was seeing a characters candle extinguished.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Switzerland,"Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Sweden. Almost 100 comments later, I think, we've found a very interesting new entry for [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): I mean, I've never seen it, but I will, because (apart from the fact that I will watch every movie on this list), c'mon, if I have been informed correctly, **Det Sjunde Inseglet** (engl.: *The Seventh Seal*) shows us Max von Sydow playing chess with the Death! To be honest, I doubt that the next winner will be able to top that...

...but we can try. I'm following an alphabetical order here (yeah, yeah, I know, that England and Co are still missing, wait for it), and so, we now take a look at movies set in **Switzerland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Also Wolf of Wall Street having the same R rating too.

Now you got PG-13 movies like School of Rock sharing the same rating as Split, The Dark Knight, 10 Cloverfield lane, and the Taken movies. These movies are way more extreme then School of Rock.

All these PG-13 movies I listed after School of Rock have more extreme inappropriate content then the higher R rated Kings Speech and Steve jobs movie.

Now imagine parents of children that blindly go off the age ratings just because it has a higher rating then how old their child is they don't let their children watch it.

You would rather want children to watch the R rated Steve Jobs and Kings Speech rather then PG-13 stuff like Split and The Dark Knight. There's many movies with a lower age rating that's more inappropriate then ones with a higher age rating and comparing movies that share the same rating are inaccurate too.

Being that this was Nolan’s first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could “solve” his movie like many tried to after Inception released.

I can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.

I read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. “Stay/Coop leaving Murph” in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. 

there is something so powerful in that composition that just had me losing it. It might be the idea that I’m becoming more open to becoming a father, but when the entire orchestral noise starts escalating as Coop is letting Tom have the truck, I am wailing for him to stay. 

And this was just for one of the compositions in this film. I can keep going on about how this element alone was truly amazing for a film like this. I really hope this gets an extended run so I can watch this again.",jay-__-sherman,1h9mq57,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9mq57/hans_zimmers_score_for_interstellar/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9mq57/hans_zimmers_score_for_interstellar/,2024-12-08 16:37:31,82,0.75,82,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9mq57
movies,Detective movie subgenre name?,"I recently started reading The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, a book from 1958. In it, an old detective seeks to solve a crime that he failed to solve for decades due to a series of stupid bureaucratic mistakes and absence of any concrete leads.The author sought to make a point about how detective novels are the opposite of real-life crime solving in that it pretends that coincidences don't exist and logic is the only thing that matters.

I noticed strong similarities between its plot and more recent movies like Bong Joon-Ho's Memories of Murder and Wei Shujun's Only The River Flows. If not for the fact that these movies were based on real-life events that occurred AFTER The Pledge was published, I'd believe that these movies were adaptations of the novel.

movies,"In The Count of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviezel, I believe that after so many lies from Fernand and Mercedes, I believed that at the end of the film, Edmond became a misanthrope.","The adaptation with Jim Caviziel appears to be an unintentional parody of the book.

The scene of French high society going to an unknown foreign nobleman's party and him descending from a balloon seemed like a parody of the book. French high society was closed off and the Count acting like a nouveau riche would bring the contempt of the French elite to him. The Count needed someone to open the doors of high society for him. This scene had a comedic tone like the Monty Python movies.

Albert is kidnapped by Luigi's gang and a stranger with a sword appears out of nowhere and saves him, giving a lame excuse when it was supposed to arouse suspicion that the kidnapping was set up.

And the mediocre revenges of the terrible 2002 film. The Count uses the treasure to attract Fernand and Danglars , but it is such an obvious trap that anyone would suspect it and not fall for the trick.

And the way the Count makes Villefort confess to his crime, what an amateur thing. An experienced man like Villefort would never confess his crime with such an amateur trick as the one in the 2002 film.

It would be much better if the Count hired Luigi Vampa 's gang to execute Danglars and Villefort like Michael Corleone executed Moe Greene, Tattaglia and Barzini in the Godfather . And he strangles Fernand like Clemenza strangled Carlo Rizzi . Contrary  the logic of the book to inflict prolonged suffering on his adversaries, but it would be a smarter way for the count to get rid of his enemies.

And Edmond reconciling with Mercedes was hilariously poorly written. She was married for years to the man who sent Edmond to a dungeon and you would think there would be a happy ending for them. She shows him a ring and Edmond starts crying saying something worthy of a comedy: “Don't steal my hate, it's all I have.”  Only in the movies do these absurdities happen. In a realistic situation, he would never forget that Mercedes was married to Fernand for years and had sex with him, while he rotted at the Château D' If . And he thinks that even if she claimed she was pregnant with his child, that would not erase or justify to Edmond Mercedes' marriage to Fernand. And worse, she lied and deceived. Wouldn't this help Edmond become a misanthrope like Gullinver ? Even the woman he loved proved to be an untrustworthy person.The couple reconciles and there is no resentment on Edmond's part for his former fiancée marrying Fernand or for having lied or deceived. And Albert discovers that he is the count's son and everything is fine, no trauma or questioning on Mercedes' part.

I thought that in the end, Edmond, tired of all the lies and deceit he had lived, would become a misanthrope like Gullinver . After all, the people close to him had proven to be untrustworthy. He would start to avoid human presence. Gullinver at the end of the book avoids the presence of his family In Livor, Mercedes was an honorable woman and that is why Edmond respected her.",cleopatraandcaesar63,1h9kgw4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,2024-12-08 14:53:16,0,0.23,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h9kgw4

movies,The Departed 2006 - Second undercover cop.,"So there is a lot of back and forth on Delahunt being a cop or not. Most say it's ambiguous. Most say that Costello is right, when he says that police wanted them to believe he was a cop, to throw them off from the real one. 

But right now rewatching it, I noticed a little scene about 1:40 into the movie. So Sullivan is checking the names of the guys he was given in the envelope. He looks at the picture of Delahunt and yet when he types in his social security number, he gets an error noise, and a message that person is not found. We instantly cut back to Delahunt giving another guy pointers on how to find a cop. Sullivan types in another social security code, and we get a little beep sound like the computer accepted that one. Back on the street, Billy walks out and Delahunt jokingly calls him a cop. And back to Sullivan, he types in Billy's name, and gets another 'person not found' message, and error sound. So in a scene where Delahunt jokes about spotting cops, the two people Sullivan can't get info on at all, are Delahunt and Billy? And this happens just before everything with Delahunt, from him not ratting out Billy, to him being declared a cop on tv. So uhh, I don't think it was for no reason, that Sullivan got two errors on his computer. I think it was just a little hint that not everything about Delahunt was as it seems.

Also, when Billy said that he doesn't have a bank account, Delahunt was the only one to say that he is a cash business himself too.

Edit: for people saying that it was not ambiguous, well I read up on quite a few posts before making mine, and there is no clear answer. Some believe he was, others say that 10 years is too long to be undercover, and most just take Costello's word on it being disinformation (none of the cops confirm or deny it for the rest of the movie, so we don't get a clear answer from any other party than the news).",LegatoRedWinters,1h9ju5o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9ju5o/the_departed_2006_second_undercover_cop/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9ju5o/the_departed_2006_second_undercover_cop/,2024-12-08 14:21:12,0,0.44,0,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1h9ju5o

movies,"The Count of Monte Cristo (2024) - A terrible adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic. The screenwriters didn't understand that the Count would be a mix of Job, Joseph, Raskonilkov and Ulysses and made the Count a kind of masked vigilante.","

The Count of Monte Cristo from Alexandre Dumas' classic would be a story of Joseph (son of Jacob), Job , Raskonilkov (Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky ) and Ulysses ( the Oydsey by Homer )

 A man with a tragic past, many scores to settle, an insatiable thirst for justice and *a lot of* money to spend on it, who returns to his home country years after being struck by a tragedy, with new fighting skills, disguises and unlikely allies in his mission to bring vigilante justice to criminals, all while dressed almost eternally in a black uniform. If the reader thought “Batman!”, know that the author did too; but, according to the French, this is none other than Edmond Dantès , Alexandre Dumas’ Count of Monte Cristo. Apparently.

 

One would expect the French to have greater respect for their own literary heritage, but apparently not. The new French film adaptation of the work, starring Pierre Niney and acclaimed in France, though why is beyond this author’s comprehension, makes this abundantly clear. Dumas’s masterpiece is altered so significantly that it is once again virtually unrecognizable; once again it is transformed into a story that completely contradicts everything Dumas intended in his book. “The greatest revenge story of all time” is reduced to the most vulgar, superficial level of its existence—skin and bones, a melodramatic, caricatured serial novel.

Edmond Dantès de Niney is almost a superhero. He is an expert in hand-to-hand combat , undergoing a *training montage* which makes no sense at all – apparently, the Prisoner of Château d' If was hell, and yet he had enough strength, energy, space and freedom to train in combat with an Abbé Faria -, leaves his insignia as a mark after beating up several ""tough guys"" on a street corner (tough guys hired by him, let's make that clear), is always wearing a black coat almost reminiscent of a cape, has in his house (heavily produced by CGI) a closet that becomes a shooting target when he presses a button, and uses masks and latex prosthetics with an almost comical proficiency.

 

In many ways, the film is reminiscent of the French Netflix series “ Lupin ,” which adapts Arsene ’s classics. Lupin , the Burglar, for modernity. But “ Lupin ” is a modern adaptation, not a direct one – the series revolves around a fan of the books who commits crimes inspired by them in the 21st century, and does not directly adapt any story from the books featuring the character Arsene. Lupin – and, above all, one that doesn't take itself too seriously.

It is excellent for what it sets out to do, with all its absurdities and moments of comedy. If the new Monte Cristo had followed the same approach, the situation would be entirely different – this could be a more youthful, fun and intelligent adaptation of Dumas' wonderful book – but that is not what happens. The film wants to be taken seriously, and it wants to be a direct adaptation of Dumas' book, and that is why it fails.

The film is a modern, youthful, almost Marvel Cinematic approach. Universe – without considering itself as such, the main source of ridicule in this whole farce – of a classic that deserves much better than this. It adds totally unnecessary action scenes – including scenes of Monte Cristo fighting hand-to- hand with several men in the middle of the street *and* the infamous duel (in the case of this specific adaptation, one was not enough; there are *two* duels, one with pistols and one with swords, invented for the film for no reason other than to follow in the footsteps of its equally mediocre predecessors) that half the Monte Cristo adaptations insist on including, despite Dumas's deliberate choice to subvert the expectations of his genre and purposefully avoid cliché, and to compensate he cuts buckets and buckets of nuance and narrative delicacy.

 

It is clear that it is impossible to expect a perfect adaptation of a classic of over 1,500 pages into a film, even if that film is almost three hours long. Even the greatest classics of cinema, with all their brilliance, have not managed to do so – Gone with the Wind…, Ben-Hur , etc. Yet, these same classics – and other more modern ones, such as Les Misérables from 2012, for example (speaking of which, Victor Hugo has not slept in the Pantheon for decades because his grave neighbor, Dumas, has been struggling in his own coffin since at least 2002, when the adaptation of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviziel hit theaters. Please, someone help him.) – have already proven that it is possible to make a good adaptation of masterful, complex and, of course, immense books in a relatively short space of time. The secret is to preserve what really matters – and that is where Monte Cristo with Niney fails.

First of all, let's talk about the man of the moment: Edmond Dantès , *the* Count of Monte Cristo. What was done to Dumas' protagonist was outrageous. The problem is not exactly Niney - although he doesn't help either - but his characterization.

 

The clothes, the laughable aging, the disheveled hair, all of this contrasts so ridiculously with Dumas's elegant, refined, sophisticated, and utterly charming yet arrogant Monte Cristo, who took over Parisian society in the space of a few months, that it is hard to believe that the character is the same person. His methods are equally crass, and infinitely less sophisticated than those of his literary counterpart, and for this, the character suffers.

An excellent example of this tragic character deconstruction is what happens to Monte Cristo to save Albert. For some inexplicable reason – not even the shorter and, in theory, less concerned with details film of 2002 makes this mistake – the Italian narrative is completely omitted. So, so that Monte Cristo has an excuse to get close to Albert, he fakes a robbery himself, hiring men to do it, just to have the opportunity to beat them all up in the middle of the street and “save the boy’s life”.

A significant difference from the well-structured plan described in the book, during which Monte Cristo, over the course of several days, befriends and displays his immense wealth to Albert and his friend Franz D' Epinay during the Roman Carnival, arranging for the young man to eventually be kidnapped, and then negotiating his release with Luigi Vampa , the feared Italian bandit responsible for the crime – and Monte Cristo's debtor, who used his influence with the Pope to save the life of one of his men – for no money at all, thus ensuring that the two young men returned to Paris not only grateful and willing to do anything for their new friend, but also impressed and ready to spread throughout French high society fabulous stories about the legendary wealth, courage, phlegm and power of a man who has as much influence in the Vatican as in the European criminal underworld.

Dumas’s Count of Monte Cristo would never hire men just to beat them up. This is humiliating for a man who prided himself with an almost irritating sense of self-importance on his near-superhuman ability to do, well, anything. When the Count does fight someone, he fights them, period—and wins on his own merit. But most of all, Dumas’s Monte Cristo would *never* go toe-to-toe with “tough guys” on a street corner, even if the fight were paid for. He solves his problems with telegrams, money, and pistols, not *bartitsu* . He doesn’t lay a finger on *anyone* , and he’s all the more effective and lethal for it.

 

Adding violence in the name of action is a common problem with adaptations of Monte Cristo. The book is often classified as a “swashbuckler novel” – and while it is, to some extent, it is a simplistic classification, as Dumas is deliberate in avoiding certain clichés and common tropes of the genre.

He creates the entire scenario of the duel (an almost mandatory item to be included in this type of novel in the 19th century), for example, but purposely does not let it happen, subverting the expectations of his readers and making his story more sophisticated because of it – since the resolution to the duel occurs in a surprisingly beautiful and emotionally profound way, which makes a huge difference not only in the development of the characters' arcs but in the narrative as a whole – and it is a shame that adapters “correct” this perceived “failure” to align with the literary expectations of their supposed category. In this film, it is no different: two duels, in addition to the laughable fight in the middle of the street, are added to the story, always at the expense of complex and well-constructed narratives, which in the book involve the emotional and psychological state of the characters, and in the film are nothing more than action sequences without further details.

But if that were all, perhaps it would be possible to save the film. But, of course, it isn’t. As is customary in mediocre adaptations – yes, 2002, I’m talking to you directly – the villains of Monte Cristo are completely mischaracterized to such a crass level of exaggeration that it becomes childish. Due to lack of time, no doubt, but equally due to lack of imagination and understanding of the text, Villefort , Danglars and Mondego are transformed into people so devoid of any human characteristics that it is almost possible to hear the echo of an evil laugh every time one of them enters the room. This author more or less expected one of them to stroke his mustache maliciously while giving a speech about his infallible plan to dominate the world, *a la the* mad scientist from a children’s film – Dr. Heinz. Doofenshmirtz , the comedic villain from the Disney Channel cartoon “ Phineas and Ferb ,” is frankly a more intelligently written and less stereotypical character.

Dumas’ characters are men who can be found in any high society salon today, just as they might have been in his time: family men, with varying degrees of love for their children and wives and involvement in domestic life; businessmen, with varying degrees of competence and probity; well-liked men , very pleasant and sometimes even too nice. Men, in short, ordinary, but with more than one terrible secret. Men who have their qualities, but succumb to their weaknesses – ambition, greed, passion, flattery, instincts of survival and self-preservation – all too often. These are the nuances that make them so real, so credible and so despicable, without, at one time or another, we fail to feel some degree of sympathy for one or two of them. These are the nuances so undignifiedly thrown out the window, like the corpses in The Prisoner. of Château d' If , for this production.

Let’s start with Fernand. Following the pattern established on other occasions – most famously by the 2002 film starring Caviziel – Mercedes’ envious cousin can’t just be that; he *has to be* Dantès ’ best friend . How, after all, are we supposed to know he’s a despicable person if he doesn’t betray *his best friend* out of jealousy and ambition? How, oh my God, can we not like a villain if he’s not completely and irremediably that – despicable? And he’s rich, of course. Don’t let Dumas’s poor, ambitious Mondego, willing to do anything to climb the career ladder, appear on a movie screen. He has to be a rich nobleman and, let’s not forget, *despicable* from the start, or he won’t do. He’s so caricatured that – and here the author assures us she’s not joking, despite what it might seem – he wears an eyepatch. Is there anything more appropriate for a cartoon villain than an eyepatch ?

He and Dantès have a showdown at the end of the film – a sword duel that never happens in the literary counterpart of the story, and which has none of the dignity of Dumas. The author's Monte Cristo never crosses swords with Morcef , he is too calculating for that. His revenge is much more sophisticated, and ends with Morcef himself committing suicide – too cowardly, and perhaps too disturbed, to even consider going through with a duel with the newly revealed Edmond Dantès . Far superior, without a doubt, is Monte Cristo's foolish display of mercy when he defeats his enemy and lets him live, something simultaneously out of character and meaningless for the construction of the narrative as it was.

Danglars is made equally over-the-top in his villainy, which is a shame, as he was already brilliantly *despicable* and, frankly, disgusting in the original, and didn't need these additions - but he gets them, of course. In Dumas's book, the character was an accountant who had ambitions to become captain of the Pharaon , and who becomes jealous when the young First Mate, Dantès , is promoted to the position. After Dantès 's arrest , he receives the promotion, and eventually leaves the sea life to become a corrupt and greedy banker who puts money above all else - including his family. In the film, he is already captain, and is demoted from the position, which is given to Dantès , after refusing to save a drowning woman, which Dantès does in his place.

 

He rises in the world by becoming a slave trader. He is directly responsible for the destruction of the Morrel family , sabotaging their ships – the Morrels ’ situation in the book is simply a natural case of bad luck, with their ships sinking over the years – and leading Morrel to die in poverty – something that, once again, does not happen, because in the book Dantès is able to save his friend from suicide *in extremis* , an occasion that, in fact, serves to show the good side of the protagonist, who makes a point of rewarding those who were good to him over the years before punishing those who did him wrong, without ever denouncing himself as the author of their good deeds. Danglars finally comes to effectively admit with pride that he is a brute in his first lines – in case the rest of the story is not enough for the audience to realize it, of course.

Danglars is one of the most unbearable and realistic villains in his work, precisely because he is an extremely ordinary man - corrupt, cowardly, envious, greedy, selfish, affected, unctuous, sycophantic, ridiculous in his petty pettiness. He has no legitimate reason to feel wronged by Dantès - the position of captain was never his, and in fact it made more sense as a natural promotion for the First Mate than for the accountant, anyway. He makes his wealth like countless men before him - by stealing from the poor and from the public coffers. He sells himself to men richer than himself – opening the doors of his house to the billionaire Count of Monte Cristo without thinking twice, when moments before he had tried to belittle him, unaware of his absurd amount of money, and accepting Prince Andrea Cavalcanti as his son-in-law without even bothering to check anything about his life, all in the name of the title of prince –, he practically auctions off his daughter to the buyer – read, future husband – willing to pay the most, and accepts his wife's humiliating affair with the journalist Lucien Debray , who goes out in public with Danglars 's wife and daughter and visits his mistress at her husband's house, with him present, in exchange for inside information on the stock exchange. There was no need to change such a brilliant villain precisely because he was so good at generating disgust. He was already terrible enough in his own pettiness.

And what about Villefort , the most complex of all the three villains in Monte Cristo? Dumas's Villefort is not, at first, a bad man; just ambitious and insecure. He knows that Dantès is innocent and is about to release him; however, when he discovers that the letter that was used to incriminate the boy was written by his father, and that his career could be completely ruined by it, he decides to keep him imprisoned. This simple but perfectly plausible and reasonable story is replaced by one of the biggest changes in the 2024 film – Villefort 's father , Noitier , is replaced by his sister, Angele (nonexistent in Dumas's narrative), whom Dantès saves from drowning, and who is carrying a letter for Napoleon. Not only does Villefort arrest the man who saved his sister's life, he is violent towards her, hanging her until she is nearly dead, and then handing her over to Danglars to turn into a prostitute-slave. Years later, Monte Cristo finds her destroyed by years of sexual servitude, and she dies soon after.

The Villefort of the 2024 film is so cartoonish that he is not even given the family he has in the book – a bad man cannot , it seems, care for his children, care for his father, or have a wife. This not only eliminates one of the most unusual plot lines in the book – that Villefort ’s second wife , Heloise, is a serial killer who is murdering all the family members to ensure that Villefort ’s inheritance goes entirely to her son, Edouard – but it considerably diminishes the complexity of Monte Cristo’s revenge, both in terms of his actions themselves and in terms of the moral and emotional depth of it for both Villefort and Monte Cristo himself.

The fact that he dies is tragic – after all, the book's revenge is delicious precisely because Villefort stays alive and is forced to live with all his worst nightmares coming true at once. All of this, however, is sacrificed for a simple death and a villain without a shred of humanity – and, if that weren't enough, the director makes a point of placing hanged bodies rotting in front of Villefort 's office , in case, once again, his villainy wasn't obvious.

This destruction of the characters is sad to watch, because all three are some of the best, most real and human individuals ever created by the author. Dumas' villains are real men, and *for that reason* they are despicable; because they are men like those we can find in various sectors of society, in real life, today, as we could find before. Because they are not monsters, just corrupt, petty and cowardly people . Real-life villains.

How many slave traders, pimps for their own sisters, and forgers of the imprisonment and disgrace of their best friends were walking around in 19th-century France? A certain number, no doubt, but nowhere near as many as the politicians, bankers, military men, and civil servants who embezzle public funds, issue convictions bought for their own interests, commit crimes that remain hidden abroad, get rid of the children they have with their mistresses, forge entire careers on flattery and political changes at the right time, and trample on probity, justice, honesty, and, above all, on poor, nameless innocents as if they were the dust under their shoes. How many *of these* were there in Dumas’s France? How many of these are there today?

Are they not deserving enough of an audience's hatred?

The adaptation's allergy to nuance and realism in the balance between good and evil, however, also works in reverse: at least two bad characters from Dumas's book are redeemed in a completely inexplicable way in the film, becoming heroic and admirable figures that would surprise Dumas himself. They are Caderrouse and Benedetto.

There is not much to say about Caderrouse ; it is enough to point out that, while in the book he is a man so greedy that he kills his wife – and meets his own death – for money (but who, despite this, feels remorse for his role as a passive observer in the imprisonment of the innocent Dantès ), in the film he becomes a man who is presented with a diamond and refuses it in the name of his moral principles.

Benedetto, also known as Prince Andrea Cavalcanti, is a special case: the character in the book is, in fact, a psychopath or something like that, being not only a terrible criminal, but also willing to torture his (adoptive) mother and kill his supposed father (he believes he is the illegitimate son of Monte Cristo, whom he tries to murder. Eventually, he discovers he is the son of Villefort ). Millions of leagues away from the Benedetto of the 2024 film – a progressive hero willing to marry a lesbian woman to help her hide her interest in women, kind, polite, and who lives as an adopted son of Monte Cristo, who has great affection for him (significantly different from Dumas's Monte Cristo's opinion of Benedetto, which, in his own words, disgusts him).

Benedetto's death – nonexistent in the book – while taking revenge on his father, Villefort , is one of the saddest and, in theory, most emotionally charged moments in the film, and it is what makes Monte Cristo doubt the justice of his actions. It took the place of the death of Edouard de Villefort , Villefort 's young son . And, of course, it makes no sense. After all, Monte Cristo begins to have doubts after seeing his revenge result in the death of an innocent man – a seven-year-old child who had no connection with his father's crimes and no part in his plan. How is it possible to transfer this same degree of guilt for the death of a boy who was as interested in revenge as he was – after all, Benedetto in the film also wanted to end Villefort , and dies doing so – and who participated willingly and enthusiastically in his plan? The answer is “impossible”. The choice renders much of Dantès 's doubts meaningless or, at the very least, out of proportion, and eliminates some of the most dramatic scenes and most significant moments of the narrative in its wake.

Early in his revenge plot in the 2024 film, Dantès goes to a church and angrily tells Jesus that from now on he will do what God was clearly unwilling to do – serve justice. Although dramatic – reminiscent of Bram ’s Dracula Stoker with Gary Oldman , even -, the scene once again contradicts everything Dumas writes in his book. The literary Count of Monte Cristo would not commit this kind of blasphemy, not necessarily out of immense faith and fear of God, but because he sees things in a completely different way.

One of the main themes of Dumas's “The Count of Monte Cristo” is the *Dies Irae* , divine wrath. This is because the Count himself positions himself as an agent of divine providence, and justifies all his actions as being part of God's will. He understands that he was rescued from D' If and gifted with his fabulous fortune to serve as a divine agent who dispenses justice like the God of the Old Testament, and that it is God's will that his vengeance be carried out. He would never ""argue"" with Jesus about his lack of action, because he understands that everything that happened to make him a Count was his action. He is not acting because God did not do it; he is acting because God compels him. And this aspect is fundamental not only for the symbolic and thematic integrity of the narrative constructed by Dumas, but also for the psychological aspect of the protagonist, who feels perfectly justified in his notion of justice and bases many of his actions on this reasoning.

 

This erasure of themes linked to the Old Testament – which is explored in the book, by the way, through a much more philosophical than religious approach – is also connected to several disappearances of characters extremely relevant to the story, but which the film cuts out completely: Maximilien Morrel , Luigi Vampa , Bertuccio , Edouard de Villefort , Heloise de Villefort , Monsieur Noitier , Hermine Danglars , Valentine de Villefort , Franz D' Epinay , and, of course, the modification of the roles of characters such as Haydée, Benedetto and Caderrousse . These disappearances have gigantic consequences for the plot, which has to be developed in a completely different way to accommodate the absence of certain characters, since Dumas structured his narrative in such a way that even the most insignificant events and minuscule characters are fundamental to the functioning of the story.

It is important to realize that almost all of the characters mentioned are members of certain characters' families. There are a number of implications for each of these cuts individually, but as a collective example, nothing better than the Villefort axis of the narrative: after all, without Heloise de Villefort , Hermine Danglars , Noitier , Edouard , Valentine and Morrel , how does Gerard de Villefort 's Monte Cristo get revenge ? The 2024 film resolves this with a death at the hands of Benedetto, something reasonably better than his senseless death in the 2002 film, but a simplistic solution when compared to the sophistication and true family drama that Dumas' Edmond engenders, involving poisons, serial murders, a faked death, an illegitimate son, an Italian criminal, a baby buried alive and a high-caliber public trial, resulting in the judge going mad, who begins to dig up his backyard in search of the son he had buried two decades earlier, having his reputation - the very thing he condemned Dantès to protect - ruined and his family torn apart.

Similarly, what prompts the Count of Monte Cristo to reflect on the justice of his revenge if there is no little Edouard there ? Haydée, the adaptation says, for the princess reminds the Count of the price of his revenge after the death of the reformed Benedetto, for whom Monte Cristo and she herself have great affection. It has already been discussed why Benedetto as a catalyst for this particular drama does not work, and now it remains to speak briefly of the implications of this for the character of Haydée.

This act of killing an innocent person that leads to questioning his actions , precedes Raskonilkov in Crime and Punishment. He kills the innocent, Lizaveta . Ivanovna  who was the pawnbroker 's sister Alyona Ivanovna made Raskonilkov question his theory about the Great Man, that extraordinary men in the name of the common good could transgress social rules.

Haydée is a character who is often misunderstood , and this time was no different. The fact that she appears in the film is already a great victory – most adaptations don’t even bother to do this – but that doesn’t mean that her character wasn’t, as expected, destroyed. It’s easy to think of Haydée as a mere accessory, one more detail in the calculated identity created by Edmond Dantès to enchant Paris as a millionaire, eccentric and orientalist aristocrat – and therein lies one of the great misinterpretations of the work. Not only does Haydée play a major role in the revenge plot that the Count has been hatching for a decade, but the revenge in question is also hers: one of the men who wrongly accused Dantès , taking him to prison in D' If , to marry his then fiancée, Mercedes, is the same one who betrayed her father's trust, killed him, and sold Haydée and her mother into slavery – Fernand Mondego, the Count of Morcef .

Haydée is as vengeful as Monte Cristo. She is angry. She is deceitful, and she is a match for the Count in every way, part of a Machiavellian duo who have spent years plotting revenge. Haydée is not simply a pawn on Monte Cristo’s chessboard, much less the voice of conscience on his shoulder: for all we know, she is his partner in the game, and does more to encourage him than to stop him. Like him, she has suffered immensely at the hands of her enemies, and like him she has a deep desire for revenge. There is, however, one fundamental difference between the two: unlike Edmond, Haydée seems immune to any kind of remorse.

This is the fundamental aspect of their relationship—a sadly underdeveloped aspect of the Count-Princess dynamic in many adaptations, and one that is effectively ignored in 2024. Haydée may be a source of peace for Monte Cristo, but she is certainly not a numbing agent. She does not help him forget the demons that haunt him, because her presence in his life is entirely conditioned by the existence of those demons. He would never have met her if he had not been searching for ways to disgrace the man who put him in prison. Haydée is not oblivion: she is a reminder of the horrors committed by those whom Edmond destroyed, and that he was justified in his anger. And unlike him, Haydée seems to be completely at peace and content with everything that has happened.

She has no doubts – and perhaps that helps Edmond feel at peace. And, in the end, she is also probably the only person in Dumas’s entire narrative who gets everything she wants. To take that away from her – to make her a young woman in love with *Albert* , completely ignoring her narrative function as Dantès ’s romantic partner , and to make her a spokesperson for remorse and morality on the Count’s shoulder – is to diminish and decomplexify one of Dumas’s brilliant and forgotten female characters, who are once again relegated to clichés of goodness and honor.

 Haydee bears a certain resemblance to Sonia Marmeladova from Crime and Punishment. Sonia offers Raskonilkov hope for happiness and a new beginning after he confesses his crime, just as Haydee offers the Count of Monte Cristo the chance for a new beginning after he forgives Danglars . Just as Job had lost everything and gained back twice as much as he had lost, so too did Monte Cristo.

The addition of melodrama doesn’t leave even the inanimate objects untouched: Monte Cristo’s treasure gets a new origin story, so dramatic that it might deserve its own book. It passes through the hands of the Borgias , the famously cruel French king Philip IV the Fair, and the *Knights Templar* – of which Abbé Faria is the last, by the way (At this point, Dumas begins to convulse in his coffin. Émile Zola, his other grave neighbor who is also being prevented from sleeping, accuses the screenwriter who decided that this was a good idea) – before reaching the hands of the sailor from Marseille. Speaking of Faria, he dies from fatal injuries after being crushed in an escape attempt – much more dramatic and less plausible than the death of the Faria in the books, due to a health condition that runs in his family and seems to be something like epilepsy.

 The aforementioned romance between Albert and Haydée – which makes no narrative or thematic sense whatsoever – is another one of those additions that turn the book into a soap opera-like melodrama for no reason at all. How does it happen? We don't know; the film doesn't bother to develop this aspect of the narrative well, certainly not well enough to justify such absurdity ( *please* , think of Hugo and Zola). All we know is that Albert and Haydée decide to run away together, madly in love, even though Albert's father killed Haydée's father, and Haydée was instrumental in the downfall of Albert's father – and family. Monte Cristo forces her to tell him this , of course, because what would become of this romance *a la* Romeo and Juliet if the drama were not made explicit to the entire audience?

That it was a poorly told story is bad enough, but the real problem here is what it means for the arcs of both characters. Haydée’s literary function is, as we’ve already established, to be Monte Cristo’s perfect match; Albert’s is to be a young dandy who develops and becomes a better man through the influence, destructive as it was, of the Count, as he abandons his family’s money and name and renounces all pleasure to enlist in the French army and go fight in Africa as a common man, building his new name, reputation, and wealth from scratch to atone for his father’s crimes—though he didn’t have to.



The ending of the 2024 film is unsatisfying for all possible audiences. On the one hand, those who have not read or care little about Dumas's work generally expect Monte Cristo to end his days married to Mercedes , the ending popularized by many adaptations, including, most famously, the 2002 one. An ending that is exactly the opposite of everything Dumas wanted to say with his book, by the way.

Those who have read the book and are genuinely interested in the author's message, however, expect to see the ending as he wrote it: with Monte Cristo avenged, satisfied but feeling some weight of guilt, sailing east to end his days living as a mistress in the company of Haydée. Not because this is a sugary happy ending – on the contrary, the way it is written, it is quite tempered by a good dose of bitterness – but because it is the right ending.

At the end of 2024’s “ The Count of Monte Cristo,” Monte Cristo is alone. He has achieved his revenge, but he has lost people he cared about, he has suffered immensely, and above all, he has his doubts, however well hidden behind a stoic facade they may be, about the validity of his actions, instilled in him by Haydée de Janina , by Benedetto’s death, and perhaps even by his choice to spare Fernand’s life. He leaves Paris and goes away, leaving a letter behind addressed to Mercedes. A harsh ending, which almost seems to indicate that revenge is not worth it—a point that has been made a thousand times before, and which would have been reasonable if the entire film had not made such a point of making its villains so caricatured and its protagonist so “super-heroic” in his quest for retribution that it borders on incoherent, and above all, if Dumas himself had not written a book that says exactly the opposite.

Dantès even flirts with repentance. That’s all it takes: he is reaffirmed in his revenge time and time again, and even receives a “posthumous message” from his mentor, Faria , which says, “You will tear out the teeth of dragons, and you will trample lions under your feet, says the Lord.” If Dumas had drawn it, he wouldn’t have been so explicit. Dumas’s Edmond is justified in his revenge, he feels that way, and the narrative sees him as such. Casting doubt on this could be an interesting philosophical discussion, but it doesn’t serve an adaptation of the work.

The problem here, as in so many other cases, is a simple misunderstanding of the author’s intent. “The Count of Monte Cristo” has become so widely known as “the greatest revenge story of all time” that for many it has been reduced to that very thing. Let’s not misunderstand: Monte Cristo is indeed a revenge story, and arguably the most essential of them all, in that it has definitively influenced the genre as a whole, including its imitations, such as Ben-Hur , and its subversions, such as Les Misérables. But the point of the story , for Dumas, was never revenge. That’s the fun part, of course. Who doesn’t feel a sense of personal satisfaction when the men who sent an innocent man to prison in order to secure his love, his money, and his reputation end up dead, bankrupt, and disgraced, respectively? These are the narratives that have kept the story, published in installments over the course of a year in a newspaper, interesting to the public for so long. But when you get to the very end—in those final chapters after everything is over—you realize the author had something more important to say. This is not just a story of revenge. It is the story of the fall and rise of a man who was young, and is no longer. Who was innocent, and is no longer. Who was good, and is no longer sure if he still is.

The third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.

Some ups and downs:
+Denzel glooming
+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again
+Nice location
-Boring villain
-Slow pacing
-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie

I came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him.

movies,Click (2006) is A Christmas Carol done horribly,"So, both of these stories have the core idea the protagonist must appreciate what they have and live in the moment, rather than focus on their career. And both receive a future vision where things have ended badly.

That is what the story beats of Click clearly intend, but it's incompetent to have its cake. Like the way the third act is filmed, it wants you to think it's a bad future and you should feel bad for Sandler's character. Except, the future in Click isn't actually bad.

* Sandler's wife has remarried a nice guy and seems happy

* Sandler's daughter has become a successful model

* Sandler's son has become a talented manager in his company and has found a wife

But Sandler's character thinks these are all bad developments. He hates his wife's new husband for no reason, looks down on the modeling career of his daughter, and thinks his son will waste his life by focusing on his career (like he did). The only remotely sad thing that happens in that timeline is the father being shunned before dying.

So, Sandler's character is motivated to change his life out of selfishness. He is still the same asshole in the end.

movies,Review of Flow 2024,"I approached Flow with high expectations based on its marketing and glowing reviews, particularly regarding its visuals. Unfortunately, it fell short of these promises. The animation, though praised for it's style, felt outdated reminiscing of a role-playing video game back from 2012. While the limited budget was outlined by many, objective ratings should compare Flow to the leaders in the industry, like Dinsey or Pixar.

The film started with intriguing ideas and concepts, but I found it to lack depth and development. It focused heavily on illustrating the flow of life and nature without offering meaningful character arcs and development, to me it felt too superficial. In my opinion stories should engage, inspire, and challenge it's viewers or readers, but again Flow remained superficial and repetitive. Furthermore, it struggled to define its target audience, too slow, long and abstract for children, yet too shallow for adults. This left it in a no-man's land, catering to neither side.

I was really excited for the absence of dialogue, but it felt like a let down. Watching the film felt like a chore, without any emotional payoff. It sure was worth seeing once for curiosity, but I wouldn't watch it again. I'd rate the film give or take a 5-6/10. I think Flow is a film you definitely want to watch in the cinema, and not on your TV.

To be clear, I'm not a professional critic, and the point of this post isn't to bash or devalue the film, I think they did a great job for the shoestring budget they had, but these are my honest thoughts questioning the ""glowing"" reviews Flow has received.

movies,"Gulliver's Travels with Jack Black it doesn't even manage to be a fun parody of Jonathan Swift's book,","Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear.

What is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose. 

the film gives us  two woozy love interests and a multitude of over-the-top jesters (also guised in the form of kings and generals). The overall story has whittled down to the bare minimum of Liliputs and conflicting kingdoms, but apart from the that the connection is non-existent.

movies,I really miss natural dialogue in animated movies,"This is something I’ve noticed for years—ever since I was a kid watching these movies in theaters—and lately, I’ve been hyperfixating on it because I feel like no one ever talks about it. I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

In movies like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Shrek, Madagascar, El Dorado, etc., the dialogue feels semi-realistic. The characters sound like they’re having genuine conversations, the kind of exchanges you could imagine real people having. It feels natural, almost as if some of it were improvised. It’s as though the writers treated these films as legitimate storytelling, not just “animated kids’ movies.” They gave the characters real depth and personality rather than relying on the gimmick of “silly talking animals.”

This approach wasn’t exclusive to Pixar and DreamWorks either. Movies like Surf’s Up, Ice Age, Rango, Happy Feet, and Coraline had a similar feel. I think what really made it work were the performances—both the writing and the voice acting elevated the characters.

It seems like this style of writing started fading around the time Illumination became popular, which I find really sad. That said, there are some recent examples that capture this feeling, like Klaus, the Spider-Verse films, and Soul. It’s not entirely gone. You also see it in many adult animated shows like The Simpsons, Family Guy, Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, and even in a lot of video games.

It’s hard for me to put into words, but does anyone else know what I’m talking about?

Here’s a quick rundown of our thoughts:

	•	Ralph Fiennes is fantastic, as usual. His performance alone is worth watching, and he definitely deserves a Best Actor nod.
	•	Fiennes spends a lot of the film basically naked, and it’s clear he trained hard for the role—impressive dedication!
	•	The movie focuses only on the final third of The Odyssey and takes a few liberties with the story. But the key plot points are there and handled well.
	•	Visually, it’s stunning. The set design and cinematography are top-notch.
	•	The pacing was my one gripe—it drags at times and could’ve used a tighter edit.
	•	One major omission: the gods are completely absent. A big part of Homer’s original was the divine meddling, and the movie doesn’t even mention them. Homer would not approve!

movies,meaning of the name A-Rab in West Side Story ? ,"I'm doing an essay on West Side Story (both version from 1957 and 2021) and I was wondering about the nicknames of the characters in the gangs. 

Every side character's nicknames from the Jets is related to their personality contrary to the Sharks that stay rather stereotypical with Latino names, so I'll focus on them : there's Ice (that keeps his cool just like in the song), Action (very energetic all along, ready to fight), even Anybody (pretty early gender questionned character who doesnt belong and have their ways in and out of the shadows) but what about A-Rab ? 

English is not my first language so maybe I am missing a pun, consdering we learn from the police officer his father is an alcoholic ? I dont know if it is related ; I also imagine there is no way it is A-Rab as in ""Arab"" since West Side Story is a pretty obvious rivalry on ethnic grounds too and the Jets are supposed to be from Anglos origins ?

movies,What if Marlon Brando was in The Great Gatsby (1974)?,"What if Marlon Brando was in the 1974 adaptation of The Great Gatsby?

This is an interesting story, Robert Evans, who was involved with this production, sought Marlon Brando for the role. Although Marlon Brando was too old for the part, at 49, Evans wanted him in large part due to The Godfather &amp; Last Tango In Paris reestablishing him as a box office star.

Incensed at his loss of income when he surrendered his profit participation points for $100,000 to Paramount before the release of *The Godfather*, Brando personally negotiated his deal, demanding an unprecedented salary reportedly as high as $4 million salary (I think for both Great Gatsby &amp; Godfather II), frankly revealing that the high salary would recoup his losses from the sale of his points.

However, Gulf + Western CEO Charles Bludhorn, whose conglomerate owned Paramount, vetoed any such deal on the grounds that the two movies were separate entities. As a result, Brando turned down The Great Gatsby and also refused to appear in Godfather II, feeling he was being disrespected.

I think Brando would of been interesting, though too old, but I find interesting not doing this film actually resulted in him not doing his cameo in Godfather II. Ultimately, I think the film would of been the same as From what I read, the director, Jack Clayton, pretty much ignore the nuances of the script that was written. (Coppola wrote the script and everyone who read it thought it was brilliant, but Coppola said, ""Not that the director paid any attention to it. The script that I wrote did not get made.""

Anyway, regarding the topic itself, I mean movies or shows where the antagonist and the protagonist (or antagonist and a side character) are alternate versions of the same character, not when they are the same like in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. Some examples would be:

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Spain. It's interesting, because more than 100 comments later, in a way, we have a ""fpreign-but-not-so-foreign"" winner here: Internationally, ***El labertino del fauno*** (engl.: *Pan's Labyrinth)* is likely to be the best-known film on our list so far.

But [our official letterboxd list ](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)immediately calls for the next movie. We now move on to the next euorpean country with S, namely **Sweden**. Just like yesterday, there are only two rules to follow today:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

If the mods wanna take it down because its been solved they can do it


Hi reddit, as you can see from the title I'm looking for a animated christmas movie that aired on tv back in 2014-2016 (i think) in german on Super RTL. Its a kids movie with an art style similar to 'lady bug catnoir' and 'scooby doo mystery incorporated'.

The main character a boy about 10-12 somehow ends up with Santa claus fighting an evil black bearded santa with a trio of elf girl special forces. These girls have some aort of levitation-y power that the can use by tapping a snowflake on the left side of their neck around where the big vein is.
The girls end up getting trapped and about to be hit by either some deathly laser machine or sunk into lava or an shredder. The MC reacues them by them sharing their levitation with him and at the end fight the evil santa gets the good santas power to clone himself hundreds of time.
The end fight happens in this big room with moving rings around it thats similar to a ""Grand Orrery Model of the Solarsystem"" where you can also get teleported to the houses (i think).
I also remeber the leader of the trio force to first hate the mc and then be more friendly to the end because he rescued them all.

2- we don't see his father in the movie only his mother.

movies,Babygirl full review ,"Babygirl: 

electric, hot and sexy, pulse racing, arousing, erotically thrilling, submissively wicked. Nicole Kidman in her best performance of recent memory. 

Babygirl is exactly what it promised to be… an erotic and powerful story of forbidden pleasure. The director Halina Reijn does a super job here in her style of directing and her script writing skills. The tension is felt as if an explosion good go off at any second. A very underrated part of the movie is the cinematography, visually this film is nothing short of stunning,. A shout out to the editors too who have done a brilliant job here. The story as a whole has depth and intrigue that’ll keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat. 

Now on to Nicole Kidman. I said at the start of this review that this is her best performance of recent memory, and I stand by that. The way she portrays the coldness of her character as well as the open vulnerability is perfectly balanced. Harris Dickinson also completely shows again how good he is in anything he does, his control over Nicole Kidman’s character is mesmerizing and intense. Antonio Banderas has more to do in this movie than I initially expected him to have, especially towards the end where he has to dig deep into his emotional range. 

With all that said I understand Babygirl will not be for everyone. Whilst it’s tasteful and respectful in its eroticism, it can be awkward and uncomfortable to sit through for some audiences. 

Finally I just want to give a minor grievance I have which is the story at times can feel clouded where it leaves you the viewer to puzzle together some motives. Apart from that a very solid movie with excellent performances. 

Babygirl = 7/10

Any other movies with comedic bits as a side story that get more ridiculous as the movies goes on?","Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.

It just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying ""jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore"" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. 

Of course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic.

Hey everyone, I’m trying to collect a bunch of scenes from random movies with essentially side characters which save or try to save people or fight off villains and die or get knocked out in the process. A realistic, good depiction of someone. They don’t have to be in it for long(the lesser the better, it’s meant to be “red shirts” who surprisingly put up a decent fight) If you know any like these please let me know, you might think watch any action movie but literally there are so few with any good depiction let alone other genres.
Some examples(non-exhaustive) are below:
The Living Daylights: MI6 agent Green Four(disguised as a butler) fights Necros in a long creative fight and he even manages to burn Necros’s hand, but is eventually knocked out
The call- a guy at a gas station is killed trying to save the woman and a guy is killed after calling 911

Alone- An old guy fights off a young guy for ages in order to protect a woman and gets killed
See for me- A policewoman radioes for backup, cuffs one of the guys, shoots another, struggles vigorously with another before being killed. 
Turbulence-One of the air martiales fights off a henchman for a long time before being killed
Along came a spider- A fisherman tries to save the girl in the water but is killed
Jaws 2- Heli Pilot(which of no fault of his own but the fault of the script has no one like Brody or the kids tells him there’s a shark so he doesn’t take precautions but tries to save the kids) and Marge(who saves Sean)

Jaws 3- Fitzroyce shoots the shark, tries to swim back up but is caught in the shark’s mouth. He then tries to get out and can’t so he tries to blow himself up with the shark but can’t pull the pin because he’s crushed. This grenade is used in the finale.
Skyfall- Court police shoot loads of times at henchmen and one of the officers kills one of the henchmen off screen and another officer gets shot and keeps shooting
Die hard 3- vault guard calls for backup, fires loads of shots and is brave but is killed
Totally Killer- The mother fights the killer amazingly before being killed
Octopussy-The agent disguised as a clown puts up a good fight and runs for his life and completes his mission before collapsing dead
Hitmans bodyguard- convoy scene is great it’s pretty equal on both sides

Bad examples:
Air Force one- there are so many officers compared to henchmen and they kill ZERO I repeat ZERO henchmen despite being presidential security
Malignant- omg the police station scene has so many officers who run to the killer before shooting……..
Salt- Same issue, there’s some army head who rushes the bad agent before getting his gun out…
Die hard- pick any movie, I’ll give it the minimal credit for having one henchman be killed by the swat team but omg that’s awful

movies,"What's your favorite Special Feature on any DVD, Blu-Ray, or 4K disc?","Mine has long been the Thermian audio track for the ""Galaxy Quest"" DVD where they actually took the time to re-record the dialogue for the ***entire*** film in Thermian!  So unnecessary and yet so awesomely nerdy!

When I worked in a locally owned and operated video store years ago, we used to put ""Galaxy Quest"" on with the Thermian audio on busy Saturday nights and wait to see how long people would realize that they were hearing something different and ask us what was happening.  Good times!

Honorable Mentions:

* That same ""Galaxy Quest"" DVD also had an Omega-13 option which would roll the movie back 13 seconds from wherever you stopped it before bringing up the DVD menu.
* The hidden feature on the Memento Special Edition DVD that when activated, would play the film in chronological order.

movies,Snow White and The Huntsman -- weird but I don't hate it,"For some reason we have this on BR and we ended up putting it on the other night, not having seen it in probably a decade. And yes, it's a really fucking weird movie, but in some ways it totally works. Obviously there's an emphasis on visuals, which change throughout the movie to reflect the the land's hope vs despair (a la Pride Rock). But this movie has some other things going for it as well. Charlize is crazy but legitimately scary. Kristen Stewart is great, even though she doesn't actually talk all that much for most of the runtime. Plus it's got a banger of an end credits song, courtesy of Florence and the Machine.

The movie has some interesting themes as well. Most prominent is the fear of death and aging, which I think is always going to be subtext of this story. Snow White represents youth, beauty, and purity, which can never last; the pursuit of these things rots the Evil Queen's soul. Aside from making this subtext text, and the obvious feminist interpretations/implications, Snow White and the Huntsman also carries a pretty obvious environmental message. The Evil Queen steals beauty and vitality from not just her people, but the actual land as well, transforming the enchanted forest from a vibrant fairyland into a desolate wasteland.

All that said, the pacing can be really weird. The first twenty minutes is basically backstory, as Snow White's mother dies, the Queen takes control of the kingdom, Snow is imprisoned, and finally she escapes to the enchanted forest, when the huntsman, ostensibly one of the main characters, finally enters the picture. The middle of the movie is a little confusing, because the title characters don't seem to really have goals other than surviving. The poisoned apple and Snow White's coma transition pretty abruptly into the climactic battle, as well.

So yeah, it's weird, and you can point out a few flaws, but it's also a beautifully dark movie with a lot of heart and a pretty clear message. What do you think? Has your view on this movie changed since it came out?",DandCdomovies,1h90e7e,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h90e7e/snow_white_and_the_huntsman_weird_but_i_dont_hate/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h90e7e/snow_white_and_the_huntsman_weird_but_i_dont_hate/,2024-12-07 19:40:56,1,0.52,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Review,spoiler,t3_1h90e7e

We didn’t know the name of the movie. Giving him the benefit of the reasonable mind, I was searching for remake of some film staring Mila where now stars Charlize, even though it made no sense due to quality of the movie. After long search I found both Æon Flux and Ultraviolet, friend watched former one I watched the latter. And then I watch both. What’s the thing with these two.

movies,The best R-Rated Comedies,"Being a teen in the late 1990s and early 2000s I grew up on R-rated teen sex comedies, and I love them so much. Unfortunately the genre has kind of died off, but here are some of my highlights over the year. Here a short review of each :)

1. Risky Business (1983): This movie couldn't be made today! A young Tom Cruise's parents are out of town. They expect him to behave and prepare credits for college, but sometimes you just have to say ""what the f\*\*k"" as ""what the f\*\*k"" gives you freedom. This lead Tom to starting his own brothel. The movie is so stylish, and shows how teens have to balance being a good robot for society and the temptations in life. A classic 10/10.
2. American Pie 1-4 (1999-2012): We follow group of guys from when they set out to lose their virginities, to when they get separated in college, having a wedding party and a reunion. These guys have the best chemistry and I love the insane gags like Stifler getting a nasty beer, a nice shower, Jim having fun with a pie and getting glued, Stifler's mom, Finche's mom, and so on. The movies get 9/10, 8,5/10, 7/10, 8,5/10.
3. Eurotrip (2004): After a rough break-up (Scotty doesn't know!) Scotty and Cooper head to Europe to meet up with a sexy German exchange student. They are taken through gags in each country. They party with British hooligans, fight a mime in Paris, experience absinth in Eastern Europe, VanderseXXX in Amsterdam, go to a nude beach and meet the pope in the Vatican City. So much fun and quotable 10/10.
4. Superbad (2007): An updated version of American Pie. Sex-crazed geeky teens want to get laid at a party. Jonah Hill is an unstoppable dick-drawing savage, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the legendary McLovin', trying to score alcohol with a fake id, and Michael Cera is your normal kinda guy. So much fun and so many roughy joke and puking. A classic 10/10.
5. Sex Drive (2008): A teen makes a fake dating profile online, and goes on a roadtrip with his best geeky and charming friend to meet a girl. They encounter sarcastic Armish, swingers, and criminals, all while getting hunted by his gay-hating brother. It is fun, but avoid the unrated version, as it kinda ruins the movie. 7,5/10
6. Good Boys (2019): A bunch of 6th graders want to learn how to kid,  before their first kissing party. It is fun to see how kids this age want to be older and cool, while know knowing what they are talking about! They try to spy on teen girls with a drone, they encounter sex toys, a frat party and much more. It is both innocent and raunchy. 7,5/10a 
7. No Hard Feelings (2023): It is much easier to get cancelled these days, and this movie did get in trouble. So a 30+ female about to lose her house gets hired by some right parents to hook up with a teen to get him out of his shell (this is what almost got it cancelled). So Jennifer Lawrence tries to seduce the kid in various ways, and it goes wrong all the time, like when she in the naked has to beat up a bunch of kids! Still a cute, colorful and fun movie! 8/10.
8. Incoming (2024): Basically a new but slightly more safe take on Superbad, but still pretty fun. We have our four freshmen preparing for their first party. One would rather play video games than go to parties, one is the over-prepared guy who has an elaborate plan involving a surveillance system to seduce women, and then we have our average guy to identify with. The usual gags of drinking, being a fish out of water, innocense and all that. Still fun, 7/10.

Movies like Easy A and The To-Do List, while fun they are not rated R, so didn't include them. I also quite enjoyed The Hangover, 21 Jump Street, Bridesmaids, Hot Tube Time Machine and the Harold and Kumar movies.",Ebbemonster,1h8zx7a,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8zx7a/the_best_rrated_comedies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8zx7a/the_best_rrated_comedies/,2024-12-07 19:19:12,0,0.44,0,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h8zx7a

I feel like a lot of the criticism of his ability comes from people who have only seen Morbius and Suicide Squad

But it’s well known that he seems like a huge pain in the ass. His method thing seems really annoying for his costars, and also just wastes a lot of time. Leto seems to have a lot of confidence in his formula, not realizing most of the roles that made him famous were just relatively normal dudes. Now he wants to prove himself as some kind of “eccentric method genius!”

After a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven’t been very successful recently.

Also, I know David Ayer seemed to like his weird process, which I suppose makes sense considering Ayer got along with Shia Labeouf very well. However, what I find funny is when you look at the behind the scenes for the Suicide Squad, the cast seemed legitimately very close.

What do you think that scene where the cat and the bird are raptured to Heaven? 

My thought is: the entire movie is a retelling of the biblical flood and that scene shows that the bird fulfilled his journey and was then, raptured. But the cat still had a mission to do.

movies,Uwe Boll's Assault on Wall Street,"Ever since the assassination of the United Health Care CEO this past week, I haven't been able to get this movie out of my mind and I saw it many years ago.  It's about a guy whose wife gets sick, their health insurance reaches their limit and he tries to cash in on his pension from the military, but most of it was put into stocks and this film's setting was the 2008-2009 Wall Street crash.  The wife feels guilty, commits suicide and the husband goes off the edge and starts going on a killing spree against stock brokers and CEOs.  

It's directed by Uwe Boll (Of course, yes, that Uwe Boll) but as far as his movies go, I don't remember this one being half bad.  I remember Dominic Purcell from Prison Break as the husband and John Heard as the main antagonist.  I see it's on Tubi, I might rewatch it this weekend.

movies,"Airplane! Joke I didn't get: ""No More Cheese!""","In Airplane!, the character of Steve McCroskey is at the center of several running gags.

Indiana must race to prevent the vampires from obtaining the Ark, which they plan to use as a weapon to amplify their power, while also uncovering a mysterious connection between the ancient artifact and the vampires' immortality.

**#50. Polite Society** \- This year seems to be the year of over the top teen movies with Red White &amp; Royal Blue, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, and Totally Killer all going viral in spite of let’s say inconsistent quality. We'll talk about another one layer one, but I wanna start with a film that deserves a lot more attention that it got. What you’d get if Robert Rodriguez made a coming-of-age movie, it's a film that embraces its blend of martial arts flicks, over the top family melodrama, and 2000s comedy to a delightful degree. I will admit it's a bit of a case of style overcompensating for a lackluster story but what makes it work overall is the charming relationship of the sisters. Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya have great chemistry with each other, creating a sweet and charming bond throughout the film. At the same time, I also dug it doesn’t shy away from focusing on the immaturity and insecurity of a younger sister selfishly not wanting to lose a best friend to her sister. It does capture that betrayal when a family or friend you thought would be there forever for you has their own aspirations. If there is a nitpick, it's that I wish the actual fight scenes had stronger and more exhilarating choreography. Not that it’s bad per say and it does make sense that a film about an action film fan wouldn’t be as polished as the martial arts films it's paying tribute to. I still would’ve like more memorable fights is all. Still the charming presentation and the comedy more than makes up for it, and I can see this becoming a cult classic amongst teens down the line. 

**#49. Unrest** \- I normally advise people to go on as blind as possible knowing little about the premise. But for this film, I think it is important to know that the entire film revolves around community anarchists working in a watch factory who are secretly plotting a rebellion. It might sound exciting but there's very little drama within the film. There's barely what you could charitably call a story and not even a plot. It's very much a grounded and straight look at how revolution is formed, with no big setpieces and few twists outside of certain workers being arrested. And yet it remains an engaging watch throughout thanks to as the says, a feeling of unrest throughout. There's a sense of simmering anger that you can feel below each scene of workers conspiring in secrecy or even as they continue diligently working for the factory. Everything is below the surface and the power of this film is very much in what is not said, in every careful and deliberate word choice uttered through thin poker faces. The sound of ticking of clocks is a constant soundtrack through the film, almost as if counting down how long the workers have until they're caught. Maybe even how long it may be even viable to accomplish a proper revolution before the window shuts forever. Or perhaps, it's a sign of how time will go on regardless of what process is or isn't made. Maybe despite the stopwatch being built, we actually still have time. Its abstract nature means this isn't for everyone but if you're intrigued about the premise and are willingly to be challenged, can't recommend this enough. 

**#48. The Deepest Breath** \- A lot of people have compared this documentary to Free Solo which is unsurprising considering both are about extreme sports and the people who find meaning and purpose in life in accomplishing the awe inspiring. And even if this film isn't as good as that documentary, this one still stands on its own as a damn good watch. From the gorgeous cinematography to the literally breathtaking footage captured of various free divers, showcasing the determination and tenacity of the divers who do this regular serving and the backdrop of the story of two people who find each other at the right place but debatably the wrong time, it's a captivating watch as we see both the limits of human accomplishment in physical feats and the love that inspires us to keep moving forward. And it'll have you hooked and holding your own breath right up to the conclusion. 

**#47. Take Care of Maya** \- I tend to not care for a lot of Netflix-produced crime documentaries. A lot of them tend to be cheaply produced and overly dramatic, not to mention often with surface level commentary and analysis. It tends to put a damper on what could be interesting stories and neuters them in favor of sensationalization. Thankfully, this documentary is not only an engaging watch but one that does proper justice towards a wronged family and highlights a corrupt medicare system that harms rather than heals. Focusing on a young girl with a rare disease and the hospital that intentionally misunderstood her case to take advantage of her family, it is a tough and heartbreaking film. It highlights not just the cruelty in corporate healthcare on not just those who need it but the emotional toll on the families, but also one of inspiration. No matter how powerless their fight may be and how they acknowledge very real risk that even standing up will only result in more pain and trauma, it's moving see the love parents have for their children and an inspiring story of courage and tenacity of a family who fought together and never gave up in spite of everything being against them. It’s a quick but emotional watch that I hope more people do more than scroll past when they go on Netflix.

**#46. Infinity Pool** \- There are films that are depressing watches for their subject matter and tone, and then there are films that are out to make you uncomfortable. Not in the sense of making you feel danger is around any corner, more poking and prodding at the limits your desires will take you. Lust, sexual satisfaction, violence, all of these desires are ones we normally tempered. Infinity Pool asks: “what would happen if you didn't have to filter these sinful, carnal desires?” How far deep would these take you that you go numb from how disgusting you think of yourself and accept it as being blasé? I fully accept this may be me overthinking this movie and being off from its themes. Regardless of my interpretation of this film though, I can deny how. From being disgusted from being intrigued and fascinated, it's a pool I dove in feet first and will continue treading its waters for the next couple of years. 

**#45. The Sweet East** \- This is a movie most will probably hate after finishing and to be honest, as I was watching it for the first time, I did find it incredibly obnoxious. It's full of insufferable, pretentious, and frequently unlikable characters, the narrative makes little sense with Talia Ryder barely reacting to anything or having any change, and by the end you think what was actually accomplished? What did we gain and what was learned? And yet much like Infinity Pool, it's that absurdity that I kept on my mind over the next few days. I kept thinking about Talia-s blasé attitude to the whole adventure - encountering blatant racism, insecure men, and snobby artists and how in a way, it actually did speak to a certain zeitgeist. And as much as I was annoyed by the film, it also kept me engaged and by the end the bitter taste actually made sense. I can't say you will enjoy this film or get as much as I did but it is a film I doubt you'll forget once the credits roll. 

**#44. The Holdovers** \- Some films sneak up on you. At first I wasn't in love with this film as everyone else was. While I thought it was good, it felt a bit too slow and felt like I'd be better served watching any of the 80s classics like Dead Poets Society and Planes Trains and Automobiles that served as inspiration for this film. And yet like the train scene in PTA, I found myself thinking more and more about my experience and realizing how warm it was and how much I took for granted. The chemistry between all three leads, not just from the award winning performances from DaVine Joy Randolph and Paul Giamatti, but also from newcomer Dominic Sessa who I think has gone criminal underappreciated. He proves himself to be a young actor full of charisma, and it's wonderful seeing the relationships the trio has with each other grow without feeling too saccharine. The gradual acceptance all three have in their places as castaways and still finding solidarity in all that is quite moving. Even if it's a predictable formula of the classic grump learning to have a heart, Alexander Payne manages to make these characters feel human and real. It's already a Christmas classic and I could easily see a lot of families having this on as a new annual tradition. 

**#43. Sanctuary** \- Power is sexy and being sexy gives power. It’s an alluring power dynamic and this film manages to make simple discussions and dialogue of it not feel drawn out for 90 minutes. For a film of almost zero nudity and zero sex scenes, this has some of the tightest sexual tension in any romantic film in a while. Both Christopher Abbott and Margaret Qualley deliver fantastic, layered performances, showcasing why they're some of the most interesting young actors right now. The cat and mouse game they play going back and forth at each other is endlessly entertaining as you wonder who's in control and who's really being played. Which one submits first? Even with the play-like structure and the bottleneck setting, this had me captivated for its 90 minute runtime. I really hope more people check it out and I hope both Qualley and Abbott continue to get attention for their work, and I'm already eagerly anticipating Zachary Wigon’s next film, also starring Qualley. 

**#42. Killers of the Flower Moon** \- If this had been 30 minutes shorter and had Mollie given more development beyond simply being the symbol of Native purity and beauty literally poisoned by the white man, I imagine this would've been much higher. Because simply on a film level, it is one of the most impressive and epic in scale. From the pacing and editing that manages to keep the three and a half hour runtime engaging despite of lull points, to the grand production and setpieces that capture how big of a plot this is, to the tight cinematography capturing it all, to the roster of a cast that has even cameo roles shine to an ending that probably one of the more daring statements Scorsese has ever made about America and its dark history. It is a behemoth worth marveling at and even though it doesn't resonate as much as I would want to, I can't deny it's more than deserving of all the acclaim it's gotten. It is a great movie that I just wish I was able to connect emotionally more with as everyone else has. 

**#41. Earth Mama** \- Being a parent is a difficult task and even more tragic are the women desperate to be a mother despite society not allowing them to be or looking down upon them for doing so. But what about the women who, controversially, ‘aren’t fit’ to be a mother? Who is really deserving of that title? That’s the tough question that Savannah Leaf’s heartbreaking debut seeks to answer: what if a woman isn’t suitable to raise her own child. In less empathetic hands, this may have been too heavy or not a balanced portrait, but Leaf’s sensitive direction allows us to come to our own conclusions while not shying away from the dirty truth surrounding it all. But the power of the film lies in Tia Nomore’s lead performance as the imperfect woman wanting to be a mother. She's able to capture the motherly instincts and drive that would make her a good, maybe even great loving parent. Yet it doesn’t shy away from how naively blind she is to her selfishness and commitment issues that would complicate things for her and potentially traumatize her baby. And what’s most intelligent is how both sides are ones you understand the causes behind even if they seem counterproductive. You want her to achieve her goals of raising a family yet at the same time you want someone to step in to guide her away from a potentially toxic and self-destructive household. It's a film with an honest maturity, culminating in an ending that is tragic but at the same time earned. This went a bit under the radar but even with the heavy tone and subject matter, I hope more check it out.

**#40. Talk to Me** \- Another year, another A24 horror movie that’s gone viral and lives up to the hype. Although in contrast to some of their disturbing but challenging and difficult movies, Talk to Me is one of their most straightforward horror flicks. That's not to say Talk to Me is less than though, it still has that great suspense and atmosphere even with the localized Australian teen setting. Despite the stoner archetypes of the cast, what this film has to say about depression, trauma, suicidation and its effects on the family don't just hit home, but feel scarier than any possession or gore the film could’ve conjured up. Couple that with teen actors that have great chemistry with each other while acting like bratty, immature kids, and some of the best gore and makeup effects that'll have you squirming in your seat, and you've got not just another good addition to A24’ horror catalog but a promising breakthrough for the Philippou Brothers who I’ll no doubt be following for their future p projects.

**#39. How to Blow Up a Pipeline** \- This'll no doubt be one of the most controversial movies I praise on this list, especially if you are immediately against the premise and what the Andrew Malm Manifesto that inspired this movie advocates. But whatever your views are about the acts committed in this film, this is one of the best and most tense heist films in a while. It's not a film asking you to agree with the act nor is it necessarily concerned about changing your mind. Frankly it could care less if you would snitch on it. Whether you want to or not, you'll have to follow the shoes of those actually willing to do the extreme, how they pull it off, and the grit they have to stand by their acts. And yet it's also not a film loudly saying why this should be done, as it doesn't shy away not just from the consequences but the lackluster success rate in creating change that acts like this. At its core though, it's a tight and tense film with a fantastic editing and pacing as you get sucked into whether or not they'll accomplish their task, and by the end a film that dares you to wonder whether they should've gone farther or pulled back. 

**#38. Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie** \- Michael J. Fox has been one of the most inspiring figures for me. While it captures his struggles with Parkinsons and the humor he maintains despite his troubles, what I love however is the narration which was taken from his autobiography. It shows how self-aware and reflective he was about just upbringing, success, and shame regarding his addictions yet also how much wisdom he still has even as the disease continues to spread. Whether or not you're a fan of his work, just know him from his biggest movies, or just know him as the Back to the Future kid, I still highly recommend this film as a shining beacon of true human fearlessness. 

**#37. Scrapper** \- For as heavy, deep, and complex films are on this list, sometimes you just need a film that's just so charming and cute. I was actually hesitant to watch this film, writing it off as something I might find too twee and cutesy. But by the first 15 minutes I was hooked in. Much of that due to how damn charismatic the central girl is Lola Campbell, in one of the best child performances of 2023. I love the juxtaposition with both them being young people forced to grow up and act like adults, Lola, the scrappy child left to fend for herself and Harris the immature manchild realizing he actually needs to mature if he’s to salvage anything from his past relationship. And while there is an exaggerated tone, particularly in the editing, neither feel like simple characters; she is not simply a wise ass smart beyond her age and he's not simply a bumbling idiot trying to be a parent. They're both trying to figure out and realize they can't be alone in surviving anymore, and no matter how much they fight there is a familial chemistry between them that they need to keep hold off. It's short and sweet, a comfortable family comedy that shows even simple, played out concepts can be an emotional ride. 

**#36. No One Will Save You** \- It's easy for straight-to-streaming horror releases to get a bad wrap as cheaply made scare fodder. Which is why one of my favorite surprises of the year came from a quietly promoted release on Hulu that probably should've been released in theaters. The big talking point for this film is the decision to have virtually no dialogue throughout. In a lesser film. This could've been a cheap gimmick for a rote house invasion story through aliens. Instead, thanks to smart pacing, writing, and a committed performance from Kaitlin Dever, it turns the film into one of the more creative horror films of last year. The lack of dialogue alongside the great sound design manages to capture, it's an engaging character study in Grief, guilt, and self-alienation. Everything feels elevated with the lack of dialogue and trust you to understand what's going on. It's also a film that invites multiple viewings as there were background details about Dever's character and her story I didn't notice on first viewing. Sure the designs and the effects on the aliens might be a little cheap but that doesn’t take away from how engrossing an experience this was. I really hope this grows a cult following and escapes the trapping it got by being relegated to streaming, we could really use more innovation amongst mainstream horror. 

**#35. Skinamarink** \- This is a film that people either find terrifying or absolutely boring, with very little in between. There's no getting around how 97% of this film is still shorts of walls, hallways, ceilings, and other rooms with a hazy nocturnal filter and with the camera intentionally positioned away or obscuring…anything. If you aren't sucked into the first 2 minutes of this film, you are likely to feel miserable and irritated by the next hour and a half. And i'll admit I was skeptical I would fall for this filma spell, yet, I was enthralled throughout by the atmosphere. There is a film that for me captures a sense of helplessness and claustrophobia as a child in the dark, knowledgeable in little besides your own uncomfortability and fear. Your paranoia as you sit or lie down pondering the thought of monsters under your bed or in your closet may sound juvenile but this film shows that that fear may never go away, sometimes it's just hidden behind your view. Again, I can't guarantee you'll like this film and I also do understand people who think this could've been a short analog horror film. But I couldn't help but be drowned in this films atmosphere and few films had that experience with me. 

**#34. Trenque Lauquen** \- Sometimes, a film can escape a cheap, low budget look not through quick editing or quick banter, but through simple engaging writing and charismatic performance. This film can be daunting being a four hour watch split into two parts and truthfully not that many action or tension driven sequences, not to mention actually hard to find a copy of to watch. And yet I was just as drawn in by the central mystery that I couldn’t help but join along for the ride as you piece together clues behind a potentially large conspiracy. And central to the film's success is the lead performance by Laura Paredes, who not only captures Laura’s curiosity and desire for adventure, but possesses a subtle but magnetic charisma that would make you want to follow her. She doesn’t know where she’s going or what she’ll even do with the discovery once she arrives at it but you can also sense a determination to find what she’s looking for. Paredes doesn’t play it off as aimless soul-searching but as a woman on a mission perhaps only she can understand. Now I will say this is lower than I would want because the second half doesn't quite keep up the pacing of the first, and meanders a bit too much for me. Still the lead performance and the first act's tight writing still come with a recommendation for me. It might not be a satisfying destination by the end but it's the journey that's the more rewarding bit. 

**#33. Bottoms** \- It’d be so easy for me to call this the Superbad for Gen Alpha gays as it is a crass, crude and immature comedy and like with Superbad, it could’ve easily fallen into the trap of relying too much on vulgarity and innuendo. But in fact there's a lot more to Bottoms than just adopting modern slang to appeal to a younger audience. From the great supporting performances (particularly Kaia Gerber and Ruby Cruz) who are game for making this as fantastical and absurd as possible to the chemistry throughout that actually makes their relationships and interactions endearing and even blunts some of the more obnoxious characteristics of the main leads. The clever visual gags, to the quick pace and editing which means jokes don't overstay their welcome, even the slang doesn't feel too obnoxious as to instantly date this movie. It's just a really charming comedy that will no doubt become a cornerstone movie for teens this decade, every generation deserves a crass Crude comedy to rally behind and this one is smart enough to transcend that age barrier. 

**#32. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem** \- It's a real shame that the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies come out as the hype and interest for the brand fades and as Paramount is going through financial instability. But it’s a testament to the films quality that even with waning interest in the Turtles brand, word of mouth meant this was able to find an audience amongst old fans, critics, and even create a new generation of fans. There’s honestly so much to praise but more than the catchy synth score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Rosa of all people, more the gorgeous handrail animation bringing it back to the comic book roots, and more the colorful cast of villains that are really funny and well voiced (including an Ice Cube performance that doesn’t just feel like every Ice Cube performance), what makes this film are the Turtles themselves. It was a great decision to actually have them as teenagers for once and the writing and the voice cast makes them so lovable. Out of all the other adaptations I've seen, the turtles here don’t just feel like teenagers but actually feel like four brothers. They’re loose and fun, immature but not like every other quippy superhero team we’ve gotten since Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, they still throw in their signature personality traits so as to not make everyone feel interchangeable. Most of all they’re relatable and kids you root for - like with Bottoms, the Gen Z slang and social media humor doesn't feel like it dates this movie because of the smart writing and the chemistry between everyone. Paramount has said they'll continue with this direction for the Turtles and I really hope we do get a feature sequel for this crew because this is the type of imagination and creativity we need in children’s media.

**#31. The Killer** \- It takes a special kind of balls for a director to make a film that's a giant middle finger to an audience that latched onto his films for the wrong reasons. A darkly comedic deconstruction of the typically stoic, masculine killer as someone just as clunky, pathetic, and weak as the “normies” he looks down upon, it's an even more impressive thing this doesn’t feel like a self indulgent mess. Fortunately, David Fincher is one of the few directors who can pull it off and make an engaging thriller regardless of whether you see the subtext or not, because amazingly it still works as a straightforward action film. The action and choreography is tight and controlled but gritty - with the break-in fight being one of my favorite fight scenes of last year, the editing creates a sense of tension while also interjecting black humor so as to not get bogged down in self-serious parody, and Michael Fassbender captures the fake macho posturing of a man realizing he isn't the invincible or even intelligent Assassin he clearly wants to be. This film has been a bit divisive even for Fincher fans but I really hope there is a reinterpretation for this film later on as even if it's not subtle per say, it still is an engaging subversion of masculine tropes. 



**#30. A Thousand and One** \- Sometimes a film's power and emotions can overcome some story and presentation flaws. This is not a flawless film by any means as it does have issues in regards to narrative and presentation. But the sheer blunt emotions it holds overpowers any issues I might have to being one of the most gripping family dramas of last year. And that comes from the Trio of actors with William Catlet and Josiah Cross also wonderful. Both are great with Cross being the eldest version of Terrie, the confused child unsure of where to go in life and whether he's getting the support from the family he'd like, and Catlet as the reluctant father who still nonetheless gives it his all to be the father Terrie needs. But it’s Teyana Taylor who delivers one of the best and most powerful performances in all of 2023. She is an absolute star here and in a just world, she'd have been recognized for this film and given so many calls by directors looking to cast her. Like with Earth Mama, it doesn't shy away from the difficulty of being a mother - both society driven and by her own personal hang ups. Yet it is more than just the template of a hardworking mother struggling to keep her family together and above water that we’ve seen in other movies. Taylor disappears in her role of unwavering love, courage and ferocity shown to fight for her family that feels so raw and real. It's not the unique take on this story and it isn't an easy watch, but the performances alone make this an unforgettable experience and I really hope all three actors can get more exposure and bigger roles from this. 

**#29. 20,000 Species of Bees** \- Children have their own dignity that deserves to be acknowledged and most of all respected. It's a concept that seems absurd and a hard pill to swallow for most people and yet this movie shows why it’s important to respect it. Looking at the journey of a trans child no older than 10, from her own self acceptance to the reactions from her mother and the grandmother she's visiting, what really drew me in is that the film doesn't sugarcoat or infantilize the audience with how difficult it can be for her family to accept it. Her older relatives are more the well meaning types more prone to tolerance than accepting and even dismissing her at times. And yet they, and in particular her caring and loving grandmother, are still the ones giving her the support she needs to not just accept who she is but love herself. I also think it's clever how this struggle is reflected in the relationship between the mother and her parents. How the lack of reciprocity from her mother and especially her father, may have contributed to her failing marriage and lacking love she needs to give to her children. It all leads up to an ending that had me stunned on first watch and constantly thinking about it for the next few days. Couple that with Sofia Otero's fantastic performance which rightfully nabbed her a Best Leading Performance award at the Berlin International Film Festival - capturing both her confusion with her domestic situation but also the stubborness to accept her identity when others won't - and you have a small but powerful trans film that’s gone overlooked by far too many. Love is complicated and harder than it, even if its to yourself, but it's better to have love and hone than to have nothing.

**#28. The Eternal Memory** \- Nothing lasts forever and everything will fade in time, no matter how much we try to keep the memories of people and events in tact. It's a tough and scary reality we all have to face even when it seems unfair that goodness can go unrewarded. But choosing to remain loving and kind in the face of that is something that has to come from inside, no matter who remembers it. And the center of this documentary is the love between Augusto Góngora and Paulina Urrutia; a wife caring for her husband slowly losing himself to Alzheimers and yet never leaving his side, still living with him no matter his condition. But it's more than a touching story of marriage as there are three different memories being fought to be preserved. There’s also the memory of the family, who he’s been as a father and husband for many decades. There’s the memory of Góngora’s vital work and accomplishments as a journalist, documenting a Chile in unrest and the resistance that helped turn the tides. And there’s also memory of a Chile whose progress is on the cusp of being reversed amidst a new regime of power. It sounds like a tricky balancing act but this documentary manages not to feel overstuffed because as it reminds us, what keeps us united and focused is love. It’s a beautiful and touching documentary that even if it hits too close for some, I can’t recommend enough if only to keep this memory from dimming too early.

**#27. How to Save a Dead Friend** \- Media often portrays love between addicts as a tragic tale of people unable to save themselves or one of them. It's often easy to criticize them when you're on the outside looking in because logic laughs at the ridiculous stubbornness people show. Yet this documentary defies that by showing us why love is still just as strong and valid even when it seems like an irrational act. That even amidst the political and social unrest of Russia, amidst an uneven and crushing economic structure denying dreams to flourish, and amidst personal demons, genuine romantic love and comfort can still be bright and worth celebrating. This isn't a film that simply ignores from how destructive drugs and addiction can be, rather it shows that relationships and the emotions we shared with each other shouldn't be tossed away even if the situations weren't ideal. Even if it wasn't ever meant to last long, that he was doomed from the start, that the memories shared between them is worth savoring and cherishing. This is an admittedly hard film to track down but if you have the chance, do watch it. It’s an emotional love story and a creative documentary.

**#26. Smoke Sauna Sisterhood** \- And concluding the inadverdent trio of documentaries, we have a small film that packs a big punch, showing sometimes blunt honesty in a closed setting can be more impactful than any big imagery a camera can capture. Some might be uncomfortable at the idea of a documentary of mostly naked women opening up about their experience of trauma, abuse, and hurt, but it's not a film simply wallowing in misery and despair. It can be tough to hear such vulnerable stories, ones that admittedly feel uncomfortable for intruding upon. But the nudity and nakedness actually amplifies their experiences - showing how unafraid they are of opening up - and like the sauna they're in also makes the act of being there one of healing. It's a double cleanse on multiple levels in terms of letting go of pain but also having the support of those ready to listen. The stories will be triggering for some people so I can't easily recommend it to everyone. But for those willing to listen, I hope it can show inner peace can happen and that you don't have to stay hurt forever.",dremolus,1h8mbvs,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,2024-12-07 06:17:22,0,0.46,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Lv5K4bNzmRq5iVWsmVRjGb8tiX9SND_AhWiu1dV3DXs.jpg,t3_1h8mbvs

movies,"""Goofs""","Various websites list film goofs but some of them baffle me, I have just watched The Guns of Navarone and as with any film i like to read the Trivia and Goofs on IMDb and the TV Tropes pages.  
  
 On the mild side there is the usual guff about the wrong tanks and guns being used but the fact that Gregory Peck is an American palying a British person isn't classed as a goof. If an American playing a British person isn't a goof then an American tank pretending to be German isn;t a goof either.  This is mild because yes it's technically a goof and so i'm not too bothered that people are complaining but it's still slightly irrational to complain about it. 

  
On a more irritating note though is bollocks like ""they reused shots"", so what? It's OK to re-use a shot especially if another filmed shot would be almost identical, it's absurd to call it out as a goof. 

For me a slip up/goof/blooper would be a missed or poorly enunciated line, a bumped camera, a crew member in shot, equipment in shot that shouldn't be and other such things. I don't see how a dressed up vehicle pretending to be a different vehicle is any different to an actor dressing up and pretending to be someone they are not.   
  
Should we call out Colin Firth playing King George in The King's Speech a goof? They really should've dug up the actual King George to play the part, it's clearly historically inaccurate to not have the actual King in the part. 

This is of course ridiculous, just as ridiculous as expecting films made many years after a period to have period accurate props, It's much easier to employ actors, whether human or otherwise, and use those instead. 

  
Anyway, what do you think, is using the ""wrong"" vehicles or guns as a ""goof""? Or do you see them playing a role and being something they are not just like the actors are?

movies,Is there any website listing differences between theatrical releases and airplane cuts? And anyone know as to Silent Night (2023)?,"Hello, fine folks of Reddit. 

I am a digital immigrant, not a digital native (I am not quite a Baby Boomer; I’m Generation X, but I identify with the Boomers; that means I’m old). Something I appreciate about the internet, among the many benefits offered by the profound innovation, is that people who are more obsessive than I am perform a service for the world, generally for free, of analyzing subjects I take an interest in, reliably enough for my purposes. For many movies that have multiple versions, you can find a list of the differences between the original theatrical release, and the DVD, and a director’s cut. But I am unaware of any resource listing what has been taken out (or added in, but it likely is taken out rather than added in) to the airplane version of movies.
I appreciate that you usually have a title card about the editing, whether for aspect ratio or content. I write as I stream John Woo’s Silent Night. It warned me. I checked: what I have started is a full five minutes shorter than the unexpurgated runtime. I am wondering if someone has performed the service of examining the one against the other (which might be difficult, since I don’t know how you get the airplane edition other than on the airplane itself, so you’d have the put it on, then also stream it on a device; there would be no demand for a repository of airplane bowdlerizations, presumably; once on the ground, you’d want the full content). If anyone has a sense as to this specific title, please feel free to enlighten me. Presumably, it’s the violence that has been taken out. Given the middling reviews of the original, I’m not dedicated enough a fan to sit through the picture twice.
So to sum up, I have three questions.
(1) Thoughts about the airplane versions of movies?
(2) Is there a website I am unaware of, that enables people to check out what they have missed from perusing an airplane version?

movies,Losing your local movie theater,"When it opened in 1999 as a Carmike, my local movie theater was the premier high-tech theater of the future in the area. I saw Star Wars Episode 1 there 3 times. I saw the whole Lord of the Rings series &amp; probably something like 150 other movies there over the years. My roommate worked there for quite a while.

Except for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off. My girlfriend and I saw Endgame there at 8pm on opening night &amp; there were only about 8 other people.

The last movie I saw there was The Way Back, a drama with Ben Affleck as an alcoholic basketball coach. This was March 15, 2020. Two days later, it closed for COVID &amp; never reopened. At the point it closed, it still had the original carpet, which was badly stained &amp; full of holes &amp; the original seats, many of which were broken &amp; could not safely support a person. Weird projection problems were common. Half the toilets didn't work.

I haven't been inside, but word is the building was badly damaged a few months after closure by the a big storm. It just sold at auction for $750k and will probably be turned into another strip mall or condo development. According to the assessor, the land itself is worth twice what was paid, so somebody will probably make bank. The buyer is unknown, but I wonder if the contents will go up for auction at some point.

Both sides may have listened to one or the other as a secondary genre, but that's about it. And it was mostly rock fans listening rap as a third tier preference after alt rock and metal. And industrial rock/metal and hardcore rap actually blend pretty well together when placed together in the same atmosphere. But contemporary rnb? Sounds odd and forced, especially at a time when rnb was at its most cheesiest, cleanest, commercial and manufactured sound. In what world did most casual music fans listen to both Nine Inch Nails and Jodeci? Those bands may as well have existed in alternate universes.

But today it was on the telly and thought why not watch it again.

Firstly. I can see why Tim was in that role. His presence really sells that ""pure"" figure.

Also I had forgotten how much narration Morgan Freeman does. If anything the whole movie shows different shades to the characters. From the guards to the prisoners and all. 

The only ones who are one-sided are The Sisters. Otherwise everyone else shows some good and some not so good.

Also the cinematography is really beautiful considering the circumstances. A real ""natural"" use of light and I appreciated how well lit it was. Unlike some films today where it's so grey.

I could see directing similarities between this and The Mist. First time noticing that. Yes I know same director.

I had always wondered why this film was so highly regarded. But upon watching it there is so much heart and the themes really speak through universally of resilience, perseverance and this sense of inner purity.

movies,The Mist ,"Why was this movie made? How was it really received at the time? 

I understand the 2000's Hollywood zeitgeist of leaning into overdramatic corniness, but this movie takes the cake. 

It seems like a B movie, but with decent at-the-time CGI, which implies a decent budget. Apparently a well-received film in terms of popularity. I'll admit, though, the ending is probably the movie's saving grave. 

Incredibly lazy, one-dimensional characters. The ridiculousness of it all kept me watching as I kept pondering how our standards have changed, at least for a blockbuster as we now understand it. 

Perhaps a key difference now is our expectation for a theme of irony - for characters to have a degree of self-awareness when indulging in shallow, easy to predict patterns of behavior. ""marvel-ization"" might be a word for it. 

I'm just at a loss of how shit this film is. I'm at a loss of how I'm supposed to have felt while watching it.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Spain,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Slovenia. In a way, we have a double winner: Because it was mentioned in two (and actually more) comments. both 1st and 2nd place are occupied by ***Moj ata, socialistični kulak*** (engl.: *My dad, the socialist kulak*),  As always, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it certainly sounds like an insightful and impressive tragicomedy about issues that are in part even more topical than in 1987, when the movie was released.

I wonder what the next movie will look like? In any case, it will also end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And in any case, let's move on to the next country with an S: In this thread, it's all about movies set in **Spain**. And as always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Why Does Bollywood Keep Ignoring Young People?,"Bollywood just can’t find the middle ground, and it’s frustrating for the young generation. On one side, you’ve got over-the-top movies like Golmaal—bright, colorful, and so unrealistic that it feels like they’re made for 10-year-olds. On the other side, when Indian filmmakers try to make something grounded, they dive straight into the Indie hellhole. These films are so bleak and heavy that, as an Indian, watching them makes you want to curl up and quit life.

But here’s the real issue: Bollywood keeps targeting the family audience or older generations. Most movies are either made for families to watch together or for the older crowd who can afford to go out and buy tickets. But what about us? The 18-25 crowd? We’re left out. We’re the ones who want stories that feel real, not some absurd comedy or a depressing indie film that makes us question everything.

Bollywood has the talent and creativity to make something honest and balanced, but it feels like they’re playing it safe. Why aren’t they making movies for us? Why is every film either for kids or parents? It’s about time they woke up and started telling stories that connect with young Indians.",No-Indication9775,1h89kdg,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h89kdg/why_does_bollywood_keep_ignoring_young_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h89kdg/why_does_bollywood_keep_ignoring_young_people/,2024-12-06 19:30:19,0,0.32,0,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h89kdg
