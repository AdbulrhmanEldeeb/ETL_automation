movies,"December 13-15 Box Office Recap: 'Kraven the Hunter' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' massively flop. Meanwhile, 'Moana 2' crosses $700 million worldwide, and 'Interstellar' finally crosses $200 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/xi19z0g5ta7e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f

The man finally came around.

***Moana 2*** was still on top of the box office, although the gap between it and ***Wicked*** is becoming smaller. We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures. ***Kraven the Hunter*** ended the SSU on a new low, while ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** finished outside the Top 5. In limited release, ***Nickel Boys*** had a solid start, while ***September 5*** disappointed.

The Top 10 earned a combined $87.6 million this weekend. That's up 27% from last year, when ***Wonka*** debuted on top.

***Moana 2*** threepeated on the top spot, earning $26.4 million. That's a 48% drop, which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop. After a record-breaking opening weekend, the legs are proving to be quite front-loaded. The film has earned $337.3 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $500 million domestically. And depending on how much it drops against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***, it could miss $450 million domestically.

***Wicked*** was still on second place, but it's getting close to ***Moana 2***. It earned $22.6 million this weekend, which was just 38% down from last weekend. The film has amassed $359.1 million, and it's now poised to earn more domestically than ***Moana 2***. It could start overtaking it next weekend, assuming it doesn't have a bad drop against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***.

Debuting in third place, ***Kraven the Hunter*** flopped with just $11 million in 3,211 theaters. That's the worst debut in the SSU (Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe), and one of the worst for a Marvel property. Hell, it even debuted below ***Kick-Ass*** ($19 million), another R-rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

This is not really a surprise. I mean, where do we start?

The SSU has earned a cumulative $2.1 billion worldwide. But the *Venom* films account for $1.83 billion of that, which is like 86% of its gross. The other two films, ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***, were critical and commercial duds, becoming Internet's laughingstock. Even the ***Venom*** films are already losing good will among the general audience. Basically, it's a universe with absolutely nothing to offer, where the bar keeps going lower and lower. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times...

But how could ***Kraven*** open below ***Madame Web***? On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released, ***Kraven*** barely felt like a comic book movie. The trailers emphasized brutal action, but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks. The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider-Man, yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story. With no signs of Spider-Man.

For some reason, Sony decided that ***Kraven*** warranted a big budget. The film was originally set at $90 million, which rose to $110 million due to the strikes (although some reports say that it actually cost $130 million). That's almost on par with the previous ***Venom*** film, and it's way too high for a C-lister. Especially when they made it R-rated. Sony is aware that this universe isn't working; [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kraven-the-hunter-sony-marvel-universe-spider-man-box-office/) reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe, choosing to focus on ***Spider-Man 4***, ***Beyond the Spider-Verse*** and the ***Spider-Noir*** series. They admitted defeat before the film even came out.

There was some slight hope that J.C. Chandor's presence would also lead to a competent film. But that was not the case; it's currently at an awful 15% on RT. Nothing but a paycheck. 

According to Sony, 71% of the audience was male, which is higher than usual for a comic book title. 40% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a horrible ""C"" on CinemaScore, which is even worse than ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***. If you think these numbers look bad, just wait for the second weekend drop. Even with the holiday season, it's unlikely ***Kraven*** can hit $30 million domestically. A comparison could be ***Star Trek: Nemesis***, which also opened on December 13. After disappointing with $18 million, it closed with just $43 million. If it follows the same trajectory, ***Kraven*** will finish with just $25 million. Yike.

After its rough drop, ***Gladiator II*** slightly recovered. It dropped 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. Looks like ***Kraven*** barely had an impact. The film has earned $145.7 million, and it should finish with close to $170 million.

Barely cracking the Top 5 was ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, which flopped with just $4.5 million this weekend. There's no point in even comparing it to the ***Lord of the Rings*** trilogy, which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend.

While ***The Lord of the Rings*** is a massively popular franchise, there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel. To understand how anime has a ceilling; last year, ***The Boy and the Heron***, with all the buzz it could achieve, made $46 million domestically. That's far less than what other animated films can earn. Warner Bros. knew this couldn't be a big moneymaker, which is why they only spent $30 million on the film, and released it in just 2,602 theaters.

It has been reported that the film's existence was fast-tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien's novels. Although with the recent announcement of a ***Hunt for Gollum*** film coming in 2026, it was clear ***Rohirrim*** wouldn't really be a priority. If people were on the fence over this film, the film's middling reviews (51% on RT) indicated that this wasn't worth it.

According to Warner Bros., 68% of the audience was male and 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a lukewarm ""B"" on CinemaScore, far worse than any Middle-Earth film. This is not gonna last long in theaters; it'd be a surprise if this earned over $15 million lifetime.

Despite being available on Prime Video, ***Red One*** dropped just 39% this weekend, adding $4.2 million. The film has earned $92.4 million, and it's fighting to hit $100 million.

It took 10 years, but Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** has crossed $200 million domestically. The IMAX re-release added $3.6 million, which was just 21% down from last weekend. Fantastic all around.

***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** fell 67% this weekend, adding $1.6 million and taking its domestic total to $13 million.

***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** eased just 14% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $36.6 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer***, which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend. That allowed it to increase again, earning $790,954. The film's domestic total stands at $1.9 million, and it will need some Oscar buzz here.

***Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem*** finished outside the Top 10 with $737K during the weekend ($2.3 million four-day).

A24's ***Y2K*** lost 160 theaters and fell 68%, earning $684,957 this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $3.7 million, and it's gonna miss $5 million.

Paramount released ***September 5***, an awards hopeful, into 7 theaters. But the film earned $80,802, which translates to a very underwhelming $11,543 per-theater average. The film will expand nationwide on January 17, 2025, but this is a very weak start.

Amazon MGM's ***Nickel Boys*** debuted in 2 theaters, and earned $54,794 this weekend. That's a solid $27,397 per-theater average, and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl*** debuted in one single screen, earning $50,300 this weekend. That's a fantastic per-theater average, making it the fifth highest of the year. It will hit nationwide in January.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** was once again topping the overseas box office. It added $57 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $716.8 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), UK ($33.5M), Germany ($24.8M), Mexico ($23.5M) and Brazil ($21.1M). It's gonna the billion milestone, but it's taking some time in getting there.

***Wicked*** added $21.5 million, and its worldwide total is now $525 million. It debuted in Germany with $4 million, which is the best for a Broadway film. The film's best markets are the UK ($55.2M), Australia ($20.1M), Korea ($12M), Mexico ($9M) and Philippines ($5M). It will hit its final market, Japan, on February.

***Kraven the Hunter*** also flopped overseas. It earned just $15 million, taking its worldwide debut to just $26 million. For comparison, ***Madame Web*** earned $49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just $100 million. There's a strong chance ***Kraven*** finishes below $60 million worldwide.

After missing the mark domestically, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** also flopped overseas, earning only $4 million overseas. That's a paltry $9.9 million worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Smile 2* | Oct/18 | Paramount | $23,021,692 | $68,967,012 | $137,991,092 | $28M

- Paramount's ***Smile 2*** has closed with $137 million worldwide. While that's a 37% drop from the original, it's still a box office success. Reception as a whole was much better than the first, with Naomi Scott earning praise for her performance. ***Smile 3: This Time It's Personal*** should be coming anytime now.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

***Moana 2*** will cede the top spot, and it's a battle between a lion and a hedgehog.

Disney is releasing ***Mufasa: The Lion King***, five years after the 2019 remake earned over $1.6 billion worldwide. Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins, and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar. This is a strong IP, but this is uncharted territories, given that this is a completely new story with new songs. It's not gonna come anywhere close to that $1.6 billion gross, but we'll see how much it can make.

The other release is ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3***. The franchise is going strong, and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow, which drew hype among the Internet. The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film, and the pre-sales look very strong so far. With the holiday corridor, another increase is pretty much imminent.

In limited release, A24 is opening Brady Corbet's ***The Brutalist***. It stars Adrien Brody as László Tóth, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States, where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life. The film has received fantastic reviews so far, and it's poised to become a big Oscar player. Look for a healthy run, even if the 215-minute runtime might be too much for many.

movies,Just finished Oblivion. Legitimately really enjoyed it.,"I'm not going to sit here and say it was the best movie ever. Nor do I have any knowledge about the books the movie is based on. But I had a lot of fun with the movie. (This is my first movie review, plus I'm pretty tired, so I apologize in advance for how disjointed it may feel)

I'll start with what I disliked, which honestly wasn't much:
There were issues with the pacing and the dialogue, I found some performances a little stilted, and some twists were more expected than others (the Tet being evil was obvious from the get go).

As for the positives:
Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, and Morgan Freeman delivered great performances I thought. I found myself actually being super absorbed in the plot, and it wasn't too difficult to follow (like a lot of sci-fi can be), which I liked. I think what everyone can agree on when it comes to this movie is that both the score and the visuals were absolutely top notch. The fact that the movie came out in 2013 blows my mind a little. 

Overall, I thought the movie was a solid 8/10. I can't say I'm totally sure why the movie gets as much hate as it does. Who knows? Maybe I just enjoyed it because I'm a huge Tron fan, and this feels similar.

movies,"Catherine O'Hara is simply spectacular as Kevin's mom in the Home Alone movies. She made the most out of a thin role, giving it more humor and depht than it deserved.","If you go through the Home Alone movies, the bond between Kevin and his mom is the heart of the Film. They have a love-hate relationship in which Kate (O'Hara) always sees the bad in Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), because he's a kid  who allows his emotions to get the best of him when he's bullied by Buzz or cursed at by his no good Uncle, but she also has a lot of love for him. But when Kevin is lost or left by the wayside, it's the mom who bears the guilt and tries to figure out what went wrong as well as acknowledging her mistakes. 

One thing I felt lacked in Lost in New York was the mom's subplot. I loved the Catherine O'Hara and John Candy's scenes in the first movie, great chemistry and O'Hara's character got to do a self-examination. 

The sequel, O'Hara is given less to do but the crux of the film continues to be the bond between Kevin and his mom. It's no accident that she's always the one whom Kevin runs to whenever he misses his family. The father is an after-thought in all of this. 

And Catherine O'Hara is superb as Kate. She gives a true depiction of motherhood, one which isn't perfect and it's often flawed but the love and care is still there. And O'Hara is an incredible comedienne and juices up a part which could have easily been another generic mom role.",Davis_Crawfish,1hfmgpm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,2024-12-16 16:07:01,1294,0.94,1294,0,176,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfmgpm

movies,The Holdovers Was A Christmas Surprise,"If you're looking for a new Christmas movie to put on this season and haven't watched the Holdovers, I'd highly recommend it.  I put it on later at night, after watching a show for some background noise and ended up being pulled in with its funny but comforting atmosphere.

I'm not a huge fan of Alexander Payne his movies tend to be enjoyable but nothing that really stands out, but the chemistry here in The Holdovers works really well.  I'm in-between the ages of the younger student Angus and the older mentor Paul, so I could see it from both sides.  People coming to terms with their lives and the people they may or may not want in them.  Even the cook Mary gives us a great perspective on the outside looking in on these characters lives and why everyone is important and has a story.

movies,Passengers (2016): How dark could it have gone?,"I watched the movie *Passengers* recently, and I just can’t stop thinking about the scenarios that could have happened, especially how dark it could get. I mean, 90 years is a *looong* time! Here are some of the scenarios that came to mind:

* Jim and Aurora have kids, and how would those kids have dealt with their lives? Would they have resented their situation and sabotaged the ship? Also, if they don't wake up other passengers, there could be a risk of inbreeding!
* What if Jim and Aurora decided to wake up more passengers but ended up waking the wrong ones and it backfires when the new passengers are hostile?
* The movie shows Aurora forgiving Jim, but realistically, forgiveness isn’t that simple. What if she grew bitter over the years and sought revenge?
* Jim passes away, leaving Aurora alone. She is unable to figure out how to wake another passenger like Jim did. Over time, she goes mad and maybe commits suicide. Yikes, that would be scary!
* The entire passenger population wakes up far too early. With limited resources, the ship descends into chaos, leading to starvation, riots, and widespread death.
* The darkest scenario I imagined is the ship malfunctioning, trapping everyone inside with no way out. They’d be awake but unable to escape, turning the ship into a floating prison.
* Cannibalism: If resources become critically scarce, they face unimaginable choices, including cannibalism if one dies or if hostility arises among awakened passengers.

movies,"Finally Finished. Watched 505 Movies This Year! If Anyone Cares, Here's A Top 5 (Mostly) From Each Decade.","\*Posted in r/moviecritic as well.

As the title says, I made a goal this year to watch 500 movies this year, roughly 40-50 from each decade to broaden my movie horizons, and while it required DAILY dedication, I finally finished today. In fact, I watched 505 as I also viewed a few bonus movies.

I built the list from Best Picture winners from the big award shows. (Academy Awards, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, etc.) I also used every “Top 100” list I could find, and even used a helpful post here on Reddit that compiled the top 250 based on users scores, which helped find foreign movies.

I made a rule for myself that I had to finish every movie, even if I hated it. (Which gave me the chance to change my mind on a few, like “Holy Motors,” etc.)

So, here’s my Top 5 from each decade, except the 20s which only got 4, and the 2000s, which had too many great movies and gets 11. The movies are only listed in order of title length, except the first one, which was the best in my opinion.

Very excited for next year's viewing list, which is the exact opposite of all this critical acclaim and made up of almost exclusively my Arrow Video Boxsets and Vinegar Syndrome purchases. (Although I am only doing 400 for an easier pace.)

\*EDIT\* I did include an image that showed the list of the 505 movies I watched. As I said in comments, if anyone wants the excel file for their own list, let me know and its all yours.

\*EDIT\* I made a mistake with the date for Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I have it listed as 1998, but it is actually 1988. My bad.

movies,It's now ten years since Peter Jackson directed a non-documentary film,"The third Hobbit film came out ten years tomorrow, and there's no sign of him directing anything else any time soon.

I think those movies are ever-so-slightly underrated (I stick up for the EEs as the best versions, as unnecessary as an even *longer* version of that story might sound). But it's hard not to think something about their troubled production, and maybe the ways Hollywood has changed over the years, broke something in old PJ.

Not that he hasn't been keeping busy at all. They Shall Not Grow Old was a really good documentary, and Get Back is essential viewing for Beatles fans. Not to mention his part in getting their 'new' song made. He seems happy enough tinkering with his pet interests.

It's a little sad though to think back on when the LOTRs came out and he was gearing up for King Kong and was still in his early 40's, you could imagine he was only just getting started. But now he seems more or less retired as a director and accepting that LOTR is probably what he'll be remembered for.

In a way, that's fair enough. LOTR is more than most people achieve. Still, it would be nice to see him back and doing something new, even if it's just shooting another horror movie in his backyard like he used to talk about doing.",Critcho,1hflaki,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,2024-12-16 15:14:39,730,0.89,730,0,242,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hflaki

movies,Oddity in VHS of Monster Squad,"I was feeling nostalgic and decided to watch my old VHS copy of The Monster Squad- the 80's movie where a group of kids team up to take on Dracula and his monster crew. Anyway, I was playing on my phone and let the credits roll to the end, and something weird happened.

Instead of the usual static that you get when a VHS tape finishes, there was a 3-second blip after the credits. It was grainy and muffled like someone was recording it on a camcorder they were trying to hide. It seemed to be one of the kids dads in front of the clubhouse saying something close to, ‘Take Tish’ (I watched it several times and that's the closest I could make out.)

I’ve Googled it, checked Reddit, and searched YouTube, but I can’t find anyone talking about this. It feels like it could be an Easter egg or an accidental addition, but I can't make sense of it.

movies,The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull opening is one of the weirdest things ever,"Never been a fan of Indiana Jones, didn't grow up on his movies, seen only the first one on TV at some points. Started watching them in order and just finished The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.

So this is the grand return of the character to the big screen and Harrison Ford's return to the role. Indiana Jones always struck me as a less cliched action hero. Sure, there's a pulpy feel to his adventures and they're generally pretty light hearted, but he still feels less like a typical invincible soldier with a machine gun type of an action hero and more of a everyman, an archeology professor who rarely uses his gun, who's not in it for the money or glory, who often gets captured, gets hit during brawls and is afraid of snakes.

And one of the first things he does in this movie is survives a nuclear explosion. Now I've always heard about the fact that Indiana Jones hid from a nuclear explosion in a fridge, but I've thought that it was either a meme I didn't understand or a climactic moment in one of the movies. But no, this is literally happening in an opening, he randomly stumbles upon a nuclear testing site and hides in a fridge to miraculously survive. And then the movie actually starts. Like, due to the law of drama, him being fired due to red scare(isn't 1957 too late for McCarthyism?) feels more dramatic than him living through a nuclear explosion without even breaking a bone from that flying fridge.

I know that this movie is not very well liked by the fans(it is okay-ish, though the CGI is pretty cheap, the nuclear fridge is dumb and also Indy being dumbed down and trusting Mac about ""I've left you to die with the soviets, but I'm actually a double agent"" and then ignoring the fact how he openly thirsts for the treasure in the El Dorado is ridiculous). But I'm curious how did people react to this opening after seeing their favourite hero return.

Adam maintains a high temperature throughout the movie. There are scenes where he coughs and chokes. Emergency lights reflect on the walls in multiple occasions. The colour temperature is mostly warm (orange). And finally the closing song kicks off with the lyrics: feels like fire""

movies,Lindsay Lohan is phenomenal in The Parent Trap,"
I just watched The Parent Trap for the first time, and she seriously surprised me. She should’ve been nominated for a golden globe, at the very least.

She’s so believable as twins it’s crazy. She gives each of the twins subtle characteristics that make them feel like 2 completely different people. I mean they actually felt like real twin girls, who were separated at birth. The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which “twin” was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. 

Every single line delivery of hers is incredible. Every single joke lands.

There’s a certain scene about 20 mins into the movie, where the 2 girls discover that they’re twins. There’s a specific line that she delivers that absolutely broke my heart, and brought a tear to my eye. She delivers this line with a single tear and a voice crack, and it was fantastic. It’s so subtle, but packs a big punch. Never in a millions years, did I ever think I’d start to tear up watching The Parent Trap, of all movies…

She’s so good, and the movie seriously surprised me. I would definitely watch it again

movies,What is so off about Dear Santa?,"I’m watching and it just feels off in every way. The main kid is bad at acting, which you can’t really expect too much from a young kid, but still he is like a charisma void even despite his character. His parents are also off sounding with their lines, like when they film dialogue separately using stand ins. All the dialogue has no flow between the characters. The cinematography(shots, pans, editing) feels weird and off. Comedy is all about timing and delivery, and every bit and line is a swing and a miss. Jack Black seems like he’s just doing improv, poorly. It reminds me of someone new to stand up who hasn’t worked out their rhythm yet.

movies,Question about the movie Die Hard (1988),"
In the movie Die Hard John McClane spends 30+ minutes trying to alert the police that there’s a hostage situation at Nakatomi Plaza. When they finally arrive and set up a perimeter, he seems quite relieved but once he observes the police get ready to enter the building he immediately switches to aggravated and criticizes them saying “no, no, you macho assholes.” and radios down something about “I told you what kind of guys you’re dealing with!” He even seems exasperated when they try to breach the building with the armored vehicle. 

I guess I’m having a hard time following the logic. Did I miss something? What kind of response was he expecting? 

The only thing I could come up with was he was expecting some kind of negotiation scenario.

movies,“Nintendo Deer Hunter 3”,"It’s that time of year again when I feel the compulsion to put forth that Bad Santa is not only the greatest Christmas movie of all time but an American Movie classic worthy of being in the same discussion as Godfather II, Citizen Kane, Goodfellas etc..etc. The cast is impeccable with zero misses, everyone of the actors brings their A-game and are hitting homers left and right. In my humble opinion this results in best career performances by a number of these actors including Thornton, Scott, Ritter, Bernie Mac, Leachman (who barely speaks) and of course The Kid. The quotable quotes are present in every scene “I’m 92 pounds you asshole”, “you know, thin fingers not fat sausage fingers” “ass clown” “I slept with an unclean woman” etc.. the list goes on. This is one of those movies that combines a unique and extremely compelling premise with great comedic performances and mixes in just enough heart to give it perfect balance.

movies,"""Constant questioners"" whilst watching a movie - annoying, or no?","I was watching a movie with a friend on the weekend, and he has this IMO extremely annoying habit of constantly asking questions during the movie. Like 'why did they do that?' 'what was that for?' 'what's he planning with that' etc etc.

Suffice it to say, I find this extremely fucking annoying and I told him so in no uncertain terms. His response was to play the victim like ""Man, why so aggressive?"".

The thing is, constant questioners IMO, basically know they're being annoying and do it anyway. We're watching the same movie. We're up to the same point in the movie since we're watching it together. I don't have any knowledge of the movie you don't, unless you weren't paying attention - but even still, that is not on me to rectify for you, you need to pay attention.

And even still, he asks questions I couldn't possibly have the answer for and it's strongly implied the movie will answer them for you anyway as long as you keep watching. Like, why ask me that question when you know I don't know the answer? The movie hasn't given us the information yet but you know it will later!

Is it just me, or are constant questioners the worst people to watch movies with? I'm basically banning him from watching movies at my place now.

movies,Found Something Shady,"Recently, someone promoted their short film/feature film (https://youtu.be/5Wbu1eEeMCw). The said person stated that the said film has won so many awards, that he can't even remember, including Cannes Film Festival awards &amp; New York Film Festival awards (in plurals).

This tingled my spider senses, and I tried to scan the internet for the same.

I found that the maker of the film has made multiple social media posts claiming the same, both on his studio's Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/arjunpicturesprod?igsh=MTc5bDhtazJhMWxreA==) as well as on YouTube (https://youtube.com/@arjunpicturespvtltd).

He made similar claims for his new project, too (#KK).

These are their so-called websites as well:

I always interpreted the ending to be that Kris chose to go to the surface of the planet and is now living in the simulation of his memories, for better or for worse. It's simultaneously joyful and sad. On one hand he gets to see embrace his father again and return to a time and place that brought him joy. On the other hand, it's a world of his own memories and who knows what kind of nightmare he can create for himself. A classic ""what dreams may come...."" scenario.

Now I'm wondering if the Kris we see on the island is in fact not the ""real"" Kris at all. Earlier they had broadcast his brain waves to the planet in an attempt to communicate with it. What if the Kris we see at the end is just a duplicate, created by Solaris from his transmitted brain waves? The ""real"" Kris could have decided to return to Earth or to an unknown fate.

- In Breens movies, every attractive woman wants to sleep with Breen, resulting in a romantic subplot or love triangle. In Megalopolis, Wow, Julia, and Vesta all sleep and/or want to sleep with Ceasar.
- In Double Down, Niel Breen has constant flashbacks to his dead girlfriend. In Megalopolis, there are four random flashbacks to Caesar's dead wife.
- In Breens movies, there are many disjoint plots taking place simultaneously. In Megalopolis, there is the plot between Caesar and Cicero amd the bank takeover plot with Wow and Shia Labeouf to name two.
- In Breens movies, Breen is always endowed with supernatural power. One of the biggest selling points of Megalopolis is that Caesar has the power to stop time among others.
- In Breens movies, the villains/antagonists are corrupt politicians and/or corrupt businessmen. In Megalopolis, the main antagonists are Mayor Cicero and the banker Crassus.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Vatican City,"Hello there,

this is the last day of my journey through the filmised Europe. Following the official list of european countries by the Council of Europe in an alphabetical order, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in a given country once a day for more than 50 days. Towards the end, things got really complicated again: As the calls for the UK not to be treated as a single country became louder and louder, I broke it down again. Unfortunately, the turnout was very limited, so I would say that if I had to do it again, I wouldn't unravel it again. But we do have a winner: Alongside *Hot Fuzz* (winner for England), *Hunger* (winner for Northern Ireland) and *The Halfway House* (winner for Wales), the winner of the Scotland round has now clinched overall victory for the UK - congratulations go out to ***Trainspotting***.

Basically, this UK final would also have been suitable for the final of this whole project. At the same time, that might have been a very sad participation rate for the final, so I'm glad that one country is still missing - a country that some people were looking forward to, as I could see from the comments: Today, to round things off, it's all about **Vatican City**. And for one last time, I may announce the relevant rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions and hope to see you again in the final thread, where I will anounce the winner of this round!

movies,"So, I watched Lord of the Rings: The War of Rohirrim","I watched it yesterday in Germany with English dub. I have to say I was positively surprised, tough it was definitely not perfect.

There was a lot of stuff me and my nerds liked. Mostly the low-fantasy-story itself and how well it fit into the lore and how respectful it was with the source. There were lots of tiny anecdotes to the og-movies, that were easily missed if it weren't for us to point them out after the movie. The characters are all likeable and believable. The protagonist is no Marry Sue, but there is also not a lot of growth, more just problems to avoid and solve, but because she is no demi-god, like Legolas, she fits very nicely and tension is definitely there.

But the same can not be said about her father, the first big negative point in this movie. He starts of strong, good King, leader, makes great decisions and so on. He even wears a helmet, wish his sons would have done the same, would definitely helped one of them. Spoiler:&gt;!But when they reach Gondor, he becomes a bit weird. More or less a demi-god who can take pushes from giant beasts, give punches that kill a man and not freeze to death in the cold winter for days, walking around half naked. It felt a bit like a peasant who would retell the story and did not fit in this very low-fantasy story.!&lt;

Now the biggest negative, the animation. If you know the original animation from 1978, you definitely see some parallels. Why? Because I am very sure it is rotorscoped. The absence of of motion blur is very confusing for the eyes in the first 20 minutes. There is some instances, where it definitely shows. The backgrounds are very close to the original. But they are often also very weak, but I rather have them save on backgrounds, than anywhere else.

Now even tough this sounds very negative in total, I must point out it is still a lovely movie. My friends and me agreed it was enjoyable and a positive experience, be it the one guy who never saw the original movies or the other who literally read the Silmarillion. I am almost certain this movie will get bashed to bits from critics, but I encourage you to watch and make your own picture, because I am pretty sure many of you will enjoy just like we did.

movies,Why is Frank Darabont underappreciated? ,"Frank Darabont is a fantastic filmmaker. 

The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are considered cinematic classics. They are also both crowd pleasers - it's funny, I've yet to meet anyone that has a bad word to say about either film! 

Aside from this, The Mist (also based on a Steven King story) is considered a beloved contemporary horror film. With arguably one of the greatest endings in horror film history. 

He made the wonderful 2001 film The Majestic. An underrated spellbinding Jim Carey drama. 

He was the show runner on The Walking Dead - which saw huge early success, thanks to his efforts - before stepping down prematurely. He was also the show runner on Mob City, an underappreciated (and sadly cancelled) period gangster drama. 

He was the writer on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Tales from the Crypt, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, The Blob remake, and Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. 

He's directed episodes of The Shield and the upcoming final season of Stranger Things. 

But through all this acclaim, and with such a robust and impressive resume, he's not a household name. Even among cinephiles - such as you and I - his name is not lauded as much as I feel it should be. 

I know he's become somewhat disillusioned with Hollywood and has taken a step back. However, this shouldn't stop him from achieving more love, more reverence, more accolades. 

So, I ask you why? Why is Frank Darabont underappreciated? 

In fact...do you even think he is?! Perhaps it's just me. 

But I believe he belongs in a pantheon of under appreciated filmmakers with an infamous body of work. Robert Zemeckis, John Badham, possibly even John Millius.

movies,"Looking for movie recommendations similar to The Bra (2018) — calm, slow, and dialogue-free films with a melodic feel","Hey everyone,

I recently watched *The Bra* (2018), and I absolutely loved its calm and slow-paced storytelling, almost like a visual melody. The movie had no dialogue, yet it managed to say so much through its visuals, pacing, and atmosphere.

I find these kinds of films really captivating—ones that focus on visual storytelling, subtle emotions, and minimalism, without relying on spoken words. They’re almost meditative to watch.

I’m hoping to discover more films in a similar vein. Do you know of any other calm, slow-paced movies—preferably dialogue-free or with very little dialogue—that evoke a similar feeling?

movies,"I have a soft spot for ""Die Hard 2"" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three ""Die Hard"" entries.","There's no way, of course, that ""2"" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by ""Vengeance"" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.

But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.

I'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest ""Die Hard"" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",Mst3Kgf,1hetrq0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,2024-12-15 14:33:34,377,0.88,377,0,280,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hetrq0

movies,Queer (2024) - Help settle a debate,"So my bsf and I just saw Luca's new film, *Queer*. We both enjoyed it but found ourselves getting into a disagreement over a pretty big plot point.

  
To start, I should say that I *literally* just finished reading Burrough's novel a couple of hours before we saw the movie. It was so fresh in my mind that I could quote half of the movie as it was happening. Throughout the book, I was struck by how unreciprocated Lee's love/lust/obsession for Allerton was. Allerton seemed extremely passive in their relationship, never initiating anything sexual or physical. There is a moment where Allerton expresses that he likes the sex sometimes after Lee asks, but this is starkly juxtaposed to all the times when Allerton appears to be disgusted or annoyed with Lee's sexual advances. I honestly feel confident in saying I think Allerton is straight and the only reason he sometimes likes the sex is because of the stimulation. I also definitely think that there is no chance that Allerton loved (or even liked) Lee back.

  
Anyways, I went into the movie with the expectation that their story would be relatively the same. And generally, it was very similar. However, I came away with a very different interpretation of their relationship. This is where my opinion diverges from my friend (who has not read the book).

  
To her, the movie is about Lee being a creep to a straight boy. She looks at the one or two moments where Allerton outright shies or rejects Lee's touch as evidence for this. She thinks that Allerton is ""definitely straight"" and only finds pleasure in sex with Lee because it's sex (very similar to my interpretation of the book). Additionally, she believes that Allerton leaving Lee in the forest is indicative of a lack of passion and care from Allerton's side.

  
I could not have a more different view. I think it is very clear that Allerton not only genuinely enjoys sex with Lee specifically, but also is in love with him. The reciprocation of lust is really obvious in the two in-detail sex scenes we get. During the first scene, Allerton seems happy to kiss Lee back and get a BJ, and when he's finished he instantly starts to get Lee off, something we never see Allerton take the initiative to do in the book. In the second scene, when Lee and Allerton are in the hotel, Lee touches his ribs as a way to start sex. In the book, Allerton shooed Lee away and only conceded to having sex when he was reminded that he 'owed' Lee for the week. In the movie, Allerton seemed very into everything happening and seemed blissed out afterward. I also think, throughout the film, the little smiles, content looks, and casual affection sometimes shown, indicates that he also feels love for Lee. I believe this love is repressed and he does not want to acknowledge it.

movies,Re-watching Edge of tomorrow a decade later,"I’ve been searching and searching and can’t seem to find any answers. 

One question I may have just missed:

Does it ever explain why Cage is railroaded so hard and basically sent to death when he seems to be quite the successful recruiter/PR guy?

And a theoretical question:

Any theories as to why they don’t just hunt more alphas for alpha blood to gain the power again? While Cage still has the power he says to Rita “Go find an alpha, kill it, get blood in your mouth (lol) so you get the powers. If you aren’t back in X amount of hours hours with a successful mission I’ll kill myself and we try again”. Then the one with the most recent save point (I assume if they die they go back in time to when the other would still have the power?) goes on the omega hunting mission until success or until they lose their power. If she loses the power during a mission Cage kills himself and gets Rita the power again by repeating the process.

movies,Coco felt like a time machine for me. ,"I am 24 years old atm. I have not seen an animated Pixar picture in a long time. Now I watched Coco, just to see if they are still my cup of tea. I have to say, it felt like traveling back in time to some degree. 

Because when entering the world of Coco, I felt the wonder of child-me again. I wanted the film to explore every inch of its tale, show me as many parts of its universe as possible and meet more characters to learn about their story.

It was the most innocent but still a very true and sometimes hard hitting story about the meaning of death for both sides, the living and the dead. It's pretty awesome how Pixar managed to get those very dark and adult themes told in a movie mainly aimed at a very young audience. 

Also, the movie looks beautiful. The shadows, the lights and the very strong colours make it a visually pleasing experience. What really caught me off guard was the detail on some characters. The wrinkles on Coco herself are borderline photorealistic. 

All in all, this was a pretty fullfilling watch in my opinion.

movies,Big Brother (2018),"This is one of Donnie Yen films that I recently watched. Don't know much about the Hong Kong actor aside of him starring in Ip man and a character in John Wick, but this was a film that I was highly interested in seeing. He plays as a teacher who was formerly a military 🪖 soldier and used to be a rebellious student and is now teaching a class of troubled teens that were under performing. The stories with these teens had an interesting background. One that lost his parents and living with his grandmother, 2 brothers living with an alcoholic father, a Tomboy girl that wanted her fathers attention, etc. There's even a scene that touches on teen suicide where he went and bought drugs then later jumped off a balcony and landed in a coma which is a sensitive topic and how the father expressing his neglect about his sons, because his wife went off in an affair was very sad too.

Also, the scene where Donnie went and kicked all the MMA fighters butts in a locker room to help rescue his student was an awesome fight scene and the near climatic ending where he fought all those guys invading the school was nice too.

Overall, a decent quality martial arts film.

movies,The Lies (and Deaths) of Christopher Nolan,"I’ve noticed a major plot point in many of Nolan’s movies often revolve around lies and false realities being deployed either selfishly or selflessly. 

Memento is about a serial killer taking advantage of his faded memory and creating a completely false narrative in order to avoid confronting his role in the death of his wife. 

In The Prestige, there is a constant game of lies played between Angier, Borden, Olivia, and Sarah all in the name of one-upmanship and dedication. A film not only about illusions themselves but also the balance of art and relationships, and the obfuscation of the true ugly nature of how these illusions operate and the massive physical and mental toll they take on the performer, such as Angier’s constant suicidal water tank trick, recreating for himself over and over again the same experience that led to the death of his wife.

At the end of The Dark Knight , Gordon and Batman decide to lie to the public about Harvey Dent’s final moments and intentions in order to avoid a scenario where all optimism had disappeared from Gotham. This is mirrored by Alfred choosing to set Rachel’s letter on fire, hoping to avoid an even deeper heart break within Bruce who’s already grieving from her death.

A large plot point in Inception revolves around Cobb making Mal come to terms with the false world they live in, ultimately making her naturally untrustworthy of her surroundings even upon coming back to reality, leading to her (wait for it) death.

Interstellar is in large part about the lies you tell others in order to make them feel safe, such as Coop (dead wife) not being forward with the extent of his mission to his children, Coop not being forward with the extent of his role and fate in the mission over Gargantua to Brand (Hathaway), and Professor Brand (Caine) not being forward with the probability of Plan A ever working. By contrast, the supposedly brave and virtuous Dr. Mann lies about the prospects of his planet in order to save himself at the expense of humanity.

Nolan’s often known for having a fascination with time manipulation and fractured narratives and he also gets a lot of flack for overly theatrical and complicated screenplays but I find his fascination with people’s perceptions and how they either accept fake narratives or create them for others to be what really makes me appreciate him as a writer. Just an unabashed interest in the psychological that I find to be endlessly entertaining.

There was another common plot point that comes up a lot in Nolan’s movies but I can’t remember it now.

movies,Filmmakers who ended up as a PERFECT match to adapt an IP,"When Peter Jackson decided visual effects technology was good enough to produce an adaptation of *Lord of the Rings*, he began lobbying for the film to get made, thinking *some big name experienced director* should, and would, take up the challenge. Thankfully, that never materialized, and Jackson himself, to his own surprise, ended up in the director's chair. As it turns out, his passion and reverence for Tolkien's beloved classic proved to be the guiding light of the films production. It was Jackson who insisted on maintaining the three book story line as three films, while the studio was pushing for two. It was Jackson who made sure every cast and crew member *had a copy of the LOTR near by*, to consult as the ""Bible"" of the production. It would seem the stars had aligned, and that Peter Jackson was the perfect man for the job, spearheading a groundbreaking production, the most ambitious the world had ever known, shooting all three films simultaneously, a game changer for the industry, and delivering a trilogy that both resounded with a broader audience, and pleased hardcore fans of the source material. 

But as perfect a match Jackson had been to direct *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, there was yet another property even closer to Jackson's heart. As a boy, it was *King Kong* that lit the fire inside him and kindled his desire to become a filmmaker. Peter was obsessed with *King Kong*, and even attempted to re-make the film using home-made stop motion puppets and a super 8 camera as a precocious nine year old boy. It must have felt like destiny, some 35 years later, when Universal entrusted Jackson with their iconic property, and he found himself at the helm of a full fledged two-hundred-million dollar remake of the very film that, for him, started it all. Peter Jackson was born to make *King Kong*.

It's a phenomenon that seems to bend the odds, when a movie director all but manifests that one project that fulfills a lifelong dream. Denis Villeneuve had long desired to adapt the unadaptable masterpiece that is Frank Herbert's *Dune*. He wasn't shy about it either. Indeed, after hearing Denis talk about his vision for translating the labyrinthine text into the language of cinema, fellow director Christopher Nolan said that he knew then and there Villeneuve was the right man for the job, even back before he was a serious candidate. Of course, Villeneuve's spectacular results are the proof that Nolan was right. 

Of all the directors I follow, none speak more eloquently and intelligently about film than Guillermo del Toro. His knowledge is immense, his insight is profound, and I'll listen to any interview I can get my hands on. Anyone who shares my sentiments knows that del Toro is singularly fascinated by one film: James Whale's Frankenstein. For del Toro, Frankenstein is a work of unrivaled pathos and beauty. When he speaks about it, he brings a depth of understanding and appreciation to the picture that one could hardly anticipate. I was elated when I heard he would be directing his own version. 

I believe these are significant moments. They give me hope that there's still some synchronicity at work in this world. That there is plenty of opportunity for us each to find our own moment, when we are perfectly suited for the task in a way unique to ourselves. 

What other movies do you think represent such connections? When the director seemed hand picked by the turn of providence to realize the project they'd always known would be the one?

movies,Why don't they (seem to) make movies like Austin Powers anymore?,"This is obviously a subjective claim, but it seems to me like goofy parodies like Austin Powers, the Scary Movie franchise, Shrek, etc. have gone entirely away. I'm just wondering if anyone else feels that way, and why that might be?

Today, I was listening to a Quincy Jones album and my girlfriend walked in and said it sounded like Austin Powers music, and I told her sure as shit it totally was! Then we sat down and watched Goldmember from start to finish and our faces were about numb from laughing. I just really appreciated the crafting that went into the bits and Mike Myers' ability to blend subtle comedic moments with totally over the top scenes. The film was full of cameos (OMG, Beyoncé!), people making fun of themselves and each other-- and above all, it was funny but not at all in a dark way, like some recent films I've really enjoyed ('Don't Look Up' is what comes immediately to mind). 

So, I'm wondering where this type of film is in today's world? I understand there is a certain level of nostalgia involved in writing this post. But I think there's something else there too. My girlfriend and I discussed it, and clearly there are some jokes that probably wouldn't make it today, but I also feel there is plenty to make fun of in today's films/tv that would absolutely hit with audiences. I've seen some satires lately which I found incredibly funny (thinking 'The Curse' [Showtime], or 'White Lotus' [HBO]) but what makes these hilarious is the examination they do on the self conscious behaviors of entitled people, and that can get pretty dark. Every commedy I've seen in the last decade or so has been this way-- good but more cerebral, and certainly calling social mores into question.

Anyway, I guess I just haven't seen a good parody in a while, and I'm wondering why not. If you have a suggestion, please please let me know, I'm dying for some decent stuff right now. SNL is a bit hit and miss for me, but it's about the only thing I can think of that makes fun of modern trends in life/politics/media without getting very heavy.

movies,"Castle in the Sky by Hayao Miyazaki, a great Japanese animation that was inspired by Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. One of my favorite animated films.","https://preview.redd.it/a4c7wxlm647e1.jpg?width=1678&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=967c5786118484fbeeb2e02ff27f82c84978ee9f

Castle in the Sky (天空の城ラピュタ), also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky, is a 1986 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

Laputa is an ancient civilization that once stood so imposing and grand, above all and everyone, but now lies completely deserted and in ruins, surrounded by the environment. Tree roots surround the entire castle, and the human architecture is covered in greenery, with animals and streams running through it. It is as if the natural world is reclaiming what is rightfully its own, and Miyazaki is telling the viewer that the world is not ours, and that humans only have the sense of grandeur that we get because the natural environment allows us to, and that if we are not careful, it may very well pull the rug out from under us and take back what belongs to it.

It was inspired by the book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.

Laputa is a flying island described in the 1726 book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. With an adamantine base, which its inhabitants can manoeuvre in any direction using magnetic levitation. The island is the home of the king of Balnibarbi and his court, and is used by the king to enforce his rule over the lands below.

The film is a strong critic of the use of technology for militarism and the desire for domination. The villain Muska, like Sheeta, is also a descendant of the original inhabitants of Laputa, uses the stone to open a secret gate and assumes power in the flying city. And he desires world control through the power of weapons in Laputa.

The impractical and dangerously authoritative behavior Gulliver details in describing the Laputians is often alluded to throughout Castle in the Sky as the reason for Laputa’s eventual abandonment and ruin. Considering that Miyazaki had read Gulliver’s Travels and often uses his films as a vehicle for political commentary, it would be remiss to dismiss such parallels. Whether intentional or not, Miyazaki effectively adapts warnings regarding absolute sovereignty’s control over scientific innovations to the Cold War era.

Hayao Miyazaki's films, in addition to the beautiful images, are known for criticizing militarism and defending the environment, as happened in the film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which talks about a great war that devastated humanity and the environment.

movies,City of Angels (1998) and correcting a 25 year injustice. ,"This will be kind of  rant but its story time.

When the movie City of Angels came out in 1998 it also had the song Iris by Goo Goo Dolls came out.  This was in the era of MTV still airing music videos and 10 year old me really liked the one for Iris. 

I figured out that it was on the soundtrack for this movie so I tried to rent it at the local movie store, Blockbuster had not yet made it to my town and this was a small mom and pop shop run by a family. 

When they saw the 10 year old boy me trying to rent City of Angels, the guy decided that I would not like this movie and I should rent something else instead.  At the counter he swapped it out for some C tier action flick i dont remember and my mom didn't really seem to care about this. 

So I never got to see it. Years passed and I forgot the title, but occasionally I'd hear that song Iris and remember that there was a movie out there somewhere that I was denied. 

It haunted me. 

25 years later. My fiancee and I are talking about songs we want to play at our wedding.  He turns on the song Iris. This set me on the quest. I could not get past this unforgivable betrayal of a movie I never got to see. 

Finally. I got it. And we are now about to correct a 25 year wrong.

movies,The handmaiden (2016) needed a third plotwist.,"Watched the movie today. Visually beautiful. The plot is another retelling of the simple story of ‘people in cahoots working together and acting as strangers to fulfill a certain goal.’

The first plotwist was really nice. You don’t see it coming because the first third of the movie is told from the pov of the victim (initially), who is oblivious to the scheme and presented in the bad person light. 

The brief giggle at the asylum door was a very nice misleading touch. It was in my opinion the very scene that made the second plot twist work.

With the way things ended, the movie is nice. A solid 8. But a third plot twist would’ve made things better.

In a hypothetical third act, the count is revealed to be the definitive puppeteer. À la Aizen Sosuke. All along, he is aware of the girls’ intentions to double cross him a certain point. And ends up putting them both in the asylum.

I know it wouldn’t have made sense considering the overreaching theme. The movie is set in patriarchal Korea and Japan, with every male character being a crook, a pervert or both. It’s about women triumphing in a world dominated by men. Women doing without men.

The second bit of world building was in the climax of the movie where &gt;!the King's secret note in the acorn Christmas ornament changed the law to allow non-blood relations to still be in the royal line of succession!&lt;. Aldovia has a Prime Minister, which suggests it is a constitutional monarchy, but this plot makes it seem like the king is the head of both the executive AND legislative branches of government. The head of this nation had extraordinary, unchecked power - perhaps the result of the hinted-at civil war?

The last question is about the posh accents of the entire royal family. All of the official royal decrees and ceremonies are held in English. There's no sign of a native Aldovian language. Is Aldovia a colony of the British Empire? What happened to the Native Aldovians and their language? Could this perhaps be the seed of the conflict that led to the former king becoming a war hero, and the leagues of orphans in the care of the state?

I am yet to watch the second and third movies, hopefully they expand on the world building in A Christmas Prince, if not I'd love to hear peoples thoughts about the history of the Aldovan nation state.",batikfins,1hewlkj,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewlkj/a_christmas_prince_2017/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewlkj/a_christmas_prince_2017/,2024-12-15 16:47:52,14,0.71,14,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1hewlkj

movies,Swiss Family Robinson (1960) - A great adventure and is similar to the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams and Robinson Crusoe.,"Swiss Family Robinson is a 1960 adventure film starring John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran in a tale of a shipwrecked family building an island home. It was the second feature film based on the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss.

The film is not a classic, it is a more naive and fun adventure. It's as if Robinson Crusoe got lost with his family on an island.

The book The Swiss Family Robinson (Der Schweizerische Robinson) is a novel by the Swiss author Johann David Wyss which was inspired by the book Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and inspired the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams

The basic story is a husband and wife want to get away from the rat race and are traveling by ship from their home in Switzerland to New Guinea to start a new life. But before they arrive they are caught in a bad storm and are shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. The captain and crew must have seen it coming and deserted early, leaving the family, with three sons, to fend for themselves.

They do the best they can to salvage useful items and supplies from the wrecked ship and set about building their new home. It ends up being a quite elaborate 3-cottage cluster in a very large tree with nicely spread limbs.

The family finds a number of animals, a Tiger, a small elephant, and several others that lead them to think it might be a land bridge, so they build a small boat and set sail to try to go around the island. Another shipwreck and an encounter with a band of pirates results in their rescuing a teenage girl as her grandpa is captured.

In the end the pirates return, the Family Robinson work hard with improvised defenses to hold off the pirates and, when it seems the pirates will prevail a ship arrives and starts shooting at the pirates and their ship to save the day.

When it was all over the parents decided they wanted to stay in this ""New Switzerland"" with the prospects of additional settlers.",cleopatraandcaesar63,1hf45fa,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf45fa/swiss_family_robinson_1960_a_great_adventure_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf45fa/swiss_family_robinson_1960_a_great_adventure_and/,2024-12-15 22:27:04,4,0.59,4,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hf45fa

The first movie is good, but it is pretty boring I can’t lie. It doesn’t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight.

From there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn’t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I’m glad they gave Rocky’s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.

I don't know where to ask such a specific question, and whether it's more suited for a film subreddit or a historical subreddit, but I'll try anyway.

From the first minute of the movie, one shot has this breast star that Patton is wearing.

What makes this peculiar is that this is a royal Bavarian order that stopped being awarded after the end of WW1. It is not in the list of awards Patton received nor is Patton in the list of recipients of this award anywhere. Did the film make a mistake here and just put any old decoration?

William Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.

https://preview.redd.it/9eglkeoplq6e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb95dfb6da04b33733c5019ea3b5560fbd7cafb



But much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the  sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207

Characters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.

It is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.

And it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it.

movies,With AI restorations on the rise in recent years I am becoming worried about the future of movie preservation.,"I will preface this post with something positive before I discuss my concerns. The truth is that as long as there are fans of art there will be people who will properly preserve it. If you want a movie in a particular form/ cut, with the original theatrical audio mix, with every special feature ever released for that movie, and in the best/ least compressed presentation possible then there are many places online where you can access it. This post isn't referring to crazy people like me that will seek out that material. This post is aimed at people that I refer to as “casuals” or the people that aren't as crazy as me about this sort of stuff. The people that just want to watch a movie with the click of a button rather than buying a physical disc or searching for an obscure torrent. 



I want to start my concerns about this phenomenon by stating that I am not a gloomy type of person. I see some of the benefits of AI technology when it comes to movie restorations, but my perspective changed after December 12th, 2024. That day I went with a friend to see a one night only screening of Interstella 5555 (2003). That presentation of the movie is the worst my friend and I have ever seen, which is saying something because that movie is cursed with sub par home media releases. The version that my friend and I saw that day was AI upscaled. It ruined all of the details in the image. Every shot in the movie looked like someone rubbed Vaseline on random parts of the screen. It was pretty much unwatchable. (Here are some examples of what my friend and I saw that night: [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1gfqxge/interstella_ai_remaster/), [Example #2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b_sL6bSRhWw), [Example #3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pX_Ss4BrepE)).



I knew this sort of stuff had happened before like with the recent Blu-ray release of [I Love Lucy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdhJMOTPVw) and the [4Ks that James Cameron has released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxOqWYytypg&amp;pp=ygUXamFtZXMgY2FtZXJvbiA0ayBpc3N1ZXM%3D), however the difference with those is that most of them (except The Abyss) have some other decent release while Interstella 5555 is stuck with a sub par DVD and Blu-ray releases.



Then there is the issue of movies staying in circulation. If this version of Interstella 5555 is the only one available on streaming or a new Blu-ray release then what will “casuals” who have never watched this movie think. Will they think that the movie shouldn't look like that or will they think that the movie is supposed to look like a Vaseline smeared mess?



AI is a very helpful technology for movie restoration but it has become very obvious to me that studios are not using this technology properly and are getting extremely lazy with it. I will put it to you this way, you use a hammer to strike nails and you use a wrench to screw bolts. You can use a wrench to strike nails and you can use a hammer to screw bolts but the tools will do those tasks horribly if used in this manner. Use the right tool for the job and everything will be fine. After that night, I realized that these studios aren't doing that for whatever reason and that it is up to us to keep the art that we love alive.

movies,Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?,"Question, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

I must admit, I've been going on a binge on Warren Beatty films recently and I still can't believe he has done only 23 films. and having done a post before, he has turned down a lot of roles and had some unrealized projects. Looking at his filmography, he was productive from 1961-1975, but after that he became more inconsistent with his projects, pretty much taking years before he does one.

From what I read, Beatty was a bit of a perfectionist and to the detriment of the crew, who takes his time and was go multitude of takes.

I will say, I think Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Reds, &amp; Bulworth are masterpieces, and Dick Tracy is fun. However, he is also notable for some real stinkers, Ishtar is middling but it really tanked his image. Town &amp; Country is bad and it pretty much put him into exile and Rules Don't Apply, his comeback, reaffirmed that exile.

Overall, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

I didn’t have one of the cases of people singing thankfully, but even that would have been better. I go to the movies once or twice a month, and surely enough every time there’s people who can’t shut their mouths. A comment or two is fine, I’ll lean over to my friend and whisper if I need to, but having entire conversations is absurd. Sometimes people in the back will legitimately have conversations at full volume! I like sitting in the back because it gives me a headache to be super close to the screen, so I guess it’s on me a bit when people around me talk. With that said, I go to a lot of relatively small theatre rooms and I bet anyone could hear it with the volume they’re at. I hate feeling like the asshole when it comes to telling people to be quiet, but sometimes it just comes to that. Today I had to (politely) shush someone and she kind of just scoffed and laughed it off. Later when I left she gave me and the person I was with a totally nasty expression. Like, I’m sorry but how am I the asshole here. I can’t remember if it was always like this, but I feel like it’s gotten worse since streaming had gotten popular and people are used to watching in their homes.

movies,What were the themes of Heretic (2024)?,"I watched the horror movie Heretic last night and I can't say I enjoyed it but I was indeed properly horrified and it's a solid 8/10. 

  
What are the themes? At first, you would think that the script was inspired by a bad date with the annoying kind of atheist who also wouldn't let her leave the apartment. Take that kind of uncomfortable, creepy, scary experience and keep amplifying it until it turns into horror. 

  
Then there's the fact that both actresses were raised Mormon and have apparently distanced themselves from it. I read a few comments from ex-Mormons who said that the movie really resonated with them. And Mr. Reed, as horrible and dishonest as he is, does raise some points about Mormonism which are both true and troubling. I can see how a woman raised in a very conservative religious family would look at the men of her family and be reminded of Mr. Reed. In other words, I think the movie may aim to subtly subvert adherence to high demand, high control religions such as Mormonism. 

  
I'm curious about Mr. Reed's motivations, planning and methods. Why and how does he go about running this house of horror? 

  
I note that Mr. Reed lets slip the occasional weird comment like when he says ""blueberry pie"" instead of ""Lou Gehrig's disease"" in a way that might be seen as mocking her father's death but then he pulls back. What was happening there?

movies,2024 movies most likely to still be memorable 20 years from now?,"I have always found it very difficult to answer the ""what is your best movie of the year?"" question. I'm not even sure what ""best"" means, it's so genre-specific, etc.

Instead, I prefer to ask myself: among the movies released this year, which one am I most likely to remember 20 years from now? Which ones will be the most memorable? Which one is most likely to make a lasting impression on me?

In my case, #1 this year is very clearly Dune Pt2 (but who knows, maybe in 20 years I'll disagree!). After that it's harder, probably Challengers, maybe Furiosa and Conclave (there are quite a few I have not watched yeet).

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 5 - Finale,"Hello there,

since more than 50 days, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day (more or less, depending on which time zone you are in) and while this is not This is not quite the end (one country is still missing after this), but I can already draw a first conclusion and have to say: we had our crazy days too. There were days when I could hardly save myself from film suggestions, double nominations and debates about whether a film complied with the rules or not. And there were days when I was mentally on the verge of dropping out because it seemed impossible to find even one film. (Both times I would like to thank the respective participants).

Towards the end, things got particularly strange again in terms of participation: after I was almost criticised for counting the UK as a country and not wanting to have any geographical duplications, the participation rate in the England-thread was still very high and then really dropped. Some people even seemed to be angry that I dared to name Northern Ireland individually - that lead into a shower of downvotes. But I don't want to complain: We have found four candidates for your favorite movie set in the **United Kingdom**.

And this is how it is played: Below you will find four comments from me - these are the respective winners from the individual rounds. The winner is the film mentioned in the comment with the most upvotes (minus downvotes). You may comment on my comments, ***but please refrain from suggesting new films***. The only exception I will accept for this: If there is a UK film that could not be attributed to England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, this is an opportunity to put it in the race.

I'm very excited, how this will work out - thanks a lot in advance!

P.S.: Since I'm not able to proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like,",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hewsks,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewsks/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewsks/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-15 16:56:27,0,0.41,0,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hewsks

movies,What Horror Movie Sub-Genres you’re not a Fan of and Why?,"Horror Movie Sub-Genres I’m not a Fan of and Why are:

Found Footage - Because of the shaky camera and a completely saturated market.

Just way too many low-effort movies in this genre. Similar plots, shaky cameras that doesn't really add anything (except in good ones), and such. The (sub)genre is just filled with too much of garbage, while it's still possible to find a gem

Body Horror 

Demon Possession - Because it’s the exact same movie. And I think a lot of them forget what's actually scary about the idea of demonic possession, which is the thought of not being able to control your own body and the threat of damnation, not just weird contortions and little girls shouting blasphemy with the voice of several grown men.

It's just getting overdone now with little to no innovation in the subgenre. Every single one pretty much feels the same and has a very similar story to tell. 

It always feels predictable, and the religious allusions made in the film are just annoying. It's one of the few horror sub-genres that I can't take seriously.

Initial encounter. Slow build up of strange behavior. Eventual blow up. Speaking in tongues and obscene language unusual for that person. Gets tied down in exorcism. Holy water. Screaming, writhing and contorting. Faith breaks through at the last minute and they're saved! Rinse, repeat. The possessed person always acts the same and the arc of the struggle always feels the same.

Home Invasion - Because a character usually has to do something beyond stupid to let the home invasion happen or they have the upper hand over the invader and don't kill them off until it's too late.",Amber_Flowers_133,1heuh6m,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,2024-12-15 15:09:25,0,0.41,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heuh6m
movies,The Polar Express - Who is the intended audience?,"I don't think it's made for kids. The dark tone of it and weirdness of certain things seems intentional and is prominent enough that there's no way it could be made for kids. But I also don't think it's made for adults either. There is enough kids stuff in it to make that obvious. I feel like it's more of an art project that doesn't really have a specific intended audience. A movie that tries to capture both the joy and wonder of a kid at Christmastime, as well as the sadness that comes with being an adult longing for that time. 

Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is decent and definitely a holiday classic. And I know there's a whole range of analysis about the story, the characters, the aesthetics, and what it all means. But it kind of seems to occupy its own place among Christmas movies. It has that feel good quality of a deep meaningful Christmas movie. There are some cheerful moments. But it also has this dark melancholic unsettling tone throughout it that you can't ignore. And there are definitely some weird aspects to some of the characters and things that happen. 

I don't think many adults sit down during the holidays to watch this movie. Nor do I imagine anyone putting this movie on for their kid to watch either.

It's usually the fantasy world comes to Earth, or humans from Earth travel to the fantasy world.

Do you think they do it so the ""average"" cinema goer can enjoy it more, or connect to it?

How do you feel about it? As a fan, and sometimes non-fan.

Whether I like the franchise (Super Mario Bros.) or not (Minecraft), every time I see it, it makes me roll my eyes, and makes me think like it's a lazy way to approach the story.

There are some successful (box office) movies that don't do this, like Detective Pikachu, Dungeons and Dragons, Warcraft, Lord of the Rings, Resident Evil, that don't do this and people still go and watch them.

movies,logistics in get out ,"to start out this is not a complaint post or me trying to get some super clear logic from a fictional movie. there's no way of knowing the answer to my question but I'm curious about others thoughts 

what do folks think that the people who stole black peoples bodies in get out generally did after they had their new body? do we think the community/cult who was in on this had rules on what you did afterwards? clearly they would have to be pronounced as dead otherwise they'd be missing and being white (and wealthy) there would have actually been serious efforts made to find them.

then there's the fact that they'd be seen as black by those who were outwith the group and would therefore have people treat them differently. my theory was that they saw this as an opportunity to sort of retire from society sort of how rose's grandparents were living with their family and posing as staff in the house when others were visiting. I know some people will think it illogical that they'd want to be in black bodies due to the racism in society but personally I think the types of people that were doing this probably held a respectability politics sort of mindset where they'd assume that because they'd act 'proper' they would be fine.

Most of them seem divided between whether one should tip at a restaurant or not, if yes then how much, and then if the minimum is also increasing every year seemingly. 

I resonate with some of the points Mr. Pink said, like when he said he'd like to do something about it eg if there's a paper to sign or party to vote, but he seemed generally in disagreement with the society who decided who he should tip or not. 

PS. No hate or disrespect to anyone making a living off those tips, but just want to initiate a genuine conversation.

movies,Which One do you prefer?  📡 Or 💿,"I have been thinking that DVDs are becoming not needed since we Gotten the stream services/ Roku, Hulu, Amazon prime, Netflix,etc.

But DVDs are Much cooler in my opinion because of the way they Create their own menus and they add more secrets about the movie and everything. While. Stream services don't include these.

Also DVDs are for their better quality

But Streams are to get the movies you want (which they still come at a price.)

  
So My only question for you all is, Which one do you prefer? (I still watch things on stream, but if I want to Keep it on for a while, then I Use a DVD)

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 4 - Wales,"Hello there,

this is the fourth (or third, depends on what status you grant Northern Ireland) time I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a country in the country called UK. After England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's now **Wales**' turn before the grand finale. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1he6u1d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he6u1d/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he6u1d/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-14 16:43:32,5,0.61,5,0,30,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he6u1d
movies,Get out,"I’m rewatching get out. Jesus. I know we’ve decided already that this movie set the bar too high, which is part of the reason some people feel Jordan’s subsequent movies don’t hold up. But rewatching it only for the second time makes me cold. 
The story presented touches on a topic in racism that always bothered me. The coveting and use of the strengths and abilities black people possess while simultaneously looking at them at no more human than those we aren’t. It’s trippy as fuck to think that they’d believe their mindset in the body of what they believe to be superior genetically would make a better person. It literally speaks to the inability to see the value in our consciousness and that disturbssss me. Roses grandfather losing to Jessie Owens. People at the auction describing how they used to be. The abilities they used to have and comparing them to his. Ugh. 
Roses obsessive need to be on Chris’s side whenever he felt uncomfortable by the weird shit was triggering. Using it as a method to hide his identity and lure him into that false sense of security that he never even really felt was crazy. I never felt more anxious than watching her bring him back into the house once the auction was over. 
And let’s talk about that fucking auction. I think what bothers me most is how sealed Chris fate is at that point . What appears like ignorance to Chris is really also lack of need to hide their true intentions. The way rose brings him around the event to introduce him to everyone , most auctions people move through. Seeing Chris being dragged from group to group, touched and questioned was disturbing to say the least . 
When Chris is having the procedure explained to him I could cry. The sunken place in its entirety is the opposite of what I fear in death. Which is the lack of consciousness. I can’t imagine playing back seat in your own body. I’m not sure how comparative to a vegetative state it is but the trauma in being moved and speaking without your own permission had to be greater than one can imagine. Seeing the color return to the eyes of Andre supports this. While I wish he managed more words lmao it took the rewatch for me to realize he has been essentially raped and used all 
with his knowledge and had no ability to stop it. 
  Rose having a real bedroom with the photos of the people she kidnapped was a choice. I can’t decide  if I appreciated the change in her character upon the reveal but I can say it was entertaining ? The conversation between she and rod and the fact that she had been Chris’s biggest ally during this ordeal. How she went from I love you to smiling during what was supposed to be her death. 
 One thing that always confused me was grandpas  ability to rationalize coming out of the sunken place quick enough to shoot rose and know there’s no way to prevent going back and kill himself. Also rose’s stupidity in not realizing the flash would take grandpa out the sunken place as it had done to Logan hours before. Handing over her gun was .. a choice 😭. Overall I really loved the movie. It was as entertaining as heartbreaking and moving &amp; thought provoking. I choose to believe since the other ending wasn’t the Final Cut it just doesn’t exist.

movies,Brian De Palma's Legacy,"Brian De Palma has directed some of the most iconic films such as Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables, and the first Mission Impossible. And yet he does not seem to be as talked about compared to the other New Hollywood filmmakers(Coppola and Scorsese for instance). He took advantage of the technical aspects of filmmaking such as using split screens and tracking shots in his films. However, from what I have read and seen, he seems to be a rather divisive figure in Hollywood. In addition to the surprising amount of Razzies he's been nominated for, many see him as style over substance and a major Hitchcock ripoff in many of his flicks. Others take issue to the gratuitous sex and violence as well.

movies,Educating Rita is the most beautiful film about self-determination and friendship,"So Educating Rita (1983) sees Blood Brothers author Willy Russel's updated take on the classic George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. He really subverts the narrative into something special and important. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are just phenomenal and arguably at their very best, as the middle class professor and his working class student, who also works as a hairdresser, in the 1980s. He is teaching her how to pass a literary course, with the narrative building up towards that final exam.

The three key themes I identified were self-determination, friendship, and social class dynamics. 

Now, Pygmalion is the classic tale of a working-class woman being educated and transformed into a member of upper class society by a wise professor.

The ending is quite dark, and it makes a point of how Eliza Doolittle feels she has lost her identity and it's exceedingly bleak. This was famously changed into a happy ending for the wonderful and far more famous musical My Fair Lady. Both have their charms , but I'll take the politically charged Pygmalion any day.

Now, what I love about Pygmalion is Russel kind of flips the roles on a psychological level. Caine's professor character Frank is far more vulnerable than hard-nosed Rita. He struggles with alcohol addiction and Rita's transformation kind of breaks him. He can't stand losing her, what she was (his pet project), as he's so unhappy in his life, otherwise.

Throughout the movie we see Rita taking more control over her life and doing what she wants instead of what society expects of her. She ditches the oppresive husband who wants a baby and breaks out of her shell to become a popular and highly regarded student at the university. She smashes the exam and gets a distinction. 

In an absolute Tour de Force of a monologue, Rita explains why she decided to carry on down that path. She explains that she had 'a choice' and made it, after considering it. She then talks about all the potential she has now the exam is over and how she can choose to do pretty much anything she likes and doesn't feel held back like before. A complete 180 from the Rita we saw at the start.

In both characters, Russel is exploring the idea of self-determination. Frank makes every wrong decision and falls apart as the film progresses. And Rita seems to make every right one.

Through this journey, we also explore their friendship amid the backdrop of the middle and working class dynamics in 1980s Liverpool (you couldn't pick a better time or setting to explore this). 

Throughout the movie, you get a whiff of palpable romance but I think that's just because Walters and Caine's chemistry is just so good. At the very end, the characters look like they may kiss as they're about to embrace to say goodbye, but no, thankfully they give eachother a nice big hug.

Frank takes a bold new step and transforms his life by jetting off to Australia. 

Then, in the final shot, Rita is walking off down the corridor. In an earlier scene, Frank implored Rita to come with him. Rita turns and looks back, you can tell she's thinking about going. But then she decides to carry on striding forward to make her own way in life.

movies,Rewatched Mad Max: Fury Road. I don’t get the hype,"I watched *Mad Max: Fury Road* about a month ago. I thought it was really cool and a good movie overall. Soon after, I checked its critic scores and was blown away by how high they were. I read up on people's opinions about it and it was just non-stop praise. Like yeah, It was good, but THAT good?! I went back and watched it again. 

I still don't get it.

OK before this gets downvoted into oblivion, I DO get why people like this movie; I like it too!! The pacing and choreography is insane, clever and subtle feminist themes, and everything done practically made for a great and more engaging viewing experience.

BUT

Is it really THAT good? I mean character development is kind of non-existent and I never really felt connected to any character or cared about what happened to them (I also never watched a Mad Max movie before, but I feel my criticism is valid), it lacked substance, and it was so abundant with and reliant on action that it never felt like the stakes were high, and scenes without action felt empty and stilted.

I understand that the movie puts less emphasis on certain aspects because it knows what it wants to be; I actually think that this kind of self-awareness in a film is rare and extremely important in putting a good project together. However, when people say that this is THE BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER MADE, I have to be harsh!

I don’t really want to argue (ok maybe a little), I want to hear from you guys on why this movie gets the praise it does and where I might be missing it.

TLDR: Everyone say movie is best movie. Me no see how movie is better than good movie.

movies,"Depictions that were considered historically or scientifically accurate at the time, but not anymore due to later discoveries","Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.

For example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the Titanic sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the James Cameron movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.

The public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of Jurassic Park . The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.

movies,Smile 2 (2024) My expectations where tripled what I expected! What did you think of the film?  ,"WARNING! Naturally, spoilers. If you haven't seen the film, do not proceed. 



&gt;!Ever since the first film, I jumped on reddit almost as fast as did with the sequel now, giving it heavy praise. I was shocked a good portion thought it was kind of laughable. The scares are important sure, but what Smile 2 provides is just unsettling anxiety. Thankfully the ammount of jump scares were JUST enough but not too much, which I admit the first film might of had just a little too much of. For example, when Skye (Naomi Scott) looked in her closet there was a dozen of people she knew smiling at her. I thought ""ok any moment they will rush and the movie goes on"" They rushed alright. But they just got closer. The scene which was less than a minute felt like a eternity. I was so uncomfortable (in a good movie way) I was just thinking common man what what WHATS gonna happen"". Then they get even closer but stacked on top each other. Honestly that made me smile in real life and giggle for a slight moment. The acting in this movie is superb. Naomi Scott was brilliant. I couldn't help thinking how hard it must of been to act it all out, but she brilliantly executed her performance. She made it feel so realistic. There was two jaw dropping (and i mean literally) moments in the film where i stood still silent in awe. The very beginning when Joel got hit by the car in the beginning. But better yet, the f&amp;$%ing ending! The moment I realized reality set in realizing 7,000+ people are about to all get the curse, DUDE I just instantly imagined a sequel for a world apocalypses movie lol. !&lt;

&gt;!Honestly, idk why but I loved both films. I never get excited for a sequel as much as I did this. As a matter of fact, I'm going to create a SCP dedicated to this ""demon"" or ""curse"". If you don't know what SCP is, you'll just have to look it up. I'm more curious what you guys thought of the movie. Happy, disappointed doesn't matter.

movies,I honestly like the other Terminator films after T2 because the likeness of Judgement Day but in different formats is a part of the Terminator franchise.,"I am thinking that I am one of the few people here who acknowledges this but I feel that every Terminator film, even after the ones of T2, bring something new to the concept of Judgement Day.

Sure, every single one brings the same concept of T2 over and over again (Dark Fate does not have John but it is still the same concept with the new character) but I think that this is intentional.

Since the very beginning with T1, there has been the concept about the debate between free will and determinism where the Kyle Reese goes back in time to save Sarah but he impregnates her with John and the result is the photo that she gets in the future. 

Because of this, Judgement Day still happens but it was delayed.

The same goes for T2 with the concept of 'No Fate' which apparently shows the dilemma between free will and the determined future where the characters still are able to prevent Judgement Day but it is delayed until a new Terminator comes.

This eerily reminds of the game Bioschock Infinite which shows the concept of Infinite universes and the idea behind constants and variables which basically says that even though the timing of the event did not come, it will still come in different forms and it is still a constant - hence, the determined need to bring  Judgement Day.

So in a way, T3 is still the same like the previous films except Judgement Day still happened meaning that not even John could escape his fate.

In Genysis, I liked the idea of trying to blend a little bit of the butterfly effect where even though Judgement Day was prevented, Skynet took a new format and I liked the parallel where we have become so dependent on technology that we have become slaves to it.

So that concept of technology being a literal threat and a literal idea that is possible was a good concept.

Same goes for Dark Fate.
Sure, the writing could have been handled better instead of just killing John at the very beginning

But I think I understood the idea behind Legion because it is still Skynet but with a different name.

From my perspective, it was just another manner of the butterfly effect. Skynet still exists and will exist in the future but somehow, the butterfly effect makes it have a different name but the intention is still determined.

The only thing that I really did not like it how the Terminator that killed John somehow developed empathy towards humanity without the proper programming and has basically maintained a relationship for years without his family never questioning his literal existence.

I just do not understand when people criticise when they expect something different than T2 because from my understanding, T2 is bound to happen over and over again in different formats.

Or the fact that people want something different because the other films are indeed different but are still the same story with different details and chapters but still telling the same story overall.",sammyjamez,1heq335,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,2024-12-15 10:42:00,0,0.3,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heq335

Meanwhile I can go to the theater and even do a double feature with full attention, I’m respecting the presentation and effort of a big screen release. It has more impact. Don’t get me wrong my home theater still has a punch but Netflix quality is still below par.

Netflix is basically the old “straight to dvd“ but now it’s straight to streaming, which I guess makes sense given the climate of entertainment these days…. But most of the memorable movies for me have premiered in theaters or get a justified release…

movies,Actors you may not have realised were British,"I want to mention five British actors that I didn't know (at least, not consciously) were British when I first saw them onscreen. Please add your own!

1. Hugh Laurie

Not everyone grew up watching British film and television and saw Hugh Laurie in his earlier roles—and even then, depending on your generation, you may not have recognised him when he became popular in American media (I didn't, at least). If your first exposure was his role as Stuart Little's dad in the movie of the same name; or as House, MD in the popular hospital drama; you might be forgiven for thinking he was an American actor.

2. Gary Oldman

A man of many faces (and voices), Gary Oldman has been in so many blockbuster movies—and is often touted as an example of characters who looked familiar but you just couldn't quite put your finger on who was playing the part... From Zorg in The Fifth Element to Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman trilogy, it may have come as a shock to some people to see (and hear) him as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter franchise.

3. Gillian Anderson

I'm a huge X-files fan. In fact, for the last year or two I have been doing a\[nother\] rewatch! Growing up, I had no idea that Gillian Anderson was a British actor. She played the part of Dana Scully so well (in my opinion), I am sure many were hoodwinked into thinking she was another fantastic American television actor.

4. Henry Cavill

Before he played Geralt of Rivia, Henry Cavill showed up in all sorts of places; but his notable role was Clark Kent / Kal-El in the mid 2010s movie, Man of Steel. At the time, I had no idea he was British. Henry's a real nerd (self-proclaimed, like many of us), and I look forward to his upcoming involvement in Warhammer 40K. :)

5. Tom Holland

This man. He's becoming quite legendary. If you haven't seen The Crowded Room, I highly recommend that you check it out. Bursting onto the screen\* as Peter Parker in Captain America: Civil War (and then of course the Spiderman movies which followed), I would hazard a guess that many fans were oblivious to the fact that Tom's a Brit. He nailed the part of Nathan Drake in 2022's Uncharted.

\* Before anyone comments that ""bursting onto the screen"" implies an actor's debut, I am aware that Tom Holland played roles prior to Peter Parker. But it wasn't until then that by all accounts his popularity began taking hold. There's no arguing it was pretty bursty, right?

Bonus: Kaya Scodelario

I sat down recently and started watching Guy Ritchie's Netflix show, The Gentlemen. If you haven't seen it, stop reading Reddit and go fire it up. It borders on hilarious, with all the Guy Ritchie grit and wit you would expect. Anyway, there is a ""businesswoman"" called Susie Glass (rhymes with arse, not ass). It took me a minute to figure out where I'd seen her before—except she didn't have a British accent.

movies,Top 5 superhero movies ,"

1. The dark knight Christian bale and heath ledger that’s all I got to say heath ledgers joker is the best villain in a movie I’ve ever seen hands down Christian bale also the best bat man won’t see anything like this anytime soon for sure 

2. Avengers infinity war/ end game tie too hard to pick this one end game is just an incredible rollercoaster with the craziest plots and to see all those characters with eachother is just genius. 

3. Spider man 2. Spider man 1 was great but I just feel like this is just the best spider man there is Tom Holland is great but you just can’t beat tobey maguire it takes every thing from spider man 1 and just improves it 

4. Iron man now this really exceeded my expectations it’s very realistic emotional and action packed and funny and you don’t see that combo in most super hero films.

5.  Spider man across the spider verse

movies,Kubo and the Two Strings is an unbelievable achievement in filmmaking ,"Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika – the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can’t believe this movie is real. I’m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.

Stop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of “Chicken Run” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit” (which I love, btw) – we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that’s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo’s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)

Also stop motion characters are usually dressed in tight clothes and have steady hairdos to make them easier to animate – but in Kubo, they’re using kimonos and have long hair; plus, there are animal characters and one of them is a MONKEY with fur. That means the animators had to move the kimonos and each hair strand (or the fur, in the monkey’s case) individually for every frame. And they placed that monkey in the middle of a snowstorm!!! They had to manipulate every single piece of that fur 24 times to end up with a second of footage.

Kubo is a very touching and beautiful film too, and I recommend it for its storytelling appeal as well. But I’m mostly here to praise the achievement by itself. Seriously, I couldn’t believe my eyes.",miggovortensens,1hd4puo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,2024-12-13 04:49:39,737,0.93,737,0,64,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hd4puo

For those who don't remember, here's the main cast of the film listed in order according to Wikipedia:

* Matthew McConaughey (Academy Award winner)
* Anne Hathaway (Academy Award winner)
* Jessica Chastain (Academy Award winner)
* John Lithgow (No Oscar but 6 Emmys, 2 Golden Globes, a BAFTA and 4 Grammys)
* Michael Caine (2 Academy Awards)
* Casey Affleck (Academy Award winner)
* Timothee Chalamet (Academy Award nominee, almost certainly will win one soon)

Matt Damon (Academy Award winner) also has a small part in the film.

movies,Anyone else suspect that Elf One was reviewed so poorly because critics are kinda tired of The Rock?,"This is a total hot take, and I'll admit that I'm pretty much done with Dwayne Johnson's recurring vanity character (a larger-than-life pile of muscle and ego), but what got me thinking about this is the disparity on Rotten between the critics (roughly 35%) and the audience (about 95%).

So I'm wondering if the critics may have been a little more kind had another actor played his part, and if the general movie going audience also thinks this a possibility. Even if youre a fan, you gotta admitt . . . he's pretty much taken over the 'family-friendly tough guy' role.

And I understand why, I was even into it at first, but now I'm just kinda bored.

But I just adore the movies where a person is mistaken for someone else and is taken into a new group of people and then makes strong relationships and changes things for the better.

* While You Were Sleeping

Or similarly when a person comes into a new place and has this super talent for something and it slowly comes out.  Sometimes I think of Babette from Babette's Feast as basically the John Wick of cooking.

one of my favorite parts of the movie is when the train arrives at the north pole. they made the very smart decision to have the polar express theme play at that part. it's a really good song with great lyrics and a fast pace that mirrors the fast pace of the titular train.

when you listen to the soundtrack on a CD or a vinyl or on Spotify or however you listen to it, the version of the song on the soundtrack is different. in the soundtrack version, they have tom hanks as the conductor randomly interjecting. and to me, this ruins the song.

for starters, as talented as he is, tom hanks cannot sing. or maybe he can. i don't really know because he isn't so much singing as he is sing talking. also, like i said, he randomly interjects and i feel that it ruins things.

So when I see Gandalf ride off to research the ring to see if it is THE one ring and come back to confront Frodo about it I didn't think much of it, Gandalf left for a day maybe two right? NOPE! He was gone for 16 years Frodo doesn't look any older and very easily could have had an entire life with a wife and kids by the time Gandalf came back.  The editing of this sequence as well as my lack of understanding of the story from the books meant that this fact about the plot of the movie blew me away and changed a lot of the context of that part of the movie for me. 

Another one is Once upon a time in Hollywood.  The plot is chugging along, then right at the end of act 2 a narrator comes in and says how several months have passed, Leo's character has left to film spaghetti westerns got a girlfriend etc. It just felt so sudden and kinda unnecessary

movies,Are We Supposed to Believe the Actor Is the Character?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about acting and how we experience it as an audience. When I watch a movie, am I supposed to believe the person playing the part is the character they’re portraying? Or is it enough to just see the actor doing their job—sometimes really well—but never fully disappearing into the role?

Take Timothée Chalamet, for example. I haven’t seen his Bob Dylan portayal yet, but when I do, am I supposed to feel like I’m watching Bob Dylan? Or will it just be Timothée doing a solid impression of Dylan? Similarly, with Adam Driver, I really like the guy and his work, but I’m always aware it’s Adam Driver. Whether he’s yelling about the Rebellion in Star Wars or breaking down in Marriage Story, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s him delivering a great performance, not me being fully immersed in the world of the character. DDL became Daniel Plainview for example. I know I know DDL is like fucking insane but shit, he raises the bar. 

Shouldn’t great acting make me forget the actor entirely? Shouldn’t I feel transported—like I’m in a dark IMAX theater, alone, completely immersed in the story and the character? Or is that asking too much? Maybe it’s enough to just appreciate the craft, even if I never fully lose sight of the actor behind it.

I’d love to hear how others feel about this. Do you find yourself believing in the character, or are you always aware of the actor? Is there a specific performance where you did feel like the actor completely disappeared? Or is that level of immersion more about the movie as a whole than the acting itself?",spacepants1990,1he7zbp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,2024-12-14 17:37:33,0,0.18,0,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he7zbp

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 3 - Scotland,"Hello there,

I've really been on a Reddit journey through filmed Europe for quite a while now and yes, it makes me wistful that it's coming to an end... but it's going to get wild here at the end. I've arrived at U, and I have to say: Sorry, UK, but this concept of a country made up of several countries is just confusing and I'm in favour of any (non-violent) way to clean up this mess somehow.

But since I don't want it to become too political, I've come up with an idea: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will each have their own thread and at the end the overall UK winner will be chosen from the individual winners. England and Northern Ireland are now more or less through and today we are looking for movies set in **Scotland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hdfvxo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-13 16:22:45,5,0.6,5,0,54,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdfvxo

Such a raw story, raw emotion, he portrayed something perfectly, albeit something I haven't been through and would never want to (as someone who suffers severe depression and is a lover I think losing a lover to suicide would be the hardest thing I could ever imagine). Although I've only watched it maybe twice total now I would consider it a comfort film for me now (is that fucked up?). The sniffing gasoline is both sad and hilarious at the same time, which I think it's intended to be and very well done. I don't want to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.. but when he grabs that pillow I have never felt a gut punch in a movie as hard as that.

movies,Airplane cuts: has anyone analyzed this?,"Hello, good people!

I am flying. I do that lots. I love movies. So some of what I see, it is en route. I have three questions.

First, is there any website or resource that compares the airplane cuts to theatrical releases?

Second, can we trust the title card? Sometimes it says a movie has been edited for content. Other times, it says formatted for the screen. What I am wondering is, if it does not say edited for content, can I trust I've seen the full movie? For some, I am willing to watch again if it omitted significant scenes.

Third, more generally, what do the experts here think of airplane versions of movies?",FrankW1967,1hdrm5w,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdrm5w/airplane_cuts_has_anyone_analyzed_this/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdrm5w/airplane_cuts_has_anyone_analyzed_this/,2024-12-14 01:20:13,0,0.5,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdrm5w
movies,Best realistic fights in movies? Bonus points for martial arts focused films ,"I was recently watching the latest batch of Cobra Kai episodes and thought that this show has jumped the shark for some time now. Sure the original Karate Kid movies are over the top and cheesy as hell but the whole appeal of this series was that it brought it all down to Earth and made them feel almost believable, like they could have happened. But they couldn't help themselves from leaning into cheesy, overly choreographed movie karate/tae kwon do. 

That got me thinking, what are  some movies that have a lot of fighting in them that remain somewhat grounded? No over the top kung fu, no fake martial arts. Just technical fighting and good cinematography to sell it. I could think of some examples, like last year's ""The Killer"" which was sort of an anti John Wick film, with fight scenes without jumping around, no telegraphed swings, no spinning kicks or anything, just people mostly shoving/punching/grappling until someone wins. I couldn't however for the life of me think of a martial arts focused movie that manages to remain grounded somewhat. I'm not looking for full on realism, just something that sells its fights well rather than looking like WWE.",PckMan,1hdzc23,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdzc23/best_realistic_fights_in_movies_bonus_points_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdzc23/best_realistic_fights_in_movies_bonus_points_for/,2024-12-14 09:20:52,0,0.26,0,0,35,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,self,t3_1hdzc23

Most people who can pull stuff like that off are comedians so they are quick witted and usually pretty funny, but I'm curious if there has been any movies or possibly TV shows where from the plot is not comedic and the lines are mostly made up.

Like, is that even a thing? I assume it would be tougher to keep the plot line in order stuff like that but I've always been curious.

Of course, the movie doesn't need to be an absolute tearjaker or anything incredibly serious, but have there been movies where dramatic improv existed?

movies,"How much ""profit"" does a movie have to make to actually be profitable?","I've seen movies that made $30 million in ""profit"" against a budget of $150 million be considered a ""commercial flop"". 

I've read that a film's budget should be doubled to account for marketing costs, so that $100 million budget film that made $300 million actually resulted in a $100 million loss. 

That can't be a rule of thumb, right? I always figured the ""double for marketing"" only applied to the tentpoliest of tentpole movies. 

An example: A Series Of Unfortunate Events (2004) grossed $211 million on a budget of around $140 million. Going by the double for marketing rule, that's a horrendous box office failure. Even if you stake out a half for marketing rule for mid-level productions, the film barely broke even. 

But there was at one point in time a sequel in the works. I wouldn't think they'd entertain the idea of a sequel if the first one barely broke even at best or blew $150 million at worst. So the oft-stated double for marketing rule or half for marketing rule that I just made up couldn't possibly apply to this film, right?

It's not as if this film came out in the 2020s, when studios were trying to status-quo their way through the post-pandemic film industry shakeup. Duds were still duds in the early 2000s when this film came out. 

So how exactly does profit work in Hollywood? Not everyone can be Paranormal Activity or Avengers: Endgame, and we've all seen movies that made a couple milly in profit get 3 or 4 sequels. It's clear they made enough money from the first one to warrant sequel(s), so a multiple of the production budget for marketing is not a universal rule.",Danielnrg,1hdr76o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,2024-12-14 00:58:58,0,0.48,0,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdr76o

movies,Mother! As interesting a movie as I've ever seen. I thought it really showed of the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence. How did you view this movie?,"I went into Mother! knowing absolutely nothing about it other than it starred Jennifer Lawrence. I watched it cold. I thought to myself Jennifer Lawrence is everywhere on social media, TV interviews, Insta Reels, and of course movies.  I thought to myself I will know if it is a good movie or not base on whether or not I become absorbed in it and forget that it's Jlaw acting in it. Well about a tenth of the way through I realized she was completely absorbed by the role. And the weirder the movie got the more she, the actress, disappeared into it. At first, as things got more and more out of hand, I thought it could turn out to be a weird dark comedy. But things never stopped getting out of hand. Every time I thought it had gone too far, it went even further. It literally took me to the very end to figure out what was going on and even then I had missed a lot of the message. I can tell I liked it and it was a good movie because I'm still thinking about it. Man what a ride it was! I'm dying to hear other people's thoughts and reactions to this movie.

Edit: Interesting. This appears to be a movie one either loves or hates. Very little middle ground. The vast majority of movies are unable to generate this kind of response - creating such a divide. That says something. Most movies I watch are just diversions, forgotten about the next day like a finished comic strip. This one lingers, generating strong feelings one way or another. That seems to me one of the defining qualities of art. So, if nothing else this movie is art.

movies,The Most 80's 80's Movie,"Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. 

  
I figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. 

  
So, for example....

  
Back To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. 

  
Top Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks ""80s""

  
But Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there.

movies,Den of Thieves is a great heist movie,"I get why people call it Heat for dirtbags, and that's part of the film's charm. I also think it's a great heist movie that stands strong on its own terms.

Here are a few things I love about it:

\- Gerard Butler's Big Nick eats a donut from a crime after his wife kicks him out.

\- The movie does a great job at highlighting how much the criminals have to lose if they fail (50 Cent's character especially).

\- The heist sequence mines tension out of the simplest moments, such as cops asking the criminals (who are posing as cops) for ID. It shows that bureaucratic procedures can be just as nail-biting as gunfights. 

\-Butler's character follows Pablo Schneider's to a gun range and they show off their shooting skills to each other. After Schneider shows up in Butler's apartment, smiles, and walks out. It's a fun way of showing that they're on to each other.

  \- It recreates the Heat diner scene but moves it to a BBQ joint, but instead of having cops and robbers have meaningful conversations about life, they just antagonize each other.

\- The guns are very loud and the bullets are piercing, which is effective in highlighting the danger of firearms.",WorldsBestWrestling,1hcw2h7,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,2024-12-12 21:35:11,32,0.7,32,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcw2h7

So after he wakes up from the coma and drops Betsy off, there is a scene where he stares into mirror.  

Is it to show that he is still a mentally unwell guy (the music kind of changes here, I guess showing that he sees things that aren’t there), even though he is deemed as a hero, or is there something else that I have missed about this scene?",Alerion23,1hdnl1i,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdnl1i/in_the_movie_the_taxi_driver_what_does_travis_see/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdnl1i/in_the_movie_the_taxi_driver_what_does_travis_see/,2024-12-13 22:03:29,0,0.48,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Question,spoiler,t3_1hdnl1i
movies,What are the best Christmas scenes in otherwise non-Christmas movies?,"I asked my wife to think of a Christmas movie for us to watch tonight. Hours later she told me she wants to watch The Godfather. An odd suggestion, I thought, until I remembered that it has some great scenes set during the holiday season that, combined with its themes around family dynamics and trauma, actually make it a subtly great film to watch over the holidays.

This got me thinking, what other films have great Christmas scenes but aren't otherwise holiday movies?",daCatburgla,1hdk5md,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdk5md/what_are_the_best_christmas_scenes_in_otherwise/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdk5md/what_are_the_best_christmas_scenes_in_otherwise/,2024-12-13 19:28:53,0,0.42,0,0,48,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdk5md
movies,Nickel Boys review,"Nickel Boys: 

Boy oh boy, where do I begin. They told RaMell Ross that he wouldn’t pull this off, that people wouldn’t adapt to the style. Well I’m here to tell you, they were dead wrong. Nickel Boys is creatively astounding. Movies that are so unique don’t come around often and this is unique with a capital U. 

The cinematography is the obvious place to start here. This is an experiment that passes with flying colors. Every frame will be burned into your brain that you’ll see them when you close your eyes. This camera work is like nothing I’ve seen ever seen before and it’s executed to sheer perfection. 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure detail and effort that pays off massively. Don’t take your eyes off the screen cause not a single frame can be missed. Nickel Boys is a vision of artistic excellence. 

Onto the acting. Credit to all the actors and actresses involved cause they were all in danger of being over shadowed by the creative choices made, but man oh man do they hold their own. Pure emotion on display. A gripping but grounded tale. 

RaMell Ross is cinema’s Einstein. Everything about Nickel Boys is innovative and inspired, a truly staggering cinematic achievement. I felt like I was witnessing cinema history… I’m not saying it’s for everyone and Nickel Boys is a movie that will inevitably divide audiences. That said I think this movie is generational, and you can say I’m taking the bait but I have never witnessed something on this scale before and I’m deeply elated with what I have seen. 

Nickel Boys = 10/10

movies,No shortage of zombie films,"No hate intended, but I'm shocked there seems to be no end to the popularity of zombie films.

I think between now and the not-too-distant future there's at the least:  
  
\-Zombieland 3  
\-28 Years Later  
\-Walking Dead, Daryl Dixon  
\-The Last of Us Season 2 (Ok a little diff but similar)  
\-Planet of the Dead  
\-Revolt of the Dead  
\-Return of the Living Dead sequel

and I'm sure more I'm missing.

movies,Short Movies (IMDB Listing),"Hi Folks...

I've keep seeing in some Actress &amp; Actors' listing in IMDB, they have some short movies like 5-30mins.

But I could never find those Titles anywhere....

Could someone recommend me where to find them or how to find them?

Any streaming site allow for download?

Thank you so much!!!
