math,What would the graph of a functional look like?,"It’s currently 4am and this is my late night thought and I have a presentation in 6 hours. 

How would you even graph a functional? 

A function is when x-&gt;f(x) and a functional is when f-&gt; F[f]. So if I input x I want to see what F[f] outputs and do that for every x. I wonder if it’ll lead to chaos or something. Honestly, I don’t know any equations that are functional (can I make one up?) besides the Kohn-Sham equations because it is the back bone of DFT which is part of my research. 

Anyways, just curious feel free to enlighten me.

math,Looking for a reference grade Algebra book,"Hi Reddit,

I have just done with studying Thomas' Calculus book, and I have to say it was one of the best math books out there. I am now looking for a similar style well written classic Algebra &amp; Trigonometry book.   
Many suggested ""Linear Algebra Done Right"" however I didn't find this book interesting or in the same class of Thomas' Calculus book (with all respect to the author). Also, been through ""Introductory and Intermediate Algebra"" by Bittinger and didn't quite like it.. 

Is there any other hidden gens out there that I am missing? Looking for your advice..

math,Is there any deep intuition behind inner products and orthogonal functions?,"
I’m studying measure theory in my masters year. I really love analysis and so far everything makes sense and is very easy to follow. I always like to construct my own proofs of theorems and I understand everything.. that is until I started studying orthogonal functions. 

I have 0 intuition as to why,what and when two functions are orthogonal. Saying that the integral of their multiplication should be 0 gives me 0 clue as to what this thing looks like. I did some reading about it and it related it back to the dot product of vectors, but I don’t have any intuition as to why thats true either (I can prove it algebraically and its straightforward, but the proof seems like a blind man feeling his way out of a dark room slowly). When I prove analysis based theorems, I can always see it in my head, then formulate it in terms of algebra. But when that “head image” is not there and all you have is blind algebra, it just sucks all the joy out of studying it.",sheraawwrr,1hfs9os,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfs9os/is_there_any_deep_intuition_behind_inner_products/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfs9os/is_there_any_deep_intuition_behind_inner_products/,2024-12-16 20:11:24,63,0.92,63,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfs9os

math,Noether normalization lemma proof (Nagata),"I think I understand the statement at an intuitive level now.  Let me know if this is the right way to think about it!

For a field k, a k-algebra on n generators A = k\[x\_1,...,x\_n\] can be ""factored"" into a two-stage extension of k, with each stage having a finiteness property:

1. By extending k as a ring to B = k\[x\_1',...,x\_m'\] \\cong k\[X\_1,...,X\_m\] for a finite collection x\_i \\in A for some 0 \\leq m \\leq n, and then 

2. By extending B as a module to get A (i.e., there's a finite collection y\_1,...,y\_r \\in A such that every element of A can be written as \\sum b\_iy\_i for b\_i \\in B.

It's like the dimensionality of A is m, but you can add a ""fudge factor"" of this module-finite extension on top of that.

It seems like a really natural statement, but the standard proof by Nagata is horrendous.  I'm reading it in Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, and he has a way of brushing details under the rug, but even then, it's a complicated construction.  

I roughly understand that it's doing a change-of-variables and I learned that there's a nice geometric interpretation of getting ""m-dimensional"" affine varieties in A\^n to project to A\^m with finite fibers by changing the coordinate axes.

Can someone explain where the intuition of the Nagata proof comes from?  The proof makes it look like an ugly ""technical lemma"", even though the statement seems to be fundamentally important for algebraic geometry.  Are there cleaner proofs?  (The proof for k infinite is cleaner, but I still don't understand the intuitive idea of why you would change variables this way.)",WMe6,1hfyak4,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfyak4/noether_normalization_lemma_proof_nagata/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfyak4/noether_normalization_lemma_proof_nagata/,2024-12-17 00:37:28,16,0.95,16,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfyak4
