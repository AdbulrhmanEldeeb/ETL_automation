artificial,Active Inference outperforms chatgbt in Mastermind benchmark using a laptop,"From:

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/17/2998249/0/en/VERSES-Genius-Outperforms-OpenAI-Model-in-Code-Breaking-Challenge-Mastermind.html


“Accuracy and Reliability. Genius solved the code every time in a consistent number of steps.
Speed. 

Genius consistently solved games in 1.1–4.5 seconds, while ChatGPT’s solve times ranged from 7.9 to 889 seconds (approximately 15 mins)

Efficiency. Genius’ total compute time for 100 games was just over 5 minutes, compared to ChatGPT’s 12.5 hours.

Cost. Genius’ compute cost was estimated at $0.05 USD for all 100 games, compared to ChatGPT’s o1 model at $263 USD.

In summary, Genius solved Mastermind 100% of the time, was 140 times faster and 5260 times cheaper than o1-preview.”


Pretty impressive demonstration of active inference and free energy principle using bayesian methods. Hopefully they see similar results with upcoming Atari 10k benchmarks. Seeing Karl Friston’s research in 2025-2026 will be pretty interesting for agi development which I think will be a blend of multiple ai methods.

artificial,"Llama 3.3 better than 4o, o1","I have started myself to shift from ChatGPT models because now they have started to go out of context for no reason.

You ask them to make a summary of what we have discussed on this chat so far and it fails to note the important points.

And if the chat is pretty lengthy, it just dismisses and gets bizarre info out of it.

I think I smell the commercialness of it spreading across the room.

I'm mostly wanting her to get better answers to ""educational"" and ""current event"" questions than I can provide (and sending her to google isn't always the best due to all the misinformation and clickbait). But a way for her to manage a life of ADHD (I have no idea what that would look like, maybe schedules &amp; timers?) would be a MAJOR plus.
