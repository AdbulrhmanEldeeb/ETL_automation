pcgaming,"I just launched the demo for my base-builder, Final Outpost: Definitive Edition - run your town and defend it from hordes of zombies outside...","Hi everyone,

I started working on this hobby project in 2018, which I released as a super bare-bones MVP on the App Store in 2020. It kind of popped off (at least compared to my expectations). Since then while finishing university I have been working on the game during holidays with my brother and a couple of friends. We made a bunch of huge updates to the game and brought it to Android.

I decided to go full-time on the project with my brother last October and we've really increased the quality of the game since then so that it feels like a really polished professional project. That game has now reached 1M downloads on mobile.

But the thing is, it really feels like a game more suited to the PC audience. It never had gatcha mechanics, just a 'support the devs' selection of optional items to buy. The game was always fully playable for free. It's depth and complexity has now also reached the level where we feel like it's a game worthy of Steam.

So since June, we've been working on a new version with a bunch of new content, features and mechanics, including a trading system and a card-based meta progression. This new game is called Final Outpost: Definitive Edition and I just released the free demo on our Steam page.

Demo here! [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066310/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066310/)

Synopsis:

Final Outpost is a survival strategy base-builder where you lead the last survivors of the apocalypse. Build your Outpost, manage your citizens and defend against hordes of zombies. How many days can you survive?
