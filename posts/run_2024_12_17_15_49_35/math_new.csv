math,What is the point of looking at very long proofs?/ How do you handle them?,"I am studying maths quite a while now, and i enjoy it. But there is something i wonder: why do we look at proofs in the lecture that are multiple pages long, and take a whole lecture to complete?

I dont not feel that i learn much from them. 

My usual way of learning is to write anki-cards and learn them, because i am a very forgetfull person, and if the proof is longer than a few senteces i will otherwise never fully understand the proof, because at the end of it i will have already forgotten how it started. That is why i am fine with a vague understanding of the contents when i am sitting in the lecture, since i know that i will get a better understanding over time by learning these cards

Sadly this now leads to a problem: Proof that are very long (multiplie pages or even multiple lecture) take ages to learn. So: is there even a point in doing it? With shorter proofd i always get a ""sense of understanding"" out of it, so i really want to learn them, but with these long proofs, i dont seem to develop the same sense of understanding.

But without learning the proofs i wil never understand them. I can ""read them through"" and check every step, but i will forget everything immideately -- so why even bother doing it?

  
To make my point more clearer, my questions are: How do you handle such proofs and why do handle them in the way you do?",skiwol,1hffvp3,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hffvp3/what_is_the_point_of_looking_at_very_long_proofs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hffvp3/what_is_the_point_of_looking_at_very_long_proofs/,2024-12-16 10:01:59,1,0.53,1,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hffvp3
math,Noether normalization lemma proof (Nagata),"I think I understand the statement at an intuitive level now.  Let me know if this is the right way to think about it!

For a field k, a k-algebra on n generators A = k\[x\_1,...,x\_n\] can be ""factored"" into a two-stage extension of k, with each stage having a finiteness property:

1. By extending k as a ring to B = k\[x\_1',...,x\_m'\] \\cong k\[X\_1,...,X\_m\] for a finite collection x\_i \\in A for some 0 \\leq m \\leq n, and then 

2. By extending B as a module to get A (i.e., there's a finite collection y\_1,...,y\_r \\in A such that every element of A can be written as \\sum b\_iy\_i for b\_i \\in B.

It's like the dimensionality of A is m, but you can add a ""fudge factor"" of this module-finite extension on top of that.

It seems like a really natural statement, but the standard proof by Nagata is horrendous.  I'm reading it in Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, and he has a way of brushing details under the rug, but even then, it's a complicated construction.  

I roughly understand that it's doing a change-of-variables and I learned that there's a nice geometric interpretation of getting ""m-dimensional"" affine varieties in A\^n to project to A\^m with finite fibers by changing the coordinate axes.

Can someone explain where the intuition of the Nagata proof comes from?  The proof makes it look like an ugly ""technical lemma"", even though the statement seems to be fundamentally important for algebraic geometry.  Are there cleaner proofs?  (The proof for k infinite is cleaner, but I still don't understand the intuitive idea of why you would change variables this way.)",WMe6,1hfyak4,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfyak4/noether_normalization_lemma_proof_nagata/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hfyak4/noether_normalization_lemma_proof_nagata/,2024-12-17 00:37:28,16,0.95,16,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfyak4

I’m studying measure theory in my masters year. I really love analysis and so far everything makes sense and is very easy to follow. I always like to construct my own proofs of theorems and I understand everything.. that is until I started studying orthogonal functions. 

I have 0 intuition as to why,what and when two functions are orthogonal. Saying that the integral of their multiplication should be 0 gives me 0 clue as to what this thing looks like. I did some reading about it and it related it back to the dot product of vectors, but I don’t have any intuition as to why thats true either (I can prove it algebraically and its straightforward, but the proof seems like a blind man feeling his way out of a dark room slowly). When I prove analysis based theorems, I can always see it in my head, then formulate it in terms of algebra.

math,Advice for Graduate School Application - Gap Year or Apply Now?,"Foreword: Typically, I would reserve such question for the academic advisors at my school; however, it is winter break, and I'm realizing nobody is looking to talk atm (and understandably so). Being that applications are due before the Spring semester starts back up, I'm stuck w/o many options. So, pls down beat me down with mean comments and heavy downvotes lol! I would appreciate the mercy. Thank you!! :) I appreciate all the help I can get.

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

Here's my situation: If I took a gap year next year, the benefits would be that I would be able to...

(i) improve GRE scores (math subject test &amp; general test),

(ii) work as a full-time tutor in mathematics (as well potentially fill the role of a substitute teacher for high school math courses),

(iii) prep on getting PhD passes on all four qual courses offered at my university (I have already taken all of these courses, just have yet to take quals),

(iv) have extra time to polish Personal Statement, looking into which universities best fit my interests, etc.

HOWEVER, I am unsure whether (a.) this would be good in ensuring strong letters of rec (most of my options are professors which I've only had one semester under, and asking for a letter of rec an entire year later I'd imagine could cause some difficulties), and whether (b.) graduate schools would frown upon seeing an applicant having taken the most recent year off.

math,Math puzzle: Move the tower,"French mathematician Édouard Lucas was born in Amiens in 1842 and died in Paris 49 years later. He wrote the four-volume work *Recréations Mathématiques*, which became a classic of recreational mathematics. In 1883, under the pseudonym “N. Claus de Siam” (an anagram of “Lucas d’Amiens”), he marketed a solitaire game that he called the Tower of Hanoi.

He claimed that the game was a simplified version of the so-called Tower of Brahma. In this supposed legend, monks had to move a tower made of 64 golden disks in a great temple. Before they could complete this task, however, the temple would crumble to dust, and the end of the world would arrive.

The Tower of Hanoi consists of a small board on which three identical cylindrical rods are mounted. On the left rod there are five disks of different sizes with a hole in the middle. They are ordered by size, with the largest disk at the bottom. The goal of the game is to move all the disks from the left rod to the right rod in as few moves as possible. In each move, only one disk can be taken from one rod and placed on another rod, and a larger disk can never be placed on a smaller disk. How many and which moves are necessary to transport the disks?

math,Intuition behind the definition of MCD as the sum of ideals in principal ideal domains.,"In my Algebra/Number theory course we have defined the MCD (only in PIDs) as the generator of the sum of ideals, meaning: 
MCD(a,b) = M  &lt;=&gt; (a)+(b) = (M),

where MCD means maximum common divisor and parenthesis denote the ideal generated by that element. 
I don't understand how this definition relates to the MCD in integers. If I take ax+by, why should that be a multiple of the MCD?? We have then used this for Bezout's identity and to solve diophantine equations in PIDs so it's pretty crucial.  

I also don't completely get why the mcm (minimum common multiple) is the intersection of ideals, in particular the inclusion (a)∩(b) ⊆ (m), where m = mcm(a,b).
If a number is a multiple of both a and b, why should it be a multiple of their mcm??

math,Proof by induction in algebra,"Is it just me or is proof by induction the single most common proof technique used in abstract algebra, at least at the late undergrad/early grad level?

I saw it quite a bit when I was teaching myself Galois theory, where I often saw the trick of applying the induction hypothesis to a number's (e.g., the degree of a splitting field) proper factors.  

Now, as I'm learning commutative algebra, it seems like every other theorem has a proof by induction.  I'm spending the afternoon learning the proof of the Noether normalization lemma, and of course, it's another inductive proof.

I never realized that induction was such an important proof technique.  But maybe it's because of the ""discreteness"" of algebra compared to analysis?  Come to think of it, I can't think of many proofs in analysis where induction plays a big role.

Somebody already made a post on this subreddit that mentions that OEIS is looking for a part-time or full-time Managing Editor (paid position).  The salary of the managing editor will probably be the biggest expense of the organization, especially if it's a full time position. Maybe, if enough math enthusiasts donate , OEIS can have the budged to hire a full-time managing editor for 5 or more years. More top candidates would want the position if it's full time, stable and long term.

math,Permanent knowledge lifehack,"What do people actually mean by saying that technical(Math,Physics,chemistry, science with numbers/abstraction involved) need intellegence and non-technical(biology,history,languages) need memory? I have thought about this topic a LOT, but couldn't find single Reddit or Quora post about it, are some knowledges relatively ""permanent""? If they are, what are they called?What are they classified as? By relatively permanent i mean, ones that are lot easier to remind/re-learn after not being in touch with it for years and forgetting.

You forget everything eventually after stopping learning it or not persuing work in it, but i think in some subjects like math, you invest majority  of the time cracking the abstraction of a concept, breaking it, understanding it . And minority of the time memorizing. And i think that's the reason that math education is so admired by society. Some topic take same amount of time to re-learn that was spent to learn it first time, some take less.

math,A different Calculus book ,"Hello there !
Recently, I've read the book called 'Algebra Unplugged' . As you can guess from the title it's a book about the fundamentals of Algebra. Although I've always been good at Algebra and I am now in Algebra in advanced topics like Sequences and Logarithms, I've really gained great benefits and more importantly enjoyed it so much.
It teachs the basics through a narrative-discussion way between the two authors.It completely changed the way I see Algebra. It has transformed it into a game.

So, all that said.
*I discovered that there is a book about calculus for the same two authors. It really clicked in time as I've started pre-calculus this semester.
So, I've searched for it , but unfortunately can't seem to find it .
And if wonder about Amazon.

math,Is there any kind of typology of (infinite) fields? How many types are the most relevant?,"Hi everyone! When studying algebra about fields, I remember noticing that compared to groups or rings, there is quite a limited number of fields that is closely looked on. If groups are plenty of any structure, ""size, shape"", fields seem to be pretty limited. In the basic course we usually have Q, R, C, and finite fields GF(p^k). In p-adic course one can also know of the (infinite) Q_p field.

For finite fields we know that all of them are encompassed by GF(p^k) and we can't make up anything that isn't isomorphic to one of GF(p^k). But what about infinite fields?

I think about ways to construct new fields. R and Q_p are the only variants that we can get from Q by completing it with respect to some norm. C is an algebraic extension of R that happens to be its algebraic closure. There should be some beast that is the algebragraic closure of a finite field GF(p) (which I can't imagine how it would be constructed and work). Also, having some field F, we can construct a field of rational functions with coefficients of F, that way we can construct an infinite field of the finite characteristic, if we take some GF(p^n) as our F. This rational function construction is basically an expansion by inserting some element x to the field.

So, my question is, can we categorise the infinite fields somehow regarding their structure and how many fields and field types are actually useful for mayh practise. Is it just our friends Q, R, C mostly or some exotic fields are useful as well?",kamalist,1he5jgp,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1he5jgp/is_there_any_kind_of_typology_of_infinite_fields/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1he5jgp/is_there_any_kind_of_typology_of_infinite_fields/,2024-12-14 15:42:48,8,1.0,8,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1he5jgp

math,Murphy vs Averson for C* algebras?,"I want to self study C\* algebras because of motivation from quantum mechanics and because they seem interesting in their own right. I'm not looking to be an operator algebraist or anything like that, I just want to get a good understanding of the basics, the motivation behind them, some of the big results, and how they can be applied in physics. Some things I'm looking beyond the basics are the GNS construction and representations of C\* algebras on Hilbert spaces. It would be even better if the book covers Von Neumann algebras and representations of the canonical commutation relations in physics. I have studied functional analysis but I know very little about operator algebras beyond what a Banach algebra is.

Based on the above I've narrowed it down to two books though I'm open to others as well. Averson's book seems very short and to the point, but also looks like it can be dense and does not provide a lot of hand holding. Does it leave anything important out?

This feels unsatisfying though because there are analogies between groups and **connected** Lie groups as well:

1. Group rings play the same role in the representation theory as Lie algebras,
2. One parameter subgroups are kind of like cyclic groups, e.g. abelian groups have a particularly simple structure in both cases and decompose into products of cyclic groups/one parameter subgroups,
3. There are many other almost exactly shared theorems (which isn't a big surprise of course because they're both groups).

I’ve been trying to think about how I would go about doing this for 3-manifolds. I suppose I start by embedding it in 4D Euclidean space. Only problem is that I can’t visualize any of this in my head nor can I draw it so I have no idea how to come up with an intrinsic coordinate system to the 3-manifold.

math,Why does this not work? (Integrodifferential PDE),"I am working on an integrodifferential PDE (a coefficient in the PDE is given by the integral of the function squared over the whole domain) and I was trying to see if there are any ways of turning it into anything simpler. I came up with something that somehow seems like it cannot work, but I don't see where it fails. I'll explain it with a simple example, using a diffusion-like equation. Suppose we have

u_t = A(t) u_xx

where A(t) could be a simple time dependent function, or given by an integral of some function of u over x. The idea I had was to simply rearrange

u_t/u_xx = A(t)

And then take a partial derivative w.r.t. x so that

[u_t/u_xx]_x = 0

Developing this expression, one gets

u_xt u_xx - u_t u_xxx = 0

which can be rewritten as the simpler (?) system

v_t v_x - u_t v_xx = 0,   u_x = v

This is now a (nonlinear and higher order, but no longer integrodifferential) PDE. In particular it is first order in time derivatives so (I might be wrong) given an initial condition u(x,t=0)=u_0(x) it can be integrated forward in time, say numerically.

Obviously this can't be right, because where is all the information that was contained in A(t) gone? Even for standard diffusion, where A is a time independent constant, this doesnt make sense.

Where does the argument fail, or what am I missing?",m3tro,1hcxnyi,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hcxnyi/why_does_this_not_work_integrodifferential_pde/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hcxnyi/why_does_this_not_work_integrodifferential_pde/,2024-12-12 22:46:52,11,1.0,11,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcxnyi

math,I am trying to construct integer multiplication without using subtraction and simply still using the definition of the equivalence relation but nothing seems to resolve. Is it possible to do so without resorting to using subtraction which isn't defined for the natural numbers?,"The basic equivalence relationship the integers are built around is ⟨a,b⟩\~⟨c,d⟩  iff a+d=b+c.

Integer multiplication works as follows. A\_Z B\_Z=\[⟨a\_1,a\_2 ⟩\]+\[⟨b\_1,b\_2 ⟩\]=\[⟨a\_1 b\_1+a\_2 b\_2,a\_1 b\_2+a\_2 b\_1 ⟩\]

It seems problematic to me that people seem to always switch to defining multiplication as (𝑎−𝑏)⋅(𝑐−𝑑)=𝑎⋅𝑐−𝑎⋅𝑑−𝑏⋅𝑐+𝑏⋅𝑑, and then they go on to resolve the arithmetic using rules of subtraction. However, as all of these numbers are natural numbers and subtraction can't be used with natural numbers. It makes no sense to me how this is acceptable.  


It seems to me like integer multiplication has to be constructed by proving the following:

  
if ⟨a,b⟩  \~⟨c,d⟩ and ⟨v,x⟩  \~⟨y,z⟩, then ⟨a,b⟩⟨v,x⟩=⟨c,d⟩⟨y,z⟩, meaning: 

⟨av+bx,ax+bv⟩\~⟨cy+dz,cz+dy⟩↔av+bx+cz+dy=ax+bv+cy+dz. However I cannot figure out how to get anything we have already proven to resolve into this.

I know it doesn't matter for a symmetric tensor, but most authors don't indicate if they are dealing with a symmetric matrix.

I tried looking at historical texts like Levi-Civita's *""Absolute Differential Calculus""* and it seems they present the divergence with respect to the second index. I also looked at Gibb's and Wilson's *""Vector Analysis""* (they treated dyadics, not tensors in general) and the divergence is w.r.t the first index.

This is confusing me, so does anyone know the correct definition, and perhaps more importantly, why it is the correct one?

math,Why is there no proof of the Church-Turing thesis?,"I heard there is no proof of it, even though it seems obviously. There are proofs of Turing mahines being equivalent to various systems, but according to some people, there is no formal definition for an effective method.

I am assuming that this topic is actually important, and that someone would actually benefit from the Churing-Turing thesis being proven. If that is the case, then whoever would benefit from it must have a formal definition of what an effective method is, since they would need a formal definition just for their brain to be able to think about it. In that case, I don't see why it wouldn't be very hard.

If it's worth anything to you, I came up with an idea for a proof. Wikepedia says that ""\[A finite method\] consists of a finite number of exact, finite instructions."", so I'm assuming that means we have some f:A -&gt; B, where A and B are both finite. Turing machines work with a finite alphabet on a tape, and the alphabet can be mapped to the natrual numbers, so A and B would both be sequences of natural numbers. Since A and B are finite, even if their inner sequences are infinite, we can map them to finite sequences. Therefore, we can replace f with a function that only takes in finite sequences of numbers.

A finite sequence of numbers can be equivalently mapped to a vector. A mapping of any set of vectors to another set of vectors can be represented by a matrix, as long as we pick a mapping with vectors that have the same sizes.

My proof is therefore this:

* Turing machines are equivalent to matrices, if we only look at a specific finite slice of the tape before or after the machine halts.
* Matrices are equivalent to functions that are effectively computable.
* Therefore, turing machines can be mapped to effectively computable functions with the same inputs and outputs.",Simanalix,1hbumro,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,2024-12-11 14:26:34,48,0.78,48,0,46,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbumro

math,"A nice little generalization of the homomophism theorem I ""found""","Of course I didn't really ""find"" it, as I am certain that someone else thought about it centuries ago, but nonetheless, I'd like to present this neat little generalization of the homomophism theorem for groups.

We start with a generalization of group homs. Given two groups `X` and `Y`, we say a **group relation** `R` is a subgroup of the product `X \times Y`. By the closed graph theorem of groups, a map `f: X\rightarrow Y` is a homomorphism iff the graph `\Gamma_f=\{(x,f(x))\}` is a subgroup of `X \times Y`. Thus, group relations can be regarded as a generalization of homomorphisms. You even can compose relations in a natural way such they are mimicking homomorphisms.

Note that this notion is symetrical and more flexible than homs, e.g. it might happen that the elements of `X` are ""related"" to more than one element of `Y` or that only the neutral elements are related to each other.

Either way, for each group relation `R`, we have group homs `p_X` or `p_Y` maping from `R` to `X` or `Y` respectively. Note that since the surjective image of a normal subgroup is still normal, `p_X(ker p_Y)` is normal in `p_X(R)`.

Now to the generalization of the homomorphism theorem. In its classical form it states: ""If we, on the left side, treat elements as equals if they get mapped to the same thing and on the right side only consider the image, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short: ""`X/\ker f \isom f(X)`"".

This theorem - and this is what I ""found"" - can be generalized to the following:

""If we, on the left side, only consider the image of a relation and treat elements as equals if they are related to the same elements and do the same thing on the right, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short:

`p_X(R)/p_X(ker p_Y) \isom p_Y(R)/p_Y(ker p_X)`

If our relation is the graph of a homomorphism, this formula gives us pricisely the classical hmomorphism theorem, but is, as group relations are, more general than this. Which is quite nice.

The proof of this theorem is of course an exercise for the reader ;-) But in all seriousness, it is very much like the proof of the classical version, give it a try if you like.

If any of you have a source where this generalization is stated and there is more to read about the things I called group relations, I'd be more than happy if you'd inform us about that.

math,Linear combination of exponentials vanishing on N vanishes on R,"I came across this exercise in Knapp's Basic Algebra, and it looks deceptively simple. Consider the family of functions defined as f_a(x) = e^ax and let F be a linear combination of (finitely many of) them. Prove that [∀k∈N, F(k)=0] implies F is identically zero.

I can easily show that the f_a's are linearly independent (which seems useful as this is intended as a linear algebra exercise). That said, I tried attacking this in a number of ways, to no avail. I feel like the intuition is that a nontrivial finite linear combination can only vanish on a finite number of points, but I have no clue how to prove it. For starters, I'm pretty sure that all the a's have to be negative, as the opposite would force lim[x-&gt;+inf] F(x) = +-inf, but I'm not even sure how to prove that. And apart from this, I'm not even sure how to use the fact that F vanishes on N. I also tried:

- fixing k∈N, considering F(k) as a homogeneous polynomial in n variables evaluated at x_i=e^(a_i)

- taking derivatives, which have to vanish if F is identically 0, but this tells me nothing relating to what I actually know about F

- taking a very linear algebra-heavy approach, taking the vecspace V=span{f_a ∀a∈R} and the evaluation functions v_k to be a subspace of V*, and noting that F belongs to the intersection of all the kernels of the v_k, but I was unable to show that they intersect trivially

- taking the derivative of F², which by analysis has to vanish on all k∈N meaning I can produce a second such F with more f_a's involved (all sums a_i+a_j) and this makes me wonder if I can reverse this process somehow to get less terms and get an infinite descent, which both seems like a possibly promising way (it's the only thing that gave me any information whatsoever) and at the same time fells like relying on too much analysis to be required in a first semester algebra book's second chapter exercise.

I feel like I'm missing something obvious, but I asked a few graduate friends and they were stumped as well. The main difficulty I'm finding is the fact that exponentials are everywhere and they aren't an algebraic/analytic/whatever object in nature, which makes me confused as to what way I should look at them in this case. Plus linear combinations with arbitrary real coefficients AND powers can really do the weirdest shit so I'm having trouble proving anything by induction on the number of terms because the complexity scales that fast.

math,I find math fascinating but school made me hate it,"
Math has always been my weakest of skills in school, I hated how school portrayed it, the exercices, the stress associated with it, and how no one really understood it including those who got the highest marks (I knew someone who always got full marks by memorising typical old exam questions lol)

This is just a rant, I just wish sometimes that I could be great at math. Do you guys recommend a way to love learning it and actually understand its notions even later in life?

math,Is there a place to learn probability theory without all the handwaving and abuse of notation?,"My biggest problem in learning probability theory is how FUCKED UP the use of language and notation is in this field. The same symbol is used for various things without being changed and you're just supposed to get it from context. I HATE it.

Is something a function? A scalar? A process? Who knows, we just call it p(x|y) and keep everyone guessing. And definitions? Who needs those? 

I yearn for the clarity of regular maths, where you define f to be a function from set X to set Y and that's all that it is. f is the function. f(x) is the value in Y that f evaluates x to.

I can understand the stuff often enough, but only AFTER I've put in the work to pick apart what the author meant by their statement. But if I wanted to do literary interpretation I would study literature and not maths. 

I honestly can't believe that throughout all of my online and university exposition to probability theory I have never once encountered someone doing it with sensible, understandable notation. It's all just quick squiggles and handwaving. I get it, I'm a lazy fuck too, but for FUCKS sake... 

Is there some place for learning probability theory that uses notation or even just a system of notation without teaching material that is not so god-damn AMBIGUOUS???

math,"if f(f(x)) = ln(x), what is f(x)? Can such a function even be defined?","I was thinking about the idea of a function that lies halfway between x and ln(x), such that when it is composed with itself, the result is the natural logarithm function.  When trying to define this function I ran into some seeming paradoxes.

ln(1) = 0, thus f(f(1)) = 0.  Let us define c such that f(1) = c, and f(c) = 0.  

If c were 0, then f(f(c)) is undefined, as ln(0) is undefined.  But then this means that f(0) is 0, per the above definition that f(c) = 0.  Thus c cannot be zero, as this would lead to the statement that f(f(0)) = 0, i.e. ln(0) = 0, where it is actually undefined.

So, we know c cannot be zero.  Thus it must be some non-zero number such that f(c) = 0.  But then what is ln(c)?  This can be expressed as f(f(c)), or f(0).

So, thus far, we can express the results of the f being composed up to 4 times with x as 1, remembering that f^2(x) = ln(x):

f^0 (1) = 1

f^1 (1) = c

f^2 (1) = 0

f^3 (1) = ln(c)

f^4 (1) = undefined

f^5 (1) = ln(ln(c)) and undefined.

This fifth power is undefined because f(undefined) can not be defined.  But since it is also ln(ln(c)), and ln(x) is only undefined on 0, ln(c) must be 0.  Thus c must be 1.

This leads to a contradiction, though, as this means f(1) = 1.  Thus f(f(1)) is also 1, but we know it must be 0.

math,Rebuilding my dad's math library,"So my dad got his B.S. (Augustana College, Sioux Falls) and Master's (University of North Dakota) in math in the 1960s, and then he taught briefly (Minot State College). He was drafted into the Army, met my mom, got married, and went to work for the state of South Dakota where he spent his career doing statistical analysis and projections.

He kept his student textbooks as well as the freebies publishers sent him when he was teaching. At least he kept them up until he and my mom moved. At that point he chucked the books.

I was a bit disappointed by this at the time, but I didn't think too much about it. 

However, my dad passed away in February, and since I can't spend time with him anymore, I've been trying to reassemble the shelf of books he kept. At least those that I remember. It's a way of spending time with him after a fashion, or at least with his past.

Anyway, most of the books I remember are here: [https://archive.org/details/fav-richard\_jensen](https://archive.org/details/fav-richard_jensen)

(Side note: my dad probably would've offered me the books rather than tossing them if he knew that I had such strong memories of them. I was, frankly, fascinated by these books as a little kid--I was a precocious reader, and these books suggested a whole new world to explore, if only I could figure out what all those symbols meant).

Most of these books are readily available from eBay, AbeBooks, etc., and I've made a start getting them.

However, I'm looking for community help with a few titles... *Basic College Algebra* by William LeRoy Hart ( [https://archive.org/details/basiccollegealge0000hart](https://archive.org/details/basiccollegealge0000hart) ) is nowhere to be found. Likewise, the Study Guide for Munem's *Intermediate Algebra* ( [https://archive.org/details/studyguideforint0000mune](https://archive.org/details/studyguideforint0000mune) ), and Elbridge Vance's *Modern Algebra and Trigonometry* ( [https://archive.org/details/modernalgebratri02edunse](https://archive.org/details/modernalgebratri02edunse) ).

If anyone has any suggestions on how I can find these books, that would be much appreciated!

The silly thing is I already know most of what's in these books--they offer nothing new *now*, but they're a link to my dad that I want to rebuild.

(P.S. I realize that Reddit is not exactly the forum for this sort of thing, but posting a ""Looking to buy"" ad on Facebook or Craigslist with these books listed is about as likely to succeed as standing on a street corner and shouting the list into the air.)",richardajensen,1hae8y8,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hae8y8/rebuilding_my_dads_math_library/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hae8y8/rebuilding_my_dads_math_library/,2024-12-09 16:54:27,100,0.97,100,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hae8y8

However, I’m still unsure about which specific area within algebra excites me the most. 

I want to apply for masters and PhD programs in Europe and US (respectively).

math,Research in Galois and Field Theory,"Hi, I wanted to ask a question about active research done in algebra, more specifically in field theory.

In the math department where I study, it seems that the main research in algebra involves finding the asynptotics of the probability of a set of random polynomials  These questions are much different than the algebra courses I took (like Galois Theory and commutatice algebra)- they are more about asymptotics, bounding terms and overall much more calculation-heavy.

I was recently given a few papers to read, which also had a lot of calculations, and the results where about counting the number of polynomials that satisfy a certain condition. It didn't really interest me, and the whole thing makes me a bit hopeless about doing research in this subject- the courses I took where so beautiful, but now everything looks like it's just calculating things.

I wanted to ask if there are different areas of research in Algebra/Field Theory (I'm not talking about Group Theory in this post), which is less about calculating things and more ""beautiful"" (I know it's subjective but I don't know how else to put it), like things done in class.

In a bit of an ironic twist, he recently (like two weeks ago) defended his doctoral dissertation while the Syrian opposition was about to start their offense. I dug up a summary of his thesis although I can't actually find the full text. I'm not a mathematician so as I'm trying to read the translated summary, I'm still not sure what exactly he did.

The title is ""Arithmetic questions of polynomials in algebraic number fields "" and this is the summary translated from Russian:

The first topic we will consider is the representation of two rational integers as sums of three rational squares having a common square. Representations of rational integers as polynomials have always been of interest to mathematics. Many well-known theorems and results, such as Legendre's three-square theorem, Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorems, the Hilbert-Gamke problem and many others, are devoted to this issue. In particular, Legendre's three-square theorem completely solves the problem of representing a rational integer as a sum of three rational squares. For representing an integer by a homogeneous polynomial of degree two, the local-global Hasse principle reduces the problem to representability modulo all powers of primes and representability in real numbers. In 1980, D.L. Colliot-Thelen and D. Core generalized Hasse's principle to two homogeneous polynomials under certain conditions. Our study is aimed at generalizing the above-mentioned Legendre theorem, and exploits this generalization.

The second topic we consider is estimates of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. Trigonometric sums have long been of interest because of their deep connection with modular arithmetic in the residue ring modulo q. In particular, they arise in the Hardy-Littlewood-Ramanujan circle method in the form of I.M. Vinogradov's trigonometric sums for estimating the number of solutions of Diophantine equations. In particular, the solvability of a given equation is considered, first, in the real numbers, and second, modulo any rational integer q. The latter part is usually deeper and more difficult, and rational trigonometric sums play an essential role in it; they are effectively responsible for the solvability modulo q. In 1940, Hua Lo-keng found a nontrivial estimate for trigonometric sums in the field of rational numbers. Subsequent work by Chen Junrun and V. I. Nechaev improved the estimate. In 1984, Qi Mingao and Ding Ping found a constant in Hua Luo-ken's estimate. In 1949, Hua Luo-ken generalized his estimate to the case of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. The first part of our study on this topic is aimed at strengthening this estimate. The second part of our study on this topic is aimed at generalizing Hua Luo-ken's tree method for constructing solutions of polynomial congruences modulo a rational prime, used in solving the convergence problem of a singular series in the Prouet-Terry-Ascot problem, to the case of algebraic number fields.

The third topic we consider is the representations of Dirichlet characters. Dirichlet characters, first introduced by P. L. Dirichlet in 1837, play a central role in multiplicative number theory. They were originally used by him to prove a theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.Many important questions of the analytical number theory were developed on the basis of Dirichlet characters and the theory of Dirichlet L-functions. In the modern theory of L-functions, estimates of character sums are of great importance. A.G. Postnikov's formula, proved by him in 1955, expresses Dirichlet characters modulo a power of an odd prime number through exponentials of polynomials with rational coefficients. Thus, the problem of estimating the sums of such Dirichlet characters is reduced to I.M. Vinogradov's method of trigonometric sums. Our study on this topic is connected with the generalization of A.G. Postnikov's formula to the case of a Dirichlet character modulo a power of 2 and the application of both the original and the generalized formula of A.G. Postnikov to estimate the sums of characters in algebraic number fields.

math,Dealing with meta-theory in research,"How important is it to understand the limitations of current techniques when coming up with new ones?

Whenever I approach a new (to me) topic in math, there always seem to be a few core standard arguments and lemmas that get repeatedly used to obtain many of the best-known results.

When approaching open problems in these areas, it often seems natural to try to try these methods to exhaustion. As these are open problems, such naive applications are almost inherently doomed to fail as they would have been discovered and published long before.


However, it usually leaves a nearly equally difficult problem of determining why such techniques don’t work—what I’m referring to as the “meta-theory”. 

Some examples of these “meta theory” arguments do include your classic peano or ZF independent statements, but they can also be more grounded in a particular approach. For instance one of the classic techniques for determining if a polynomial has nontrivial integer roots is to consider residues mod n (Hasse principle). However, the equation 3x^3+4y^3+5z^3=0 has solutions mod n for every n, but has no solutions in the integers.
Such a result shows that this elementary technique is fundamentally limited.

Another example in information theory is the existence of non-Shannon-type entropy inequalities. (entropy inequalities that can be derived solely from the non-negativity of mutual information.) 

I find these kinds of results very intriguing and yet very difficult to understand the full implications of. This is particularly because they can show that the current/basic techniques are not enough to solve certain problems. However, it they can sometimes be almost as challenging as the problems they are intended to help solve, as even formalizing what it really means to be (or not be) obtainable using a set of methods can be extremely difficult.

When mathematicians develop new tools to solve open problems, how well do they understand the limitations of the current techniques? I find it difficult to believe that people randomly stumble across new techniques without already having a pretty good sense of what a “correct” proof would have to look like, although im sure it happens rarely.

Does reasoning about the limitations of current techniques generally come before the creation of new ones? Is this an essential skill to develop as a mathematician or is there more to it than that?",tedastor,1h9cgjm,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h9cgjm/dealing_with_metatheory_in_research/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h9cgjm/dealing_with_metatheory_in_research/,2024-12-08 06:08:16,20,1.0,20,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9cgjm

math,Building Probabilistic Intuition and Working Towards Applied Knowledge of Random Flights and Rough Paths,"**Background**

I hold a B.S. in math and CS, and recently graduated with my M.S. in CS. My day job consists of writing code for monte carlo integration and importance sampling. 

I’m looking to continue some of my M.S. research in my spare time, and pursue some new directions that I didn’t have time to build the background for in grad school. This background lies specifically in the domain of short random walks, random flights, and the theory of rough paths. 

My (formal) experience consists of:

1. Undergraduate probability theory
2. First semester real analysis
3. The first half of Durrett’s *Essentials of Stochastic Processes*
4. Two graduate topics courses in probability theory, which very loosely followed Alon &amp; Spencer, Bollobas, and Winkler’s collections of puzzles. 

I stress that since I work on the applied side of things, I’m not looking to understand results in these domains well enough to prove them myself. So while I have my own understanding of things like the pushforward measure’s usage in my own contexts, I have not yet needed to truly understand or learn the definitions for a sigma algebra. 

**In summary**
1. Given my background, what resources should I use and how should I best approach learning about random flights and rough paths?
2. What other interesting resources are availible to further my intuition about probability, stochastic processes, and related domains?

* I have really not liked this course and I feel no desire to study for it. I don't understand why I feel so blah. The material is quite important and useful, but I think the material isn't particularly well-motivated, especially given that every method has been developed to solve a practical problem.
   * For example, I guess when we talk about Krylov subspace techniques, we could mention the motivation of projection methods is to efficiently solve very large sparse systems arising from finite element method.
* I don't understand why I feel so bored and unmotivated. I think it may have to do with the teaching structure, as my instructor was absent for several lectures and has been quite busy this semester. I felt really quite frustrated as I have other courses during office hours and the instructor was only able to meet during office hours, but I guess this is on par for the course for a graduate course.
* Normally I am quite happy to study in whatever spare time I have, but I feel like I've lost my passion and I struggle to want to study.
* I am constantly confused, also, and I am doing poorly in the course. It's a graduate course and I currently have a B; to me, that indicates a deficiency in my effort level and / or my understanding. Maybe my linear algebra background is too weak.

This semester, I applied to graduate school and I've been working on research projects, hence my mind was elsewhere for much of the semester. But I feel so frustrated and I am scared that I've lost my passion for math.

math,Feeling Lost in My Math Journey: Seeking Guidance to Reignite My Passion,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics (Honors) at the University of Delhi, and I’m in my 5th semester (third year). While it’s a decent university, the curriculum and academic environment aren’t exactly top-notch (although the professors are good). In my fourth year, we’ll focus on research, but right now, I’m struggling with what I want to do after graduation.

Here’s my story: I’ve always been passionate about mathematics and video editing (I’m a tech enthusiast). I’ve always wanted to change how people perceive and approach mathematics, especially inspired by 3blue1brown’s YouTube channel. The way he explains concepts so smoothly really resonated with me, and I thought, “I want to do something like that.”

However, I feel completely lost now. I shifted my focus from mathematics and started taking a lot of video editing courses. I didn’t attend many of my classes and, as a result, my GPA has dropped to 6.5. For the past semester, I’ve been trying to rekindle my love for math, for that I participated in a national level workshop about Numerical Optimisation  but I feel like I’m failing at it. As a Gen Z student, I’m constantly on social media, which doesn’t help in staying focused. I want to dive back into mathematics, but I’m not sure how to balance everything or even what my next steps should be.

I have no clear idea about my career path after this, and I feel stuck. I genuinely want to become great at mathematics again and eventually make a difference in how mathematics is taught and managed, especially in India, where things aren’t structured in the best way.

Any advice or thoughts on how to get back on track with my passion for math, manage my time better, and figure out my career direction would be greatly appreciated!

math,Groups -- and Generators without Closure?,"I'm doing a project in music theory, and it has unexpectedly veered into Group Theory. I have been reading about it and I get the gist of it, but some of the definitions are unclear. I don't have a definitive textbook on the subject. Can you help?

Take for example the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}, which describes all the tones in the 12-TET Chromatic scale. We also define the operator of ""addition modulo 12"". I know that it is a Group because it satisfies the criteria:

* Closure
* Associativity
* Identity Element (it is 0)
* Invertibility

And this set definitely has a Generator. The generator could be 1, 5, 7, or 11 -- all the numbers that are coprime with the modulo. I've read that this is a ""generator set"", ie {1,5,7,11} is the set of all generators.

A Group with a generator is called a ""cyclic group"". And I've also read the definition ""a cyclic group has a single generator element"". Well, my Group has multiple generators. I take this to mean that we're only using one generator at a time... we aren't finding members of the Group by applying 1 or 5 or 7 any way we wish. We pick one generator, use it to generate the set, then put it back when we're done.

Furthermore, this is a ""finite cyclic set"" because of the modulo. It doesn't go on forever down the yellow brick number line.

Another definition says ""a group is cyclic if there exists an 𝑎∈𝐺 such that every element of G is a power of a. By ""power of"" I assume that means a repeated application of the operator ""addition mod 12"". By this definition, the set {1,2,3,...,11} is cyclic.

So far that all makes sense, and... if I've made any mistakes please let me know and correct me!

OK Here's where things get a bit unclear for me, and where I think I might be wandering astray.

The Major Scale is represented by a set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}. We'll use the same operator ""addition mod 12"".

This isn't a Group! It fails the Closure condition -- because we can add 4 + 2 = 6, and 6 is not in the set. It passes Associativity and Identity. But then it fails on ""Inverses"".

And yet... in the Music Theory literature there is a lot of theorizing around Generators where the Major scale is used as an example. From any tone in the set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}, you can add (or subtract) 5 or 7 enough times to find every other member of the set. Those of you who have studied music and the ""circle of fifths"" know what I'm talking about here.

But wait, forget about subtracting. We can create a path for the generator 7 if we start on the 5 and end on 11. It just can't go any further than that. According to what I've read in Group Theory, generators can't be stopped like that, but in Music Theory, they can?

Does the Major Scale fulfil the criteria ""there exists an 𝑎∈𝐺 such that every element of G is a power of a""? It almost does, but it's more like a + x\^n not a\^n 

So what's the deal here? There are sets (with the addition mod 12 operator) that are not Groups, but they are cyclic, they have a Generator, Or at least, something that behaves like a Generator, but it can't be applied forever in both directions; there is a start and end to its generation pattern. Are there words for this that I haven't learned yet? Group-like things that have a Generator, but no Closure?

I'm writing this for an advanced academic audience so it's very important that I get all the words correct, and that I'm not glossing over the mathematical details with some vague hand-waving.

After the course ended, I realized how much happier I was during that semester. Math had completely occupied my mind—there wasn’t room for other worries to creep in. That struggle, that focus, made my brain feel calmer.

Now, I’ve decided to make math my “side quest” alongside medicine, and I feel incredibly satisfied about it. These days, I carry an abstract math book with me almost everywhere. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I’ll open it, read a few pages, and immerse myself in it. It’s like a reset button for my mind.

Currently, I’m enjoying a book on Galois Theory, and it’s been amazing  so far. I just wanted to share this experience and see if anyone else can relate. Do you also find joy in math as a way to calm your mind and bring clarity to your life?

math,"Justin Clarke-Doane | Mathematics, Reality, and Morality | The Cartesian Cafe with Timothy Nguyen","Justin Clarke-Doane is a professor of philosophy at Columbia University, whose interests span metaethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of logic &amp; mathematics.   
  
In this thought provoking-discussion, Justin and I go deep into topics that are typically neglected by most mathematicians and scientists, namely the philosophy of mathematics and morality. Justin has contributed to both these areas via his book Morality and Mathematics, which takes the view that the standard position of being both a mathematical realist and moral antirealist is incoherent. Perhaps the most novel aspect of Justin's work is the treatment of the philosophy of mathematics and morality side-by-side, showing how these two topics, which are usually thought of as being unrelated, in fact have strong analogies. Along the way, we discuss many other foundational topics in epistemology and ethics, with elements of set theory, metaphysics, and logic sprinkled in.

math,"People who do research in math, did you occasionally feel like the results you discover are embarassingly trivial?","I hope the title manages to adress the question I am asking. So I am currently working on some stuff in low dimensional topology, more precisely I try to characterise a specific set of simple closed curves on surfaces by using homological considerations that are eventually needed for proving the main theorem of my work.  
  
Without getting too much into details, I am studying the behaviour of certain loops on  surfaces and I just recently finally managed to pin it down and give a full characterisation of these elements I was trying to understand for quite some time. First I witnessed some patterns by doing a bit of combinatorial considerations and once I understood what happens, I started proving what I had witnessed. The following day I noticed that everything I proved essentially comes down to basic linear algebra and now my proof is literally a few lines of nothing than very elementary linear algebra. 

To be fair, it is not entirely obvious at first glance.  The result itself is still novel in the sense that it helps me eventually prove a much more significant statement but still, once I found the proof, it felt utterly trivial all of a sudden.

I will of course discuss my results with my supervisor who can immediately tell whether or not my results are useful, but am still interested in hearing some of your experiences. Have you ever had a similar experience or feeling?

math,Question about the Grigorchuk Group,"Hi, I'm currently reading this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607384) about the Grigorchuk Group and there is this proof I don't understand.

Lemma 7.1 says, every element g in G has all of its reduced decompositions of the same type (i), or of type (iv), or of mixed type (ii/iii).

The types are

* (i) a\*a\*...\*a
* (ii) a\*a\*...\*
* (iii) \*a\*...\*a
* (iv) \*a\*...\*

where every \* stands for one of the generators b, c or d.

The proof given in the paper is really short and honestly I don't understand it one bit. It goes like this:

The number of a's in a reduced decomposition of g is even iff. g stabilizes the vertices on the first level^(1). Thus g cannot have decomposition of type (i) and (iv) at the same time. (WHY?) The fact that decompositions of type (i) and (iv) have odd length, while those of type (ii) and (iii) have even length, implies the result.

If someone who is familiar with the Grigorchuck Group could explain this proof to me, that would be great :-)

math,Seeking Guidance: Niche in Mathematical Optimization/Programming in Finance ,"Hi there,

I am a master's student in Applied Mathematics specializing in Optimization, and I’m exploring research directions that combine mathematical programming with finance. Recently, while wandering through the library, I came across the book Optimization Methods in Finance by Gérard Cornuéjols and Reha Tütüncü. It captivated me with its focus on how different programming techniques (linear, integer, quadratic, etc.) can be applied to develop financial models.

From my understanding, the book is aimed at audiences in Computational Finance, MBA programs, and master’s courses in Finance. However, I’m particularly interested in exploring the mathematical backbone of these techniques, with a focus on deterministic programming methods rather than stochastic analysis.

To delve deeper, I checked the bibliography of the book and searched Google Scholar for related work. Surprisingly, I struggled to find a dedicated ""niche"" or group of researchers focusing exclusively on this intersection. It seems that relevant work is scattered across journals in Applied Mathematics, Finance, Optimization, and Operations Research.

So, I have a few questions for anyone working in this area or adjacent fields:

1. Why doesn’t mathematical programming in finance seem to have a dedicated niche or society, like stochastic analysis does?


2. Are deterministic programming techniques less useful compared to stochastic methods in finance, or is this a relatively newer area that hasn’t yet gained a strong foothold?


3. Can you recommend journals, conferences, or research groups that focus on applying mathematical programming (not stochastic methods) to financial problems?



I’m keen on developing a research direction that revolves around the mathematics behind such models, and understanding their practical applications. Any guidance, insights, or resources would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

math,"The sequence converges to zero, but its infinite sum diverges.","We learn early on that just because a sum converges to zero doesn’t mean its infinite series converges. Case in point, the harmonic series a_n = 1/n. But how often does this actually happen? Shortly after learning this fact, we learn that the infinite series for a_n = 1/n^p converges for all p &gt; 1.

 For example extending this to 3-dimensions the numbers would appear in a 3-dimensional  arrangement(probably shouldn’t call it an array since that suggests 2-dimensions.) For 3-dimensions, you can interpret as a sequence of matrices extending vertically in the z-directions. Higher dimensions than 3 though would not come so easily for a visual interpretation.

math,Is there a standard for classifying circular permutations? Either by complexity or some other metric,"So this ""problem"" has been on my mind and I feel like the concept probably has been explored, but I am having trouble finding literature on it or the right term to google.

Say you have a set made up of elements with a known order (e.g. 10 integers).

And say that we can define a known order for this set, for example lets call the ""base"" circular permutation is is just N mod 9 in order so 0-&gt;1...-&gt;8

We know there are (N-1)! unique circular permutations. Some of them will be ""similar"" to the base circular permutation. For example,  (0,1,2,6,7,8,3,4,5) would be largely ""similar"" to the base permutation, but has two points where it jumps to other part of the the base cycle. On the other hand, (1, 8, 3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 0, 5) seems completely random form the base permutation.

Is there a known / standard way to quantify / sort all the permutations, based on how similar they are to known ordered ""base"" circular permutation?

math,"Road to mathematical rigor, where from here?","I am at a bit of an impasse. My interest in math bloomed a bit later than it does for most kids, and while I consider that both a good and a bad thing, it has left me in a bit of a pickle.

I am in my Senior year of high school, and became ""very good"" at math only in my junior year. Now my interests have grown exponentially, and quite beyond the school curriculum. 

I have done a lot of self study, currently doing differentials (I'm trying to get a good math basis for quantum physics which is very diff-e and vector heavy). I am considered very advanced by my peers and teachers, but I don't feel like it, and I think I know the reason why.

Because I've been trying to ""catch up"" to the truly talented kids for the past 6 months, I feel like I have a good grasp on the advanced concepts I've learned myself but lack the rigorous ability to do the basic stuff.

What I mean by this is, when I do the algebra portion of a problem, like let's say an integral was already set up, all the calculus was done, and now it's only 10th grade algebra that's left, there is a 50/50 chance I'll do it right the first time and then another 50/50 chance of me spotting the error (if the solution *feels* really wrong I usually find it, and it's something insane every time). I feel like the really talented math kids who've been doing math rigorously from like age 6 have this down to muscle memory.

To make a comparison to another hobby of mine, I feel like they are really good at writing prose while I'm very good at structuring a story. The issue is, a good structure with poor prose will give you a story no one will read.

I don't know where to go from here. I feel very concentrated while doing the ""hard parts"" of a problem and then my head feels full of cotton while I'm doing basic computations. I make errors that are both ludicrous and invisible to me, for example:

Let's say we have a function f(x) = (x^2)/(x^2-x),

This function is defined if x^2-x ≠ 0

After some basic computing we get the penultimate step:

x ≠ 0

x - 1 ≠ 0

And then I'll write

x ≠ 0
x ≠ **-1**

And I guarantee you I will not spot that error. It will sabotage the entire problem, whatever might come after it, and I won't notice it unless I redo the whole thing again.

I don't know what to do. This is just not good enough, but I don't know how to fix it. I've done probably hundreds and hundreds of practice problems and the same algebra mistakes are ruining me. It has gotten to the point where I never feel confident in my calculations, nor believe I have what it takes to be truly good at math. It's like I lack some mathematical intuition that really talented people have.

I've been feeling rather demotivated because of this, specifically because I can't trust myself and my own ability. If I could at least trust that and only have missing knowledge, I'd be excited to learn. The way things are I just feel useless as a mathematician and I have no plan on how this might be resolved.",zZEpicSniper303Zz,1h6ch6h,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,2024-12-04 09:50:20,10,0.67,10,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6ch6h

Today the students were filling out their course evaluations and I was also doing some reflecting on how things went.

math,Triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°,"I would like to share a fun exercise that I came up with.

I was thinking about which points on a square grid have integer distance, and the answer is obviously given by Pythagorean triples, which can be generated by the famous Euclid's formula. Then I wondered: What about a triangular (or hexagonal) grid? There, the possible integer distances are given by the triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°. If the sides are a, b, c, and the 120° angle is between a and b, then they satisfy a² + b² + ab = c² (by the law of cosines).

Then I wondered if I could come up with the analogous of Euclid's formula for this class of triangles, and I found that, if m and n are two integers with m &lt; n, then the triple (a, b, c) where

a = n² - m²

b = 2mn + m²

c = m² + n² + mn

satisfies our condition. Moreover, it is not difficult to prove that if m and n are coprime and not congruent modulo 3, then the triple is primitive (i.e., GCD(a,b,c) = 1). It can also be shown that all primitive triples can be obtained by this formula.

That's it, I just wanted to share this fun little exercise in number theory. I also wonder if this formula already has a name. I am not aware of it, but probably someone knows better than me.

math,Is there any intuition behind results in stochastic processes?,"I'm taking a class on probability theory and stochastic processes. So far I've been able to follow all the technical arguments but I've been uncomfortable because I can't build an intuition on any of the results.

For example the Ito integral is an L2 limit of simple processes using a subsequence argument. Since this integral isn't defined pathwise this integral clearly isn't an area of any kind so I have no idea what the random variable that is the Ito integral even represents. 

Another example is Ito's lemma. Again the quadratic variation means the ""stochastic chain rule"" has an extra term (the second derivative) compared to the ordinary chain rule but is there any intuition why it should be 1/2 the second derivative? You can make some sort of argument using Taylor series but we're able to motivate the ordinary chain rule without resorting to any expansions so this seems like a bit of a stretch. 

Stochastic differential equations are another example. A non-random ODE or PDE clearly describes the rate of change of different functions.

math,Notion of a standardized curvature?,"It’s been a while since I studied this in undergrad so apologies for the lack of rigor and specificity.

When I was in Calc 3, I remember learning about curvature, and I believe it was denoted with “k”. We were taught that a small circle was more curvy, than a larger circle with a larger radius.

I understood at the time, why this was defined as such, **however** I felt like there should also be some notion of curvature that is standardized for the shape of the closed shape.

So that all circles have the same shape regardless of size, but we could still compare the curvature of shapes, i.e. a circle is more curvy than a triangle.

In the same way that Usain Bolt can run really fast for his size, but a Giant 50ft troll running at 30mph would be quite average, if not slow.

math,Looking for Seminar Topic Ideas in Functional Analysis with Connections to Probability and Ergodic Theory,"Hi everyone!

I’m currently taking a course in functional analysis, and for the oral exam, I need to present a 20-minute seminar on a topic related to the course. The topic should not overlap with the material already covered but still stay within the realm of functional analysis.

Some of the main areas we’ve covered include:

• Normed and Banach spaces, linear operators, and dual spaces.

• Hilbert spaces and orthogonal projections.

• Hahn-Banach theorem, topologies (weak, weak*), and convexity.

• Spectral theory for bounded operators and compact operators.

• Elements of distribution theory and spaces of sequences.

I’m particularly interested in topics that connect functional analysis to probability theory or ergodic theory, as these are fields I’d like to explore further.

Do you have any suggestions for seminar topics that fit these criteria?

math,How can I know my math problem/research is novel?,"I'm now doing math research on a probability theory question I came up with. Note that I'm an undergraduate, and the problem and my approaches aren't that deep.  
First, I googled to see if somebody had already addressed it but found nothing. So I started thinking about it and made some progress. Now I wish to develop the results more and eventually write a paper, but I suddenly began to fear: *what if somebody has already written a paper on this?*

So my question is, as in the title: how can we know if a certain math problem/research is novel?

If the problem is very deep so that it lies on the frontier of mathematical knowledge, the researcher can easily confirm its novelty by checking recent papers or asking experts in the specific field. However, if the problem isn't that deep and isn't a significant puzzle in the landscape of mathematics, it becomes much harder to determine novelty. Experts in the field might not know about it due to its minority. Googling requires the correct terminology, and since possible terminologies are so broad mainly due to various notations, failing to find anything doesn't guarantee the problem is new. Posting the problem online and asking if anyone knows about it can be one approach (which I actually tried on Stack Exchange and got nothing but a few downvotes). But there’s still the possibility that some random guy in 1940s addressed it and published it in a minor journal.

math,How monstrously long papers are made?,"Following the steps of a recent discussion in the community, I have read a Wiki page on the Feit–Thompson theorem. There I found the following:

*The final paper is 255 pages long. &lt;...&gt;*

*Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the proof was its length: before the Feit–Thompson paper, few arguments in group theory were more than a few pages long and most could be read in a day. Once group theorists realized that such long arguments could work, a series of papers that were several hundred pages long started to appear. Some of these dwarfed even the Feit–Thompson paper; the paper by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen D. Smith on quasithin groups was 1,221 pages long.*

How do authors come up with such long proofs? I don't believe there are brilliant insights every few pages. If there were, these gigantic papers would be valued as high as FLT proof, but they are not. I imagine there should be some machinery that produces arguments more or less mechanically, but still,  these arguments are not so standard that they could be just omitted from the paper.

But that's just my guess. If it is true, what does this machinery look like? If it is not, how are behemoth-long proofs actually made?

math,"In the Yoneda Lemma, in what ways can Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) fail to be naturally isomorphic? How do such failures correspond to failures in C and D being isomorphic?","The paragraph below is from [https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/](https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/) , who posted four years ago in ""Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?"", [https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is\_it\_normal\_to\_be\_struggling\_to\_get\_the\_yoneda/](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is_it_normal_to_be_struggling_to_get_the_yoneda/) . The post is archived, unfortunately, which means I can't discuss it with the original discussants. But the paragraph says exactly what I want to start from. To go further, I want to ask: in what way can Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) fail to be naturally isomorphic, and how do such failures correspond to failure in C and D being isomorphic?

&gt;One way to appreciate the Yoneda lemma is through its corollaries. There's one particular special case which I find particularly enlightening: the Yoneda embedding. The idea is that we can think of an object C as being represented by a hom functor Hom(C,-), i. e. by all its relations to other objects in the category (in the form of arrows from C). Then, an arrow from C to D corresponds exactly to a natural transformation between the corresponding hom functors (this is because the Yoneda embedding is fully faithful, courtesy of the Yoneda lemma). In particular, if Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) are naturally isomorphic then C and D are isomorphic, which essentially justifies the ""it's the arrows that are important"" perspective of category theory. Note that we could just as well look at Hom(-,C) instead of Hom(C,-).

I've never seen this discussed, but is there a concept of ""C and D are isomorphic except for these cases""? Of, as it were, defects or deformations in isomorphism? As a programmer, I find it natural (sorry!) to study such points of failure. If I could do so for Yoneda, I think it would be enlightening. Because it's easy to see how a natural transformation can fail. Some components may not be there. But what kind of damage does that do to the wanna-be isomorphism arrows between C and D?

By the way, I attach a picture of a category with objects C and D in, also X, X', X'', etc. It also shows the functors Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-), with just visible hom-sets indicating their effect on some of the X's, and a natural transformation. Maybe someone can see how to complete it to make the source of C and D's isomorphism obvious.

math,Quaternion double-cover of SO(3),"It’s clear to me why the quaternion rotation formula works. The exps commute through the parallel component, cancelling and leaving it unchanged, but they anticommute with the orthogonal part, each performing a half-rotation. And we use exp because exp of a 90-degree rotation (e.g. all unit pure quaternions) generates all rotations.

What doesn’t make sense to me is how this relates to the double-covering of SO(3) by Spin(3). I understand algebraically that the sign of the quaternion cancels in the rotation formula. I also understand that the theta/2 in the quaternion rotation formula requires you to take a 720deg path around Spin(3) to make a full loop. But I don’t understand what’s really special about a full 720deg walk. So what if we need that to take a loop around Spin(3)? What makes Spin(3) a truer group of rotations than SO(3)? I know it’s the universal cover, but why is that relevant in this case?

And of course, there’s Dirac’s belt trick. I “get” what’s going on there, but I fail to see the significance of it.

math,"Looking for references on ""coproduct"" of random variables","I'm trying to find what a concept is called and references to learn more about it. My best guess is to call it a coproduct of random variables, but this leads nowhere.

---

Here's a description (handwaving measure theory to keep things short):

Given two random variables x : Ω → S\_x and y : Ω → S\_y, we can form the joint random variable (x,y) : Ω → S\_x × S\_y by taking (x,y)(ω) = (x(ω), y(ω)). This is a product in the category of random variables over (Ω, Σ, μ). This raises the question: is there a coproduct?

Yes, there is. We can prove its existence using Zorn's lemma or explicitly construct it by taking the coequaliser of the maps x : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y and y : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y, i.e. the random variable x∨y : Ω → E, where E = S\_x ∪ S\_y / ~ and ~ is the smallest relation such that x(ω) ~ y(ω) for all ω.

Another characterisation of this object is that the sub-σ-algebra of Σ induced by (x∨y)^(-1) is the intersection of the sub-σ-algebras induced by x^(-1) and y^(-1).

math,A simple but powerful map ban format for 2-player random queue games,"I have no idea what the right subreddit for this is but I wanted to share it since I feel like it might be interesting and/or useful.

**For a short description of the problem:** You are hosting a random matchmaking queue for a game where two players face off on one of multiple possible maps. Most players don't want to learn every map, so you offer map bans. But you still want to ensure that any two players will be able to find a map that neither of them has banned. What is a good way to allow your average joe to ban as many maps as possible without making things feel too complicated or too restrictive?

The format that is typically used in games (e.g. AoE2) asymptotes at a map pool size of `2n` maps if each player has to leave `n` maps unbanned.

My previously favourite format asymptotes at `4n` maps for `n` unbanned.

This new format that I just found asymptotes at `n²/2` maps for `n` unbanned.

I think the theoretical limit (Fano plane anyone) is somewhere between `n²/2` and `n²` but it seems way too unwieldy and restrictive to make that into a user-friendly system.

**So here's my new system:**

1. Arrange the available maps into a grid of `x*y` maps, where `x` is odd.
2. Any given player must select one of the `x` columns as their ""home column"". They can't ban any maps in their home column.
3. The player may then ban most of the maps in the other columns, except that every *second* column (starting from the home column and looping around) must have at least one map not banned.

If these rules are followed, three scenarios can happen when attempting to match two random players A and B:

**a)** Both players have selected the same column. In this case, any map from that column can be randomly selected and played (fully random, or prioritizing favourited maps, or something else, we don't need to care).

**b)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an odd column. Then player A has left open one of the maps in player B's home column, so that map can be played.

**c)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an even column. Then player B has left open one of the maps in player A's home column, so that map can be played.

**Example:** There are `5x4` maps in the pool (picture 1).

    A B C D E        - B - D -        - - - - E
    F G H I J        - G - - -        - G - - J
    K L M N O        K L - - -        - - - N O
    P Q R S T        - Q - - -        - - - - T

Player A's bans leave open the maps in picture 2. Player B's bans leave open the maps in picture 3.

Both players have left map **G** open, so map **G** will be played.

**EDIT:** As pointed out by u/mfb- and u/bartekltg, this system comes at the cost of reducing player choice, e.g. a grid of size `5x3` only gives the player `5*3*3=45` ways to leave 5 maps open, while a basic system with 9 maps and 4 independent bans offers `(9 choose 4) = 126` options.

By a different metric, however, grid sizes of `2k-1*k; n=2k-1` and `2k+1*k; n=2k` (with `n` maps left open) are optimal:

*There are* `n-1` *arbitrary bans; that is, for any set of* `n-1` *desired bans, a ban configuration banning all of them exists.*

**Proof:** Let `B` be a set of `n-1` desired bans. Since there are more than half as many rows as desired bans, at most one column can consist only of desired bans.

Case 1: No fully undesired column. Since there are more than `n-1` columns, at least one column remains without a desired ban. This column can be the home column, and by the case assumption, all other desired bans can be dodged.

Case 2: Exactly 1 fully undesired column. This uses up k desired bans, and the undesired column can be fully dodged by half of the other possible home columns. So in the `2k-1*k` case, there are `k-1` columns and `k-2` desired bans remaining, whereas in the `2k+1*k` case, there are `k` columns and `k-1` desired bans remaining. By pigeonhole, we can designate a home column with no desired bans from this set, and once again dodge all other desired bans.",Iwer_Sonsch,1h3dze9,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,2024-11-30 14:43:19,49,0.9,49,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h3dze9
math,More in-depth reference for matrix calculus,"There are a number of threads on this subreddit and others asking for resources for matrix calculus. There isn't much attention given to differentiating with respect to matrices. For example, there's not much of this in The Matrix Cookbook. I'm looking for this sort of info (all in numerator layout as that's what I need to use):

* $\frac{\partial (Mx+b)}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)} = x^T \otimes I$. This one I can at least get out of https://www.matrixcalculus.org
* $\frac{\partial f(Mx+b)}{\partial M} = x f'$. (This was not on Wikipedia until I added it recently.)
* This attempt to relate $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial M}$, which is a monstrosity in numerator layout: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)} = \left( \mathrm{vec} \left(\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial M}\right)^T \right) \right)^\top$
* If $dv = M\mathrm{vec}(N)$, then $\frac{\partial v}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(N)} = M$

I'm working on a problem involving subsets of R3 and I'm trying to figure out how to determine if one set is contained inside another.

I've tried numerical methods (using integrals) and visualization, and it seems to be the case that the first set is contained into the second.

math,Inductive definition of a set.,"I am a computer science student and have studied basic discrete maths, including set theory. I was pacing across some questions when I came across this one. It seems like the standard way of defining a set inductively. A basis clause stating that certain elements are in the set, and an inductive clause which states that if x is in the set, y is also in the set. 

  
Now the problem that I have with this definition is that for many objects, it does not specify if they are in the set or not (which are not taken into account in both of the clauses). For example in this question, I cannot tell if b is in L or not. According to me, a good definition of a set should be able to define for every object in the universe of discourse, that it belongs to the set or not. The answer here, also completely depends on this assumption. My question is, am I missing something in the way sets are defined inductively, or the question is just vague and poorly framed, or the inductive definition of sets is incomplete and there are better ways to define a set?

I'd be happy to provide any clarifications in my post. TY

I am a mathematics student with interests in Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and theoretical aspects of Physics. Recently, I’ve been exploring Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS), and I’m fascinated by its deep connections to Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, and String Theory.

I would like to ask for guidance on the following:

1. Roadmap: What is a good progression of topics or prerequisites to study before diving into HMS? For example, how much familiarity with Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, or Category Theory is required?


2. References: Could you recommend foundational textbooks, lecture notes, or papers that introduce HMS in an accessible way? Are there any must-read works by Kontsevich or others to understand the origins and formalism of the conjecture?


3. History: I’m interested in the development of HMS. How did it emerge historically from Mirror Symmetry in Physics, and what are the most significant milestones in its mathematical formulation?


4. Applications and Extensions: Where is HMS actively being applied or extended in current research? Are there particular areas or open problems that are especially exciting?



I’d love to hear from those who have studied or worked with HMS. Any advice or insights into this beautiful theory would be greatly appreciated!

For measure theory, I have glanced at (1) Capinski and Kopp's book (2) Rene Schilling's book and (3) David William's book. They don't seem as dense as Billingsley's book. But many people seem to opine that Billingsley is a must read. 

I hope this is not a redundant post. I did google search for alternatives to Billingsley's book but could not find it. All I found was a plethora of book recommendations but not specifically as an alternative to Billingsley's book. Hence this post.

Morphisms of algebras, valuations, ideals, maximals and primes, quotient algebras, localization, and Stone's representation theorem.

He keeps rambling about prime ideals being points in some space, and how every boolean algebra is actually a topology in some space, given by the zeroes of valuations...

All of this screams commutative algebra to me (Although I won't take it until next year). Is is this what is usually taught??

I found the recurrence relation b_k =1/a (a_k-(k+1)b_(k+1)) to figure out the integral a little bit faster but unless i can point to a known theorem, i would have to prove it each time i want to use it which would destroy all the time savings.

math,I’ve been reading Max Tegmark’s book “Our Mathematical Universe” which argues convincingly that we’re living in some vast mathematical structure that somehow acts as a real-life model of itself…,"This seems to render the much-reviled simulation argument moot, because it’s like we drop all pretence that it was ever anything other than a simulation in the first place. 

But anyway my question: what structure could it be?

For this I think we have to call in the model theorists.

From my limited understanding of the subject, perhaps we’re looking for a countable structure (or maybe with the cardinal it the reals?) which is homogeneous, saturated - perhaps some kind of Fraïssé limit which also has a universal interpretability quality?

A countable structure able to interpret any other countable structure, and perhaps with additional saturation properties, would be nice - bonus points if it’s locally finite. 

If one framed a rigorous definition, it seems possible that there are many structures with these properties, and one could then reasonably ask for the simplest or most easily defined.

math,Can We Define 'Understanding' Between Systems Mathematically?,"Hello,

Is it possible to mathematically formalize the concept of one system ""understanding"" another? If so, are there any studies or theories that have explored this topic? I would be grateful if you could point me to any relevant work or ideas.

This question stems from the following motivations:

* By formalizing ""understanding"" between systems, I aim to identify subsets such as ""natural language"" and ""mathematical language,"" with the ultimate goal of exploring the limits of human intelligence.
* I believe that by turning the concept of ""understanding"" inward, we may gain insights into the possibility of understanding consciousness itself.
* Ideally, such a formalization would be applicable to human brains or intelligence in a relatively straightforward manner.

More specifically, I am interested in topics such as:

* Mathematical studies on ""understanding"" or ""correspondence"" between systems.
* Applications of information theory, model theory, or type theory to this concept.
* Research on abstract definitions of ""understanding"" in cognitive science or artificial intelligence.

Any suggestions, references, or insights would be greatly appreciated.

I am reading section 4.2 of Stein and Shakarchi's *Complex Analysis*, where the Schwarz-Christoffel integral is defined as in the image, where A1&lt;...&lt;An and all the beta's are in (0,1) and their sum is &lt;=2. The powers are defined using the branch of log which is defined everywhere except the nonpositive imaginary axis. We define a\_k=S(A\_k) for all k and define a\_∞=S(∞).

In the proof that this integral maps the upper-half plane into the polygon with vertices a1,...,a\_n,a\_∞, they note that S′(x) is real and positive when x&gt;A\_n.

I believe this should mean that when x travels from A\_n to ∞, S(x) should travel in a straight line parallel to the real axis, from left to right. Hence a\_n should be directly left of a\_∞.

However, the image shows what the textbook has drawn.

In the picture, when Σβk=2, a\_1 is to the left of a\_∞ which is to the left of a\_n. But it seems to me this should all be the other way around.

Even worse is the case when Σβk&lt;2, when the line between a\_∞ and a\_n is not even horizontal.

As well, a\_∞ is depicted as being at the top of the shape in these images, but I believe it should really be at the bottom (ie: it should have a smaller imaginary component). Since the line between a\_{n−1} and a\_n is at angle −πβn with the real axis, hence it ""points"" downwards, so a\_{n-1} is above a\_n.

So from my understanding, the polygon should have a flat bottom between points a\_n and a\_∞, where a\_n is to the left of a\_∞. And the rest of the points should be put counterclockwise around the polygon. But this is not what the picture in Stein and Shakarchi depicts, so I'm wondering if I have done something wrong.

Please let me know if my understanding is correct or if I have made a mistake somewhere.

math,I think the formal definition of a limit in Walter Rudin’s Real Analysis text has an unexpected consequence,"This is the second of two definitions of a limit given in Walter Rudin’s *Principles of Mathematical Analysis,” which I understand to be a reliable reference text for analysis. The first definition comes before the introduction of the extended real numbers and, crucially, requires that the point A at which the limit is taken be a limit point of the domain. To cut to the chase I think this second definition allows for the following:

&gt; Let f: E = (0, 4) -&gt; R be defined by f(x)=x. Then f(t) approaches 4 as t -&gt; 5.

Given a neighborhood U of 4 in the codomain, U contains an open interval (4-e, 4+e) for some e&gt;0.
Now let us define a neighborhood of 5 in R which need not be a subset of the domain E. Let V = (4 - e, 5 + e).

We have thus met the required conditions for V: 
- V \cap E is nonempty; the intersection is (4-e, 4).
- On this intersection, we have 4-e &lt; f(t) &lt; 4+e, that is to say f(t) is in U, for every t in V \cap E

Is this an intentional consequence? If so I am curious to hear any perspective that might contextualize this property in a broader or more general topological framing.

Is it unintuitive but nevertheless appropriate because of the nature of the extended reals?

Or is it a typo of some kind that is resolved in other texts?

Or am I misunderstanding something?

I noticed the operators on Hilbert spaces have a very similar definition to L\^p spaces and measurable functions. For example the equivalent of an L\^1 norm for operators is the trace class norm, the equivalent of the L\^2 norm is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, and the equivalent of the L\^infinity norm is the operator norm. Is this a coincidence or is there some big picture behind these operator norms similar to the L\^p space idea I gave above? What are these norms tell us about the operator as p increases?

math,"Strange Feature of the Finite Projective Plane PG(2,3)","I was playing with finite projective planes and stumbled across a phenomenon that surprised me. I've thought about it a bit, but cannot explain why it should be so.

Consider PG(2,3), the two-dimensional finite projective plane over GF(3). If we assign a numerical label to each of the thirteen points in the space then we can describe each line in the space by which points it contains. Each line contains four points, so each line can be written as a 4-tuple. So, we can characterize the thirteen lines in PG(2,3) as a 13x4 array. One example of doing so might be (taken from the La Jolla Covering Repository Tables):

|Point A|Point B|Point C|Point D|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3|5|11|
|3|4|6|12|
|4|5|7|13|
|1|5|6|8|
|2|6|7|9|
|3|7|8|10|
|4|8|9|11|
|5|9|10|12|
|6|10|11|13|
|1|7|11|12|
|2|8|12|13|
|1|3|9|13|
|1|2|4|10|

Since these labels are arbitrary, we can permute them however we want and get an equivalent description of the space.

I wondered, is there some permutation of these labels that is ""nice"" in the sense that the row sums of the corresponding array representation of the space are all equal? I've convinced myself that the answer is ""no"", but it looks like something stronger is true.

Clearly, permuting the labels won't affect the *mean* of the row sums of the array. What is surprising (to me anyway), is the fact that permuting the labels also won't affect the *variance* of the row sums of the array. No matter how you shuffle the labels, the variance of the row sums is always 42.

For example, in the array above, the row sums are \[21, 25, 29, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 31, 35, 26, 17\].

If we swap all of the 1s and 13s, however, the row sums are \[21, 25, 17, 32, 24, 28, 32, 36, 28, 43, 23, 26, 29\]

These are different multisets (notice, for example, that the second has a 43 as an element but the first does not), but both have a variance of 42.

What's going on here? It seems clear that there's something about the underlying symmetry of PG(2,3) that's is causing this, but I can't for the life of me see what could be causing the variance of the row sums to be invariant when permuting the point labels.",shdgctbei,1gy94bn,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,2024-11-23 20:33:09,19,0.92,19,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gy94bn

math,Struggling with Discrete Math Teaching Methods at My College—Is This Normal?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently taking a Discrete Math course at my college, and I’m finding the way it’s taught incredibly frustrating and borderline incomprehensible. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar or has advice for dealing with it.

Here’s what’s happening: the materials we’re given—lecture notes and problem sets—are filled with references to other questions, sentences, or formulas scattered across 400+ pages. For example, I’ll be trying to follow a proof, and it’ll say something like “According to question 28c” or “As per sentence 1.24 and question 14k.”

The problem is, I’m expected to use these earlier questions or sentences to understand the current proof, but I’m struggling to keep track of where everything is or how it all connects. If I didn’t understand question 28c, how am I supposed to use it to build a new proof? It feels like I’m being asked to construct something complex without being given a proper foundation.

I’ve talked to friends who study at other colleges, and their Discrete Math courses seem much more straightforward. They get proofs written out step-by-step in a clear way, without having to constantly refer to random questions or pages. Meanwhile, my course feels like a maze of scattered information, and it’s making me doubt my abilities.

I understand that math requires rigor and effort, but this approach feels unnecessarily convoluted. I don’t know if it’s meant to encourage independence or what, but it’s honestly just overwhelming and frustrating.

Does anyone else’s school teach Discrete Math like this? How do you deal with such a fragmented way of learning? Are there any resources or strategies you’d recommend for surviving this kind of course?

Thanks for reading—I’d really appreciate any advice or insight.

math,Could the decentralized web transform math research as Terry imagined?,"**Background**

* Terry Tao launched a project for decentralized math research where anyone can contribute a piece of progress to a math problem. See his [blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/).
* Bluesky, a social media platform, is building a protocol for decentralized communication. User's data, including content and followers, is reachable from multiple interfaces. If a user does not like the policy of a platform interface, it can move to another one with her followers and content. See their [blog post](https://bsky.social/about/faq).

**Ambition.** Bluesky aims to let anyone use their decentralized protocol and build new platforms, with a genuine access to all users content and data. Researchers and entrepreneurs may innovate interaction mechanisms, beyond for-profit prediction AI that aims to manipulate people and waste their time for advertisement.

**Discussion**

* If we took the stance of Terry Tao, and started to think of collaborative mechanisms for a new kind of math research, Would the new aspired wave of decentralized internet take place?
* In the same way the internet allowed anyone to learn from [Timothy](https://bsky.app/profile/wtgowers.bsky.social), Could a community-centered collaborative mechanism lead to a better interactive experience?",xTouny,1gwc3nx,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gwc3nx/could_the_decentralized_web_transform_math/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gwc3nx/could_the_decentralized_web_transform_math/,2024-11-21 09:06:31,66,0.82,66,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gwc3nx

The cases I was seeing are: (P + P) + Q = P + (P + Q) and (P + P) + (P + P) =  P + (P + (P + P)).  I tried to do this by trying to compare the x and y coordinates through transformations, for example, the point (P + P) + Q = (x1, y1)

where x1 = a² - xpp - xq, with ""a"" being the angular coefficient. The same would be done with P + (P + Q) = (x2, y2) . So, after expanding these equations until there were only variables xp and xq, I would compare them (the same would be done with y1 and y2), but I couldn't, maybe out of laziness, maybe out of stupidity, but the equations were too big to handle. make it inviable to do these calculations. I think it would be possible to use auxiliary variables but I don't know exactly what would be the best way to do this. Anyway, if anyone could help me complete my demonstration or show a better way to do it I would be grateful.",Advanced-Put3229,1gvxwzu,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gvxwzu/help_in_demonstration/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gvxwzu/help_in_demonstration/,2024-11-20 19:29:28,1,0.6,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gvxwzu
math,Is Lowenheim-Skolem just an artifact of the formalism?,"
People here, and on various math blogs,  love to point out the existence of countable models of ZFC. Seems like at least once a week, and this is stated like it has profound implications. Conclusions like ""uncountable sets are an illusion,"" ""God could count the reals,"" or ""we might live in a model where every set is countable"" are common.

But Cantor's argument shows, in a very generic way, whenever we conceive of a collection and its subcollections, there can be no one-to-one correspondence between them. The proof doesn't rely on any controversial axioms of a specific set theory. It's a basic consequence of a very general idea.

And sure, when formally studying models of a first-order set theory, some are countable from the metatheory. It's like making maps of the world. On any given map, South America will be larger than Europe, because it's larger in real life so we make maps that reflect that fact. But South America on one map might be smaller than Europe on a different map (because the whole map is smaller).

But *so what?* Why would you compare objects across models like that? It's common for diagonal arguments to relativize in this way. The halting problem: a Turing machine can't decide it's own halting, but there's always an oracle machine that can. Or the second incompleteness theorem: a theory can't prove itself consistent, but there's always a stronger theory that can.

Yet no one ever says ""incompleteness is an illusion"" or ""we might live in a model where every problem is decidable."" The fundamental ideas are reflected *within each level*, and comparisons across levels don't seem particularly important.

In physics, we encounter ""artifacts of the formalism"" sometimes. Like tachyons in special relativity, closed timelike curves in general relativity, or zero-point energy in quantum fields. Extra stuff that shows up in the math but generally isn't thought to be physically relevant.

Can we say the same about *mathematical* phenomena sometimes? Lowenheim-Skolem seems like a pretty good candidate. While the core idea behind |P(N)| &gt; |N| is reflected (in some form) in each of the models of the set theories we use, the existence of countable models feels like a technical limitation of formal systems, similar to the various paradoxes that ensue when you have to use logic to talk about logic. 

Thoughts? I'm sure there are some formalists here who disagree.

math,Pursuing master in Applied statistics in 2025? Need advices as international student,"Hey everyone,

I’m an international student considering pursuing a Master’s in Applied Statistics to break into the analytics field. The challenge is that my background isn’t in math or STEM (I studied International Business), so I’d need about 2 years to study Calculus 1-3 and Linear Algebra just to meet the prerequisites.

I’m drawn to analytics because of the opportunities in fields like data science, finance, and tech, but I’m questioning whether this is the best path for someone in my position. Some programs seem highly technical, and I’m wondering if the effort and time would be worth it in the long run.

A few questions I’d love advice on:
	1.	Is a Master’s in Statistics a good way to pivot into analytics, or should I consider other degrees (e.g., Data Science, Business Analytics)?
	2.	Would spending 2+ years preparing for the program and then 2 years in the program itself be worth the time and money investment?
	3.	Are there any alternative ways to break into analytics in the U.S without committing to a full master’s program?

math,When to start this Coin Flipping Game over?,"I was thinking about the following problem. Take a game where you have a fixed number of flips f and a prerequisite number of heads h you need to win.

You can start the game anew whenever you like, your headcount get's reset and you get the same number of flips again.

The goal is to win the game as soon as possible so in the least amount of total flips. When is the probability to win the ongoing game low enough that you expect to win earlier by restarting and forfitting the flips you already did.

Let's say it's 100 Flips and you need 80 heads to win. I'd wager that if you flipped 30 times and got only 15 heads you're better off to start over, since getting 75/80 heads is too unlikely and you may hope for a better Start.

I tried some calculations, but my stochastic is very rusty. I though about this in the context of speedrunning a RNG heavy game, when is the run so bad, that you shouldn't waste your time playing it out - I thought this coin flipping game breaks this down to the most basic case?

math,Anything interesting about 20990?,"Hey r/math! I've got a bit of a silly project here, but it gave me sleepless nights nonetheless:

Probably you have heard of the Interesting number paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting\_number\_paradox) which states that every integer is in some way ""interesting"".

So I started digging for the smallest uninteresting integer. First I looked for facts on Wikipedia. On [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_(number)) of numbers, the 2040 seems to be the smallest integer, that is not listed.

So on the search for properties of the 2040, I went to the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org) and found almost every number I was interested in, was somewhere in their database. So I wrote a small python script that searched the OEIS for numbers, to find the smallest integer that is not on there.

It is the 20067. Of course I was not the first one to discover this. Googleing the number, I came across [this blog post](https://benwiederhake.github.io/oeis-funfacts/) by Ben Wiederhake with fun facts about the OEIS, including the 20067.

I am willing to accept that being the smallest integer not in the database of the OEIS *is* in itself an interesting fact about the 20067. Even though the number is not actually that boring. For example it's semi-prime!

So the second smallest integer not in the OEIS is the 20990. I haven't found anything interesting about it so far.

\- It's factorization is  2 \* 5 \* 2099  
\- It is unhappy  
\- It is deficient

I haven't got any good ideas on how to discover interesting properties about numbers. So far I've got just by going through online databases and now I'm a bit stuck. Almost went out to make some sort of crazy piece of art with the 20990 in it...

Maybe someone here got an idea on how to study a number for it's hidden special properties. I'd be very grateful for any help, thank you in advance! :)

math,"Examples where ""taking a step backwards"" is helpful","For a project I'm looking for examples in math where it's useful to ""take a step backwards.""

Computation example: the distributive law $a(b+c) = ab + ac$, which we can interpret as a pair of rewrite rules. If we assume that distributing $a(b+c)$ -&gt; $ab + ac$ is the forward direction [1], then factoring is running the distributive law backwards. Factoring is obviously incredibly useful, e.g. in finding closed forms for (convergent) geometric series, or finding roots to polynomials.

Proof-based example: [sometimes it's easier to prove a stronger statement than a weaker statement.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1007256/examples-where-it-is-easier-to-prove-more-than-less) Considering statements / theorems as vertices in a directed graph, where a forward [2] edge from A to B means ""A implies B"", deciding to prove a stronger statement is taking a step backwards in this graph. 

What are some more examples of ""taking a step backwards?"" Computational / algebraic tricks would be the most helpful for the project, but all examples are welcome.

[1] Justification of distribution being the forward direction: computationally speaking, it's easier to match patterns of the form $a(b+c)$ modulo associativity and commutativity than patterns of the form $ab + ac$. Anecdotally, students usually can easily identify situations where they can distribute, but it's harder for them to identify situations where they can factor.

I always thought I'd be more of a biology person when I began undergrad, but as time went on I realized that the things I liked about science actually boiled down to math.

I'm so embarrassed to admit that, because it's so fundamental. Nevertheless, I graduated with an A- average and did a math thesis in Fluid Dynamics.

I've then got my PhD in mathematical biology. While I was technically in a biology department, my dissertation and my research is all about graph theory.

My PhD research group wasn't the most uplifting environment; my advisor was increasingly absent over the years, and while we have a good relationship and I respect him a lot, I always had the sinking feeling that he didn't respect me as much as other members in the group. When I look back at what I learned, I can see that I have managed to accumulate a real expertise in my area. However, compared to what I want to be able to do as a mathematical researcher, there are so many other fields I want to know (expand into geometry &amp; topology), as well as some basic areas I need to get more solid in (e.g. real analysis, measure theory). And I have had my spirit crushed by my advisor more than once.

I've just started an applied math postdoc, which I feel has been going well, but I can't help but still feel doubtful of my skills and frustrated that I don't get things quicker. I have to get papers out, but I also want to learn more fields of math. I have genuine passion for math and honestly have felt happier in the few months of my postdoc than I ever did during the entirety of my PhD, but I feel like the stress and burnout has been getting to me over the last few days.

math,Probability of a random matrix over a finite field having all of its eigenvalues in the field,"Fix a random nxn matrix M over a finite field F of order q. 

What is the probability that M has all of its eigenvalues in F, as a function of q and n?

I am curious because, fixing n, as q increases, this seems to “converge” to some value, namely,

n=2 -&gt; ~.45
n=3 -&gt; ~.13
n=4 -&gt; ~.03

As n increases, I would expect to get less eigenvalues in F (the degree of the characteristic polynomial increases, so the probability that 1 solution lies outside of F increases). Similarly, as q increases, I would expect to get more eigenvalues (there are more ways to solve the eigenproblem). 

However, I wouldn’t necessarily expect this value to converge as q increases.

math,Is there anything special about sets of functions which can represent any other function as infinite linear combination?,"For example, sines and cosines can do this with fourier series. 

The set of x^n for all natural n also has this property (taylor series).

My first question is there any more sets of functions with this behaviour?

My second question is do all of these sets have an accompanying ""transform""/""continuous case"". For example a fourier series has a fourier transform. Do polynomials have something like that? And others (if they exist)?

My third question is if there is any relation between all of these sets of functions. The way people talk about fourier series/transforms and the way people talk about infinite polynomials are completely different - using different methods and terms etc. But in the end they both, in a way, do the same thing (make a large range of functions from a sum of set of others).

math,Determinant trick,"In Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, he uses what he calls the ""determinant trick"" to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.   He does this by working with matrices with elements from a subring A' of endomorphisms A\^n-&gt;A\^n corresponding to ""multiplication-by-ring-element"".  This allows actions by a homomorphism \\phi in A\^n to be treated as multiplication in the ring A'\[\\phi\].  Then he multiplies the matrix \\phi\*I\_n-N, where N is the matrix of the homomorphism with respect to a basis of the free module (regarded as having elements in A'\[\\phi\]) by the adjoint matrix to conclude that the determinant is zero in A'\[\\phi\] and hence, the characteristic polynomial applied to \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] (or N, remembering that multiplication by \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] corresponds to action by \\phi, and working with the chosen basis in A\^n) is also zero, because the map

\\Psi:A\[x\]\\to A'\[\\phi\], x \\mapsto \\phi

commutes with det(as a function on A'\[\\phi\] valued matrices) and det(as a function on A\[x\] valued matrices).

It seems to rescue the bogus proof of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (substituting N\*I\_n into x\*I\_n in x\*I\_n-N) by turning the unwieldy application of the characteristic polynomial to a matrix into the nicer application of the characteristic polynomial to a single element in the ring A'\[\\phi\].

This argument seems to be applicable in general to finitely-generated modules, and is used by Atiyah and MacDonald in the proof of Proposition 2.4.

Could somebody check if my understanding (after two hours of pondering yesterday and another two hours just now) is correct?

Suppose we are working with barycentric coordinates with respect to an arbitrary triangle. Given a triple of numbers (a_1, a_2, a_3) such that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ≠ 0, we have a point (a_1 : a_2 : a_3) in barycentric coordinates. Also, if a_1, a_2, and a_3 are not all equal, we have a line consisting of points (x_1 : x_2 : x_3) such that a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0.

Does anyone know if there is any geometric relationship between a point and corresponding line defined this way? If we go up to higher dimensions, does this geometric relationship still hold between a point is its corresponding hyperplane?

As an example of the type of thing I mean by a geometric relationship, if we were instead working in cartesian coordinates, we have that the vector from the origin to (a_1, a_2, a_3) is normal to the plane defined by a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0.

It was a massive jump in abstraction at first, but eventually I got over it and gained some momentum. That all broke down once I got to the section on the generalized product topology and onwards; I could barely comprehend what was going on with those sections, and the exercises were hell to get through (I'm not even sure my solutions are correct). Come today, the section on the quotient topology is going smoothly -- the proofs are proofing, the geometric intuition is intuitioning, etc. Until I get to the exercises. I sat there for hours trying to crack the 2nd one, which I only managed after finding an online solution to peak at. I'm currently struggling with the 3rd one under similar circumstances.

Is it possible that I just came into this without the necessary preparation? I would put Topology aside temporarily and work on something like Axler's Lin Alg. book or Dummit &amp; Foote's Abstract Algebra, but I'm afraid of losing the momentum I've built. What should I do in this situation?

math,Is there a version of Vector Calculus that works in all dimensions? Why isn't it taught instead of Vector Calculus?,"Hey y'all,

Over the past few months I've had this growing... frustration(?) with Vector Calculus as it's usually taught in a Calculus 3 course, and I'm coming here because I kind of want to spill my thoughts about it in the hopes that someone else understands why I'm feeling this way and can offer some guidance.

(Also, just to be clear, I'm not posting this because I struggled with vector calculus or thought it was ""too hard,"" I honestly found it to be just fine)

I think most of my frustration stems from the fact that vector calculus is an exclusively 3-dimensional theory. The definitions of surface integrals and curl, as they're given in a typical course, only make sense in 3D, and this bothers me, because it feels to me like there shouldn't be anything ""special"" about 3D, right? Any R\^n can be treated as a vector space, so why was a theory of calculus created in such a way that it only works in R\^3? As an example of what I'm talking about, the fact that we represent the curl of a vector field as another vector field seems kind of like a ""coincidence,"" if that makes sense? Because it's been mentioned on numerous occasions that curl in other dimensions requires a different number of parameters (in 2D, curl only requires 1 parameter, and in 4D, it requires 6) and it just so happens that, in 3D, curl is described in 3 parameters. 

Is there a theory that serves the same purpose as vector calculus but that doesn't have this shortcoming? If there is, why is Vector Calculus so ubiquitous? I would love to live in a world where, for example, E&amp;M and Maxwell's Equations were taught using some other theory that's less reliant on 3D coincidences.

I'm sorry if I did anything wrong, this is my first post, please let me know if there's anything I should change here.

math,Are complex eigenvectors for nonconjugate eigenvalues orthogonal?,"For a complex eigenvalue conjugate pair, their eigenvectors will not be orthogonal. This is because if v = a + bi (a and b are vectors) and u = a - bi, then v · u = (a + bi) · (a - bi) = a · a + b · b, which is clearly non-zero since we established v and u are complex and thus have nonzero b.

(EDIT: Apparently, I was using an alternate inner product for complex numbers than most mathematicians would use. So apparently a + bi and a - bi can be orthogonal according to other inner products. Thanks u/lucy_tatterhood! Also, I meant to write I was only considering real-valued matrices.)

But what I'm wondering is for nonconjugate eigenvalues, are their corresponding eigenvectors orthogonal? For example, with the matrix:

A =  
\[0 1 0 0  
\-1 0 0 0  
0 0 0 -1  
0 0 1 0\]

nonconjuate eigenvalues do have orthogonal eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are (-i, 1, 0, 0), (i, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, i, 1), (0, 0, -i, 1), and we can see orthogonality with the nonpairs. But that could be do to how I structured this matrix. Afterall, this matrix was skew symmetric. Though I've tested with a non skew-symmetric matrix like

B =  
\[√3/2 -1/2 0 0  
1/2 √3/2 0 0  
0 0 √2/2 -√2/2  
0 0 √2/2 √2/2\]

and a similar result happened. But maybe I'm getting these orthogonal eigenvectors because my matrix has 0s separating the dimensions. But maybe because every rotation can be broken down into rotation of orthogonal planes, this result with nonconjugate eigenvalues eigenvectors being orthogonal will keep happening? I'm not sure.

The reason I've been thinking about orthogonal eigenvectors is I realized recently that ALL eigenvectors being orthogonal for distinct eigenvalues implies real eigenvalues (due to conjugate eigenvalues implying nonorthogonality, as shown earlier, meaning we can't have complex eigenvalues), which then by the Spectral Theorem implies a symmetric matrix. So I'm trying to learn more on what my idea of partial orthogonal eigenvectors (orthogonal for nonconjugate pairs) implies in terms of the matrix structure.

  
(EDIT: My conclusion that all eigenvector are orthogonal for distinct eigenvalues implies real eigenvalues realized on a non-commonly used inner product for complex vectors. So my conclusion was false.)

math,State Machine as a Binary Matrix?,"I'm a CS nerd, but I know enough about linear algebra to know that anything can be represented as a vector if you're brave enough. 

I want to make a hyper-condensed model of a Boolean logical circuit, using a series of 0 1 matrix operations to transform the inputs. 

While I've been able to find one explanation about binary matrices being used as logic gates and another about automata being mappable to a polynomial matrix, I'm having trouble figuring out how to bridge that to map automata onto a boolean matrix.  And with Google being what it is nowadays, even finding those two was hard enough on its own.

Does anyone know how I'd be able to map a finite state machine onto a binary matrix? Or a series thereof?


EDIT: For example, a Set-Reset latch would be modeled as the stateful expressions `Q_n=!(R_n+Q'_(n-1))` and `Q'_n=!(S_n+Q_(n-1))`, where S and R are inputs, but I can't seem to get myself to understand how to translate that to a binary vector or matrix.

Ideally, I would like to be able to repeatedly multiply the transformed vector and the matrix to continue ""ticking"" the circuit. 

Even if we deviate from linear algebra to another mechanism for deriving meaning from a set of numbers, I'd love to hear it. My current option is essentially 32^({layers of abstraction}) times larger per single binary value, which I just feel is wasteful.


EDIT 2: So when looking back at this, I realized that I'd basically need a matrix with one degree for every wire. And since most circuits don't have anything to do with each other, I'd end up with a hundred thousand wasted zeros.

It might be better to do a combination of a tree and a matrix then, using the tree to narrow down the required inputs and then the matrix to actually perform the computation.  That or just stick to a linked graph form of a circuit since that's the most intuitive way to do it, and then a bitwise matrix or something to serialize and compress it.",bythepowerofscience,1gt7etf,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gt7etf/state_machine_as_a_binary_matrix/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gt7etf/state_machine_as_a_binary_matrix/,2024-11-17 06:20:31,17,0.9,17,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gt7etf
math,"Karen Uhlenbeck said, ""two minds thinking together -- there can't be more intimate experience that that"": does anyone remember hearing this? ","Hello, guys. 

I am not a math person. I about a month ago, due to the strange Youtube algorithm, saw an interview of Karen Uhlenbeck. It was a short clip and I watched it to the end.

I reconstructed it from memory, trying as hard as I could to be faithful, and put it in the title above.

Her point was, if you do math, really do it together with other people, it is sharing minds, something deeply personal is revealed and shared.

Potential ADHDer and math graduate student who has always been unsure what people are referring to when they say they ""enjoy"" the process. For context, whenever I read math or solve problems, I feel

i) neutral most of the time, unless some surprising result or theorem arises (in which case dopamine floods my brain).

ii) Or, a kiddish excitement or satisfaction at having the opportunity to do math in the first place (so not really a joy at the process of thinking through problems and coming up with solutions themselves, but a joy at the mere idea of doing math).

The process itself has never generated dopamine, which worries me. For this reason, what does 'enjoying the process of learning' means for you?

math,Contour integrals around non isolated singularities?,"In my, nearly nonexistent, free time, one of my current side interests is finally going back and properly learning some complex analysis. In particular, I’d like to have a better handle on contour integration.

Now, I of course took a complex analysis course in my undergrad and so I am familiar with standard Cauchy-Gorsaut, Jordan’s Lemma, and Residue methods. These all work for the standard meromorphic functions that one sees in a course like that.

But what about functions such that the set of singularities has cluster points or perhaps contains a continuum? A simple example would be something like

f(z)=(e^(1/z)-1)^(-1) or

g(z)=tan(1/z)

Neither of these are meromorphic as z=0 is both singular and a cluster point of other singularities. Now, I actually don’t know any minimal conditions for complex integrability like one might have in the theory of Riemann or Lebesgue integration. But assuming that such a function can be integrable, how could one compute a contour integral around a cluster point or a continuum of singularities?

math,Local/global maximum of a polynomial lies on the greatest interval between x-intercepts,"Apologies if this is too low level for this subreddit.  I ran into this theorem that I just can't believe I haven't heard before.  If a global maximum lies between any two zeros of a polynomial function, it will lie on the greatest interval between *x*\-intercepts.  Is this true?

So for example, the function *f*(*x*) = -*x*^(4) \+ *x*^(3) \+ 20*x*.  Without graphing, we know that *f* has a global maximum between *x* = 0 and *x* = 5 *because* the *x*\-interval \[0, 5\] is greater length than the interval \[-4, 0\].

Obviously I can draw a continuous function where this is not true, but perhaps that is not a polynomial.  What is the proof here?  It is just for certain polynomials?

math,Do you think the standard axiom-definition-theorem presentation in textbooks hurts learning?,"Do you think the standard axiom-definition-theorem presentation of material in mathematics textbooks pedagogically sound? I am thinking of books that take this to the extreme such as Landau's Foundations of Analysis and Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis. It certainly makes sense from a logical point of view. However, to me it seems to hide the often fuzzy and messy development of the subject and the intuition behind it. Yes, you can understand the definitions, the theorems and their proofs but reading such books doesn't leave you with a sense of you could discover all these stuff yourself if you had given enough thought. What do you think?

  
Edit: A point of clarification. I do not propose that we do away with definitions, theorems, and proofs etc. Clearly these vital and indispensable to doing proper mathematics. In fact, I despise the informal style of so-called ""applied"" mathematics texts (such as Introduction to Linear Algebra by Strang) that are full of hand-wavy arguments and imprecision. The kinds of texts I have in mind are those that follow a strictly definition-theorem-proof style with no explanatory passages or motivating examples in-between. To those who categorize these as only reference material, I would like to point out that regardless of the intension of the author, such books do end up being used as textbooks in classes.

math,"Why are estimated ""centers"" sometimes bimodal?","For a project I'm working on, I've been trying to find the most central point in each country, which I defined as the point inside the country that has the smallest mean distance to all other points in the country (I believe this is equivalent to the centroid if the shape is contiguous and convex, but the centroid can lie outside the country, whereas this point can't). I couldn't calculate this directly, so I estimated it with a Monte Carlo method as follows:

1. Generate 1000 points in the shape randomly according to a uniform distribution
2. Find the point that has the lowest average distance to all the other points, take that as the central point
3. Repeat 200 times
4. Take the average of the 200 central points

Much to my surprise, some countries (like Slovenia) had a unimodal distribution, while others (like North Macedonia) had a bimodal distribution.

To make sure this wasn't a mistake in my code, I tried it again with a different number of points in each trial (step 1). The distribution of central points oscillates between unimodal and bimodal as the number of points increases. I then ran the same algorithm on an ellipse in the plane, and this time, the distribution was sometimes unimodal, sometimes bimodal, and once even trimodal.

math,"Typo in R. Milner's 1975: ""PROCESSES: A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF COMPUTING AGENTS""","**I will try to give as much context as possible to enable as many people as possible to answer but it is likely that only people with knowledge in denotational semantics and/or process algebra will be able to answer this question.**

Milner defines a process as a member of the Scott domain

`P = V -&gt; LxVxP` (1)

with `V` the domain of values, `L` the domain of locations and `P` the domain of processes. A domain of functions from values to a triplet &lt;location, value, process&gt;. Intuitively, it means that a process will receive a value and produce a location, a value and a new process (its continuation).

Let `w_1` and `w_2` be values and `s=pw_1` and `t=p'w_2`. From the previous definition (1), `s` and `t` are triplets so that each value in the triplet have the following types:

`(s)_1 : L, (s)_2 : V, (s)_3 : P`

Same goes for `t`

We say that a process returns a result when its continuation contains the special member `l` of `L`  
When defining parallel composition of processes `p` and `p'` receiving a pair of values `&lt;w1, w2&gt;`, Milner states that the rough idea is that if either `p` or `p'` reached a result, reduce the other one and return the pairing of the two results. If none is completed, ask an oracle to pick which process to reduce"".

I thus expected a definition of the type :

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) := 
    
    if ((s)_1=l) {
      // since p is complete, we sequentially compose p' with the result of p 
      (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2 
    } else if ((t)_1 = l) {
      // since p' is complete, we sequentially compose p with the result of p'
      (p * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1
    } else {
      // we ask an oracle to decide to reduce either p or p'
    }

using the notation of the paper for conditionals, we should get 

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) = 
    ((s)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2,
    ((t)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1,
    oracle_decision
    

but the paper gives us 

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) = 
    ((s)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2,
    ((s)_2=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1,
    oracle_decision

with `(s)_2 : V` I think the `(s)_2` is a typo, that what Milner meant was `(t)_1` but I can't seem to find any erratum of any sort and papers tracing the history of process algebra don't bother explaining this particular definition of parallel composition as it is dropped in the following paper by R. Milner.

math, Why does the Lebesgue Integral not require countably many partitions? ,"Originally posted on r/learnmath but I thought it would be better suited here.

I'm working my way through Axler's Measure, Integration and Real Analysis. In Chapter 3A, Axler defines the Lebesgue Integral of *f* as the supremum of all Lower Lebesgue Sums, which are in turn defined as the sum over each set in a **finite** *S*\-partition of the domain *P*, where the inside of the sum is the outer measure of the set multiplied by the infimum of the value of *f* on that set.

My question is, why is it sufficient that *P* is a finite partition and not a countably infinite one?

In Chapter 2A, Axler defines the Outer Measure over a set *A* is as the infimum of all sums of the lengths of **countably** many open intervals that cover the set *A*. I'm confused as to why the Lebesgue Integral is defined using a finite partition whereas the Outer Measure uses countably many intervals.

math,Maximum Number of Near Orthogonal Unit Vectors in a High Dimensional Space,"Suppose we have a set V of k unit vectors in an n-dimensional space, where k &gt;&gt; n and both are large (at least on the order of hundreds in this case). All k vectors are mutually near orthogonal: -ϵ &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ with i ≠ j and 0 &lt; ϵ &lt; 1.

The goal is to find a function of n and ϵ that yields the maximum possible k.

From [this stackexchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4680506/what-definition-of-nearly-orthogonal-would-result-in-in-a-10-000-dimensional), we get: n ≥ C \* ln(k) / ϵ^(2), where C is a constant currently accepted 8 (ignore what the post says about C - assuming [the proof on page 6/7 of this](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/OBDA_spring16/material/random_projections.pdf) holds, 8 is the best available right now). Further, from that equation we move things around to get the desired k ≤ exp(n \* ϵ^(2) / C).

So problem solved right? Well, maybe. That post gets the equation from [this response](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/24864/almost-orthogonal-vectors/24873#24873) which was to essentially the same question. That response was written by Bill Johnson, who in turn references the [Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) for which he is a namesake.

So problem definitely solved, surely?! After all, one of the creators of the lemma themselves directly answered this question. The problem is: if you read about the lemma on wikipedia or the various other available sources, it becomes increasingly confusing how one is supposed to make the jump from the equation being used by the lemma as a condition for the existence of a linear map to the same equation being used to get a lower bound on the dimension size n needed to allow for k near-orthogonal vectors. Specifically, the lemma shows that V can be reduced in dimension from some N to some lower n so long as the equation holds, where the n is the same as used above in the equation but now V is of R^(N) instead of R^(n). **So, how was this jump made?**

Further, I could find no information on how this equation was derived in that form, which is a problem: I am looking for a generalization of this equation with -ϵ1 &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ2, both ϵ1 &amp; ϵ2 being between 0 and 1 but not necessarily the same value.",OblivionPhase,1gpyz8k,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,2024-11-12 23:37:48,34,0.86,34,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpyz8k
math,The Sandwich Problem (Open Discussion),"Suppose you have a square sandwich of area 1 with an infinitely thin crust along the edges. You remove a constant area from the sandwich such that it has area 1 at t = 0 and area 0 at exactly t = 1. This area can be removed in any way you'd please so long as dA/dt = -1. For example, you could remove it in an expanding strip from one side of the square to the other, two strips from both sides converging to the centre, an expanding circle centred at the middle of the square, etc. 

The method by which you choose to remove the area is called strategy S and can be as complex or as simple as you'd like.

Let P^(S)(t) be the crust-less perimeter of the sandwich at time t when using strategy S. That is, the total perimeter of the shape subtracted by the perimeter with crust on it at time t when using strategy S. 

Find the strategy S that minimizes the value of the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of P^(S)(t) with respect to t.



Some examples:

The integral has value 1 for the strategy where you remove an expanding strip from one side.

The integral has a value 2 for the strategy where you remove two expanding strips from opposite sides that converge in the centre.



From a bit of discussion with my friends, we've found that a good way to start is removing an expanding quarter circle from one of the corners, but it's unclear how to proceed once the quarter circle is inscribed within the square.

I started my Master's not long ago, and I'm mainly interested in algebra (I really enjoyed the courses in Galois theory and commutative algebra).

From what I saw, a lot of the research done in algebra in my university uses a lot of calculations, asymptotics and big O notations, which really surprised me as there were no such things in the courses I took.

Does every topic in algebra (which relates to Field theory) uses a lot of calculations? I don't really enjoy that type of proofs (I remember taking a seminar in number theory, where the theorems where really interesting, but the proofs were just a bunch of inequalities thrown together, like in Dirichlet's theorem, which I really didn't like)

math,How Does an Infinite Number of Removable Discontinuities Affect the Area Under a Curve?,"Hey everyone! I am currently redoing Calculus 2 to prepare for Multivariable Calculus, going over some topics my lecturer did not cover this past semester. Right now, I am watching Professor Leonard’s [lecture ](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=V9z1wMUcNE_L9REs)on improper integrals and I am at the section on removable discontinuities [1:49:06](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=TWEzTwTz3diLYk88&amp;t=6546).

He explains that removable discontinuities or rather ""holes"" in a curve do not affect the area under the curve. His reasoning is that because a hole is essentially a single point and a single point has a width of zero, it contributes zero to the area. In other words, we can ""plug"" the hole with a point and it will not impact the area under the curve. This I understood because he once touched on it in some of his previous video, I forgot which one it was.

But I started wondering what if a curve had removable discontinuities all over it, with the holes getting closer and closer together until the distance between them approaches zero? Intuitively to me it seems like these ""holes"" would create a gap. But the confusion for me started when I used his reasoning that point each individual point contributes zero area, therefore the sum of all the areas under these ""holes"" is zero? 

If the sum is zero then how do they create a gap like I intuitively thought? or they do not?

How do I think about the area under a curve when it has an infinite number of removable discontinuities?

math,"Which Of These Probabilities Is The Important One To Know? (Bayesian Belief Networks, Probability)","Hello Friends,

I am teaching a class on Bayesian belief networks and relevant sampling techniques. I've always found this to be a pretty dry subject compared to others that we study, so to make it more fun I designed a video game to play with the concept. In brief, you are a paranormal investigator trying to determine if visiting aliens are hostile or friendly. To do this, you have a relatively complex (15 nodes and about 25 edges) BBN, and the first part of the game is to query the BBN to get a sense of when the aliens tend to visit the town. The second part is an investigation where you interview people who claim to have seen the aliens and describe their behavior as friendly or hostile. Your job is, using the insights you gained from the first step, to determine if the eye-witness report is credible or dubious, and your judgment on the aliens if determined by a majority vote, ie did most credible witnesses describe them as hostile or friendly?

**My question is about defining credibility. I have two possible answers to this:**

**A witness is credible iff P(Aliens|evidence) &gt; P(Aliens)** \- or in other words, the posterior probability given their account of events is greater than the prior probability of alien visitation.

  
**OR**

**A witness is credible iff P(evidence|Aliens) &gt; P(evidence|\~Aliens)** \- relating the probability of their account to aliens being present or not being present.

These two conditions are clearly related by Bayes rule:

P(A|evidence) = P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/P(evidence) = 

P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/(P(evidence|Aliens)\*P(Aliens)+P(evidence|\~Aliens)\*P(\~Aliens))

All the terms are there and related to each other, but it need not be the case that if one condition is met then the other is necessarily met.

One assumption about this is that we are trusting the evidence the NPC is giving us, but we doubt their claim that they actually saw the aliens. That assumption is fine for me. We also are not evaluating the probability that someone saw aliens given that they say they saw aliens, and that is also fine with me.

What do you think? Or could there be another way we can evaluate credibility?

(Tangent) The game in its more simple form (without the interview mechanic) was a real hit last year, really transforming one of the most boring lectures into one of the most fun ones. The students also learned a lot because they get to actually see and explore things that they previously only heard about - like we say rejection samplers are wasteful because most of their samples are not used. Ok, how many samples are wasted? We say Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers are extremely expensive compared to other approaches - ok, how long do they take to run on a graph like this? With algorithms like these, getting to actually explore them and see them at scale is key, and I think that actually using these objects and algorithms does a lot for learning.",ProdigiousMike,1gpccdv,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,2024-11-12 04:13:49,14,0.8,14,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpccdv

math,"Math puzzle: solve the subway conundrum, a Martin Gardner puzzle","A young man lives in Manhattan near a subway express station. He is dating two women: one in Brooklyn; one in the Bronx. To visit the woman in Brooklyn he takes a train on the downtown side of the platform; to visit the woman in the Bronx he takes a train on the uptown side of the same platform. Since he likes both women equally well, he simply takes the first train that comes along. In this way, he lets chance determine whether he rides to the Bronx or to Brooklyn. The young man reaches the subway platform at a random moment each Saturday afternoon. Brooklyn and Bronx trains arrive at the station equally often—every 10 minutes. Yet for some obscure reason he finds himself spending most of his time with the woman in Brooklyn: in fact, on the average, he goes there nine times out of 10.

math,Why study so hard when AI can do the work for you?,"I love math olympiad- as a student I have pored hours into this subject, loving it for the creativity and logic needed to solve each problem.

When I heard about AlphaGeom that was referred to early 2024, I was shocked- AI has developed to the stage that it can solve questions with international olympiad level of difficulty.

Then came an article in July, praising AI for being able to achieve a high silver medal in the IMO.

At that point, I was just coping- I thought ""Oh, it solved the Algebra, Number theory, Geometry questions by blindly bashing and trying many options, but its unable to solve the combinatorics questions as it is bad at logic. Humans will forever beat AI in terms of logical reasoning."" It was true that this model solved all the questions in the IMO except the two combinatorics questions.

But I was wrong. In late 2024, OpenAI developed a new AI chatbot model o1 that, on average, solved 11/15 questions in the AIME (A math competition in the US). That's already better than me: and most of those problems are combinatorics questions.

Of course, right now these models aren't that good in combinatorics yet, but it will be able to surpass even most IMO medalists in combinatorics, in the coming years.

If AI models already beat most humans in the area of logical reasoning, whats the point of studying so much math olympiad if an AI will destroy you in it?

Why even study math in the first place then, if an AI would be much more effective than us? I'm losing motivation to study because of this...

math,Curious about forms of solutions for differential equations.,"I'll preface with I don't study differential equations and have at best a scattered understanding of parts of the theory.

When teaching or studying intro DE's, we pretty universally cover the Laplace transform as a method of solving constant coefficient linear IVPs. Some courses will also go over power series solutions to equations with nonconstant coefficients and, if they're lucky, possibly the Method of Frobenius.

Here's what I'm curious about: The motivation and ideas leading to the development of the Laplace transform itself are almost *never* taught. Things like the historical study of various integral forms and the extension of power series to a continuous indexing variable.

**Is there any well-developed study of solutions to DEs where, instead of a power series solution, we look for a solution in the form of an integral transform?**

I tried working out a few possibilities, but it seems to fail for various reasons depending on the form of the differential operator and even the form of the inhomogeneous term. For example, if we take something like a second order operator with polynomial coefficients and some forcing term g,

y''-2xy'+x^(2)y = g(x), y(0)=a, y'(0)=b

we can guess a solution of the form y=&amp;int;_0\^&amp;infin; f(t)x^(t) dt where f is an unknown function. This would be a continuum-indexed analogue of a power series solution. After substituting this into the DE, we can do some simplifying calculations and write the left side as the Laplace transform of some polynomial multiple of f. Using the properties of &amp;Lscr;, we can recast the original DE as a new DE whose solution is the Laplace transform of this unknown function f.

What seems to happen in some surprisingly simple cases is that this simply leads nowhere. It seems to be the case that if the function g is not chosen fairly carefully, then the equation expressing g as a Laplace transform of f simply has no solution. The issue is that the function g(e^(-s)) must tend towards 0 as s approaches &amp;infin; in order to be in the range of &amp;Lscr; and this simply is not the case for many reasonable choices of g.

So what gives? Why is it that a power series solution to the above equation is perfectly viable, but this integral transform solution appears not to be? And is there a better guess for a transform that *will* work? Could we perhaps try something like a ""basis"" of delta functions? I'd really like to know more about this sort of thing if it's out there.",OneMeterWonder,1gog0ff,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,2024-11-11 00:58:53,27,0.84,27,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gog0ff

math,Why should I care about logic?,"I'm a Master's student and would see myself as an algebraist (at least, I'm interested in algebraic number theory, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, that stuff). But I always avoided logic and some set-theoretic problems (e.g., is this statement provable without assuming Zorn's lemma?): these questions seem so abstract that I don't want to wrap my head around it and they seem not to be ""real math"", but ""meta-math"". Another reason for avoiding logic was mainly due to [Logicomix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix) (a really good graphic novel), whose subtext makes the claim that logicians become mad, and I don't want to get mad.

Hence the title: *Why should I care about logic?* Or at least an introduction to logic?

I know of some very technical and almost absurd results from (real) algebraic geometry which rely on logic, e.g., [Lefschetz principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry_and_analytic_geometry#The_Lefschetz_principle), [Tarski-Seidenberg theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%E2%80%93Seidenberg_theorem), [Krivine-Stengle Positivstellensatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krivine%E2%80%93Stengle_Positivstellensatz), and some topics on [real closed fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field#Decidability_and_quantifier_elimination) in logical nature.

math,"If you could go back and reteach yourself math in childhood, what would you do differently? ","Hi all and thank you greatly in advance for any input. 

I’m a dad homeschooling my 4 y/o who seems to have a strong receptivity to math. They know their times tables through 10, can mentally perform three digit addition and subtraction problems with multiple carries quite fluidly, do various puzzles well, and generally appear to have a very strong conceptual grasp of everything we do together and why operations work out the way they do. FWIW I’m no tiger dad—I couldn’t care less how advanced my child is, I just want to help them along in their development as best I can. Nor am I trying to make any claim about my child’s abilities—I just try to do a little bit every day with them, be enthusiastic and engaging, and over the course of their childhood it’s snowballed into them being pretty far along for their age. 

As we get further along in arithmetic I find myself at a bit of a crossroads. My sense has been that one of the best things I could do with them is drill arithmetic problems/puzzles and leverage the incredible retention powers of childhood to memorize things like addition/subtraction math facts and times tables with the hope it’d strongly develop their number sense and save them a lot of time later. But I’m wondering about how far to take this: should I have them start memorizing squares and cubes through 30 or something? Should I try to get them proficient handling larger and larger numbers? Or should I focus more on introducing new concepts? 

I’m not a mathy person myself—it’d be generous to say I’m capable through basic highschool math—so I’d love some perspective from people who are highly numerate and consider math a passion: if you could go back, how would you like your math education to have been conducted? What could you have been taught early that would’ve really helped you along on your journey? What was not so helpful? I’d just really love any and all perspective of others on the other side of this mountain I never traversed so I can help my child along their journey as usefully as I can. Thank you so much!

\[The following paragraph provides context, skip to the next one if it doesn't matter\]  
I really loved math in high school and was gunning for a B,Sc in mathematics in a top university, but a tumultuous period of life kept me from applying myself to the subject for multiple years and I soon got horrifyingly bad at the most elementary areas of the subject. Now I'm doing an online degree that I *really* need to finish if I'm to live my dream of not being homeless, and part of it was an elementary course in discrete mathematics which I had been ignoring for the entire semester with a week till the final exam. I fumbled through the course material and escaped a failing grade by two marks, and it's been eating away at me how fun and interesting all the problems looked if only I were to put in the effort to build my ability up from its current uselessness. Following that line of thinking for a few months, I've now got a somewhat reignited ambition for a career in mathematics

Now, if I were to try and enter the field in any serious capacity, I'd need to do it outside of my actual degree. Once that's over I'll be competing with people who, unlike me, did not drop the ball through their secondary and tertiary education, and have proven themselves and trained at levels I am nowhere near, and might possibly never reach for my age range. I'm 23, I'm quickly losing ""fresh meat"" status as an academic in my country. I got sloppy, and now doors are closing fast

So I figure if I'm to have my hopes crushed, best have them crushed early. Can I study math at a professional level, or am I best advised to remain satisfied with the status of, at best, a hobbyist with a passing interest in the subject?",AffectionateAd6932,1gnd323,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gnd323/is_it_possible_to_be_a_competent_and_respectable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gnd323/is_it_possible_to_be_a_competent_and_respectable/,2024-11-09 15:54:34,42,0.78,42,0,49,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gnd323

math,"PhD students, postdocs, and beyond: If you're regularly producing quality research, do you still have time for personal hobbies?","Dear all,

About one year ago, I posted a question here about [how to be successful mathematicians](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/10bqo7i/successful_mathematicians_what_differentiates_you/), in which *working hard* seems to be a common theme (*networking* is another).

I am a Master student and currently my research interests are analytic/additive number theory and extremal combinatorics. My previous background also includes computer science (CS), so I also enjoy tinkering with computers and programming, for instance, recently I got my hands on homelab and trying to play with LLMs (large language models).

As mentioned in said post, my goal is to become a professor at a university, which means I'll likely follow the usual path of PhD -&gt; postdoc -&gt; tenure-track position. However, I often worry that the time I spend tinkering and programming -- usually in the evenings -- might be ""wasted"", since I could instead use that time to skim/read papers.

So I was wondering that for those of you currently in graduate school or who have gone through this stage, *if you’re producing and publishing research in good journals, do you still manage to find time for personal hobbies? Would you say that it depends more on time management and so on?*

math,How invested should I truly be in courses? (Rant),"TLDR: Is it worth it to sacrifice ALL of my time to learn the subjects super well or should I do as my classmates and just get a passing grade and not give a damm about the material?

Hello. Second year undergraduate here, at a college with a relatively hard curriculum. I have 5 courses every semester, with 25h per week of lectures. On top of that, I devote 5h per day to studying, more on the weekends. I basically have no free time, its classes in the morning, lunch, studying in the afternoon/evening, then going to the gym, dinner, study some more, rinse and repeat. 

I feel like many of my colleagues have more free time. I usually study to the point of fully understanding the subject, quite a bit deeper than what was taught in class, this involves researching on my own, reading books outside of the curriculum and such, so in the end I am very satisfied with the outcome, as I truly love math.  But this comes with a price that is basically my entire life during that period. Students from other degrees spend most of their time having fun, with hobbies, socializing, etc.
I dropped all of my hobbies.

Even half of the students in my own degree study just to pass and don't care about learning profoundly about what they are being taught. I dont know why but the idea of not learning the math perfectly gives me so much anxiety. Just thinking about not knowing a certain part of the degree or dropping some electives in future years makes me really nervous.

Im starting to think I might be going a bit too hard, this might be some completionist syndrome type of thing.

While I love math, I'm not sure it is worth the best years of my life, Im studying in a different city, famous for its college scene, so I feel like Im wasting so much.

And then there is the dilemma of choosing whether to sacrifice my youth completely with a Masters and PhD or to go into finance or tech which is what I actually should do (for the life I want in the future) and feel like I failed at math.

1. The material in math is so difficult that there is an upper limit to how fast the courses can move, so if you are good at math it’s easy to keep up (although this seems a bit contradictory)
2. People in math are naturally smart and good at school (egotistical but I do notice a correlation)

I had a proof class in undergrad but it's been so long I forgot all of it. So I'm going through *A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics,* which promises to remind me of what I've forgotten.

But I really like prime numbers, and I had a teacher decades ago who said, ""all math is geometry,"" and I want to play around with both of those things. So I've decided I'd like to dive very, obnoxiously deep into geometry. I assume it will take me years. That's ok. I'm quite bored.

Does anyone know a series of books or some set of books (videos won't work, I need to be able to do problems till I understand it) that would be useful? Minimal cost is preferable, but usually this crap is textbooks so I can accept some pain.

But if we have hundreds of DiffGeo textbooks WHY CAN'T ONE OF THEM JUST WRITE DOWN EVERY F-ING DETAIL FOR ONCE. No, you DON'T get to ""choose coordinates x\_j"". Maybe it could be useful to just, like, maybe distinguish the dozen types of derivatives you have defined not just for one page after the definition, but maybe, uuuhm, till the end of the textbook? All of these things are functions, all of these objects are types, and have you maybe considered that actually precisely specifying the functional relationships and clarifying each type could be USEFUL TO THE STUDENT?

math,I really hate my advisor,"For the record, I graduated already and currently working as a postdoc.

But my PhD problem was a nightmare and it was a problem that required lots of details checking with a result that is not surprising. 80% of it was verifying that the usually theory in my line of work is true under this minor assumption, which is expected to be true by anyone is the field. You just need to make sure they are. No big ideas, no originality.

But lots and lots of reading and verification. So much that basically nobody wanted to do it and my advisor basically decided that I should do it and made that my entire PhD instead of giving me a chance to make original contributions.


And now that I’m trying to publish my result and apparently there’s this whole sub part of the theory that needs verifications, and it’s haunting me. I can’t believe what I thought was behind me is coming back to haunt me just as I think I can finally make originals contributions and move on to different problems.

I was stressed, depressed the whole PhD and I thought I can finally enjoy doing some math research with problems of my choosing, and now it’s coming back to haunt me some more. I really fucking hate my advisor for doing this to me.

And btw throughout the entire project he gave me no help and told me to stop worrying about the details when the whole project is about verifying details, he didn’t even read my thesis m or any of my paper.

math,"Question on defining the spectral family of a bounded self-adjoint operator T using the ""positive part"" of the operator T-\lambda I (Thm 9.8-3 in Kreyszig's ""Functional Analysis..."") (definition of ""positive part"" in description).","Summary: I have looked everywhere, and so far, can't find a satisfactory explanation of one aspect of Theorem 9.8-3 in Kreyszig ""Functional Analysis with Applications"": in particular, what is the motivation for using the **""positive part""** of the operator T\_lambda instead of T\_lambda itself, and what goes wrong if we had just used T\_lamba itself instead?

here is a screenshot of the theorem in question:

where the ""positive part"" is defined as T\^+ = 1/2 (B+T) where B = (T\^2)\^(1/2).

my question is: why is the ""positive part"" used?

If we consider just the operator T\_lambda itself, then the projection onto the nullspace of T-lambdaI is just the projection onto the ""eigenspace"" (with the caveat that lambda could be a non-eigenvalue spectral value i.e. in the continuous spectrum of T) corresponding to the spectral value lambda; this to me is somewhat reminiscent of the finite-dimensional case; which involves a sum over projections onto the eigenspaces of T.

So why is the additional definition of the ""positive part"" of this operator needed?

math,Found a cool book,"So at my university, there's this math library with a small bookshelf that said ""free books."" One of the books that caught my attention was this one in Russian (*Asymptotic methods for linear ordinary differential equations* by M.V. Fedoryuk), so I picked it up and put it in my backpack thinking it would be a cool book to just keep around cause why not (I can't even read Russian💀). I noticed that it had a few papers in it but didn't think much of it until I got home and pulled out the papers. To my surprise, it includes the following:

* A handwritten letter from January 1995. It said ""FEDORYUK. According to Sergai Slavyanov, Fedoryuk died when he fell off a railway platform and landed on the back of his head. Might have been pushed? Mightc have had hangover?""
* A printed out email with a bunch of people from Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Duke, etc. (i can provide the names but i dont wanna dox people from like 30 years ago) just saying that they saw a sticker on a truck that said ""JESUS IS COMING: LOOK BUSY"" that weekend. A few of the recipients have passed away but a couple are still alive and well.
   * I have no idea how this ended up at my university (UMN)
* A few summaries of the book from Springer.
* A handwritten summary that has the table of contents.
* What I find most interesting: Inside the book, someone wrote ""To professor F.W.J Olver with compliments from the author."" Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything from Fedoryuk himself :(
* The book was valued at $130 at the time and I feel like a thief when I found out because it was free

math,Pictures of Spec Z[X],"I've been reading Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, and it's been a really enjoyable read.  I appreciate the effort he puts into motivating the development of ring and module theory.  The use of first person is unusual, but this is one of the few cases where I don't mind seeing so much of the author's personality.  And Atiyah and MacDonald's exceedingly terse text feels somewhat more penetrable after reading this book.

That said, the book teases and hints at a lot of advanced math, which is cool but frustrating.  For instance, in the opening chapters he draws a couple of pictures of things like Spec k\[X,Y\] and Spec Z\[X\].  He tells the reader that it's okay if you don't understand these pictures at this point.  

I feel like a novitiate and I'm being shown a Zen riddle by a master, who tells me that I will understand it someday when I'm enlightened enough.  What does it take to really understand these pictures?  Do algebraic geometers each have their own way of visualizing prime spectra? (Specifically, are these pictures just trying to depict the Zariski topology, or is it deeper than that?)

math,How to measure credibility? ,"When thinking about people making good and bad predictions, I got to wondering how one could design a system of rating people's predictions and the corresponding observation about whether they were right.  

To make things simple, let's say that a person has a probability distribution p over a random variable X, which is a prediction of a future event.  So for example X could be a roll of a die with support {1,2,3,4,5,6} and they believe the die is biased with probability distribution 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/2.

We roll the die once and the outcome is observed.  

How do we rate the credibility of the person based on their probability distribution and whatever the observed result is?  I.e. how can we assign them a score for their prediction, with the following obviously desirable properties.

1. They earn a positive score when their prediction seems to agree with the outcome, however that is measured.

2. If they assign to event X=i the probability 50%, then they neither earn nor lose points if X=i occurs.

The score should somehow reflect the value of the person as a source of information and prediction.  The two points above are not the only important considerations -- another would be informativeness of the prediction.  For example, if someone predicts that the sun will come up tomorrow, that's not very informative, so you shouldn't earn many points when the sun rises.  But I'll think about how to incorporate those kinds of considerations later.  

Is this the kind of thing people have already studied?

math,Reading Recommendations in “Institutional” History of Mathematics,"It's not a big secret that good books on the history of relatively modern mathematics are few and far between. Sure, there are some memoirs, autobiographies, overviews of some particular fields, collections of anecdotes, and a few books on the history of mathematics in general, but little of what professional historians would call a serious history text — something that would concern the institutions, politics, economics, and other extra-mathematical contexts involved in the development of modern mathematics as a historically-grounded enterprise. 

This probably shouldn't come as too big of a surprise given the comparatively small number of academic mathematicians, the seemingly parochial, obscure, esoteric nature of the field in the eyes of historians, and the fact that few of the working professionals would have enough of historical “knack” to write a reliable history.

Yet still, there are many questions that could be easily asked and less easily answered regarding the every day matters of institutional mathematics.

How would they justify themselves to the government in the matters of, say, funding? How would they justify themselves to the universities? How did they attract students to the programs? What were the typical career paths of math students in, say, mid-20th century? What was the demographics of math departments: age, class, gender? What was expected to know from a freshman, a bachelor, phd candidate? When, why, where the pure math programs were created? How do external factors come into play — is it an accident, for example, that planned-economy era soviet mathematicians were dominant in optimisation and probability? And so on, and so on, and so on.

If you have any readings that could shed some light on those matters, any resources, even if indirect (personal diaries, biographies, statistics, old reports, etc), I'd be immensely thankful if you share them here.

math,Is it just me or is stochastic calculus extremely difficult?,"Some background: I’m a master’s student in mathematics, and during my bachelor’s degree, I took a course on stochastic calculus. I took it because I enjoyed both measure theory and measure-theoretic probability theory and was interested in seeing how they are used, for example, in mathematical finance. However, I found the course more difficult than any other that I had taken up to that point, so much so that I decided to drop it halfway through. Concretely, I had a hard time keeping track of all the very technical definitions and developing an intuition for the presented concepts.

Fast forward to my master’s studies, and I chose to take a course on numerical methods for mathematical finance, with only measure-theoretic probability theory as a prerequisite. Halfway through the course, we started discussing the basics of Brownian motion, stochastic calculus and SDEs, and once again, I found myself struggling in the same way I did during the stochastic calculus course.

It is good that I am surrounded by people more experienced in higher mathematics, and it has only made me hungrier for improvement. I'm often pessimistic due to my frequent inability to focus, but I want to change my mindset and gain confidence.

My most conspicuous shortcoming: problem-solving, the heart of mathematics itself. I'm poor at it, and I want to be better. So, how would you suggest I go about improving this skill? I've taken courses in calculus (my first love in mathematics) and differential equations, real analysis, abstract algebra, and linear algebra. I feel like my knowledge of mathematics is sparse, so I'd like to develop a routine familiarity with the major reappearing concepts, motifs, and whatnot. Above all, I want to practice, practice, practice. Where can I find problems to solve? Of course, there are textbook exercises, but what are some other resources? They don't have to be immediately solvable (like arithmetic or integration); I'm more looking for challenging proof-problems and the like.",Competitive_Switch_4,1glk23m,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glk23m/how_to_disicpline_myself_in_higher_mathematics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glk23m/how_to_disicpline_myself_in_higher_mathematics/,2024-11-07 06:15:40,0,0.42,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1glk23m

math,effective remaining area in circle packing,"I'm working on a problem where I'm packing circles of unequal radii sequentially into a rectangle

because I'm doing this sequentially, it would help if I can somehow the capture of how much effective area is remaining after I place a certain number of circles into the rectangle

for instance, for 4 circles I could:
1. pack all 4 in 1 corner
2. pack 2 in 1 corner, pack 2 in another
3. pack all 4 right in the centre of the rectangle

for all 3 methods, the area that remains afterward is the same, but methods 1 and 2 are clearly superior because the area that remains still allows for more circles of larger areas to be placed, whereas method 3 prevents that (i.e. the effective area that remains is reduced)

so, is there a way I can capture this notion?

math,Math app recommendations for kids with learning disabilities,"Hello,

I work at a K-12 special education school. Kids are low to low-moderate and have some form of ADHD/ADD, are on the spectrum, or have dyslexia/dyscalculia to some degree.  Our math program is in need of restructuring and is a subject students struggle with the most, so I've been tasked with compiling a list of math software apps and looking into a good few options. The highest level we go to is Algebra 1 and Geometry in high school. Some problem areas:

* Elementary - developing number sense/numeracy. Our lowest kids have difficulty adding/subtracting without counting
* Middle school - fractions are the biggest thing that confuses students
* High School - lack of basic arithmetic knowledge/numeracy. Some kids in geometry can't do basic operations with fractions.

Either way, across the board, numeracy and basic arithmetic is something that is a struggle for some of our students.

The tricky part is not every student starts in elementary. Because we're an NPS, districts send their kids to us from all different grade levels and knowledge (but they all have some form of learning disability). We may get kids enrolling as early as 1st or late as 12th grade. So some of those basic numeracy skills need to be honed for our high schoolers who are really behind.

Here is a working list of apps I've been looking into. I'd love any additional feedback on some apps that you've worked with or are familiar with--any other suggestions not on the list are welcome!

Of course, critical feedback is more than welcome. There are so many of these out there it can be hard to choose, but I wanted to cast a wide net because we are different from your traditional public school.

* **Banzai** \- seems more applied (financial literacy) with real-life focused problems
* **Beestar** \- parents can monitor performance online. also gives motivational recognitions every week to encourage students
* **GeoGebra** \- was looking into an option for geometry and this was the top result
* **Illustrative Mathematics** \- has built-in assessments and hands-activities, review-focused
* **Gimkit/Prodigy** \- very gamified, can create own questions and students have to answer them to proceed in the game or get 'energy' etc.
* **iReady** \- Good as a diagnostic tool. Helpful in knowing a student's grade level and gaps in knowledge
* **IXL** \- great for review and practice. Not as visual as other apps
* **Khan Academy** \- particularly looking into Khan Academy Kids for K-8 but seems like a strong resource for geometry
* **Nessy Numbers (Woodin)** \- seems good for building numeracy/number sense 
* **Splashlearn** \- very visual and engaging
* **Zearn** \- K-5, seems good for early math review/practice",shuai_bear,1glccdh,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glccdh/math_app_recommendations_for_kids_with_learning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glccdh/math_app_recommendations_for_kids_with_learning/,2024-11-06 23:25:25,10,0.82,10,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1glccdh

There are 10 students in my year, and although we’ve grown close, it seems almost all of us are having second thoughts — lots of talk of mastering out/switching to another program.

Most of us were originally enrolled 3 courses, but pretty much all of us have since dropped to 2 due to being overwhelmed. Even taking just 2 courses is comparably difficult to my undergrad where I was able to manage 5 without too much difficulty.

Between coursework and 10-20 hours per week of TA duties, I haven’t found time to start getting involved in research, and worry I am slipping behind on this front. In speaking to my cohort, it seems most of us are having similar concerns.

math,An interesting problem related to elections,"I've been thinking of this question for a few months now, and all the talk about the elections have only made me think more about this, so here it goes.

Let's say there's a two-party system in a country, where P1 and P2 are the parties. Let's say I define a quantity called ""vote density"" for each of these parties, p1 and p2 - p1(x,y)dx dy would be the number of votes that the party P1 receives in an infinitesimal rectangular area of side lengths dx, dy, at the point (x,y), divided by the total population in that infinitesimal area- similar to a 2d probability density. The vote density p2(x,y) is defined in an analogous fashion. In general, there could be less than perfect voter turnout, so the sum of these voter densities, p1+p2 would be less than or equal to 1 for all (x,y).

Now let us say that the elections in this country work by splitting the country into smaller constituencies/counties. Whichever party gets higher votes in a particular county is declared the ""winner"" of that county, and whoever wins in the majority of the counties is declared the winner and forms the government. Further let us assume the vote density functions p1 and p2 are known, and that the county borders are given.

1) Let us define the total vote share of a party to be the integral of its vote density function. Can it be possible for party P1 to have a lesser vote share than party P2, but still win the elections - maybe in a way where P1 loses heavily in a select few counties and wins marginally in a larger number of counties, by virtue of which, the total vote share of P1 is lesser, but it is still declared the winner. What are the conditions for this to happen? 

2) Related to my above question, let's say the total vote share of P1 is less than that of P2. Can I always come up with a bordering of the counties such that P1 still manages to win? Or is there any ""critical vote share"" for P1, which if it fails to reach, no design of country borders can help it win? If yes, what is this critical vote share? If no, how do we construct such a county bordering?


3) Now let's say we only know the total vote shares of both the parties, and not the vote density functions themselves. I want to design my counties in such a way that leading in the vote share correlates to winning the elections - I wish to avoid a system where a party like P1, which has lower vote share, gets a ""rogue"" win due to a poor design of borders. Can I come up with an optimal county design which minimizes the chances of these ""rogue"" wins? If yes, under what conditions, and how do we design it? Does the chance of these rogue wins also depend on the voter turnout? That is, does a higher value of p1(x,y)+p2(x,y) result in lesser chances of rogue wins?


4) Do these questions also have answers for multi party systems?


Do any of these questions come under any particular field as such? Are there any resources to read more about these ideas? Also, I guess I haven't been too rigorous in formulating my problem, but I've tried to keep it as intuitive as possible.

math,"Next ""step"" after studying Ext groups.","I'm presenting to a small group of fellow graduate students on homological algebra in a few days. The loose structure is that we take turns studying a concept and then presenting it to the group. We've generally been trying to follow Gelfand and Manin's Methods on Homological Algebra, though we've jumped around the book a bit, and some have taught concepts in different ways than what is presented in the book. So, our structure is pretty loose, if that makes sense.

Two weeks ago I talked about chain complexes and resolutions (with an emphasis on projective resolutions). Last week, someone built off of this defining Ext using projective resolutions and proved that any two different projective resolutions give isomorphic groups. Now, my question: Where should I take it from there?

Gelfand and Manin don't define Ext groups until they construct the derived category. This construction is obviously quite in-depth, and it would take me weeks, if not a month, to parse through the details, build up the derived category, then redefine Ext groups and progress the class further. So, the deeper meaning behind my question is: Is there a good place to take the class from our current ""naive"" definition of Ext groups without diving head-first into the category-theory side of things? Or is the next natural progression going to entail us fully embracing category theory, in which case it makes sense to take several weeks carefully defining the derived category?

I emailed the professor who technically ""runs"" the class (mostly, he only attends and lets us run things). He suggested I could discuss taking the category of complexes and considering morphisms up to homotopy. Then, talk about the mapping cone of a morphism. This feels to me like we'd still be embracing the category theory of things, but side stepping a lot of important details. In this case, it feels better to me to follow Gelfand and Manin and begin constructing the derived category, since that's where we'd be winding up anyway.

So, my question seems to be: Is the next natural step to embrace category theory head-on, let it take what time it may? Or is there a natural way to continue the class without embracing the category theory of things? (Thus far, people have been avoiding heavy doses of category theory).",DevilDuckTy,1gko2wd,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gko2wd/next_step_after_studying_ext_groups/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gko2wd/next_step_after_studying_ext_groups/,2024-11-06 02:25:35,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gko2wd
math,How would you nurture a young child’s natural interest in mathematics? ,"Edit: Thanks everyone. Some really great suggestions!

Asking on behalf of my 2, almost 3 year old. 

He is speech-delayed and recently diagnosed with ASD. He is absolutely obsessed with numbers and addition/subtraction and has been for the past 1.5 years. He gets very anxious with basic everyday things, but numbers and shapes really mellow him out for some reason. He definitely has a strong natural interest in it, so I’d like to help him with that. 

Neither his father or I are super mathematically-inclined, and I’m drawing blanks here. Simply counting to 100 with him is now boring for him and I can tell he’s over it. Some other things he likes are organising cereal into sets of 5s / 10s / 20s etc. He’ll count the sets, add them together, and move them between different containers. He counts/organises everything around the house; shoes, articles of clothing, squares on the window pane etc. I’ll give him a bunch of vegetables to play with while I’m making dinner and he’ll add the potatoes, take some away etc. Also loves shapes and moves his little magnet triangles together to make “diamonds” and so on. He refers to everyday objects as shapes , eg he calls my phone the “rectangle” and his playpen “hexagon” and coins are “circles” 

He also loves planets and everything related to
space. He gathers balls of various sizes (basketballs, golf balls, bouncy balls etc) and lines them up, pretending they are the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus etc. up until Pluto. He seems to know a bit about each one like Saturn has “icy rings” and Neptunes “windy”, Mars is the “red one”. I got him play dough and he mixed colours together and made little planets out of it. I had to google what the planets actually looked like and he was actually spot on. I think he maybe learned this from watching Blues Clues, not entirely sure tbh because he can’t speak in sentences and only has a handful of words. 

But anyways, I feel like 95% of the games he plays are focused around maths/space and I’d like to encourage that, but struggling to come up with how. I ask him questions but he can’t answer me. 

Would really appreciate any ideas/suggestions on what I could do with him, or even where to begin as a grown adult to improve my math skills to, in turn, help him? He is so eager to learn.

math,XMJR,"So, just to warn you, the content of this post is admittedly a very low-stakes issue and in fact I'm not even sure about exactly what the question I want to ask is.

Basically the thing is: what the heck is the XJMR community? By XJMR I mean www.econjobrumors.com.

It has happened to me a few times, when googling some math related topic, to bump into a post in XJMR. Over time I started to develop a sort of zoologic interest in the species that seems to populate that forum, or more specifically the sub-forums concerned with academic mathematics.

If I had to describe my impressions of the community that inhabits those sub-forums in a couple of sentences, I would say that they seem to share two traits that I find it hard to imagine together in a single individual, namely: they seem to be pretty shallow, superficial people who have a hard time taking seriously any life pursuit that is not money or women; *and* they seem to spend lots of time researching and gossiping about the mathematics academic job market (even though they are mostly, if not only, ""outsiders"").

Am I the only one who finds this combination peculiar? As an example, some time ago there was a topic about some rumour that Ashwin Sah, the renowned combinatorics star under Yufei Zhao, was moving to industry. People were speculating about why that was, and one of the comments was:

""Combinatorics is a low-prestige field. Mostly just tricks, not big ideas. At some point a man realizes that any endeavour in life which doesn't make big money, get women or achieve high-status is basically pointless, and I'm glad AS came to this realization at such a young age.""

So here we have somebody who is shallow enough to believe that ""any endeavour in life which doesn't make big money, get women or achieve high-status is basically pointless"", while at the same time making clear that they have some non-trivial inside knowledge of math research. Now, don't get me wrong; I don't think that combinatorics is a ""low-prestige field"" because there are no ""big ideas"", but it does have that reputation and it's an opinion that only someone familiar with the math research community could possibly have.

So... who exactly are these people?

Packers haven't invented 0 yet. They haven't even invented 1! In fact, they don’t need the concept of ""one"" much in their system. There's no need to say ""I ate one fish"" when they can simply say ""I ate fish"". (The fact that it's easier for them to multiply than to add has also had an impact).

Packers can't yet write large prime numbers, like 101 or 10,501, because they would have to draw a huge shape to represent them! Even writing 17 or 19 would be quite difficult if they only used convex shapes.

So packers use non-convex shapes too!

Many years later, some packer noticed that large prime numbers look suspiciously symmetric.

So this packer improved the notation system and made it clearer.

Later, another packer simplified this system even more, deciding that there was no point in writing the same shapes twice.

This packer was the first in their culture to declare that ""a dot isolated from a number"" should also be considered a number. The packer called this dot ""the wonderful number that's less than two"".

Many years later, another packer made an important innovation: the ""dot isolation"" could be repeated multiple times as long as the result remained odd. When the result became even, it could undergo a ""two isolation"" (division by two). The final result will be a series of dots and twos.

Here's an example for the number 60:

This invention led to the creation of a binary system based on one and two, which had a significant impact on the technological advancement of packers.

math,I plotted the complex roots of an arbitrary cubic polynomial on the complex plane.,"[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cy3agqh4du](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cy3agqh4du)

The result is kind of fun to watch. Roots collide, split, and repel as the coefficients vary. If anyone wants to tinker, let me know if there are any interesting axes to jointly vary coefficients by that produce interesting behaviors. The following are the same code, but just with different combinations of varying parameters/different offsets, and I would be interested in seeing if varying specific expressions (e.g. the discriminant) would produce illuminating paths for the roots.

(I also found out today that Desmos has a complex plotter now... would have been helpful a while ago lol but this seems to be pretty stable regardless.)

math,Books that explain Limits 'intuitively',"I am reading Prelude to Numbers and Mathematician's Delight by W.W Sawyer. And thanks to some internet troll I discovered Professor Gowers's blog where I stumbled upon [this article ](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/what-maths-a-level-doesnt-necessarily-give-you/#more-4693)which concludes with ""...the general principle that if you forget about understanding what’s going on and concentrate on mechanical manipulations, you’ll forget how to do even the mechanical manipulations."" 

1. This led me to wonder if there are books that intuitively build the idea of limits (and the implications of this idea and so on) without requiring the student to have encountered Analysis.   
  
2. Alternatively, I was wondering if there are books/pathways that circumvent limits entirely by approaching calculus through some other way. Maybe nonstandard calculus?   
  
3. Or is there a way to introduce someone not at the undergraduate level to Analysis in a way that helps them understand Limits better?! I am groping in the dark so maybe this is all very absurd to even ask. 

So far, from the r/math FAQ I found ""Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach"" by Keisler"" which might fit the bill. 

Lastly, I realize that Mir Publishers, AMS, Dover among others have books that intuitively build various mathematical ideas. I was hoping to hear about your favorite books of this nature (could be about any topic, not just calculus or limits).

PS: Also would ""The Metaphysical Principles of the Infinitesimal Calculus"" by René Guénon be a worthwhile read while on this subject?

math,Mathematics Summer School ,"I am surprised by the fact that there is so little opportunity for interested people to do mathematics over the summer. It is incredibly busy during term time but in summer there is a void with nothing to do. It is particularly bad in the UK where active lectures and seminars only run for 20 weeks a year(the rest is self study but I would still prefer more term time). I remember feeling a great hunger for studying in summer but I had nowhere to go apart from books and internet, and while they are a good way to study, they can't replace a live community and education. There are some math related opportunities in summer around the world but the list is honestly not very inspiring.

I want to setup an online summer school for people interested in doing more maths over the summer. It would involve courses mostly for school students and undergrads. But I don't think graduates and postdocs would find this useful since they are likely too busy with their own projects. It would also try to create a sense of community with discussions, group projects, and active engagement(which could all be done very easily with discord). I expect that the courses would be run by more experienced people who want to earn some cash, such as graduates or late undergrads, but all people should be welcome to run their course, including professors and postdocs. A big part of it would probably have to be volunteering but at the same time, I could expect a few dozen students from all over the world to enroll in a 5 week course(say) for a hundred bucks, which would make some good money for whoever's running the course while lecturing for only 3 hours a week.

People from less mathematically specialised universities could catch up with maths they are missing on, like analysis courses, while people from more specialised places could delve in topics that their university doesn't have courses in. High schoolers could get into olympiad mathematics or get a taste of university mathematics.

math,Spot it - but with three cards?,"Most of you probably know the math behind the ""[Spot it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobble)""/""Dobble"" game. If not, read about it [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36798/what-is-the-math-behind-the-game-spot-it).   
tl;dr: The cards are designed after the finite projective plane of order 7. Each card is equivalent to a line, each symbol on the card to a point and because two lines meet in exactly one point, two cards (=lines) will always have exactly one symbol (=point) in common.

Over the weekend I was thinking how to make this game harder. **Can you have n cards with k symbols on each of it such that the intersection of any three cards is exactly one symbol, but the intersection of only two cards is more than one symbol?** I read a lot about [Block design ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design)and [Combinatorial design ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design)and I am still not sure how to tackle this problem. I don't think a ""t=3-block design"" is what I am searching for because this would just make each triple of symbols occur on only one card - this is not what I am searching for.  
  
The only non-trivial solution I could think of is 4 cards with 4 symbols: 123, 124, 134, 234. If you pick any three cards here, all of those will have all symbols except one, so the intersection is 4-3 symbols.   
I have a gut feeling that larger solutions might not be possible, because for large n, there are many more way to choose 3 cards out of n as there are for choosing 2 cards out of n and therefore, the ""intersection is 1 symbol""-condition is much more restrictive.

So, are there larger non-trivial solutions you could use to design a similiar, harder game? What exact ""combinatorical design"" term do I need to search for?

math,Question about a reducible complexity,"I'm a high school student who was thinking about tetration, pentation, etc. the other day and was curious if there was a more precise way to define them.

1. f(n,k,a,b)=f(n,1,a,f(n,k-1,a,b)

2. f(n,1,a,b)=f(n-1,b-1,a,a)

3. f(1,1,a,b)=a+b

I'm pretty happy in general; the function derives multiplication, exponentiation, etc. on its own with the form f(n,1,a,b), with n=2 equaling a\*b, n=3 equaling a\^b, etc. However, the k is just a result of my process in reducing the function and is not in the input.

They all link to this youtube link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWZAOLDLjw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWZAOLDLjw)

And it seems it's not just there. This guy is all over Gower's website:

I just clicked in a random of these and they seem to be pasting some other youtube link,

And at the end I'm pretty sure it's the same guy:

There're more from Gower's website but I can only put 20 images here. Is this some sort of AI?

I originally noticed something strange when I saw every single comments under Terrence Tao's blog got 16 dislikes.

The Victor Porton guy from one of the image seemed a little off. But I don't see how he would be motivated to do this.

Who's actually behind this all? Why do they do this?

**Update:**

I got a screenshot of the username who made the comments that were deleted on Terrence Tao's website. They seem to be still spamming there but some precautions seems to be taken. When I hit refresh these comments go away.

I also found this comment, which just seems random and not that offensive, except for the profile picture, and when you click on the profile you can see the updated username that directly attacks Terrence's current work...

math,I love Hartshorne!!,"I think Hartshorne's algebraic geometry book is one of the best math books I've ever read. It's somehow so enjoyable that these days I just want to go around telling all my friends to read this book even if they are not math majors lol. For a long time I avoided it due to its notoriety and read Vakil's *Rising Sea* and Liu's *Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves* instead, but both of them never clicked for me. Vakil's book has way too many exercises that disrupt the flow of the book, and somehow I feel like I never know where he is trying to go. I've only read the first few pages of Liu's book, but I remember it being extremely dense and confusing to read. After struggling with AG for so long, I decided to bite the bullet last summer and read Hartshorne from the start, doing most of its exercises. And I regret so much not doing this earlier because this book really changed how I see AG. To me his style of writing is so much clearer than the two authors before, and I also found most of his exercises really enjoyable to work on. I've only read up to the middle of chapter 3, but this is already much further than I got in the other two books. I'd recommend anyone starting to learn AG to at least try reading Hartshorne and see if it fits your style of learning or not instead of completely avoiding it like me at the start.",attnnah_whisky,1gipuf4,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gipuf4/i_love_hartshorne/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gipuf4/i_love_hartshorne/,2024-11-03 15:47:53,167,0.92,167,0,30,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gipuf4

Unfortunately, though, I’m not aware of an autosave feature in VSCode, so if you forget to push your work to GitHub or your computer crashes, you risk losing a lot of progress.

  
By the way, **I feel a BURNING hatred in my heart for dealing with inserting figures in Beamer** presentations and I absolutely hate making Tikz figures, but I have a fondness for the Madrid theme because the first math class I ever took used it.

math,Need Advice: Should I Keep Building My “Web of Mathematics and Physics” Project After Finding TGView?,"I’ve been working on a project to build an interactive web of mathematics and physics—a kind of hierarchical map that shows how different concepts and theories connect.

Here’s the thing: I’ve become completely obsessed with this project. I can’t stop working on it, and I even lose sleep because my mind keeps drifting back to it. It’s pulled me away from my usual work in writing, and I’m constantly thinking about these connections and jotting them down.

But now, after discovering TGView, which already does something similar with visualizing mathematical relationships, I’m wondering if my project brings enough unique value to keep going. Maybe my focus on mapping “gaps” and inclusion chains could make it different enough, but I’m honestly not sure. I’m starting to think that maybe I should step back and go back to my writing.

math,Set Theory Multiverse vs Mathematical Truth - Philosophical Discussion,"#

I've been thinking about the set theory multiverse and its philosophical implications, particularly regarding mathematical truth. While I understand the pragmatic benefits of the multiverse view, I'm struggling with its philosophical implications.

The multiverse view suggests that statements like the Continuum Hypothesis aren't absolutely true or false, but rather true in some set-theoretic universes and false in others. We have:

- Gödel's Constructible Universe (L) where CH is true
- Forcing extensions where CH is false
- Various universes with different large cardinal axioms

However, I find myself appealing to basic logical principles like the law of non-contradiction. Even if we can't currently prove certain axioms, doesn't this just reflect our epistemological limitations rather than implying all axioms are equally ""true""?

To make an analogy: physical theories being underdetermined by evidence doesn't mean reality itself is underdetermined. Similarly, our inability to prove CH doesn't necessarily mean it lacks a definite truth value.

Questions I'm wrestling with:
1. What makes certain axioms ""true"" beyond mere consistency?
2. Is there a meaningful distinction between mathematical existence and consistency?
3. Can we maintain mathematical realism while acknowledging the practical utility of the multiverse approach?
4. How do we reconcile Platonism with independence results?

I'm leaning towards a view that maintains objective mathematical truth while explaining why we need to work with multiple models pragmatically. But I'm very interested in hearing other perspectives, especially from those who work in set theory or mathematical logic.",wenitte,1gh5997,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gh5997/set_theory_multiverse_vs_mathematical_truth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gh5997/set_theory_multiverse_vs_mathematical_truth/,2024-11-01 13:22:10,26,0.71,26,0,79,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gh5997

math,When is the “path length” function continuous?,"Every once in a while, a “proof” that pi = 4 makes the rounds on the internet. The gist is that you inscribe a circle in a square, and then slowly collapse the square path around the circle while keeping it rectilinear, so the square path keeps a total length of 4. Since it converges uniformly to the circular path, people assume that the path lengths must converge as well, and thus pi = 4.

Of course, the mistake here is assuming that just because the paths p_n converge to p, the lengths length(p_n) converge to length(p). It’s common that stronger modes of convergence guarantee stronger properties of the limit, like convergence in probability vs. almost everywhere. For these paths, we at least have uniform convergence. My question is: does there exist, or can we describe, a mode of convergence for the paths that actually does guarantee convergence of the lengths, i.e. makes the length function continuous?",hydmar,1ggjmh9,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ggjmh9/when_is_the_path_length_function_continuous/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ggjmh9/when_is_the_path_length_function_continuous/,2024-10-31 17:10:29,52,0.87,52,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ggjmh9

For this discussion, we will ignore the way that Nebraska and Maine divide their Electoral College votes (I don't think this adds much in terms of complexity to the problem, but I didn't want to think too much about it). I am also ignoring faithless electors.

The running theory is that 1, 2, 536, and 537 are still impossible, unless we consider Maine and Nebraska, in which case everything works.
 And I am certain that there are more numbers which one cannot hit, but I'm not sure, and I'm not sure if there is an efficient means to check.

 As described, I believe that this is just a variation of the[ subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem), which does not bode well for finding a solution. I have written up some inefficient Python code that I fear will not end, since it just checks all possible sums. I have also considered trying to implement the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I'm not sure that could even help. My question then is, is there a quick (re: polynomial time) way to figure out which values are IMPOSSIBLE to hit, or perhaps a way that I can prune out some of the states (for instance, if they were superfluous) which could make a brute force quicker? Any advice is greatly appreciated. This has been eating away at me, and I have more pressing things to worry about, haha!

math,Wikipedia’s class existence theorem for NBG,"On the wiki page for [NBG set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory#Class_existence_theorem), it states and proves the Class existence theorem as:

Let ϕ(x1,…,xn,Y1,…,Ym) be a formula that quantifies only over sets and contains no free variables other than x1,…,xn,Y1,…,Ym (not necessarily all of these). Then for all Y1,…,Ym, there exists a unique class A of n-tuples such that:∀x1⋯∀xn\[(x1,…,xn)∈A⟺ϕ(x1,…,xn,Y1,…,Ym)\].

Dealing with tuples seems to overcomplicate things though, and this is the only source I have seen this theorem stated like this. Is this not equivalent to the tupleless version:

Let ϕ(x,Y1,…,Ym) be a formula that quantifies only over sets and contains no free variables other than x,Y1,…,Ym (not necessarily all of these). Then for all Y1,…,Ym, there exists a unique class A such that:∀x\[x∈A⟺ϕ(x,Y1,…,Ym)\].

Since, if we want a class of n-tuples that satisfy some predicate ϕ, we can just instead use the predicate ""∃x1,...,∃xn\[x=(x1,...,xn) ∧ ϕ\]"" (basically, we tack on the statement ""x is an n-tuple"" before ϕ). This seems like it would significantly simplify both the statement of the theorem and the proof of the theorem, so I'm wondering why Wikipedia does not do this?",Warheadd,1gfzjds,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gfzjds/wikipedias_class_existence_theorem_for_nbg/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gfzjds/wikipedias_class_existence_theorem_for_nbg/,2024-10-30 22:42:47,10,0.86,10,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gfzjds

math,Exploring Solvable and Unsolvable Equations with Python's SymPy,"As an applied scientist, I learned to ""solve"" y = x² and get x = ±√y. But I was never taught that you can't solve y = x −c sin(x) and get a nice equation. (That's always bugged me. Why isn't it taught?)

To really understand closed-form solvability, you apparently need advanced mathematics (e.g. Galois theory). Instead of that, I cheated and used Python's free SymPy package to search for unsolvable equations.

What surprised me:

* Kepler’s Equation, y = x −c sin(x), is wonderfully simple.
* Lambert’s W function is invaluable when your mathematical model includes exp or log (but not both).
* SymPy is excellent but may not match WolframAlpha in some cases.
* Mixing trigonometric functions with other terms frequently prevents closed-form solutions.
* When closed-form solutions remain out of reach, we can rely on plotting and numerical methods.

I've written up details in a (free) article: [Explore Solvable and Unsolvable Equations with Python | Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/explore-solvable-and-unsolvable-equations-with-python-661ac11f4f20).

math,"If irrational numbers are infinitely long and without a pattern, can we refer to any single one of them in decimal form through speech or writing?","**EDIT: I know that not all irrational numbers are without a pattern (thank you to /u/Abdiel_Kavash for the correction).  This question refers just to the ones that don't have a pattern and are random.**

Putting aside any irrational numbers represented by a symbol like pi or sqrt(2), is there any way to refer to an irrational number in decimal form through speech or through writing?

If they go on forever and are without a pattern, any time we stop at a number after the decimal means we have just conveyed a rational number, and so we must keep saying numbers for an infinitely long time to properly convey a single irrational number.  However, since we don't have unlimited time, is there any way to actually say/write these numbers?

Would this also mean that it is technically impossible to select a truly random number since we would not be able to convey an irrational in decimal form and since the probability of choosing a rational is basically 0?

math,"I realized ""inventing math"" as a child isn't really *that* impressive","If you read any biographies of famous scientists, you probably stumbled upon the ""he/I invented this thing as a child out of curiosity, only to realize it was already a thing"" and it's usually followed up by the narrator explaining some complex idea that the mathematician/physicist stumbled over like operator calculus.

I would read/hear these anecdotes in amazement, kinda pondering how much better these geniuses were than the rest of us which mostly absorb things we're taught in school and don't care about anything else. Honestly, it would kinda depress me, knowing that all the great people were inventing calculus in 4th grade while I was making redstone chicken farms in minecraft.

Then I stopped to kinda think about it. Then it hit me, I, and probably most of you, got pretty close as well. For example, I distinctly remember thinking about circles in 4th or 5th grade (whenever it is you learn how to calculate the surface of a square/rectangle). I thought about this annoying stupid circular shape and how you could never calculate its surface because of its disturbing smooth perimeter.

It annoyed me to such an extent that I tried to figure out a way to do it. I thought about what the closest thing to a circle was for which I could calculate an area, and well, it was a square. Not very close, but it would do. So I put my square in the circle, and noticed it filled up most of it but the edges were missing. So I tried putting the cubes in a sort of circular shape, and ended up with 13 cubes filling the circle. It still didn't fit, but I sort of realized that the smaller the cubes got the better the ""pixelized"" circle would align to the perfectly smooth one. 

Of course I didn't know it at the time, but I got pretty close to getting the idea of limits and how some values can approach others to the point where they are practically the same thing.

When I reached the limit of my own capacities at the time, I approached my teacher with the idea and she told me it wasn't something we should be doing now and that my efforts would be better spent elsewhere. So I kinda forgot about it until our current calculus teacher mentioned the rearrangement proof for the area of a circle. While little-me's idea was a lot less elegant I was kinda there.

I don't think it was that brilliant of an idea, honestly. I just wish someone would've pushed me to do stuff like that more often and really look into them. I feel like the difference between most people and the greats is that they just had someone like that in their life, be it a real person or, well, just autism lol.",zZEpicSniper303Zz,1gdez3t,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdez3t/i_realized_inventing_math_as_a_child_isnt_really/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdez3t/i_realized_inventing_math_as_a_child_isnt_really/,2024-10-27 16:32:37,61,0.97,61,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gdez3t
math,Can you formulate Fourier analysis without complex numbers?,Multiplying complex numbers leads to rotations which can be easily seen by simply multiplying (a+bi)(c+di). But can we completely get rid of the imaginary numbers and still get all the results of Fourier analysis? The main idea of Fourier analysis is that any shift transformation has complex exponential eigenfunctions. But for a vector v=x+y where v is in the top right quadrant a counterclockwise rotation requires the length of x to decrease while the length of y increases. Typically the y dimension is imaginary but if we view complex numbers as just a 2D vector with real components then multiplying a vector by a complex number is just the tensor product of vectors correct forming a 2x2 matrix correct? We can see this from distributing (a+bi)(c+di) that the imaginary components combine to be real and the mixing of real and imaginary turn imaginary. This is essentially non-zero off-diagonal entries in a matrix since components in one space are affecting the other space. Wouldn't this mean that any construct involving e^ix can be reformulated in terms of simple tensor products of vectors where every number involved is real?,LemonLimeNinja,1gdexdf,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdexdf/can_you_formulate_fourier_analysis_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdexdf/can_you_formulate_fourier_analysis_without/,2024-10-27 16:30:33,39,0.9,39,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gdexdf

math,A few questions regarding Baby Rudin and the Process of Studying Mathematics ,"We are using Baby Rudin in my undergraduate real analysis course and to be honest I feel like a complete idiot.  I asked my professor about how long we should expect each homework problem to take and it was implied that sometimes it could take days.  It has indeed taken me quite some time  to “solve” many of the problems.  I use quotation marks because more often than not, I have to rely on other sources to help me solve them.  I am curious as to if I am the only one who has struggled in this regard.  Is it indeed normal to wrestle with a problem for days?  Should I be able to solve all of these problems on my own without external consultation?  I struggle to envision myself having come up with many of the solutions to said problems.  When my professor has gone over a few of them, the answers seem to come so naturally to him.  

I feel guilty for having to rely on external help as it feels like one should be able to figure the problems out by oneself.

Also, is it common for math exams in advanced courses (such as those at the graduate level) to be based off of the homework?  I have an upcoming test in my real analysis course and am concerned as to how to prepare.  The professor said it would be based off of the homework assignments so I was curious as to how common this is.

I hope this is appropriate for this forum.  If not, I apologize.

math,Generating ternary pseudo-gray code,"I'm trying to generate a full factorial list of different combinations of input states to use for unit testing some logic. The reason this is ternary and not binary is that what I'm actually interested in testing is the different combinations of transitions of each input. So I've defined by states is: 0 = rising, 1 = falling, 2 = high. I've not included a low state because in the case that one or more inputs is remaining low, the problem would be reduced to lower order. The reason I've called it pseudo-gray code is that the previous state of an input limits what it's next state can be (i.e. an input cannot be falling or rising for two consecutive codes).

The rules could be summarized as follows:

|Prev State|Next State|
|:-|:-|
|0 (rising)|1 or 2|
|1 (falling)|0|
|2 (high)|1 or 2|

I believe it may still be some form of gray code since after the transition rules are enforced, only one state should be changing and the full list at the end should have no repeats.

For example, a case with 2 inputs is fairly straightforward to construct manually:



|States|
|:-|
|00|
|21|
|10|
|02|
|12|
|01|
|20|
|11|



Note that there is no 22 case because I'm only interested in cases where at least one state is changing, though I think that is not a hard requirement as that case could easily be removed after the fact. I believe it wouldn't be too difficult to manually generate this for 3 inputs, however, I will need to generate these combinations for at least up 6 inputs and the problem grows quite quickly.

I realize trying to treat this as gray code may not be the best approach and that this may better posed as some sort of directed graph problem, so I'm certainly open to any suggestion on better approaches.

So I guess my primary questions are: is it reasonable to treat this problem as a gray code generation problem? If so, is there anything like this I'd be able to reference to come up with an algorithm that fits my needs? If not, what would be a better approach to take for this problem?

Bonus question: It's possible in the future I'd be interested in extending this to include more states, i.e. m-ary states with n inputs. Does a pseudo-gray code approach or some other approach lend itself better to that extension?",MadRoboticist,1gbagck,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gbagck/generating_ternary_pseudogray_code/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gbagck/generating_ternary_pseudogray_code/,2024-10-24 19:01:03,5,0.66,5,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gbagck

math,confused with local coordinates notation(manifolds),"suppose f is a function from manifold M to R. my professor keeps saying f depends on local coordinates x1 ... xn and writes f(x1...xn). I feel like this is informal and confusing. I feel like saying that f*phi**^(-1)* *(for a chart U, phi arpund p, say) depends on x1 ... xn is accurate. he also uses chain rule very informally. suppose we have a curve g R to M, and a function M to R. he would write f*g and differentiate it as though both f and g were functions from domains in Rn for some n, ie he uses normal chain rule theorem.

math,Question about 3 different but related sums of reciprocals,"So the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_sums\_of\_reciprocals) lists these three known sums:

A. The sum of the reciprocals of the [perfect powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_power#Examples_and_sums) (including duplicates) is 1 .  
  
B. The sum of the reciprocals of the [perfect powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_power#Examples_and_sums) (excluding duplicates) is approximately 0.8745 .  
  
C. The [Goldbach–Euler theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%E2%80%93Euler_theorem) states that the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers that are 1 less than a perfect power (excluding duplicates) is 1 .

I might be interpreting these three facts incorrectly, but does this imply that taking some function ""unique(x)"" and apply it to the terms in series A is somehow perfectly undone by taking each term in the denominators of the resulting series (B) and subtracting 1 from each? At least in terms of their sums.

Why do these two operations appear to be so perfectly matched? Is there some symmetry I don't see?

math,"So, what the hell even is geometry?","Stats/probability guy here. Naturally, I'm pretty removed from the more abstract areas of math. I recently came across [this picture of Spec(Z\[x\]) ](https://pbelmans.ncag.info/assets/mumforddrawing.jpg)from Mumford's Red Book. Reading up more about schemes in algebraic geometry, I struggled to understand how they can be considered geometric objects. Not knowing much about AG, I always thought that it just studies the geometry of zeros of polynomial equations. But having seen the post-modern approach with schemes and the like, it seems like I simply had no idea what *geometry* really means. 

  
Ask any middle schooler what geometry is, they all will give the same answer: shapes! Euclidean geometry studies shapes and lines on R\^2 (which is a nice model for Euclid's postulates). Relaxing some of these postulates brings us to spherical/hyperbolic/whatever geometry which still seems geometric in nature. Generalizing further, we have differential geometry, which studies ""curvy shapes"". Algebraic geometry studies curvy (?) shapes defined through polynomials? Sure, pretty geometric, makes sense. But wait. It also studies rings? And [things that look like a bunch of points and some weird line that goes through those points](https://i.sstatic.net/XIR2d.png)? 

So, one can say that geometry studies 'rigid' objects in spaces. Let's take that to mean topological spaces, which provide the most general notion of ""space"" and being able to tell points apart. Can we get a unifying definition of geometry out of this? 

  
[nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometry) provides a pretty good starting point: 

&gt;the term *geometry* is used in much greater generality for the study of *spaces* equipped with extra “geometrical” structure of a large variety of sorts

Let's ignore the tautology and say that geometry studies topological spaces with some extra structure. What are the implications of this?

1) Euclidean, hyperbolic, differential, etc geometry is still geometry because R\^n / manifolds / whatever are topological spaces with additional structure. Sure, I agree with this

2) Algebraic geometry is geometry (yes, even the scheme kind). Besides the (Zariski I guess?) topology there is an additional structure on schemes. 

3) Metric spaces are geometric in nature. There's the metric + the induced topology. Sounds about right. 

4) *Literally everything that isn't topology is geometry if you're pedantic enough?*  Ok, how did we get here? Take any ""set with extra structure"" and put a topology on it, say the discrete one. Boom, there you have it. 

Even without the boring point above, there are many things that are topological spaces with extra structure that  isn't geometric in nature. 

Do we have a better definition of geometry that includes all the fields of math that have geometry in their name, and excludes all others? I know I'm grossly overthinking this, but what even is geometry?

math,Finding the smallest rectangle that perfectly fits all tetris blocks,"I am working on an application that takes a bunch of tetris bocks and fits them into a rectangular board perfectly (meaning every space on the board is covered by a tetris block and no two tetris blocks overlap). Is there a formula that can only provide me the size of the smallest board that can fit all tetris blocks? 

I am not interested in how the tetris blcoks will fit (that will be the job of the person who has to use my application). I only want to know the width and height of the space that can perfectly fit all of them. Also, is there an algorithm that can do the reverse? Meaning, given a grid square of some size, it can provide me all different combinations of distinct tetris blocks (two tetris blocks are distinct if they can never be the same via rotation, reflection is not allowed) that can fit it? This will allow me to generate random tetris puzzles in my application.

To clarify the last bit, here is an example:

There is a board of size 4x4 -&gt; Collection A has 4 blocks that can fit it perfectly, Collection B has 5 blocks that can fit it perfectly (some pieces in B might be the same as A but not all of them are the same), and so on.",zimmer550king,1ga00nm,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ga00nm/finding_the_smallest_rectangle_that_perfectly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ga00nm/finding_the_smallest_rectangle_that_perfectly/,2024-10-23 02:34:04,19,0.89,19,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ga00nm

But we’re not being asked to prove anything in class. Our professor comes from an applied math background and he is definitely teaching us the expected stuff but the actual work we’re doing is minimal and straight up unrelated. For instance, in class we learned the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem while going over sequences. Did he prove it? No. He just gave an analogy about infinite people in a room and we can cut the room in half, etc. What was the homework? Find what the nth fibonacci number is asymptotic to. It’s almost endearing because it seems like he’s under the assumption that we’d be able to prove these things no problem, but I’m not so sure.

math,Restriction Sheaf in Hartshorne vs Other Sources,"In Hartshorne, the restriction sheaf of a sheaf F on a topological space X to a subspace Z is the \*deep breath\* sheafification of the inverse image presheaf of the inclusion of X into Z, and is denoted as F|\_Z (but for now I'll denote it as i\^-1F as Hartshorne does for the inverse image presheaf of a continuous map to distinguish them).

On the other hand, I've seen that if Z is an open subset, then the restriction sheaf F|\_Z is defined by F|\_Z(U)=F(U) if U is contained in Z.

Why are i\^-1F and F|\_Z isomorphic if Z is an open set?

Right now, the way I am practicing for making AIME is going through past AMCs, going through the problems, and spending time on them.  I aim to do at least 3-4 problems per session total, and I try to learn something new with each problem to make sure that I am not repeating only what I know.  I have also learned a bit from the AOPS vol. 1 textbook, but I no longer have access to it now.  I also go to math competitions my school hosts very often, and I learn from the mistakes I made on those.

The thing is, I am very fond of doing competition math and I enjoy it, but I can only invest maybe 30 min - 1 hour everyday for it due to other commitments. Some days I might not be able to do it, and it’s probably something I can put 2-4 hours a week in for.

My questions are:

1. Is this enough to make AIME in 1-2 years?  I likely won’t be able to do 3-4 hours a week pace in 11th grade, but I can for sophomore year.
2. Is the AOPS textbook necessary for making AIME, or will learning from past problems suffice?

math,Rank-Nullity Theorem and Euler's Characteristic in Graph Theory ,"I have read a couple textbooks regarding Linear Algebra, I noticed a footnote in one of them on the Rank Nullity Theorem, claiming that, and I will repeat it verbatim: 

""If you’ve taken any graph theory, you may have learned about the Euler Characteristic χ = V −E +F. There are theorems which tell us how the Euler characteristic must behave. Surprisingly, the Rank-Nullity Theorem is another manifestation of this fact, but you will probably have to go to graduate school to see why.""

math,Best books for a second pass through analysis?,"I'm just about done with Abbott's Understanding Analysis, and I think it's been a great aid in helping to build up intuition for analysis. That said, now that I have a reasonable conceptual grasp, my goal is to find a book to serve as a follow-up that can help to really nail down the rigorous aspect.

I've seen a few threads similar to this question, but most of them seem concerned with books for the topics *after* those covered in Abbott, so I'll clarify exactly what I'm looking for and what I'm trying to avoid. 

I'm not interested in moving on yet to more advanced topics; I really would like a book that goes over the fundamentals, just perhaps in more depth than Abbott. However, I also would like to avoid a complete retread of what I've already covered; ideally it would introduce a handful of new topics alongside a more challenging treatment of the basics.  
  
Some specific books that I've heard of and am considering / looking for opinions on are: 

* Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin
* Real Mathematical Analysis by Charles Pugh
* Mathematical Analysis by Tom Apostol

math,Software tools for mathematics research collaboration,"Hello r/math,

I was recently having a conversation with a graduate student where they admonished the disorganization between themselves and their advisor. From what I gathered, there were several reasons for this but the most major one was that their advisor travels quite a bit and they frequently resorted to zoom calls to talk about progress.  

I wanted to give some advice, but I realized that I myself didn't have a perfect solution (their advisor supposedly cares *a lot* about getting scooped), so I figured this might be a good discussion to have on r/rmath. 

* What tools do you use to keep track of research in a distant, albeit private, collaborative environment? 
* How do you keep track of things like dead-ends? An interesting answer to this question might go beyond typing up meeting notes in a tex file.
* How do you share sources? For example, collaboratively marking up a PDF of an article you found on  arXiv.

math,Maths became trivial,"After I transitioned from undergraduate to graduate, I noticed a complete downgrade in mathematical level. 

I'm now in a generalist engineering school, and the biggest part of student come from the same track as me (Mathematics-heavy undergrad). 

The volume of lessons has augmented little bit (notions are introduced at a higher pace). However, the level of thinking, analysis and problem solving plumetted. During sections, exercises all seem trivial. They are just direct application of the lessons and feel like I dumbed down to the very beginning of my first year in higher education...

The demonstrations in class also seem slow. 

Bizarrely, I'm not supposed to be good : selection process toward higher-level schools are reliable, and I failed them. The fact that I come from a majoritarly Mathematical background must play however. 

I now take lessons in English (not my first language), and the cursus is somehow supposed to be at the very least compliment to what is teached in international universities.

math,Advice on ways to get to know professors?,"Let me preface by saying that I know that this has been asked plenty, yet the advice is always typical and I've still been struggling with being able to properly establish a connection with my professors.

The most commonly touted advice is to go visit professors during their office hours, often being prepared to perhaps discuss their research or the like --it doesn't exactly work that way for nearly all my mathematics and statistics courses. On average, my classes have 200-300 people in them; the office hours are once a week, 1 hour long, and therefore filled with people. Almost certainly there will be a long line to your front and your back; the professors need to operate like a conveyor belt: ask your question, get an answer, step out of line --there is no time to ""chat"", discuss, or anything. Admittedly, I've seen this advice work for some of my friends as they have been able to cultivate stronger relationships and converse with their professors via office hours. However, these friends are not in mathematics; commonly I see this in Philosophy departments, which I feel that by the nature of the subject itself, makes those who teach it more likely to be open to conversation.

Granted, I still go to office hours nevertheless; it's helped in the fact that the professors now recognize me and know my name, but that's about it.

Now of course the next step is to email them, though most of my professors have strict policies against that too. Technically, according to some of my syllabi, I can't even send an email regarding questions on course content; only things of upmost personal emergency are to be expected. Not to say that it hasn't stopped me from trying: I've emailed a few professors, all giving no answer. It is both especially irritating and demotivating; I've been polite, followed up nicely, and wasn't even asking for anything! It's not that I'm  trying to inject myself into their research or pester them for letter of recommendation; I genuinely just wanted to strike up a conversation, pick their brain, and ask them a few questions about a cool subject that we both have a common interest in.

The absolute last option that I see available, which I admittedly I haven't tried, is to arbitrarily drop in at their room on campus. However, I feel that such an unsolicited interruption might do more harm than good.

All of this is particularly concerning for me as it is very barring. In the event that I actually would need a letter of recommendation, I don't realistically see how any of my professors would know anything about me to even ""recommend"". Furthermore, my school offers the ability to take independent reading/research courses that I would definitely be interested in, except I would need to be in touch with a professor who agrees to launch and supervise the project in the first place.

I certainly don't want to come off as being overly defeatist, but I'm definitely reaching a level of frustration.

I'm not attempting to know my professors for solely an opportunistic goal. At this point, I genuinely just want to speak to someone experienced in the field; someone to ask for some kind of help, advice, touch base with, discuss ideas, whatever it may be. Perhaps a professor isn't even best suited for this role, though in any case, the importance of building a network is clear.

math,Do Dirichlet series have an abscissa of Abel summability?,"It is a well known fact that when a [Dirichlet series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_series) converges, it converges in a half-plane in the complex plane. The infimum over all real s where the series converges is called the abscissa of convergence. Dirichlet series also have an abscissa of absolute convergence, which determines a half-plane where the series converges absolutely.

I was curious if this can be generalized to the case when we interpret the sum as some other summation method, rather than the limit of the partial sums, and can this be used to find an analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series? For example is there an abscissa of [Cesàro summability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_summation)? I'm particularly curious about the case of [Abel summability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_series#Abel_summation).

In general, [Abel's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%27s_theorem) guarantees that the Abel sum agrees with the limit of the partial sums when a series converges, and otherwise, provided that the function defined in the region of Abel summability is analytic, it should agree with the unique analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series by the identity theorem.

So, my only concern is that the Abel summable region would not form a half-plane or that it would not define an analytic function. When we consider the [Dirichlet eta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_eta_function), it seems like this has an abscissa of Abel summability of -∞, and this corresponds to an analytic continuation of the series to the whole complex plane. In other words, this is a nice example where everything works out like how I'd intuitively expect, but I'm not so sure if this should always be true in general.

Abel summation and Dirichlet series have been well known for over a century, and this is not a super deep question, so it seems overwhelmingly likely that this would have been discussed before, but I couldn't find any references. I checked G.H. Hardy's book Divergent Series, but he does not really focus much on analytic continuation.

math,I'm tired of having to look things up,"I'm a first year PhD student that comes from a weak undergraduate program. Since my college's math department was so small I have self taught most of the math I know. Over the past three years I have read books on measure theory, functional analysis, and algebraic topology. Lately I have been studying harmonic analysis along with my core graduate courses. The way I learn is I read a book and supplement it with lecture notes, other books, and searching online until I feel like I very intuitively understand why a definition is the way or it is or why we expect a theorem to be true. 

The problem is my proof skills are really bad. Today a friend of mine asked me to help him prove x\^3 is continuous using epsilon and deltas and another problem he had was to prove that a certain sequence is cauchy and I had to look both of them up and it is very embarrassing. Once I see the solution then its usually obvious to me and I can get it quickly.

From the books I read I know most of the major theorems/definitions by heart and for most of them I even have a feeling ""why"" they should be true or why they're important but I have no idea how to prove almost any of them. I'm talking about everything from the mean value theorem to the spectral theorem. I have a hard time following all the steps in most proofs in my textbooks and I have to search on google why a certain step is true. I wish I could sit down and prove things myself but I'm not very good at it if I can't use google even for very simple undergraduate problems.

math,Exponentiation’s Similarity to Integration,"I’ve recently been thinking a lot about exponentiation and how it describes flow. For instance, the flow of a vector field can be described by an exponential. Or more abstractly, exp(d/dx) shifts a function by 1 unit, which “undoes” the derivative operator (up to a shift), a la the fundamental theorem of calculus.

I can give more examples, but generally it seems like exponentiation is performing a sort of integration. More precisely, exp(X) can be described as “the place you end up after moving with velocity X for one second”, which is exactly integration. What’s going on here? Are they secretly the same thing?",hydmar,1g639cu,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g639cu/exponentiations_similarity_to_integration/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g639cu/exponentiations_similarity_to_integration/,2024-10-17 22:29:08,109,0.94,109,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1g639cu
math,Why do enjoy math? How do you reignite interest in math?,"I'm a senior in college and I've grown somewhat disinterested in the classes I'm taking. I used to really love math and learning but I find it hard to engage with material like I used to. I'm not really entirely sure why. I still like talking about math and can sometimes find that joy again when I talk about past personal projects related to math, but it's hard to maintain that enthusiasm.  
  
Academically, losing this excitement is not good for me because I end up putting less work into the classes I'm taking. I always tried hard in classes not to get a good grade but because I enjoyed learning the material so it's tough when that's not so much the case anymore.  
  
I honestly don't really understand why I was so interested in learning math. It kinda feels a bit silly to be honest. Objectively it feels like math should be a really dry subject. Sure, a lecturer might be able to bring the material to life if they have enthusiasm and present it like a performer, but that enthusiasm isn't an essential part of the material. You can make any subject interesting if you're good at presenting. 

Maybe if I just talk to other people about the material as if I'm excited about it that will help me find joy in it.

math,Normal numbers,"I've just seen [this lecture](https://youtu.be/G3MwnMo7tio?si=_pV-AdNFZaukEFqn) by dr. Joseph Vandehey about normal numbers.

At the beginning he states that ""almost all real numbers are normal"" and I'm still trying to make sense of that.

He gave this very convincing demonstration that shows that the probability of picking a normal number at random is 1. He used a D10 dice to generate a number, and showed that the number would be normal.

However, using intuition alone I am convinced that the cardinality of normal numbers is equivalent to that of abnormal numbers (I think they are called that...).  
  
My thinking is that the cardinality of the set of numbers with a decimal expansion only including the digits 0 through 8, all of which would not be normal, is the same as the that of the set of numbers with all digits, both being uncountable. I have no proof of this claim, but am quite certain that it holds.

If this is true then can we really say that ""most numbers are normal""? And if not, how do we reconcile this equivalence of cardinality with the demonstration of the probability of randomly picking a normal number being 1? Are there sets with equivalent cardinalities but with different ""densities""? Or is this demonstration simply flawed?

math,Is Theoretical Computer Science a branch of pure mathematics or applied?,"People tend to have different views on what exactly is pure mathematics vs applied.

Lots of theorists in computer science especially emphasize mathematical rigor. More so than a theoretical physicist who focus on the physics rather than math.

In fact, the whole field is pretty much just pure mathematics in my view.

There is strong overlap with many areas of pure mathematics such as mathematical logic and combinatorics.

A full list of topics studied by theorists are:
Algorithms
Mathematical logic
Automata theory
Graph theory
Computability theory
Computational complexity theory
Type theory
Computational geometry
Combinatorial optimization

Because many of these topics are studied by both theorists and pure mathematicians, it makes no sense to have a distinction in my view.

When I think of applied mathematicians, I think of mathematicians coming up with computational models and algorithms for solving classes of equations or numerical linear algebra.

math,Relearning how to learning for Grad School. Any tips?,"Hi! I'm a first year PhD student studying Applied Math and I think I could use some advice/wisdom if you all had some to give. I'm coming straight from undergrad and the transition into grad level coursework has been...bumpy. There are two main problems Im encountering: not knowing how to apply concepts in more general applications and not understanding how to use lecture times. 

In undergrad, much of the information I learned felt very natural and intuitive probably up until my last semester. I sort just ""downloaded"" the information. I do think that in the last year I got into a bad habit though. I could read through my professors' notes and my notes and, even if I didn't 100% understand a concept, I knew I'd see problems similar the ones done in class in both homework assignments and exams. I think what this resulted in was a habit of knowing ""how"" to do problems but truly knowing ""what"" I was doing. Now, the relationship between lecture, homework, and exams are drastically different. Lectures introduce topics and provide proofs. Homework problems are substantially more complex than what should be able to be done using pure lecture material, and exams lie somewhere in the middle. 

I'm not bothered by this shift, but I'm not sure how to adjust. Now, I find myself not simply being confused in lecture, but 100% lost with nothing seeming ""relatable"" or ""intelligible"", and where I once got clarity in doing the assigned homework, I now find even more confusion because of how difficult they are. 

Again, I'm not upset. I knew that pursuing a PhD would be hard, I would just like some advice on how to pivot my approach to learning materials because what I did before definitely doesn't work anymore. I still enjoy the concepts once I finally do understand them, but I always find myself falling several weeks behind the pace of the new material. If you have any advice, I'd be very appreciative.

math,Mathematical intuition as a science,"I have often wondered how to convey (to non-mathematicians) what exactly mathematical intuition is, and I think I now have a somewhat satisfactory explanation. Let me know your thoughts on it.

The idea is that theorems (basically all proven statements, including properties of specific examples) are like experiments, and the intuition one forms based on these 'experiments' is a like a (scientific) theory. The theory can be used to make predictions about reality, and new experiments can agree or disagree with these predictions. The theory is then modified accordingly (or, sometimes, scrapped entirely).

As an example consider a student, fresh out of a calculus course, learning real analysis. He has come across a lot of continuous functions, and all of them have had graphs that can be drawn by hand without lifting the pen. Based on this he forms the 'theory' that all continuous functions have this property. Hence, one thing his theory predicts is that all continuous functions are differentiable 'almost everywhere'. He sees that this conclusion is false when he comes across the Weierstrass function, so he scraps his theory. As he gets more exposure to epsilon-delta arguments, each one an 'experiment', he forms a new theory which involves making rough calculations using big-O and small-o notation.

The reasoning behind this parallel is that developing intuitions involves a scientific-method-like process of making hypotheses (conjectures) and testing them (proving/disproving the conjectures rigourously). When 'many' predictions made by a certain intuition are verified to be correct, one gains confidence in it. Of course, an intuition can never be proven to be 'true' using 'many' examples, just as a scientific theory can never be proven to be 'true'. The only distinction one can make between various theories is whether (and under what conditions) they are useful for making predictions, and the same goes for intuitions.

All this says that, in a sense, mathematicians are also scientists. However they are different from 'conventional' scientists in that instead of the real world, their theories are about the mathematical world. Also, the theories they form are generally not talked about in textbooks; instead, textbooks generally focus on experiments and leave the theory-building to the reader. Contrast this with textbooks of 'conventional' science!",thereligiousatheists,1g4yuon,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g4yuon/mathematical_intuition_as_a_science/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g4yuon/mathematical_intuition_as_a_science/,2024-10-16 13:02:50,47,0.76,47,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1g4yuon

math,"In 100-200 years' time, will undergraduate math education look very different?","In my undergrad I've read plenty on key discoveries in various fields from as recent as the 20th century. It had me thinking about what a Real Analysis or Abstract Algebra course, for example, would look like a few hundred years ago, and then I thought about what they could look like in the future. Do you believe these subjects are ""complete"" for an undergraduate level study? Or how do you think some subjects might change to look like in a few hundred years? I think about Kolmogorov and the explosion in probability theory, or Fourier becoming an integral component to differential equations courses.

math,Math learning in another language,"Hello,

I've seen some posts about this in the past but I am studying abroad in Spain from U.S. in the spring and I'm thinking about taking a math class there. I've seen information about how the course is structured differently with one exam likely being all of the grade, but has anyone had experiences with taking math in a different language, in a class like complex analysis for instance? I'm about a B2 level, and the only non-language-specific course I've taken in Spanish is a literature class, but watching math videos on YouTube, it doesn't seem like a terribly difficult leap?

Also, my advisor for the program said that some computational steps are done completely differently, and professors only accept that way of solving things—I think she was referencing long division, which wouldn't really pertain to analysis, but has anyone experienced something done very differently in higher undergrad math that really threw them off in a different language/country?

All the results I came across all had to do with wave equations and dispersive PDEs. I'm not very satisfied because I still don't know what exactly these terms mean and I can't find a mathematical definition anywhere.

math,What should be taught first: metric spaces or topological spaces?,"This question comes from remembering the time I was studying General Topology in the degree. In this course, the first chapter we were taught was topological spaces (where basic notions of open sets, closed sets, basis for the topology and neighbourhoods were introduced). Later, in order to present one of the most important kinds of topological spaces, metric spaces were the topic of the second chapter.

I understand this ordering since metric spaces can be understood as a particular case of a topological space. This follows the canon in the current mathematical education were the more general case is explained firstly and then the concrete one. Not only that, but the concept of open ball arises naturally once you learn about  open sets and basis for a topology.

  
On the other hand, I remember losing any kind of motivation, goal or direction while firstly studying topological spaces, so by the time metric spaces arrived, It was too late to simply understand what was going on. Also, I would say metric spaces has the advantage of being easily depicted visually, so fundamental notions of topological spaces can be slightly described in advanced with a geometric representation in mind.

math,Envy-free cake cutting (Selfridge–Conway procedure),"\[THIS POST WAS CONCERNING A BUG AND HAS BEEN SOLVED\]  
Hi,

I'm working on an automatic representation of the Selfride-Conway procedure, just for the fun of it.

I suppose that the players have a preference for each infinitesimal slice of the cake and that their envy of a share is simply the integral between the two cuts:

https://preview.redd.it/inhk7ri9piud1.png?width=555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e20287490dc1668fb2916d00a61da8b8614bb3b

(Nota: The three total integrals are equals)

To cut a piece in three, a player P starts at the left and the right and looks for when the integrals are equal to a 1/3, compares the errors and picks the one with the lowest (A00). The remains are cut into two pieces as equally as possible (A02 is slightly bigger than A03).

Then we apply the algorithm by evaluating the integrals for each player on each proposed piece. In the figure below, the colour intensity represents a player's envy for each proposed piece. It works great up to the trimming part.

https://preview.redd.it/3tyegfoeoiud1.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=828a0350e150c57308ea7400b8d68021e8701001

PB (in this case P3) cuts the trimming in 3 pieces of equal value to his/her eyes (A21, A22, A23), so no matter what the others pick PB will be envy-free.  
Then PA (in this case P2), picks its favourite trimming piece (here A21, which becomes P21) and thus is envy-free.

Here comes my problem, what if the last piece chosen by PA (P2) was also P1's favourite? It forces P1 to choose its second-best choice and thus P1 has envy towards PA (P2).

Shouldn't this procedure guarantee a total envy-free solution in the end? If yes, I must have misunderstood a step but I can't tell which one.

I hope you'll be able to help me.",Nadran_Erbam,1g2owmz,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g2owmz/envyfree_cake_cutting_selfridgeconway_procedure/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g2owmz/envyfree_cake_cutting_selfridgeconway_procedure/,2024-10-13 12:48:50,5,0.78,5,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1g2owmz

Some reflections I enjoyed:

On the involvement of modern AI tools, which weren't up to his expectations:

&gt;Day 13 (Oct 8)

&gt;Modern AI tools, so far, are the ""[dog that didn't bark in the night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_Silver_Blaze)"". We are making *major* use of ""[good old-fashioned AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI)"", in the form of automated theorem provers such as [Vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_(theorem_prover)); but the primary use cases more modern large language models or other machine learning-based software thus far have been Github Copilot (to speed up writing code and Lean proofs through AI-powered autocomplete), and Claude (to help create our visualization tools, most notably [Equation Explorer](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/), which [Claude charmingly named](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/.E2.9C.94.20What.20shall.20we.20name.20our.20interactive.20equation.20tool.3F) ""Advanced Equation Implication Table"" initially). I have also found ChatGPT to be useful for getting me up to speed on the finer aspects of universal algebra. I have been told from a major AI company in the first few days of the project that their tools were able to resolve a large fraction (over 99.9%) of the implications, but with quite long and inelegant proofs. But now that we have isolated some particularly challenging problems, I believe these AI tools will become more relevant.

This is one of the key advantages of a highly structured collaborative project - there are modular subtasks in the project that can be usefully contributed to by someone who does not necessarily have the complete set of skills needed to understand the entire project. At one end, we are getting important insights from senior mathematicians with no prior expertise in Lean; we are getting volunteers to formalize a single theorem stated in the blueprint that requires only a relatively narrow amount of mathematical expertise; and we are getting a lot of invaluable technical support in maintaining the Github backend and various user interface front-ends that require little experience with either advanced mathematics or Lean. Certainly most of the contributions coming in now are well outside of what I can readily produce with my own skill set, and it has been a real pleasure seeing the project far outgrow my own initial contributions.

On how this sort of massively collaborative AI-assisted math looks like big software development, with everything that comes with that:

&gt;Day 14 (Oct 9)

&gt;We are encountering a technical issue that is slowing down our work - at some point, the codebase became extremely lengthy to compile (50 minutes in some cases). This is one scaling issue that comes with large formalization projects; when the codebase is massive and largely automated, it is not enough for every contribution to compile; efficiency of compile time becomes a concern. [This thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/slow.20build) is devoted to tracking down the issue and resolving it.

&gt;Day 15 (Oct 10)

&gt;These secondary issues, by the way, were caused by fragility in one of our early design choices... These sort of ""back end"" issues are hard to anticipate (and at the start of the project, when the codebase is still small and many of the tools hypothetical, implementing these sorts of data flows feels like overengineering). But it seems that it is possible to keep refactoring the codebase as one progresses, though if the project gets significantly more complex then I could imagine that this becomes increasingly difficult (I believe this problem is what is referred to in the software industry as ""[technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)"").

On speed vs promisingness of approaches to tackling problems:

&gt;Day 12 (Oct 7)

&gt;There was some [quite insightful discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Future.20of.20Using.20ATPs) about the different ways in which automated theorem provers (ATPs) can be used in these sorts of Lean-based collaborative projects. ... the speed of the ATP paradigm may have come at the expense of developing some promising human-directed approaches to the subject, though I think now that the pure ATP approach is reaching its limits, and the remaining implications are becoming increasingly interesting, these other approaches are returning to prominence.

On ""bookkeeping overhead"" requiring standardization, not an issue in informal math:

&gt;Day 6 (Oct 1)

&gt;Much of the time I devoted to the project today was over ""big-endian/little-endian"" type issues, such as which orientation of ordering on laws (or Hasse diagrams) to use, or which symbol to use for the Magma operation. In informal mathematics these are utterly trivial problems, but for a formal project it is important to settle on a standard, and it is much easier to modify that standard early in the project rather than later.

This reminded me of the late Bill Thurston's reflections in *On proof and progress*, similarly mentioning the need for standards to do large-scale formalization:

&gt;Mathematics as we practice it is much more formally complete and precise than other sciences, but it is much less formally complete and precise for its content than computer programs. The difference has to do not just with the amount of effort: the kind of effort is qualitatively different. In large computer programs, a tremendous proportion of effort must be spent on myriad compatibility issues: making sure that all definitions are consistent, developing “good” data structures that have useful but not cumbersome generality, deciding on the “right” generality for functions, etc. The proportion of energy spent on the working part of a large program, as distinguished from the bookkeeping part, is surprisingly small. Because of compatibility issues that almost inevitably escalate out of hand because the “right” definitions change as generality and functionality are added, computer programs usually need to be rewritten frequently, often from scratch.

&gt;A very similar kind of effort would have to go into mathematics to make it formally correct and complete. It is not that formal correctness is prohibitively difficult on a small scale—it’s that there are many possible choices of formalization on small scales that translate to huge numbers of interdependent choices in the large. It is quite hard to make these choices compatible; to do so would certainly entail going back and rewriting from scratch all old mathematical papers whose results we depend on. It is also quite hard to come up with good technical choices for formal definitions that will be valid in the variety of ways that mathematicians want to use them and that will anticipate future extensions of mathematics. If we were to continue to cooperate, much of our time would be spent with international standards commissions to establish uniform definitions and resolve huge controversies.

Terry's low-key humor:

&gt;Day 12 (Oct 7)

&gt;Meanwhile, [equation 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65) is proving [stubborn to resolve](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.2065.20-.3E.20Equation.20359) (I compared it to the village of Asterix and Obelix: ""One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders...""). 

&gt;Day 14 (Oct 9)

&gt;There is finally a breakthrough on the siege of the ""Asterix and Oberlix"" cluster (or ""village""?) of laws: we now know (subject to checking) that the ""Asterix"" law 65 does not imply the ""Oberlix"" law 1471!

math,Upcoming book by Tammy Kolda &amp; Grey Ballard: Tensor Decompositions for Data Science,"&gt; This book is intended for a graduate-level course in a data-science domain such as mathematics, computer science, engineering, statistics, physics, neuroscience, etc. It is written so that it can be used flexibly. It can be adapted for a subunit in a longer class or can stand on its own in a full semester course. We include substantial background material in linear algebra, optimization, and probability and statistics in the hopes of making the contents widely accessible. The book includes links to several real-world datasets to be used as examples for experiments in the book, grounding the material and providing a playground for student experimentation.

Speaking from personal experience, Tammy &amp; Grey are phenomenal researchers and math communicators. On reputation alone, I feel this will be a relevant textbook for years to come.

math,"Dyscalculic amd really struggling with arithmetic, is there a solution?","I have read that there aren't really any known treatments for dyscalculia (it is real btw, I keep hearing it isn't) but it is becoming a major issue in my life in particular my private economy.

It wasn't something people knew about in school but I had good patient teachers, then had to take special classes and even got a special tutor, pretty much all because of my struggling with arithmetic.

How it manifests:
I basically can not think in absolute quantities, it is very difficult for me to not substitute one number for another that feels more comfortable, so for example 3 often turns into 4, it feels like there's leeway the way there is with everything else, and there isn't. 
I also never could learn my multiplication tables, and I do a particularly stupid thing of confusing things' relationships to nearby multiples I know (10 usually) meaning: I often mix up 8 and 2, because 2 is the difference to 10, same for 6 and 4, this is probably related to my brain invariably thinking all quantities are malleable and that this includes the making of any given 10, even ones that I imagine as a crutch.

This has caused me many problems, I am allegedly intelligent and so everyone always wondered why I almost failed every year of schooling with decent to great grades in other subjects and invariably failures in math.

I took classes after ""finishing"" school, hoping to get into first biochem or whatever else fascinated me and then gradually wanting to just get any diploma at all, but can't attain the requisite grades in math. I struggle with time because I confuse nearby hours, 30 mins and 15 mins and similar intervals, I therefore have long been unemployed which makes things significantly worse as money is tight now, which I can't keep track of either.

I understand many here likely aren't neurologists, and I know there's no pill, but I really want to grasp this so I can start actually functioning at last; I am in my 30s, so I feel like it's long overdue. 
Is there an alternative to rigorous tutoring which clearly does not work for me?

The article shows a graphical interpretation of the parallel operator, which shows a certain geometric relationship between three line segments whose lengths correspond to two arbitrary numbers and their parallel combination.

math,Since when is computer science considered physics rather than mathematics?,"The recent physics Nobel literally got me puzzled. Consequently, I've been wondering... is computer science physics or mathematics?

I completely understand the intention of the Nobel committee in awarding Geoffrey Hinton for his outstanding contributions to society and computer science. His work is without a doubt Nobel worthy. However, the Nobel in physics? I was not expecting it... Yes, he took inspiration from physics, borrowing mathematical models to develop a breakthrough in computer science. However, how is this a breakthrough in physics? Quite sad, when there were other actual physics contributions that deserved the prize.

It's like someone borrowing a mathematical model from chemistry, using it in finance for a completely different application, and now finance is coupled to chemistry... quite weird to say the least.

I even read in another post that Geoffrey Hinton though he was being scammed because he didn't believe he won the award. This speaks volumes about the poor decision of the committee.

Btw I've studied electrical engineering, so although my knowledge in both physics and computer science is narrow, I still have an understanding of both fields.

math,Surreal numbers and generalizing the construction of the reals one cardinality higher,"I've recently been thinking about [surreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number#) and was thinking about the way that you could describe the set of reals as the topological completion of the ring of surreal numbers you get from finitely many steps, and was wondering if anyone has spent time thinking about the field you get of all surreal numbers defined in countably many steps?

It seems natural enough to define a metric (albeit with a larger-than-real codomain) on this thing similarly to the standard metric on the reals, and from there one could talk about Cauchy sequences and do some sort of topological completion. This isn't very productive though, as two sequences here aren't equivalent unless they are eventually equal. Then it seems the most natural to define sequences as having the set of countable ordinals as their domain, and do a Cauchy completion this way.

It seems like I'm essentially trying to redefine the number systems with the set of countable ordinals replacing the set of finite ordinals (natural numbers). The biggest difference that I can see on the surface is that the set of countable ordinals isn't isomorphic to the set of positive ""integers"" in this context, so I definitely can't expect all the facts of arithmetic to transfer over seamlessly the way they seem to when you do weird [model theory tricks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_analysis)

math,Visualizing four dimensions,"I'm a PhD student in geometry/topology, so naturally I tend to have a very visual approach to math. But every so often, I find I can't imagine enough dimensions to be able to accurately picture something. Of course, there are often all sorts of workarounds, for example:

- Functions from a 2d space to a 2d or 3d space can be pictured as a ""mapping"" from one to another. This is useful e.g. in complex analysis and topology.
- Higher dimensional spaces can often be accurately represented by lower-dimensional cartoons. This is what they do in complex algebraic geometry, where all the pictures are half the dimension of what they're trying to depict.

But these workarounds don't always apply when the situation becomes sufficiently complex. On the other hand, I've heard all sorts of stories of mathematicians being able to get an intuitive feeling of higher-dimensional spaces (in particular, a certain mathematician with the initials WT). However, any attempt I've made to visualize the fourth dimension seems to have been completely in vain.

Does anyone know anything about how one might be able to ""visualize"" (or at least get a better understanding of) the fourth dimension?

There's some probability it's going to be raining for each trip, all independent. If it's raining, you take an umbrella, and if it's not, you leave the umbrella wherever it is. If you own one umbrella, you will quickly find that one day you are out of luck, because you need the umbrella but it was left at the other place. But maybe if you start off with 6 umbrellas, 3 at each place, you will get through the year without ever getting wet -- sometimes one will end up at the other place, but there's a safety cushion with more umbrellas, and if you're lucky there will always be at least one umbrella at each end.

Say there's a 20% chance of rain each trip, and 260 work days in the year (so 520 trips). Every January 1 you get to redistribute your umbrellas equally, to restart the process. How many umbrellas will you need at the beginning of the year to have a 95% chance of making it through the year without getting wet? 

Seems like it could be modeled by considering there will be 104 rainy trips (20% of 520), each of which will bring the number of umbrellas at one end up or down by 1. If you start with 3 umbrellas at each end, this number can't get below 0 or above 6. So: what are the chances that a 104-step random walk along the number line will not exceed +/-3 at any point?

(I think we're going to need more than 6 umbrellas.)",gliese946,1fzfihc,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fzfihc/probability_of_a_1d_random_walk_not_having/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fzfihc/probability_of_a_1d_random_walk_not_having/,2024-10-09 00:55:25,18,0.82,18,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fzfihc

math,Math puzzle: How many routes can you find for this traveling salesman?,"https://preview.redd.it/obo0hqn19ltd1.png?width=2084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49583bb119b7e83d431f3829d5034c8fe828ba88

A traveling salesman who lives in city A wants to visit all cities from B to P over the course of a week, though not necessarily in alphabetical order, and return to A at the end. He plans to enter each city exactly once. The blue lines are the only roads connecting the 16 cities. The traveling salesman may use only a straight route between any two cities; he is not allowed to turn at the intersection of two streets. How many different routes are possible?

This puzzle is originally from Henry Ernest Dudeney’s 1917 book Amusements in Mathematics.

math,"[2410.04189] Primes of the form $p^2 + nq^2$ | Ben Green, Mehtaab Sawhney","arXiv:2410.04189 \[math.NT\]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04189)  
Abstract: Suppose that n is 0 or 4 modulo 6. We show that there are infinitely many primes of the form p2+nq2 with both p and q prime, and obtain an asymptotic for their number. In particular, when n=4 we verify the \`Gaussian primes conjecture' of Friedlander and Iwaniec.  
We study the problem using the method of Type I/II sums in the number field Q(-n---v). The main innovation is in the treatment of the Type II sums, where we make heavy use of two recent developments in the theory of Gowers norms in additive combinatorics: quantitative versions of so-called concatenation theorems, due to Kuca and to Kuca--Kravitz-Leng, and the quasipolynomial inverse theorem of Leng, Sah and the second author.

Alex Kontorovich on X: Major breakthrough on arxiv today: Ben Green and Mehtaab Sawhney push “Type II sum” techniques using Gowers norms, quantitative “concatenation” theorems, and the “quasi polynomial inverse theorem” to settle whole classes of major open problems about whole numbers! Their formulation is that, as p and q range over the primes, the expression p\^2 + (2q)\^2 is itself also prime infinitely often. (You can generalize it to p\^2+n q\^2 where n=0 or 4 mod 6). Mehtaab gave a beautiful lecture on this here at Princeton a few weeks ago...

I tried noteshelf, but that is a buggy mess and has less features than paint on windows. Paying for that should be considerd a crime since they only work on the apple version as far as i am aware. I heard Samsung noes is great, but that only works for samsung by now. 

Since i type faster than i write and writing on a laptop/tablet isnt that fun, i search for one where i can easily 

* add equations
* write/sketch with a pen 
* type normally

Thats basically it. Like paint with a math input panel that works. I know windows has a math input panel but that hasnt been updated since windows 7 i think and i cant put my equaions into my text so it is useless to me. 

I do not mind paying for the software, but i am not to fond of subscription models like evernote. Especially if i pay for millions of features i simply do not need. All i wanna do with the software is take notes and i cant find 1 single programm that actually works wihout me flipping my screen up and down every minute.

math,"Connecting Rubiks cubes, sudoku, groups, manifolds, and algorithms ","
I have this idea for a project that seems somewhat plausible to me, but I would like verification of its feasibility. For some background im a Highschooler who needs to do a capstone project (for early graduation) and I know all the main calculuses, tensor calculus, and I have knowledge in linear algebra and abstract algebra (for those wondering I learned just enough linear algebra to get through tensor calculus without going through every topic) My idea is to first find group representations of a Rubik’s cube and sudoku puzzle and create a Cayley table for it. I then plan to take each of the possible states and (attempt) to create a manifold of it with tangent spaces representing states in the puzzles that can be obtained from a single operation (twisting or making a modification on the board). From there I plan to utilize geodesics to find the best path (or algorithm) to the desired space. All this, to my knowledge, is fairly explored territory. What I plan to attempt from here it to see if I can utilize manifold intersection that could possibly create an algorithm to solve a Rubik’s cube and sudoku puzzle at the same time. I know manifolds are typically more associated with lie groups than others like permutation groups and that this idea stretches some abstract topics a little too thin than preferable. I also don’t know whether this specific idea has been explored yet. Is this idea feasible? Do I need to go into further depth? Are there any modifications I need to make? Please let me know. Edit: It has come to my attention this may not be entirely possible since manifolds contain infinite points and Rubik’s cubes and sudoku puzzles only have finite spaces.

math,"creating a meaningful math ""stock photo""/background image together","I have read Jordan Ellenberg say ""Mathematical facts can be simple or complicated, and they can be shallow or profound"". When looking at math stock images, they seem to try to look complicated, some successfull at that, others not. However, they all seem very shallow. Because writing theorems out in full would probably not fit on a background image, i am looking for a subset of theorems that can be, at its core, summarized (accepting some loss in accuracy or detail is acceptable) in a single equation/diagram or similar. 

For example: 
The [Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck%E2%80%93Riemann%E2%80%93Roch_theorem) can be summarized by a single formula. 

The [Geometric Langlands conjecture](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/gaitsgde/GLC/functor.pdf) can be summarized as an equivalence of certain categories.

The [Snake lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_lemma) can be summarized by combining the commutative diagram and the exact sequence into one diagram. 

What other examples can you think off? Thank you alot. 

P.S.: If this has been done before, feel free to tell me.

math,What are your favourite theorems in geometry?,"Could be any theorem related to geometry. It could even be results that have some bearing on geometry and topology. 

Personally, my favourites are: 

**1. Pythagorean theorem (elegant and absolutely fundamental as it defines the Euclidean metric, which  can be easily extended to define other geometries, which eventually lead to the development of Riemannian  geometry)**

**2.Gauss Bonnet theorem**

**On the algebraic side:**

**1.Grothendieck Riemann Roch theorem**

**On the topological side:**

**1.Donaldson theorem, existence of exotic spheres in various dimensions, existence of infinitely many exotic copies of $R\^4$ etc.**

**2.h cobordism theorem**

**And on the more applied side (in the sense applied outside geometry):**

**Maybe Gromov's non squeezing theorem that is applied extensively in PDE. Or maybe the rich collection of theorems around Hamilton's Ricci flow that have lead to vast swaths of development in analysis, topology and even physics.**

So what are your favourite theorems? It doesn't matter how basic or how esoteric it may be. Goemetry is probably the one field in math with the widest reach, being absolutely essential in all areas of math, and crucial in physics, computer science and other areas. So I'd really love to see a dump of great theorems and results in geometry, not only on the pure side, but applied math side like engineering or CS or maybe finance, and even in completely separate fields like biology or cognitive neuroscience.

math,Kobon Triangles - optimal arrangement for k=19 found!,"Kobon Triangle Problem - optimal arrangement for k=19 found with 107 triangles! (previously unknown)

The Kobon Triangle Problem asks for the largest number N(k) of nonoverlapping triangles whose sides lie on an arrangement of k lines.

Before this, the largest value k for which an optimal arrangement was known was k=17, with 85 triangles. 

k=19 has an upper bound of 107 triangles, but the best known arrangement had 104 triangles. This arrangement I found has 107 triangles, and so has the maximum number of triangles possible!

I can only do one attachment, the image itself, so I can’t link my GitHub which has the code I used to find the arrangement. But here it is:

https://github.com/Bombardlos/Kobon_Triangle_Workspace

compile_mirror was used to find this arrangement in pure numerical form, then a separate program rendered 19_representation.png, and finally I made 19_final by hand. I also have compile_11, which is an algorithmic proof that k=11 CANNOT reach the current accepted upper bound of 33 triangles, and so the current best arrangement with 32 triangles is actually optimal. With the right equipment, it could ALSO find whether there is an arrangement for k=21 which meets the upper bound in a reasonable amount of time, but my laptop sucks and I don’t wanna cook it TOO badly lol.

I actually found the arrangement about a week ago, but it was with an algorithm that abstracts it really far away from the physical model. It took me awhile to turn a representation of the model into the model itself, and I had to do it largely by hand. I actually bought ribbon and wall tacks to be able to arrange part of it, since the first visual representation used VERY unstraight lines. I could move around the ribbons at certain points and restrict their movements with tacks, eventually sorting them into much straighter lines. Finally, I took a picture, opened a Google Slides file, uploaded the pic, turned the opacity down, and drew line objects overlayed on top of the pic. Did some more adjusting, and the final image is just a screenshot of the Google Slide 😂",bigBagus,1fx08k3,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fx08k3/kobon_triangles_optimal_arrangement_for_k19_found/,https://i.redd.it/ygdm3ovx40td1.jpeg,2024-10-05 21:00:16,242,0.99,242,0,23,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,Image Post,,t3_1fx08k3
math,Does this idea work for generalizing the cross product to n dimensions? ,"I haven't really found much (useful) online for this so I came here as a last resort. I am working on programs for visualizing 4d and above from complete scratch (my language doesn't have anything for matrices or vectors built in) so I've been doing some research in linear algebra, mostly 3B1B's essence of linear algebra series. The only issue is that he never mentions 4d with anything important for my uses, and a lot of places are saying the cross product just doesn't work in 4d and above (accept for 7d for some reason???) and I just want to know why, when (atleast extrapolating from 2&amp;3 dimensions) there's a decent pattern that seems to make natural sense for any (whole) dimension.

I want to be clear, I am not an expert. I do math as a hobby so if I'm spouting bullshit, please feel free to roast me in the comments. However, if you think of the idea of the 2d cross product, the idea is you take the area of the parallelogram that those vectors make. If these are {u1, u2} and {v1, v2} then the cross product is u1*v2-u2*v1. When I do this, I think of it as sort of an x, where you multiply the items that are in line and subtract the lines from eachother. This technically isn't the actual cross product, but I see it used enough that it might as well be an honorary 2d cross product even if it's literally just a determinant. 

The 3d case is similar, but we're getting a vector out, so we need three numbers, so we do it three times. We do a very similar process for the 2d (determinate) case. We do our x multiplication, but we start in the middle. Weird, but whatever. We put that as the first number, then shift our x down. Since the two bottom points (the lower numbers getting multiplied) were at the bottom and now just moved down, we just overflow them to the top. This means that in a sense we go from u2*v3  to u3*v4, overflows to u3*v1 and u1*v3. Subtract and put that in the vector, then repeat. You move the x down, overflowing when the points go below the end of the matrix and shove it in. These may seem very disconnected, but they are insanely similar in practice.

A procedure that gives you both of these results is start on the second to last number in the vector, and do the x multiply subtract oporation, then shift it down overflowing if necessary. Repeat until you shift to your original place and stop.
This is the exact procedure with 3d, but in 2d it also gives the same results. The first number in a list of two number IS the second to last one, and the reason you only get a number and not a vector is because there's only that single x you can make. In the 3d case you can shift down three times before they fully overlap, leading to a list of 3 numbers, a 3d vector. This also leads to a natural extension into 1d. If you think about the parallelograms area, in 1d it will be 0. Take two 1d vectors (just numbers) of {a} and {b}, this procedure asks for a*b-b*a, a*b=b*a and any number minus itself = 0, so you get the very natural conclusion that the area of a 1 dimension shape comes to 0. So with a procedure that seems to work great with 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, why not just keep going? The 4d case pretty much means that {u1, u2, u3, u4} x {v1, v2, v3, v4} = {(u3*v4-u4-v3), (u4*v1-u1*v4), (u1*v2-u2*v1), (u2*v3-u3*v2)} and while I haven't done enough to tell if this makes sense in a 4d geometry kind of way, this feels super natural and can be extended to any number of dimensions. 

I understand somebody else definitely came up with this idea before me, but I haven't heard much discussion about and and it feels like the most natural way to extend the cross product further. Again, math is my hobby not my profession so if I made a major oopsy daisy and said something compleatly incorrect here, please let me know. If you know any reason this doesn't work, tell me.

The university at which I am giving this class allows students to take it concurrently with Calc 1.  This is a non-standard choice, but it also fits with the material; I have thought for quite some time that students don't necessarily need the material covered calc 1, calc 2, calc 3, diff eq track to understand proof-based mathematics.  They do, however, need a certain level of mathematical maturity.

So with all of this background, I'm asking if anyone has good recommendations for discrete math textbooks.
