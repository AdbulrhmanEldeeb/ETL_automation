learnprogramming,"I suck at programming, how do I get better?","I'm doing a course that's focused on front end development and we had to basically learn JavaScript and React in 6 weeks, but I feel like im digesting the concepts on a surface level. There are weekly assignments but I'm usually stressing about it, calling friends up to help, using gpt and writing code that barely works. For example, I kind of get how hooks like useEffect works, but when presented with an exercise I only know how to get started but can't complete the whole exercise.

There are people in my cohort who just seem so on top of things(to be fair some of them have programming experience in R etc) and I feel so behind compared to them. The other day I saw someone posting about giving up on programming and some commenters suggested coding something they actually like. So far my course is just focused on web development (things like forms, how does a simple form take so much code).

learnprogramming,"I have a CS degree but suck at programming, looking for advice on moving forward in life.","I have a degree in CS, no experience, overall suck at programming and am looking for help.

  
I understand that my only chance of getting a job in this field is to have created some outstanding project that would impress the hell out of a recruiter to the point where they could confidently assume I am proficient in my ability to design/build things. Currently this is not what I am as a developer at all.

I have dabbled in many different areas attempting to build projects and either get stuck and quit, lose interest and quit, or just feel too overwhelmed to even start. I've tried game dev and some full stack applications so far and honestly haven't accomplished much. I believe my problem is that I rely too hard on AI to write code for me. I know this is kind of a controversial thing to say, as many people who are established professionals use AI to help them write code all the time. But the problem is I'm letting AI write code I don't really understand. I'll tell myself I understand it, but later down the line when it comes to fixing something or adding something new I can't do it.

I believe a lot of my inability to program comes from my lack of programming principles. In school I learned some theory, some basic programming in C, C++, Java, and Python. In my spare time I've attempted to learn React/JavaScript, Godot, Spring boot, and databases like MongoDB and Postgresql.  I've found that generally speaking I seem to be more interested in low level code and the C++ language, but when it comes to jobs involving these things it seems the main industries are quant and embedded systems which I have no foundation in at all, and don't even know how to start learning them.

I've tried learning through YouTube and online courses and have found that these just don't work for me. They are either too slow and boring or too fast and not explanatory enough. I know most people say to just learn by trying to build things, but I don't even know where to begin half the time. 

I have neglected learning through reading books outside of the ones I have read during my degree. I think I need to change my method of studying to something else besides watching videos and maybe do more reading so if anybody has an books they recommend that genuinely helped them be more confident in programming I would appreciate any suggestion.

learnprogramming,Thinking into programming after many years. I'm very very lost.... What should I learn?,"I know, I know... the same question over and over again... But I promise you this time it will be different.



I studied physics at the university (I finished two years ago, or so), and in the second year we had a programming class that lasted for four months. In that class we learned a bit of Java, just to create some scripts to do some calculations and draw some graphs using a library created by the university. I didn't like that language at all. It felt like... anti-natural for me. Then I tried for some months C#, but I left it due to health issues and never used it again. For my final degree project I had to manage some jupyter notebooks, and with them I was able to understand some R and Python code for statistical calculations.

I have been using Windows and Linux for the last decade or so, and I've used the QTile window manager a bit, but the python language has always made me feel a bit sad :(. I also have used old distros like Slackware or configure some window managers like Awesome, DK, or Hyprland (even entering a bit into the suckless world... hehehe).

Now, after quite some time, I feel the necessity to make my brain work again, and I thought programming could be a great idea. One project I have in mind is creating an app to manage my students' scores (I'm a high school teacher), list them in tables and graphs, calculate averages etc. This project is not something fixed, but I think it would be nicer than to learn how to use Excel LOL. 

What I'm asking you is what language I should choose, taking into account:

* What I think of some languages.
* The possibility to develop a Windows and/or Linux app.
* I'm not very interested in Web Development.
* Activate my brain.
* Develop discipline. 

(I know the last two things are not related to any language in general)

  
I'm not sure if functional programming would be great, or just non-OOP programming or OOP programming.

        plotResultsQuantity1.py
        plotResultsQuantity2.py

Where `calc1.py` and `calc2.py` use the Physics module to obtain different results. For example in `calc1.py` it might be interested in testing how the simulation looks like as I change the initial conditions, whereas `case2.py` does the usual simulation (whatever that means) but outputs some very specific plot at each step in the simulation (which I achieve by appropriately wrappinng a method defined in `mainCalculation.py.`

Finally, `plotResultsQuantityN.py` has a file selector that gives a choice (in this example, between `case1.txt` and `case2.txt`) so that it can plot `QuantityN` from the different data sets. For example in `plotResultsQuantity1.py` I might be plotting the derivative of the file that I choose, where as in `plotResultsQuantity2.py` I might be interested in calculating the integral.

Now the project has gotten fairly big, and the amount of files has grown really fast in the last couple of weeks. I think now it would a good time in which I should reorganize the directory so that utilization is easier in the future.

What would be a nicer way of organizing this? I was thinking of
 
    computation/
        Physics/
            __init__.py
            utilScripts.py
            mainCalculation.py
        Results/
            case1/
                case1.txt
            case2/
                case2.txt
        Calculations/
            __init__.py
            calc1.py
            calc2.py
        plotScripts/
            __init__.py
            plotResults1.py    
            plotResults2.py
       calculate.py
       plot.

Where `calculate.py` looks something like

    from Calculations import calc1

    calc1.main()

if I want to reobtain the calculations done in `calc1.py`.

Is this a nice way of doing it?

Is using a thread and queueing commands to the controller just the only way of doing this? I need to read the responses from the controller to validate it received the command so I can’t mix thread and non thread. 

I can’t find any examples or literature of people doing serious GUI programming online and controlling stages.

I am designing a pretty large C# project, and automatically I always used an int ID in the database, and IDs for relationships, but I have been wondering if it would be safer to use UUID?

I was initially thinking to keep the auto inc integer ID for internal operations, then UUID for any requested interaction, but still having an ID I would assume \_could\_ in edge cases where for example a DTO mistakenly keeps an ID to be open to guessing an ID.

So in 2024, whats the most accepted approach. 

1. Keep both an ID and GUID, refer to ID internally, and UID externally

2. Ditch the int ID and use GUID as primary key

learnprogramming,How do I convert a base 2¹²⁸ number into a denary string?,"I honestly don't know where I'm supposed to ask this, which is why I'm asking here.

My idea is a base 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 (2¹²⁸) number system, where each digit is a `u128` in the array (`arr[0]` is the unit's digit).

The problem with my idea is that I have no idea how I'm supposed to convert this type of number into a string.

learnprogramming,How to loop datasource in UI.Vision,"I created a functioning script that opens a page, selects options 1 and 2 from a.csv file, and submits; it then loops and repeats the process. Everything has been wonderful up to this point. Just one issue: it does not utilize row 2 from try number 2.

So, for example, row one options 1 and 2 are orange and fruit, respectively, whereas row 2 options 1 and 2 are carrot and vegetable. However, when I execute the script, even if I loop it ten times, it will continue to publish orange and fruit rather than attempting 20 additional entries.CSV file.

I'm posting my basic code here in case someone can spot the problem and fix it so that I may attempt the loop with data from the following line on successive tries.

I remember once working with this tool like 2 years ago ( maybe library, or a package downloaded from github) that helps automate data preprocessing. 

You would run the library in jupyter notebook and the output of the cell will be the table (if you're workign with a table) and you would perform the treatment manually on the table. And when you run it, the code of the process you did will be generated. 

I've been searching for it for so long, it's starting to feel like i was on a good fever dream and it's not coming back.

learnprogramming,Freshman in Comp Sci want to learn more,"Hey Guys, I am sure you get these posts all the time but I am a freshman in Comp Sci and I want to grow as a programmer. Right now I have learned JavaScript, Python, C++ and MySQL. What I know in these languages is 

  
\- loops

\- importing/reading and writing files

\- using Classes to organize my code better

\- building user interactable main menus (by interactable I mean the user will type in a # to respond to what menu they want to move to)

\- how to read update and move around data in mysql

\- how to use Gui commands in python and javascript to do things with my mouse and keyboard

\- how to update dbeaver software by using python and java software 

  
and the beginner stuff such as for loops, while loops, do while loops, if/else statements, for loops with iterations (i ++), basically anything beginner you can think of I probably have some sort of familiarilty with it. 

  
my issue is I will go to websites like leetcode to ""test my knowledge"" and what leetcode is asking seems next to impossible for me to solve (is this because I am so early on in my coding?). I also see people making buttons, interactive clickable menu options and importing color to backgrounds of their displays and I have no clue how to even do those things. Will I learn those down the line? 

  
It seems like my next courses over this and next year will incorporate

\- the software development cycle

\- building an interactable user interface

\- full stack development

\- mobile and desktop architecture

and client server development. 

any advice/guidance tips and tricks and where to learn more would be greatly appreciated thank you in advance and please be nice in the comments I am sure all of you were in my shoes at some point.

learnprogramming,"What are the ground rules of using Python for competitive programming, especially with regards to memory allocation? I keep getting Runtime Errors in Python with solutions that are accepted one I reimplement them in C++. Are there obvious basic tips to working with Python on coding problems?","For a bit more context, I used to do competitive programming in my high school almost 10 years ago and even went to the IOI. At that point, I only knew how to code in C++ because that was the best for competitions. Nowadays, I'm a machine learning researcher and I have basically only used Python ever since high school.   
  
The last time I stumbled upon coding problems was when I gave a look at the two level 4 ""coding puzzles"" at Meta's hiring platform for curiosity. I believed I knew how to solve them and naturally tried to implement them in Python, but I got stuck with runtime errors in both problems. I tried to debug that for hours and find a test case that would give me the RE locally, but nothing. After a long time, I finally tried to locate the line that raised the error (classic binary search with wrong answers) and it was simply a line that created and populated a list... on both problems! I proceeded to simply reimplement my code in C++ and both solutions passed.

I have no clue why a simple `list.append(x)` would result in Runtime error. I thought if it was some simple Python memory inefficiency I'd get a MLE instead. This is not the first time I have this experience trying to use Python for something like this. So all these years after I left competitive programming, is Python still unusable for these things? Does anyone use it? Is there a good blog post or set of ground rules about how to avoid these issues with Python?  

Anyway, I also found it remarkable how C++, that I only used for 3 years in high school and haven't used ever since still gave me better control over my code than Python, the language I've been working daily for the past 10 yearsI and that believed I was the most proficient at (until today 😅).

learnprogramming,Dropped out of college to pursue web development—need advice!,"Hey there,

I recently dropped out of college where I was pursuing a diploma in Automation and Robotics. After some reflection, I realized this field wasn’t the right fit for me. Instead, I’ve decided to follow my passion for tech and have enrolled in the **PW Skills Full Stack Web Development** course.

Now that I’ve left college, I’m dedicating myself fully to becoming a web developer. However, I don’t have a degree, and I’m learning through self-study and structured courses.

I’d love to hear from others who have taken a similar path:

* How hard is it to get a job as a self-taught web developer without a degree?
* What steps should I focus on to stand out in the job market?

Any advice, tips, or shared experiences would mean a lot.
