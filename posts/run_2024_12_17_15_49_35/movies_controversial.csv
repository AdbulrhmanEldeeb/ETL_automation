movies,Passengers (2016): How dark could it have gone?,"I watched the movie *Passengers* recently, and I just can’t stop thinking about the scenarios that could have happened, especially how dark it could get. I mean, 90 years is a *looong* time! Here are some of the scenarios that came to mind:

* Jim and Aurora have kids, and how would those kids have dealt with their lives? Would they have resented their situation and sabotaged the ship? Also, if they don't wake up other passengers, there could be a risk of inbreeding!
* What if Jim and Aurora decided to wake up more passengers but ended up waking the wrong ones and it backfires when the new passengers are hostile?
* The movie shows Aurora forgiving Jim, but realistically, forgiveness isn’t that simple. What if she grew bitter over the years and sought revenge?
* Jim passes away, leaving Aurora alone. She is unable to figure out how to wake another passenger like Jim did. Over time, she goes mad and maybe commits suicide. Yikes, that would be scary!
* The entire passenger population wakes up far too early. With limited resources, the ship descends into chaos, leading to starvation, riots, and widespread death.
* The darkest scenario I imagined is the ship malfunctioning, trapping everyone inside with no way out. They’d be awake but unable to escape, turning the ship into a floating prison.
* Cannibalism: If resources become critically scarce, they face unimaginable choices, including cannibalism if one dies or if hostility arises among awakened passengers.

movies,8-Bit Christmas!,"Heard about this movie on a podcast the other day and decided to give it a shot even though I'd never heard a peep about it before and it was apparently an HBO Max original, but damn I loved it! 

Neil Patrick Harris plays the father of a young girl and he narrates a flashback story about him as a kid hoping to get an NES for Christmas in the 80s and doing everything he could to get his hands on it. The movie has great humor, rarely is a joke just a flat out dud, I laughed out loud several times (which takes a lot) the story is heartwarming, everyone including a bunch of child actors does a great job. For me, this will be a new Christmas classic I'll probably watch every year. I related to a ton of it and it's got so many quick subtle jokes that I'll probably find something new to laugh at every time.

movies,Interpreting the ending of Solaris (1972) (Spoilers!),"I just gave Tarkovsky's Solaris a rewatch. I always interpreted the ending to be that Kris chose to go to the surface of the planet and is now living in the simulation of his memories, for better or for worse. It's simultaneously joyful and sad. On one hand he gets to see embrace his father again and return to a time and place that brought him joy. On the other hand, it's a world of his own memories and who knows what kind of nightmare he can create for himself. A classic ""what dreams may come...."" scenario.

Now I'm wondering if the Kris we see on the island is in fact not the ""real"" Kris at all. Earlier they had broadcast his brain waves to the planet in an attempt to communicate with it. What if the Kris we see at the end is just a duplicate, created by Solaris from his transmitted brain waves? The ""real"" Kris could have decided to return to Earth or to an unknown fate. 

I have not read Lem's book nor seen Soderbergh's version since its release. Do either of those allude to the above possibility?

movies,Queer (2024) - Help settle a debate,"So my bsf and I just saw Luca's new film, *Queer*. We both enjoyed it but found ourselves getting into a disagreement over a pretty big plot point.

  
To start, I should say that I *literally* just finished reading Burrough's novel a couple of hours before we saw the movie. It was so fresh in my mind that I could quote half of the movie as it was happening. Throughout the book, I was struck by how unreciprocated Lee's love/lust/obsession for Allerton was. Allerton seemed extremely passive in their relationship, never initiating anything sexual or physical. There is a moment where Allerton expresses that he likes the sex sometimes after Lee asks, but this is starkly juxtaposed to all the times when Allerton appears to be disgusted or annoyed with Lee's sexual advances. I honestly feel confident in saying I think Allerton is straight and the only reason he sometimes likes the sex is because of the stimulation. I also definitely think that there is no chance that Allerton loved (or even liked) Lee back.

  
Anyways, I went into the movie with the expectation that their story would be relatively the same. And generally, it was very similar. However, I came away with a very different interpretation of their relationship. This is where my opinion diverges from my friend (who has not read the book).

  
To her, the movie is about Lee being a creep to a straight boy. She looks at the one or two moments where Allerton outright shies or rejects Lee's touch as evidence for this. She thinks that Allerton is ""definitely straight"" and only finds pleasure in sex with Lee because it's sex (very similar to my interpretation of the book). Additionally, she believes that Allerton leaving Lee in the forest is indicative of a lack of passion and care from Allerton's side.

  
I could not have a more different view. I think it is very clear that Allerton not only genuinely enjoys sex with Lee specifically, but also is in love with him. The reciprocation of lust is really obvious in the two in-detail sex scenes we get. During the first scene, Allerton seems happy to kiss Lee back and get a BJ, and when he's finished he instantly starts to get Lee off, something we never see Allerton take the initiative to do in the book. In the second scene, when Lee and Allerton are in the hotel, Lee touches his ribs as a way to start sex. In the book, Allerton shooed Lee away and only conceded to having sex when he was reminded that he 'owed' Lee for the week. In the movie, Allerton seemed very into everything happening and seemed blissed out afterward. I also think, throughout the film, the little smiles, content looks, and casual affection sometimes shown, indicates that he also feels love for Lee. I believe this love is repressed and he does not want to acknowledge it. This is why he leaves Lee, because they just had an experience where they were truly able to be together because of the drugs, and now he doesn't know how to deal with those intense feelings and so he runs.

We can’t come to an agreement. What do you guys think?

movies,Found Something Shady,"Recently, someone promoted their short film/feature film (https://youtu.be/5Wbu1eEeMCw). The said person stated that the said film has won so many awards, that he can't even remember, including Cannes Film Festival awards &amp; New York Film Festival awards (in plurals).

This tingled my spider senses, and I tried to scan the internet for the same.

I found that the maker of the film has made multiple social media posts claiming the same, both on his studio's Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/arjunpicturesprod?igsh=MTc5bDhtazJhMWxreA==) as well as on YouTube (https://youtube.com/@arjunpicturespvtltd).

He made similar claims for his new project, too (#KK).

These are their so-called websites as well:

The main kid is bad at acting, which you can’t really expect too much from a young kid, but still he is like a charisma void even despite his character. His parents are also off sounding with their lines, like when they film dialogue separately using stand ins. All the dialogue has no flow between the characters. The cinematography(shots, pans, editing) feels weird and off. Comedy is all about timing and delivery, and every bit and line is a swing and a miss. Jack Black seems like he’s just doing improv, poorly. It reminds me of someone new to stand up who hasn’t worked out their rhythm yet. Even the music doesn’t seem to match what I’m watching, if that makes sense.

movies,Why don't they (seem to) make movies like Austin Powers anymore?,"This is obviously a subjective claim, but it seems to me like goofy parodies like Austin Powers, the Scary Movie franchise, Shrek, etc. have gone entirely away. I'm just wondering if anyone else feels that way, and why that might be?

Today, I was listening to a Quincy Jones album and my girlfriend walked in and said it sounded like Austin Powers music, and I told her sure as shit it totally was! Then we sat down and watched Goldmember from start to finish and our faces were about numb from laughing. I just really appreciated the crafting that went into the bits and Mike Myers' ability to blend subtle comedic moments with totally over the top scenes. The film was full of cameos (OMG, Beyoncé!), people making fun of themselves and each other-- and above all, it was funny but not at all in a dark way, like some recent films I've really enjoyed ('Don't Look Up' is what comes immediately to mind). 

So, I'm wondering where this type of film is in today's world? I understand there is a certain level of nostalgia involved in writing this post. But I think there's something else there too. My girlfriend and I discussed it, and clearly there are some jokes that probably wouldn't make it today, but I also feel there is plenty to make fun of in today's films/tv that would absolutely hit with audiences. I've seen some satires lately which I found incredibly funny (thinking 'The Curse' [Showtime], or 'White Lotus' [HBO]) but what makes these hilarious is the examination they do on the self conscious behaviors of entitled people, and that can get pretty dark. Every commedy I've seen in the last decade or so has been this way-- good but more cerebral, and certainly calling social mores into question.

Anyway, I guess I just haven't seen a good parody in a while, and I'm wondering why not. If you have a suggestion, please please let me know, I'm dying for some decent stuff right now. SNL is a bit hit and miss for me, but it's about the only thing I can think of that makes fun of modern trends in life/politics/media without getting very heavy. And please pardon me if I'm ranting-- I'm happy to go back and watch my turn-of-the-millenium parodies by myself if nobody else cares for them!

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Vatican City,"Hello there,

this is the last day of my journey through the filmised Europe. Following the official list of european countries by the Council of Europe in an alphabetical order, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in a given country once a day for more than 50 days. Towards the end, things got really complicated again: As the calls for the UK not to be treated as a single country became louder and louder, I broke it down again. Unfortunately, the turnout was very limited, so I would say that if I had to do it again, I wouldn't unravel it again. But we do have a winner: Alongside *Hot Fuzz* (winner for England), *Hunger* (winner for Northern Ireland) and *The Halfway House* (winner for Wales), the winner of the Scotland round has now clinched overall victory for the UK - congratulations go out to ***Trainspotting***.

Basically, this UK final would also have been suitable for the final of this whole project. At the same time, that might have been a very sad participation rate for the final, so I'm glad that one country is still missing - a country that some people were looking forward to, as I could see from the comments: Today, to round things off, it's all about **Vatican City**. And for one last time, I may announce the relevant rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions and hope to see you again in the final thread, where I will anounce the winner of this round!

&gt;Day 49–53: United Kingdom - Trainspotting

&gt;Day 48: Ukraine - Тіні забутих предків (engl.: Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors)

&gt;Day 47: Turkey - Bir Zamanlar Anadolu’da (engl.: Once Upon A Time in Anatolia)

&gt;Day 46: Switzerland - Trois couleurs: Rouge (engl.: Three colours: Red)

&gt;Day 45: Sweden - Det Sjunde Inseglet (engl.: The Seventh Seal)

movies,Why is Frank Darabont underappreciated? ,"Frank Darabont is a fantastic filmmaker. 

The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are considered cinematic classics. They are also both crowd pleasers - it's funny, I've yet to meet anyone that has a bad word to say about either film! 

Aside from this, The Mist (also based on a Steven King story) is considered a beloved contemporary horror film. With arguably one of the greatest endings in horror film history. 

He made the wonderful 2001 film The Majestic. An underrated spellbinding Jim Carey drama. 

He was the show runner on The Walking Dead - which saw huge early success, thanks to his efforts - before stepping down prematurely. He was also the show runner on Mob City, an underappreciated (and sadly cancelled) period gangster drama. 

He was the writer on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Tales from the Crypt, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, The Blob remake, and Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. 

He's directed episodes of The Shield and the upcoming final season of Stranger Things. 

But through all this acclaim, and with such a robust and impressive resume, he's not a household name. Even among cinephiles - such as you and I - his name is not lauded as much as I feel it should be. 

I know he's become somewhat disillusioned with Hollywood and has taken a step back. However, this shouldn't stop him from achieving more love, more reverence, more accolades. 

So, I ask you why? Why is Frank Darabont underappreciated? 

In fact...do you even think he is?! Perhaps it's just me. 

But I believe he belongs in a pantheon of under appreciated filmmakers with an infamous body of work. Robert Zemeckis, John Badham, possibly even John Millius.

There are countless examples in addition to the ones mentioned above, not only in movies but also TV-shows like Punisher and Daredevil.

Or they stand in a circle around the hero, taking turns to attack instead of ganging up.

One question I may have just missed:

Does it ever explain why Cage is railroaded so hard and basically sent to death when he seems to be quite the successful recruiter/PR guy?

And a theoretical question:

Any theories as to why they don’t just hunt more alphas for alpha blood to gain the power again? While Cage still has the power he says to Rita “Go find an alpha, kill it, get blood in your mouth (lol) so you get the powers. If you aren’t back in X amount of hours hours with a successful mission I’ll kill myself and we try again”. Then the one with the most recent save point (I assume if they die they go back in time to when the other would still have the power?) goes on the omega hunting mission until success or until they lose their power. If she loses the power during a mission Cage kills himself and gets Rita the power again by repeating the process.

movies,Oddity in VHS of Monster Squad,"I was feeling nostalgic and decided to watch my old VHS copy of The Monster Squad- the 80's movie where a group of kids team up to take on Dracula and his monster crew. Anyway, I was playing on my phone and let the credits roll to the end, and something weird happened.

Instead of the usual static that you get when a VHS tape finishes, there was a 3-second blip after the credits. It was grainy and muffled like someone was recording it on a camcorder they were trying to hide. It seemed to be one of the kids dads in front of the clubhouse saying something close to, ‘Take Tish’ (I watched it several times and that's the closest I could make out.)

I’ve Googled it, checked Reddit, and searched YouTube, but I can’t find anyone talking about this. It feels like it could be an Easter egg or an accidental addition, but I can't make sense of it.

movies,Filmmakers who ended up as a PERFECT match to adapt an IP,"When Peter Jackson decided visual effects technology was good enough to produce an adaptation of *Lord of the Rings*, he began lobbying for the film to get made, thinking *some big name experienced director* should, and would, take up the challenge. Thankfully, that never materialized, and Jackson himself, to his own surprise, ended up in the director's chair. As it turns out, his passion and reverence for Tolkien's beloved classic proved to be the guiding light of the films production. It was Jackson who insisted on maintaining the three book story line as three films, while the studio was pushing for two. It was Jackson who made sure every cast and crew member *had a copy of the LOTR near by*, to consult as the ""Bible"" of the production. It would seem the stars had aligned, and that Peter Jackson was the perfect man for the job, spearheading a groundbreaking production, the most ambitious the world had ever known, shooting all three films simultaneously, a game changer for the industry, and delivering a trilogy that both resounded with a broader audience, and pleased hardcore fans of the source material. 

But as perfect a match Jackson had been to direct *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, there was yet another property even closer to Jackson's heart. As a boy, it was *King Kong* that lit the fire inside him and kindled his desire to become a filmmaker. Peter was obsessed with *King Kong*, and even attempted to re-make the film using home-made stop motion puppets and a super 8 camera as a precocious nine year old boy. It must have felt like destiny, some 35 years later, when Universal entrusted Jackson with their iconic property, and he found himself at the helm of a full fledged two-hundred-million dollar remake of the very film that, for him, started it all. Peter Jackson was born to make *King Kong*.

It's a phenomenon that seems to bend the odds, when a movie director all but manifests that one project that fulfills a lifelong dream. Denis Villeneuve had long desired to adapt the unadaptable masterpiece that is Frank Herbert's *Dune*. He wasn't shy about it either. Indeed, after hearing Denis talk about his vision for translating the labyrinthine text into the language of cinema, fellow director Christopher Nolan said that he knew then and there Villeneuve was the right man for the job, even back before he was a serious candidate. Of course, Villeneuve's spectacular results are the proof that Nolan was right. 

Of all the directors I follow, none speak more eloquently and intelligently about film than Guillermo del Toro. His knowledge is immense, his insight is profound, and I'll listen to any interview I can get my hands on. Anyone who shares my sentiments knows that del Toro is singularly fascinated by one film: James Whale's Frankenstein. For del Toro, Frankenstein is a work of unrivaled pathos and beauty. When he speaks about it, he brings a depth of understanding and appreciation to the picture that one could hardly anticipate. I was elated when I heard he would be directing his own version. 

I believe these are significant moments. They give me hope that there's still some synchronicity at work in this world. That there is plenty of opportunity for us each to find our own moment, when we are perfectly suited for the task in a way unique to ourselves. 

What other movies do you think represent such connections? When the director seemed hand picked by the turn of providence to realize the project they'd always known would be the one?

movies,"Finally Finished. Watched 505 Movies This Year! If Anyone Cares, Here's A Top 5 (Mostly) From Each Decade.","\*Posted in r/moviecritic as well.

As the title says, I made a goal this year to watch 500 movies this year, roughly 40-50 from each decade to broaden my movie horizons, and while it required DAILY dedication, I finally finished today. In fact, I watched 505 as I also viewed a few bonus movies.

I built the list from Best Picture winners from the big award shows. (Academy Awards, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, etc.) I also used every “Top 100” list I could find, and even used a helpful post here on Reddit that compiled the top 250 based on users scores, which helped find foreign movies.

I made a rule for myself that I had to finish every movie, even if I hated it. (Which gave me the chance to change my mind on a few, like “Holy Motors,” etc.)

So, here’s my Top 5 from each decade, except the 20s which only got 4, and the 2000s, which had too many great movies and gets 11. The movies are only listed in order of title length, except the first one, which was the best in my opinion.

Very excited for next year's viewing list, which is the exact opposite of all this critical acclaim and made up of almost exclusively my Arrow Video Boxsets and Vinegar Syndrome purchases. (Although I am only doing 400 for an easier pace.)

\*EDIT\* I did include an image that showed the list of the 505 movies I watched. As I said in comments, if anyone wants the excel file for their own list, let me know and its all yours.

\*EDIT\* I made a mistake with the date for Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I have it listed as 1998, but it is actually 1988. My bad.

movies,Big Brother (2018),"This is one of Donnie Yen films that I recently watched. Don't know much about the Hong Kong actor aside of him starring in Ip man and a character in John Wick, but this was a film that I was highly interested in seeing. He plays as a teacher who was formerly a military 🪖 soldier and used to be a rebellious student and is now teaching a class of troubled teens that were under performing. The stories with these teens had an interesting background. One that lost his parents and living with his grandmother, 2 brothers living with an alcoholic father, a Tomboy girl that wanted her fathers attention, etc. There's even a scene that touches on teen suicide where he went and bought drugs then later jumped off a balcony and landed in a coma which is a sensitive topic and how the father expressing his neglect about his sons, because his wife went off in an affair was very sad too.

Also, the scene where Donnie went and kicked all the MMA fighters butts in a locker room to help rescue his student was an awesome fight scene and the near climatic ending where he fought all those guys invading the school was nice too.

Overall, a decent quality martial arts film. I do, however, expected Donnie to play more of a role as a teacher and have him expanded more on his teaching abilities to help the students.",DismalBoot7731,1hfoca3,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfoca3/big_brother_2018/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfoca3/big_brother_2018/,2024-12-16 17:27:41,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfoca3

The first trailer for part 1 off across the spiderverse released in December 2021. 3 damn years ago!

I’m 99% sure it was also released with a release date for part 2 slated for March 2024. Well it’s now blown past that.

movies,The handmaiden (2016) needed a third plotwist.,"Watched the movie today. Visually beautiful. The plot is another retelling of the simple story of ‘people in cahoots working together and acting as strangers to fulfill a certain goal.’

The first plotwist was really nice. You don’t see it coming because the first third of the movie is told from the pov of the victim (initially), who is oblivious to the scheme and presented in the bad person light. 

The brief giggle at the asylum door was a very nice misleading touch. It was in my opinion the very scene that made the second plot twist work.

With the way things ended, the movie is nice. A solid 8. But a third plot twist would’ve made things better.

In a hypothetical third act, the count is revealed to be the definitive puppeteer. À la Aizen Sosuke. All along, he is aware of the girls’ intentions to double cross him a certain point. And ends up putting them both in the asylum.

I know it wouldn’t have made sense considering the overreaching theme. The movie is set in patriarchal Korea and Japan, with every male character being a crook, a pervert or both. It’s about women triumphing in a world dominated by men. Women doing without men.

movies,Just finished Oblivion. Legitimately really enjoyed it.,"I'm not going to sit here and say it was the best movie ever. Nor do I have any knowledge about the books the movie is based on. But I had a lot of fun with the movie. (This is my first movie review, plus I'm pretty tired, so I apologize in advance for how disjointed it may feel)

I'll start with what I disliked, which honestly wasn't much:
There were issues with the pacing and the dialogue, I found some performances a little stilted, and some twists were more expected than others (the Tet being evil was obvious from the get go).

As for the positives:
Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, and Morgan Freeman delivered great performances I thought. I found myself actually being super absorbed in the plot, and it wasn't too difficult to follow (like a lot of sci-fi can be), which I liked. I think what everyone can agree on when it comes to this movie is that both the score and the visuals were absolutely top notch. The fact that the movie came out in 2013 blows my mind a little. 

Overall, I thought the movie was a solid 8/10. I can't say I'm totally sure why the movie gets as much hate as it does. Who knows?

I recently watched *The Bra* (2018), and I absolutely loved its calm and slow-paced storytelling, almost like a visual melody. The movie had no dialogue, yet it managed to say so much through its visuals, pacing, and atmosphere.

I find these kinds of films really captivating—ones that focus on visual storytelling, subtle emotions, and minimalism, without relying on spoken words. They’re almost meditative to watch.

I’m hoping to discover more films in a similar vein. Do you know of any other calm, slow-paced movies—preferably dialogue-free or with very little dialogue—that evoke a similar feeling?

movies,It's now ten years since Peter Jackson directed a non-documentary film,"The third Hobbit film came out ten years tomorrow, and there's no sign of him directing anything else any time soon.

I think those movies are ever-so-slightly underrated (I stick up for the EEs as the best versions, as unnecessary as an even *longer* version of that story might sound). But it's hard not to think something about their troubled production, and maybe the ways Hollywood has changed over the years, broke something in old PJ.

Not that he hasn't been keeping busy at all. They Shall Not Grow Old was a really good documentary, and Get Back is essential viewing for Beatles fans. Not to mention his part in getting their 'new' song made. He seems happy enough tinkering with his pet interests.

It's a little sad though to think back on when the LOTRs came out and he was gearing up for King Kong and was still in his early 40's, you could imagine he was only just getting started. But now he seems more or less retired as a director and accepting that LOTR is probably what he'll be remembered for.

In a way, that's fair enough. LOTR is more than most people achieve. Still, it would be nice to see him back and doing something new, even if it's just shooting another horror movie in his backyard like he used to talk about doing.",Critcho,1hflaki,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,2024-12-16 15:14:39,736,0.89,736,0,242,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hflaki

movies,"So, I watched Lord of the Rings: The War of Rohirrim","I watched it yesterday in Germany with English dub. I have to say I was positively surprised, tough it was definitely not perfect.

There was a lot of stuff me and my nerds liked. Mostly the low-fantasy-story itself and how well it fit into the lore and how respectful it was with the source. There were lots of tiny anecdotes to the og-movies, that were easily missed if it weren't for us to point them out after the movie. The characters are all likeable and believable. The protagonist is no Marry Sue, but there is also not a lot of growth, more just problems to avoid and solve, but because she is no demi-god, like Legolas, she fits very nicely and tension is definitely there.

But the same can not be said about her father, the first big negative point in this movie. He starts of strong, good King, leader, makes great decisions and so on. He even wears a helmet, wish his sons would have done the same, would definitely helped one of them. Spoiler:&gt;!But when they reach Gondor, he becomes a bit weird. More or less a demi-god who can take pushes from giant beasts, give punches that kill a man and not freeze to death in the cold winter for days, walking around half naked. It felt a bit like a peasant who would retell the story and did not fit in this very low-fantasy story.!&lt;

Now the biggest negative, the animation. If you know the original animation from 1978, you definitely see some parallels. Why? Because I am very sure it is rotorscoped. The absence of of motion blur is very confusing for the eyes in the first 20 minutes. There is some instances, where it definitely shows. The backgrounds are very close to the original. But they are often also very weak, but I rather have them save on backgrounds, than anywhere else.

Now even tough this sounds very negative in total, I must point out it is still a lovely movie. My friends and me agreed it was enjoyable and a positive experience, be it the one guy who never saw the original movies or the other who literally read the Silmarillion. I am almost certain this movie will get bashed to bits from critics, but I encourage you to watch and make your own picture, because I am pretty sure many of you will enjoy just like we did.

movies,"Catherine O'Hara is simply spectacular as Kevin's mom in the Home Alone movies. She made the most out of a thin role, giving it more humor and depht than it deserved.","If you go through the Home Alone movies, the bond between Kevin and his mom is the heart of the Film. They have a love-hate relationship in which Kate (O'Hara) always sees the bad in Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), because he's a kid  who allows his emotions to get the best of him when he's bullied by Buzz or cursed at by his no good Uncle, but she also has a lot of love for him. But when Kevin is lost or left by the wayside, it's the mom who bears the guilt and tries to figure out what went wrong as well as acknowledging her mistakes. 

One thing I felt lacked in Lost in New York was the mom's subplot. I loved the Catherine O'Hara and John Candy's scenes in the first movie, great chemistry and O'Hara's character got to do a self-examination. 

The sequel, O'Hara is given less to do but the crux of the film continues to be the bond between Kevin and his mom. It's no accident that she's always the one whom Kevin runs to whenever he misses his family. The father is an after-thought in all of this. 

And Catherine O'Hara is superb as Kate. She gives a true depiction of motherhood, one which isn't perfect and it's often flawed but the love and care is still there. And O'Hara is an incredible comedienne and juices up a part which could have easily been another generic mom role.",Davis_Crawfish,1hfmgpm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfmgpm/catherine_ohara_is_simply_spectacular_as_kevins/,2024-12-16 16:07:01,1290,0.94,1290,0,176,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfmgpm

In my humble opinion this results in best career performances by a number of these actors including Thornton, Scott, Ritter, Bernie Mac, Leachman (who barely speaks) and of course The Kid. The quotable quotes are present in every scene “I’m 92 pounds you asshole”, “you know, thin fingers not fat sausage fingers” “ass clown” “I slept with an unclean woman” etc.. the list goes on. This is one of those movies that combines a unique and extremely compelling premise with great comedic performances and mixes in just enough heart to give it perfect balance.

movies,"December 13-15 Box Office Recap: 'Kraven the Hunter' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' massively flop. Meanwhile, 'Moana 2' crosses $700 million worldwide, and 'Interstellar' finally crosses $200 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/xi19z0g5ta7e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f

The man finally came around.

***Moana 2*** was still on top of the box office, although the gap between it and ***Wicked*** is becoming smaller. We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures. ***Kraven the Hunter*** ended the SSU on a new low, while ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** finished outside the Top 5. In limited release, ***Nickel Boys*** had a solid start, while ***September 5*** disappointed.

The Top 10 earned a combined $87.6 million this weekend. That's up 27% from last year, when ***Wonka*** debuted on top.

***Moana 2*** threepeated on the top spot, earning $26.4 million. That's a 48% drop, which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop. After a record-breaking opening weekend, the legs are proving to be quite front-loaded. The film has earned $337.3 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $500 million domestically. And depending on how much it drops against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***, it could miss $450 million domestically.

***Wicked*** was still on second place, but it's getting close to ***Moana 2***. It earned $22.6 million this weekend, which was just 38% down from last weekend. The film has amassed $359.1 million, and it's now poised to earn more domestically than ***Moana 2***. It could start overtaking it next weekend, assuming it doesn't have a bad drop against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***.

Debuting in third place, ***Kraven the Hunter*** flopped with just $11 million in 3,211 theaters. That's the worst debut in the SSU (Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe), and one of the worst for a Marvel property. Hell, it even debuted below ***Kick-Ass*** ($19 million), another R-rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

This is not really a surprise. I mean, where do we start?

The SSU has earned a cumulative $2.1 billion worldwide. But the *Venom* films account for $1.83 billion of that, which is like 86% of its gross. The other two films, ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***, were critical and commercial duds, becoming Internet's laughingstock. Even the ***Venom*** films are already losing good will among the general audience. Basically, it's a universe with absolutely nothing to offer, where the bar keeps going lower and lower. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times...

But how could ***Kraven*** open below ***Madame Web***? On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released, ***Kraven*** barely felt like a comic book movie. The trailers emphasized brutal action, but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks. The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider-Man, yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story. With no signs of Spider-Man.

For some reason, Sony decided that ***Kraven*** warranted a big budget. The film was originally set at $90 million, which rose to $110 million due to the strikes (although some reports say that it actually cost $130 million). That's almost on par with the previous ***Venom*** film, and it's way too high for a C-lister. Especially when they made it R-rated. Sony is aware that this universe isn't working; [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kraven-the-hunter-sony-marvel-universe-spider-man-box-office/) reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe, choosing to focus on ***Spider-Man 4***, ***Beyond the Spider-Verse*** and the ***Spider-Noir*** series. They admitted defeat before the film even came out.

There was some slight hope that J.C. Chandor's presence would also lead to a competent film. But that was not the case; it's currently at an awful 15% on RT. Nothing but a paycheck. 

According to Sony, 71% of the audience was male, which is higher than usual for a comic book title. 40% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a horrible ""C"" on CinemaScore, which is even worse than ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***. If you think these numbers look bad, just wait for the second weekend drop. Even with the holiday season, it's unlikely ***Kraven*** can hit $30 million domestically. A comparison could be ***Star Trek: Nemesis***, which also opened on December 13. After disappointing with $18 million, it closed with just $43 million. If it follows the same trajectory, ***Kraven*** will finish with just $25 million. Yike.

After its rough drop, ***Gladiator II*** slightly recovered. It dropped 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. Looks like ***Kraven*** barely had an impact. The film has earned $145.7 million, and it should finish with close to $170 million.

Barely cracking the Top 5 was ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, which flopped with just $4.5 million this weekend. There's no point in even comparing it to the ***Lord of the Rings*** trilogy, which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend.

While ***The Lord of the Rings*** is a massively popular franchise, there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel. To understand how anime has a ceilling; last year, ***The Boy and the Heron***, with all the buzz it could achieve, made $46 million domestically. That's far less than what other animated films can earn. Warner Bros. knew this couldn't be a big moneymaker, which is why they only spent $30 million on the film, and released it in just 2,602 theaters.

It has been reported that the film's existence was fast-tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien's novels. Although with the recent announcement of a ***Hunt for Gollum*** film coming in 2026, it was clear ***Rohirrim*** wouldn't really be a priority. If people were on the fence over this film, the film's middling reviews (51% on RT) indicated that this wasn't worth it.

According to Warner Bros., 68% of the audience was male and 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a lukewarm ""B"" on CinemaScore, far worse than any Middle-Earth film. This is not gonna last long in theaters; it'd be a surprise if this earned over $15 million lifetime.

Despite being available on Prime Video, ***Red One*** dropped just 39% this weekend, adding $4.2 million. The film has earned $92.4 million, and it's fighting to hit $100 million.

It took 10 years, but Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** has crossed $200 million domestically. The IMAX re-release added $3.6 million, which was just 21% down from last weekend. Fantastic all around.

***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** fell 67% this weekend, adding $1.6 million and taking its domestic total to $13 million.

***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** eased just 14% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $36.6 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer***, which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend. That allowed it to increase again, earning $790,954. The film's domestic total stands at $1.9 million, and it will need some Oscar buzz here.

***Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem*** finished outside the Top 10 with $737K during the weekend ($2.3 million four-day).

A24's ***Y2K*** lost 160 theaters and fell 68%, earning $684,957 this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $3.7 million, and it's gonna miss $5 million.

Paramount released ***September 5***, an awards hopeful, into 7 theaters. But the film earned $80,802, which translates to a very underwhelming $11,543 per-theater average. The film will expand nationwide on January 17, 2025, but this is a very weak start.

Amazon MGM's ***Nickel Boys*** debuted in 2 theaters, and earned $54,794 this weekend. That's a solid $27,397 per-theater average, and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl*** debuted in one single screen, earning $50,300 this weekend. That's a fantastic per-theater average, making it the fifth highest of the year. It will hit nationwide in January.

***Moana 2*** was once again topping the overseas box office. It added $57 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $716.8 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), UK ($33.5M), Germany ($24.8M), Mexico ($23.5M) and Brazil ($21.1M). It's gonna the billion milestone, but it's taking some time in getting there.

***Wicked*** added $21.5 million, and its worldwide total is now $525 million. It debuted in Germany with $4 million, which is the best for a Broadway film. The film's best markets are the UK ($55.2M), Australia ($20.1M), Korea ($12M), Mexico ($9M) and Philippines ($5M). It will hit its final market, Japan, on February.

***Kraven the Hunter*** also flopped overseas. It earned just $15 million, taking its worldwide debut to just $26 million. For comparison, ***Madame Web*** earned $49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just $100 million. There's a strong chance ***Kraven*** finishes below $60 million worldwide.

After missing the mark domestically, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** also flopped overseas, earning only $4 million overseas. That's a paltry $9.9 million worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Smile 2* | Oct/18 | Paramount | $23,021,692 | $68,967,012 | $137,991,092 | $28M

- Paramount's ***Smile 2*** has closed with $137 million worldwide. While that's a 37% drop from the original, it's still a box office success. Reception as a whole was much better than the first, with Naomi Scott earning praise for her performance. ***Smile 3: This Time It's Personal*** should be coming anytime now.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

***Moana 2*** will cede the top spot, and it's a battle between a lion and a hedgehog.

Disney is releasing ***Mufasa: The Lion King***, five years after the 2019 remake earned over $1.6 billion worldwide. Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins, and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar. This is a strong IP, but this is uncharted territories, given that this is a completely new story with new songs. It's not gonna come anywhere close to that $1.6 billion gross, but we'll see how much it can make.

The other release is ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3***. The franchise is going strong, and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow, which drew hype among the Internet. The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film, and the pre-sales look very strong so far. With the holiday corridor, another increase is pretty much imminent.

In limited release, A24 is opening Brady Corbet's ***The Brutalist***. It stars Adrien Brody as László Tóth, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States, where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life. The film has received fantastic reviews so far, and it's poised to become a big Oscar player. Look for a healthy run, even if the 215-minute runtime might be too much for many.
