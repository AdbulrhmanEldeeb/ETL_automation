books,Have you ever read a book written by someone you knew personally? What did you think?,"TLDR: my ex's novel showed promise, but was unpolished and, imo, unfinished.

I have an ex who was always interested in writing a novel.  She had had a few essays and short stories published in magazines while I still knew her, then we broke up.

After a few years, during which we'd completely lost contact, I found her novel for sale online and bought a copy.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.  There were several elements that I enjoyed, some I even remembered her telling me about years before, but the whole thing seemed rushed and incomplete.  I also noticed very obvious influences from other novels she had recommended to me from her literature courses in uni which made it seem partially unoriginal.

Anyone else have a similar experience?

books,What happens to your ebooks when you die?,"What happens to your ebooks when you die? Can you bequeath them to someone else?

But I also have an ebook collection that's restricted to particular ereaders. Unless I give my account details to someone else, it seems like the collection will just die along with me.

books,Just read Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka,"I cant believe it took me this long.

I dove right in without prior expectations, just a friend's book suggestion. Right out of the gate, l thought it had a comedic premise to it. Who can blame me? Gregor being turned into an insect and was practically unbothered by it was such an absurd situation, coupled with some lines which made me audibly chuckle. (mainly the part where he wanted to do a simple task as dragging a linen sheet, and there was a bracketed line (this task took him 4 hours)). That was hilarious.

Anyway, after I finished the book, I couldn't help but wonder if turning into an insect was a euphemism (?) for depression. Think about it, struggling to get out of bed in the morning, being shut in his room, losing joy in things he used to love. IMO, this transformation was of a psychological suffering after losing his job, his self worth, being alienated from his family and society alike. It was an amazing read, witnessing the transformation of his family as well as Gregor himself.

Let me know what you think! Excited to see many perspectives on this.

books,Just read Matterhorn. What a great mix of aspects of a war novel ,"This gripping book takes the reader to war with a young marine officer on his first combat tour.  

I've read that the writing process took decades after Marlantes went to Vietnam. I believe it.  The book introduces you to boredom and blood, body horror (leeches and rot) racial tension, beauracratic indifference and incompetence, theft and corruption, loyalty and courage, survivors guilt and more. 

The writing ranges from brutal and direct to philosophical and empathetic.  If you have ever wanted to recommend catch 22 to someone but want a more straightforward story, Matterhorn would be a good choice.  

It's a well crafted story about flawed humans caught in complex structures, doing violence.  I will probably revisit it, but not soon.  

If any of you have read it, what are your thoughts?

How did the discussion between Mr JLB Matekoni and Mma Ramotswe conclude after he asked her if she would ever leave him? This is after he had developed the photo. He eventually asked her this while they were eating at the table. 

The library audiobook copy I have borrowed has an issue and skipped from that part to the bit about Mma Ramotswe thinking about the case with the hospital deaths in the same bed, specifically she is thinking that a good explanation has already been provided.
