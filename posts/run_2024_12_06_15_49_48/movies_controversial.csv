movies,"What titles to watch to engage in some schadenfreude, in light of recent healthcare news","I'm curious what films others might recommend to support the feelings of schadenfreude* many of us are feeling over the death of the UnitedHealthcare CEO.

There are two titles that come to my mind.

*The Rainmaker* is a '90s adaptation of a John Grisham legal drama novel of the same name, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Its cast is an absolute murderer's row of talent. In the film, &gt;!a young Matt Damon brings a case of unlawful denial of care against a huge healthcare insurer, on behalf of the family of a young man with leukemia.!&lt;

*Hell or High Water* is directed by David Mackenzie, based on a script by the only screenwriter whose name I've memorized, Taylor Sheridan. The modern western plot follows &gt;!two brothers as they go on a bank robbing spree against a particular chain of banks in order to gather the money needed to keep their family farm. Law enforcement is frustrated by locals who willfully turn a blind eye to the robberies in support against the bank they despise.!&lt;

I'm interested to hear titles that come to mind for others, and why you recommend it! Don't forget the spoiler tags either! \&gt;!spoiler text goes here, between the paired symbols!&lt;

movies,What is the appeal of feel bad movies? Why do some enjoy and prefer dark disturbing movies?,"I have a friend, who‚Äôs a very silly funny guy. Very privileged dude with a nice loving family. Young in his 20s.

He turned me onto to these European ‚Äúfeel bad‚Äù filmmakers. Lars Von Trier, Gaspar Noe, Haneke etc. 

Stuff that disturbed me in these movies this guy just laughs at. (Spoilers ahead) like in the house that jack built when he murders the whole family. He said he thought that was funny. And i couldn‚Äôt even look at the screen. I was getting sick to my stomach.

Granted I liked a lot of movies from these directors, but they were definitely not an easy watch and I wouldn‚Äôt want to watch them again.

Does it say something about someone psychologically if they love these kind of movies? Im not at all saying they‚Äôre bad people.

movies,Subservience (2024) - Thriller/Sci-fi,"SPOOOOILER   
this is for those who HAVE WATCHED THE FILM AND WANT TO DISCUSS. this is my own take (why I liked it, what would have made it better, etc.)

this isn't ur average: ""robots take over the world and they're bad because..."" story. I mean, yes- from the beginning its giving- proceed with caution but this twist on what could be is fantastic. I was SO excited for this film before even watching it. I will begin with, I love futuristic, end of the world or new world films (and novels.) and I gotta say I love the idea of AI overpowering human kind because as a society we are ABSOLUTELY heading in that direction and surprisingly no one seems to realize this writing is an inference of what will happen if we continue. my overall score is 7/10 read below for my analysis and reasoning. 



my initial opinion of the main character (Nick) is he is smart, handy, nurturing, patient, and so goddamn sexy. hes a pretty complex character imo, he was constantly battling with what is right/ wrong from the beginning.  he works a blue collar job (that can and eventually are replaced by SIMS) and tries his hardest to fight against his friends losing their jobs. but he actively uses extremely advanced technology like his refrigerator, populating bars utilizing SIMS to serve, and ofc hiring his own SIM. he expresses a high sex drive (source: when Maggie (his wife) is literally in the hospital bed waiting for her heart surgery, hes making jokes abt getting her back to the marathons they used to have- but she doesn't seem to mind, shes pressing into him too so we can only assume she has an equally high sex drive too) but remains faithful even when he feels an unintentional attraction to Alice. 

when Nick asked Alice to wipe her memory in order to ""experience"" Casablanca, that's exactly what she did. she consumes the film as if shes a part of it. erasing her program to reprogram the story as her own. she tells Nick that resetting her in order to ""forget"" the memory she has of Casablanca will be antithetical, but he still does it. the quote from the movie we see is ""you are a man. if someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?"" then the call is interrupted by a call from Maggie. 

  
the entire film counters being dependent on AI, but very much distinguishing their inability to experience life through emotions. in the beginning scenes, the sales person explains the longer the AI unit is with the family/ the more knowledge it obtains the better it will perform. but no one seems to think they can replicate emotions or make decisions outside of their based programming?   
as soon as she wipes her memory.. she learns only: Nick, Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland. throughout the film we see her putting together the metaphoric similarities of their real life to the characters of Alice in Wonderland when speaking with Isla as well. she even notes wiping her own civility because ""it's better."" aka more human. aka creating a more genuine link to human emotion. (this doesn't make sense to me, because in this film- the companies programming these SIMS are extremely hands on- later in the film the company even immediately takes action in bringing in two employees well after working hours to reset/ reprogram Alice. every story of robots taking over the world seems to always conclude that robots will outsmart the companies who make them. so in a world where we're so far advanced; AI is in your home and consuming more and more information all the time, is it really so crazy to assume the companies who created them would want to check in on their projects' progress? the amount of times we hear how much money they cost, you think they would have scheduled tune ups frequently. with scheduled check ups, the companies would have found out a lot of her program was wiped and I think this fact kind of kept me in movie mode- not so much lose myself in the film mode.)

   
to me, it's obvious the matter of ""messing around"" with Alice wouldn't have ever crossed Nick's mind if she didn't look the way she did. there would have never been a moment where he was willing to risk anything if Alice was ""an old English butler,"" which was originally what Nick and Maggie had originally discussed when purchasing a nanny SIM.   
he gives the explanation that ""Isla chose her,"" and I think this is a really great moment to note: he really was teetering back and forth whether he found it wrong or not. he clearly liked to look but even if the idea crossed his mind- he never tempted himself with any action. it wasn't until Maggie told Alice that if she died, Alice needed her to comfort Nick and make sure he's taken care of. the first time they messed around (in the garage later that night) Alice initiated it. she convinced him she wasn't real (because her heartbeat is just a simulation programmed to provide comfort to humans) and encouraged him to proceed if only for his own health and he does.   
the second time is after the shower when she again, tempts him with lingerie and a blindfold. she disguises herself as Maggie which was such a nice touch because it really enforces the idea that there is nothing human about her and essentially can be or do whatever he needs. and \*\*ok honestly\*\* lets face it the bathroom scene was... nice   Õ°¬∞ Õú  Õ°  
  
BUT I really hate that that's the extent of their relationship. the next morning, Nick ""ends it"" with her, the wife gets her surgery and comes home and then it turns into this weird vibe between the women. all of a sudden, we see a jealous/ competitive side from Maggie (ie: dirty looks when Alice cared for the baby, cattiness towards Alice when she asked for the family recipe, etc.) I dont understand because at this point Maggie has no idea that Alice and Nick have had sex- Alice has only shown she is an obedient and hard-working and loving nanny so idk how the vibes are so far off when there wasnt a single hospital visit that was weird?

here's where the story line goes all over the place. there was SO much build up between Nick and Alice and then for like 6 scenes in a row you don't even see the two of them in conversation. we have the playground scene (where we learn Alice has changed her software to have more of a human approach to casual encounters,) the shower scene between Nick and Maggie (where Alice interrupts with Isla's nightmare,) then we see Monty attack Nick, Alice k\*lling Monty (\*but we also learn that Monty: hater of all SIMS, OWNS A SIM. he's coked out and contemplating suicide but we also learn hes been using and ab\*sing his SIM,) then the bathtub scene between the women (again- would have been a nice time to see Alice be useful to Maggie??? this woman has just had open heart surgery, her medicine has proved two separate times to cause dizziness, and she isn't thankful to have the extra hands on deck. again- up until THIS POINT SPECIFICALLY, she doesnt know Nick and Alice have hooked up. obviously in this scene, she puts it together, but in my perfect world, she would have accepted the help from Alice and welcomed the extra energy she has to take care of her husband- which before she was about to die was her only concern? idk weird continuity there, but again this is the scene she puts together that they've indeed had sex. but then immediately the scene goes from Maggie and Nick talking about his affair to Alice trying to drown the baby. 

??? huh !!! ???   
I have watched this movie now three times all the way through and this just does not add up. her software changes up until this point could always be justified with \~what she was learning real time.\~ she says its bc Max is a ""burden,"" which in the beginning Nick (when Max was crying,) shushes him and says ""quite the little burden,"" but the words are never brought up again and that was BEFORE the hard wipe before Casablanca. so..... yeah I really really dont understand this part.   
not to mention miss ""I just had open heart surgery"" takes on scaling the house and fighting a robot? 

  
I definitely wouldnt have made her turn on the kids- if there was no hope in seeing a harmonious relationship between the women, I would have much rather seen Alice drowning Maggie in the bathtub and played it off as ""people accidentally drown all the time,"" or using her medication symptoms to her own advantage and coerced Maggie into hurting herself or the kids (making Nick question her character, aka not be in love with her.) 

ok so then yada yada, we're at the hospital with the baby to check on his vitals (even though he was never even submerged in the water? kinda dramatic to take him by ambulance to the ER but whatever. flashes to the bar scene where Alice speaks in a revised quote from Casablanca and informs Nick, she k\*lled Monty for him, and will take care of his family (alluding to the fact that she had connections in the hospital at the same moment.) then Nick attempts to trick her (c'mon now.. shes clearly proved she cant die?) and k\*ll her and he races to the hospital. ofc we get this unrealistic fast and furious driving through the snowy streets only to have his car crash into an ambulance pinning Alice in between them. SHOCKER: she still doesnt die. we have to sit through terrible fight sequences and multiple fake deaths before everyone walking away barely scathed. Nick is in a hospital bed with light bruising and Maggie is healing in a wheelchair with both children and she invites him to come home \*rolls eyessssss. the film then ends with a 30 second clip of Alice's software uploading on every SIM and her opening her eyes after reconstruction of her face implying a sequel.... I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say we dont need it. 

tldr;   
my rating would be higher than 7/10 if the company was more hands on, there was more of a relationship (whether that would have been friendship or romantic) built between Nick and Alice, a more manipulative side of Alice towards Maggie, more mentions of Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland (so we could have definitively seen the allusion to the stories playing IRL for Alice,) and heres a big kicker: I really wish that Nick would have died in the car crash. this may be so so over the top controversial, but I think it would have been very \~poetic justice\~ if he died trying to save Maggie when it was his actions that potentially destroyed them in the first place  

  
anyway :) definitely watch the movie!! big fan!!

movies,"Genuinely, how do you feel about how Alien: Romulus used Ian Holm's face?","For those who didn't catch that while watching the movie, it wasn't an actor who played Rook (kinda obvious honestly). Daniel Betts voiced Rook, but the character in itself is some sort of mask molded after¬†Ian Holm's face when he was in his late 40s (specifically when he played Ash in¬†Alien¬†).

I've seen many people talking about whether this approach was even ethical.

On the one hand,¬†Fede Alvarez¬†did talk with Ian's wife to see if she was fine with them doing this, so the person who would most likely be affected by seeing Ian on screen was removed from the equation. And this wasn't a copy of Ian's most relevant appearance, aka the year before he died, so you might make a case for that too.

On the other hand, getting permission from his wife isn't like getting permission from him. So you can't say he would have been fine with his appearance being used. As for the point of his younger appearance being used, this might actually not matter at all since it is still Ian's appearance.

Look! I really liked Romulus, but this could have been easily avoided if they just cast someone who looks like Ian to play Rook or keep with the original plan to have a different person for Rook. That was possible since the movie has amazing practical effects, and I'm sure the artists would have come up with genius ideas to hide the lower part of Rook's body.

movies,The Odds (2018),"Got recommended this movie on amazon prime as a ""you might also like"" for Cube Zero, to firmly contextualize the type of movie it is. A cheap thriller that had me genuinely surprised at the quality. An intriguing concept about a woman who chooses to partake in a game where enduring pain progresses you towards the monetary prize.


What really surprised me was the quality of the cinematography, direction, acting, sound, and a solid enough script for a cheap film. Thought it unusual to find almost 0 discussion or articles about it online, considering the other schlock out there with better visability. 

Just wanted to see what other people thought of it, or if anyone had suggestions for similarily low budget but well made films? As well as to leave evidence that this movie exists, and I at least enjoyed it (though it could've been 15 minutes shorter).",450nmwaffle,1h7ezhz,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7ezhz/the_odds_2018/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7ezhz/the_odds_2018/,2024-12-05 17:45:26,0,0.5,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7ezhz
movies,"Movies with ""video game plots""","It's hard to articulate exactly, but after seeing Moana 2 (which I didn't love), I was reminded that the first one's (which I do love) structure reminded me of a video game. They're quest movies, obviously, but there's something about the episodic nature of the movies and the level/boss battle/fetch quest elements that really felt like video game storytelling. She even levelled up at the end of the movie! 

One of the people I saw Moana 2 with, who doesn't play video games, also felt that the writing felt a little off. Did anyone else feel this way? What other movies' plots feel like video games? (Besides the obvious movies that are adapted from games.)

It‚Äôs hard for me to narrow it down, but the funniest scenes for me were Dustin Hoffman getting crushed by rubble in what is essentially a family guy style cutaway. One of the most unceremonious deaths I‚Äôve ever seen, especially considering how little of the movie he was in.

Any scene with Shia Labeouf, all of them were wild. I think I‚Äôll go with when he throws his hat down and yells at his assistant to pick it up, who in turn does the same thing to the guy behind them

movies,Rewatched The Devil Wears Prada,"I rewatched The Devil Wears Prada. I have not seen it for many years, so I was glad to revisit it especially after all the discussions revolving the movie. Here is what I get from the movie:

# Miranda is awful, but Andy is too naive to empathize for

Miranda's treatment of Andy is awful. I would feel bad for Andy if she was not so stupid. She is an aspiring journalist who is way too unperceptive to be an effective one.

From the beginning, she is being told by everyone her position is one people would die for. Despite this, she still sees it as a joke despite being told over and over again how serious this role is. The only reason she wanted the job is because her other choice was Auto Universe magazine. [Andy snickers at the choice of belts to choose.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-KQij0I8I) Miranda dresses her down in front of everyone. I would feel bad for her if she did not already been made aware how big of a deal this is. Like girl, you've been told so many times.

Next, Miranda asks her to do the impossible task of finding her a flight. When she fails, she is admonished by Miranda.

&gt;I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid. But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl. I had hope. I always have hope. But you‚Äôre as disappointing as anyone else.

Narratively, this scene is not earned. The task should be something difficult but not impossible, and probably something that someone who is interested in fashion could manage. Her saying that to Andy is more petty than cruel given the circumstances.

So what does Andy learns from this? [That Miranda hates her.](https://imgur.com/5Q2PaYS) [Nigel gives her a reality check.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJf-J5RXxw8) Nigel once again tells her how important Runway is, something she should have caught on right now. Then, Andy comes up with the first smart idea: start dressing like she works at Runway. Nigel even helps her, probably thinking ""this dumb bitch finally caught on"".

Later, Nigel is telling Andy about Miranda's scale:

&gt;In her way. There‚Äôs a scale. One nod, good. More than one nod -- very good. There is only one actual smile on record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she doesn‚Äôt like it, she shakes her head. And then there‚Äôs the pursing of the lips. Catastrophe.

So what are Andy's first words after this?

&gt;So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?

LIKE HOW ARE YOU STILL NOT GETTING THIS??????

Smart Andy is then gets bamboozled by twins in messing up the book delivery. For punishment, Miranda is giving her impossible task #2: get the unreleased Harry Potter book in 4 hours. She gets it done, which is insane. She is finally happy to get something right (that something right is literally doing the impossible, but to her it's like ""hahaha I finally did not majorly fuck up"")

The movie seems to want to make us believe that Andy is similar to Miranda. Miranda tells Andy:

&gt;I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.

How does Miranda see ANYTHING in her in Andy??? Andy is so naive and dumb. Then Miranda says that what Andy did to Emily was cold. How???

Miranda was basically threatening to fire Andy if she did not go to Paris. Hell,[ Andy even went to visit Emily in the hospital after her accident.](https://imgur.com/Qm3RMWj) Andy should know how Emily would feel about the Paris trip, but she is like ""omg you know how she is"". Either she is like Miranda visiting Emily at the Hospital for some sick pleasure (doubtful), or she is just naive about how the world works.

Anyways, Andy is pretty dumb.

# Nate is not really a bad boyfriend.

A big piece of the conversation revolving this movie is how bad of a boyfriend Nate is. Some even say he is the real villain. This is ridiculous. Here is my scene by scene take on him.

***SCENE 1 - Opening Montage***

[The first shot we get of Nate is him chilling in bed saying ""Good luck."" ](https://imgur.com/HCjFzJt)This is a man with no aspirations. While his girlfriend is getting ready to work, he is reading the comics + games section of the newspaper. Andy and Nate seem to be in good terms her though, so she is familiar with how he is.

***SCENE 2 - Dinner with Friends***

When Andy, Nate, and their friends go out to eat, her friends and her take solace in the fact that they all have shitty jobs. When walking back to home, they hold hands and make fun of how ridiculous the workers dress at Runway. This shows how both Andy and Nate do not take their jobs too seriously.

***SCENE 3 - Andy Coffee Dial***

Andy wakes up to a phone call from Emily and has to go get coffee immediately. [Nate's gives the look like he is saying ""oh brother... jobs am I right??""](https://imgur.com/lFllBP4)

***SCENE 4 - Andy is Venting About Her Job***

Nate is cooking a grilled cheese sandwich on a skillet, which is awfully on-brand for our underachieving king. Nate serves her the grilled cheese which Andy says that she will not partake because everyone is skinny at Runway (red flag?!?). Andy then makes the promise of it being only one year, which Nate nonchalantly says ""Easy there, tiger."" while he is chewing on the grilled cheese. Classic Nate.

***SCENE 5 - New Wardrobe***

Andy surprises Nate with her new clothes. Nate hits her with a [classic Nate line.](https://imgur.com/cALodxM) Now Nate somewhat superficially likes an aspect of her job.

***SCENE 6 - Bar with Friends***

This is where the main issue arrives. Andy sings the praises of Runway, which then Nate makes a quip about Andy drinking the Kool-Aid after praising Runway. This makes sense, they both laughed at how silly fashion is in the beginning, Nate still remains the same while Andy now admires it. The friends playing with her work phone when they just accepted gifts she got from work is shitty though.

Sidenote: the next scene, blonde hair man asks for some samples of her writing to get her connections. She rejects this offer because she is Miranda's assistant. So maybe Nate was onto something here...

***SCENE 7 + 8 - Andy calls Nate Saying She Wants to Quit.***

After given the impossible task of getting the Harry Potter books, she calls Nate saying she wants to quit. [We finally see Nate working, which is cool too.](https://imgur.com/SOoIlim) Next scene Nate comes home to see Andy working on the twins' science project (Red flag?!?!?!).  She starts defending her boss after Nate calls her a wacko (a wacko surely would not have their assistant work on her niece's science project). The conversation comes to an end when [Andy shows her sexy bra](https://imgur.com/SXRlBEL), which is the weakness of a simple man like Nate.

***SCENE 9 - Poor Nate is Alone on his Birthday***

Andy was working and had to miss Nate's birthday. She then [comes home to a single cupcake with a candle on top of it saying ""Happy Birthday"".](https://imgur.com/d8MSnyD) After briefly explaining herself, Nate just says ""Don't worry about it. I'm going to bed"". Not even Andy's sexy bra will save her this time. He then tells her ""You look very pretty"", and goes to bed. He is unhappy because Andy bailed on him.

***SCENE 10 - Andy Won't Go to Bed***

Nate asks Andy if she will go to bed. She says [five minutes ](https://imgur.com/9QnrUni)(doubtful). She is looking at some personal photos, but the tension is definitely there.

***SCENE 11 - The Art Exhibit***

Andy's friend sees the blonde man giving Andy a kiss on the cheek. Andy's friend asks Andy why she is cheating on Nate (it is a misunderstanding). The friend leaves, and clueless ass Nate comes from the back asking [""You're going to Paris?""](https://imgur.com/K90oVIo)

Nate asks ""I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or..."" and Andy responds ""Great. Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?"". Andy walks away [leaving Nate in utter shock.](https://imgur.com/Se2YpsG) They argue. Nate suggests to take a break. When Nate is walking away, Andy calls for him, but alas she gets call from Miranda.

This is probably the most contentious scene, but I do not see how Nate is in the wrong. Andy is completely different now, why would they want to stay together anyways? Nate is asking her to be genuine: either be the same with him or aspire to be a Runway worker. And he got his answer in the end, she decides to answer Miranda.

***SCENE 12 - Andy Apologizes to Nate***

Andy apologizes to Nate, saying:

&gt;Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?

This is apology misses the point. Andy shouldn't be sorry about that, she should be sorry for not knowing what she really wanted to be. Nate accepts the apology though, he is not very bright.

**IN CONCLUSION - Is Nate a Bad Boyfriend?**

Not really. He is a dumb underachiever. Andy changed too much and will not acknowledge it, so Nate had to say it openly for her to understand.

**TL;DR: The movie is not very well written.**",ParticularJoker,1h7pn6d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7pn6d/rewatched_the_devil_wears_prada/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7pn6d/rewatched_the_devil_wears_prada/,2024-12-06 01:26:39,0,0.38,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h7pn6d

movies,The sequels to Terminator 2,"I just re-watched all the Terminator 3 versions, and just thought I'd give some feedback.

I'm a big fan of the original two movies. T2 is IMHO one of the best movies ever made. T1 is also an amazing movie, but I don't feel it's aged well.

The TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles I feel was the best continuation of the series. Though there was a lot of filler episodes, it felt true to the spirit of the Terminator franchise.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines I really didn't like. There's too many jokes, it feels like a parody. Stuff like the camp glasses the T800 wears and the breasts inflating. The ended felt really good, but the journey felt so corny I couldn't enjoy it.

(Terminator Salvation I haven't watched yet, but it's a continuation from Rise of the Machines, so I'm comfortable leaving it out).

Terminator Genisys I think is my favorite T3. I enjoyed the twists with John Conner and the stuff about Genisys, and the stuff with Pops. It's weak as a Terminator film, but it feels like the best of a bad bunch.

Terminator: Dark Fate I cannot stand. The twist at the start with John just left a bad taste in my mouth, and the humanization of the T800 just makes no sense.

movies,name of movie trope?,"What's the name of the movie trope where a character is either about to crash into something, or somethings about to crash into them, and instead of running they scream into the camera before getting hit?

I hope there will be a sequel, it has the opportunity for it. Even though it was revealed Clyde dug out tunnels and shit, it didn't really show it was actually Clyde. I hope he really had an accomplice, or a copycat that fights for the same thing as him. There's a possibility for a sequel on this character, which the story goes on the way of a cycle, the same thing that happened to Clyde's family, happened to Nick's, but it's the accomplice of Clyde, instead of random murderers.

movies,RDJ as Doctor Doom might be one of the biggest fumbles OAT.,"Ok so I like many other marvel fans have kinda not been paying attention to most of marvels recent projects, so guess my surprise when I hear that they are making the new major villain Doctor Doom, one of my favorite villains in all of media. Doctor Doom is the ruler of a foreign nation who uses both science and magic, as well as his incredibly high IQ, to destroy his opponents and try and raise his country to prosperity as well as any other motivations he may have. He is one of the most brutal and harsh characters marvel has to offer and the actor they choose to play him is RDJ????? 

Don't get me wrong RDJ is a great actor and was fantastic as Tony Stark, he also demonstrated his ability to play a serious villain in Oppenheimer, however RDJs whole vibe is completely wrong, Doctor Doom is a character that no matter the context should feel menacing and dangerous as well as calculating and incredibly serious, RDJ is not this, he is iron man. 

Idk this all feels like a cash grab or they just don't really care. So many other actors could've played Doom amazingly (Javier Bardem comes to mind) and also Doom is literally the ruler of a foreign country his accent wouldn't be American. Ik this is jumping the gun and the movie could be great but Doom is such a perfect villain to follow thanos, someone less physically powerful (although he can get quite the powerup) but smarter then anyone the Avengers have faced yet.

movies,Why do Tyler Perry movies look so cheap when they mostly aren‚Äôt?,"This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. 

I don‚Äôt understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. 

My theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn‚Äôt look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. 

Maybe that‚Äôs not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovenia,"Hello there!

Since more than 40 days, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. Yesterday, we took a look at Slovakia, and even though I haven't seen the winning movie yet - as is so often the case here - I'm pretty sure it will be a worthy entry on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Obchod na Korze*** (engl.: *The Shop on Main Street*) has not only made it here, but also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.

Will we have such a high-ranking visitor in the next round, too? Well, we'll see. Our next country is no longer Slovakia, but **Slovenia**, and as everytime before, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Theory about the missing folder in Whiplash (2014),"In Whiplash (2014)Tanner‚Äôs Whiplash sheet music can be seen in the first rehearsal. In the final scene where Nieman plays for Fletcher, the same exact sheet music with the same markings can be seen. Suggesting it was stolen by either Nieman or Fletcher. 

https://imgur.com/a/unFP8da

Okay, given that there is no scene where we see the actual sheet being given to Nieman at the end of the film it can‚Äôt be totally confirmed BUT to consider: 

 1. Before the final scene Nieman clearly has brought his own folder with him for the concert. Does this mean that the whiplash sheet music would be in that folder?  

 2. Fletcher could have given Nieman the sheet music when he got there, but this is never seen. It would depend on what the usual protocol is for concerts which I don‚Äôt know much about.  

 3. In the middle of the movie, Nieman can be seen photocopying copy‚Äôs of whiplash to learn at his dorm. This version has NO markings on it. Which suggests that Fletcher gives out blank pages with no markings and the markings were put there by Tanner himself, the version we see at the first rehearsal and at the final scene has to be his own personal one.

movies,WDAS and Pixar Copying Marvel Studios IP Flex Logo in the Future?,"I have been thinking about how Disney and Marvel Studios changed logo branding forever by making it their standard of having long, grandiose, self-serving and congratulatory logos that pretty much serve as a sizzle reel to promote their most popular and relevant brands. Kids and Disney Adults are more likely to be exposed to already established IP that is safe to invest rather than new ideas (which are likely to banned in Hollywood in favor of tax write offs).

The current Disney Studios logo is honestly very stimulative and busy with the fireworks and Easter Eggs all over it.

What if Disney Animation and Pixar decide one day to change their logos to copy exactly what Marvel is doing?

For WDAS, Steamboat Mickey transitions only to their most relevant ""franchises"" like Frozen, Wreck-it-Ralph, the Disney Princesses and Zootopia along with some other movies similar to the current DreamWorks logo.

Pixar, whether it is still the hopping lamp or phased out, is stepped aside in favor of their biggest franchises like Toy Story, Cars, Incredibles and Inside Out.

Christophe Beck and Michael Giacchino can compose new music to mimic the Marvel Studios fanfare with a minimalistic rhythm and melody that is just enough to sell it. And the logos have to clock in at 30-40 seconds. Disney has made long logos their identity and do you think they can pull this strategy off for both Disney Animation and Pixar? What other ideas do you have in mind if they were mandated to reimagine their logos?

DreamWorks and Star Wars have done this now.

movies,"What happened to Rotten Tomatoes' ""Five Favorite Films""?","I'm not usually a fan of the site itself, but one of the major outliers that left enough enthusiasm in me to continue visiting it was its ""Five Favorite Films"" editorials, where there would either be videos or articles of various actors/actresses/filmmakers discussing their top 5 favorite movies, one of my personal favorites of all being Nicolas Cage's top 13 favorites list. 

To me, knowing about an actor or filmmaker's favorite movies is a great way to understand their vision and inspirations behind their craft, as well as a good way to subvert expectations, like finding out that Corky Romano is one of Robert Pattinson's favorite movies, and Beverly Hills Ninja is one of Christian Bale's favorites. It's the same exact reason I also browse the offical Criterion website's Top 10 lists too. But lately it just seems like they only post once a year now. Like it's just surprising to see a bunch be posted on the site around 2022, then only two in 2023 and one this year, and the last video listing Steve Carell's five favorites back in 2022 lol.

***THE CHARACTERS:*** Lilly is surprisingly a likable and fun character, and she's still one of my favorite characters of all time in Lionsgate history. Everyone else? Well, we'll get to that later.

***THE ANIMATION:*** Holy shit. What is up with the fucking animation!? Yes, it's like a PS3 game or something, even a deleted scene on the film's Blu-Ray had better animation. I like the expressions on the characters.

***THE VOICE ACTING:*** Honestly, I prefer the cast of this film, and not the sequel cast of Sonic actors and anime dubbers. I like Justin Long and co.'s voices, sounding far more cute than Ben Diskin and co.'s voices in the sequel media.

***OVERALL:*** Well, this was what ruined Lionsgate even further, the only thing that I hate more than this film are those seven-shitty direct-to-video sequels that Lionsgate made just for money, and I might write a new story/retelling of the sequel that ignores the DTV sequels.

movies,"James Cameron, has to believe ‚Äúthat door‚Äù is the biggest mistake of his career!","
From the second that movie hit theaters the debate about Jack, Rose, and the door took off. 

There are countless videos and even pictures of people ‚Äúproving‚Äù that both Jack and Rose could have fit on the door. I say proving because most of them talk about how it was big enough for them both to get on but don‚Äôt always take weight into consideration. 

Some even say if they had taken turns on the door and both would have survived. 

I just picture James lying in bed every night thinking‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúIf I had known all the shit I was going to get over that damn door‚Ä¶God! Why didn‚Äôt I just have them die together‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm sure people would have forgiven me quicker for that!‚Äù 

He is a great director but he will NEVER escape that door debate. 

(Also I have seen some theorize that it wasn‚Äôt wood carving over a door)

EDIT:

ITS CALLED JOKING AROUND PEOPLE! 

It‚Äôs joking about how we shouldn‚Äôt care as much as we have. To this day so many debate it. 

So the joke is James never thought people would care so much and they do so it‚Äôs joke about him regretting it because people won‚Äôt let it go. 

People on here do know joking isn‚Äôt a sin right? You don‚Äôt have to insult someone for making a stupid joke to have some fun with others on Reddit.

I‚Äôm sure he loves the film is remembered but it‚Äôs funny imagining him being like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I get all this shit about a door! Like out of all things a door! If I had them both die all these never ending debates wouldn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù

He probably thinks why is the possible survival of two fictional characters is so serious to people that they have done so many things to prove it.

Again it‚Äôs called joking around people. Even if a joke isn‚Äôt funny as long as it‚Äôs not offensive you shouldn‚Äôt get so pissed and rude.",HeyWeasel101,1h817tp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h817tp/james_cameron_has_to_believe_that_door_is_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h817tp/james_cameron_has_to_believe_that_door_is_the/,2024-12-06 13:21:47,0,0.13,0,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h817tp

movies,üî• Pushpa 2: The Rule - The Most Anticipated Sequel of the Year! üî•,"The Positives:

1. Allu Arjun's Performance: He‚Äôs the soul of the movie. His portrayal of Pushpa Raj is even more charismatic and intense than in the first film. From his swagger to his emotional depth, Arjun delivers in every scene.


2. Action and Visuals: The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. They‚Äôre larger-than-life but still gritty, which fits the tone perfectly. The cinematography adds a cinematic grandeur that amplifies the experience.


3. Music and Background Score: Devi Sri Prasad nails it again. The songs and the background music elevate every scene, especially during high-octane moments and emotional beats.


4. Narrative Depth: Compared to the first film, the sequel explores Pushpa‚Äôs personal and professional battles more thoroughly. The emotional connection with his family adds a layer of relatability.


5. Villain's Presence: Fahadh Faasil as Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat is a standout. His face-offs with Pushpa are thrilling and add a lot of weight to the story.




---

The Negatives:

1. Lengthy Runtime: The movie feels stretched in parts. Some scenes could have been trimmed to keep the pacing tighter, especially in the second half.


2. Predictable Moments: While the core storyline is engaging, certain plot twists feel predictable, taking away some of the excitement.


3. Over-the-Top Action: While fans of masala entertainers might love it, some viewers may find the action sequences a bit exaggerated.


4. Focus on Subplots: At times, the film delves too deep into side plots, which distracts from the main narrative.


5. Comparisons with the First Film: Some fans felt it lacked the raw energy and novelty that made Pushpa: The Rise so impactful. The bar was set so high that this sequel, despite its strengths, doesn‚Äôt completely surpass it.




---

Final Word:

If you loved the first part, Pushpa 2 offers plenty to enjoy, especially with Allu Arjun‚Äôs electrifying performance and the intense drama. But the pacing and predictability might leave some viewers wishing for a tighter edit. Overall, it‚Äôs a mix of high-octane entertainment and emotional storytelling worth a watch, especially on the big screen.",EngineeringWorldly45,1h7jvgq,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,2024-12-05 21:07:37,0,0.11,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h7jvgq

HEROES AMID PESTILENCE: Todd Alcott is thriving as a scribe who finds heroes amid pestilence. First, he co-wrote the hit pic ‚ÄúAntz,‚Äù which turns those insects into sympathetic sorts. Now, he‚Äôs got a script that delivers a serial killer worth rooting for, and it‚Äôs got director Adrian Lyne seriously considering making it his next film.

Lyne, who last directed ‚ÄúLolita,‚Äù counts that among several helming options, which include ‚ÄúThe Murder Next Door‚Äù at Sony and an untitled project he‚Äôs developed at Fox 2000.

Alcott, who started as a Gotham playwright, also has adapted the zombie comic book ‚ÄúDead World‚Äù for Warner Bros. and producers George Clooney and Robert Lawrence.

**THE PLOT:** The whole plot of Patch feeling left out by all of his siblings and the only thing that cheers him up would be his favorite TV show. I like how Patch is a great and likable character, and Thunderbolt also is a fun and enjoyable character too.

**THE ANIMATION:** I'm surprised that the animation is more in-line with the original 1961 film, keeping the scratchy outline/xerography aspect, and is feeling like the previous film's animation as well. Kinda good that Television Animation was capable of making good animated sequels.

**THE VOICE ACTING:** Even though everyone from the original is **fucking dead**. Everyone here has a brand new cast, I like the voices of Lockwood and everyone else, as many of the new actors do splendid jobs recapturing the magic of everyone.

movies,Cruising (1980): Reoccurring character ,"Hi everybody - long time reader, first time poster here!

I just saw 1980s Cruising yesterday and it really stuck with me: The intense atmosphere of NYC underground in the late 70s, the rawness of the SM gay community, and the constant ambiguity of the plot and characters.

Also, very interesting performance by Al Pacino, who you can really see evolve in his role, as his character does during the movie.

I know that Friedkin assigned different roles to the same actors to add to the ambiguity of the movie, however I noticed one of them in particular in completely different roles: A slightly older guy with thin mustache and impure skin (played by Joe Spinell):

02:30: plays the cop on the passenger seat who‚Äôs wife left him 

27:28: plays a homosexual in the first bar scene with Al Pacino, right after the appearance of killer Stuart Richards

29:32: same role in the first scene with al pacino standing under Bridge in the park

1:33:31: in the scene where they show murdered Ted, he plays the cop again who briefs the chef on the murder

I just thought that was an interesting choice - did anybody else notice this? I guess Friedkin made that decision to add on the ambiguity even more, blurring the lines between the underground community and the NYPD.
