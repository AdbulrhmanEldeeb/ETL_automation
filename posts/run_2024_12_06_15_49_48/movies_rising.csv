movies,Die Hard is NOT a Christmas movie. That's just a meme lots of people take WAY too seriously.,"For those of you who haven't attached that joke to the core of their identity, this won't come as a shock but it's nice to hear, right?  It's been what? Eight years or so that the ""Christmas movie"" thing has been an easy joke for the uncreative to parrot as through they thought it up? It was fun for a bit, got some good Brooklyn 99 moments, but it's really tired now. Maybe give it a rest or try it with another movie. Try Batman returns or the Gremlins, Gremlins 2. Hell, I'm pretty sure first blood counts. It would be awesome if some of THOSE movies could get December screenings at local theaters, and we can make that happen if a large number of people can STOP REGURGITATING AND REDIGESTING THE SAME TIRED JOKE FOREVER... Shit I'm pretty sure lethal weapon counts.
Also, Christmas isn't integral to the plot. You're just straight up lying if you say that and you know it.

movies,The Last Samurai: Beyond the Stereotype,"Where do I begin… well this should do it. I think.

To start things off, I’m basically a *newcomer* when it comes to the posting related thingamajigs and stuff. I’d really like to give it a try and share with *you guys* some thoughts concerning a movie which I just watched a week ago or so. 

First, let’s get something straight, I will be giving my personal point of view ‘bout it, so, to be clear, I’m no expert of such or about *‘nothin* in this topic. Just a guy who would like to see what do people think about something *I feel* is *worth* talking about. 

*Let’s cut to the point*, which is: The Last Samurai - released back in 2003. **This film is-a-masterpiece**, and oh man, there is *no room to doubt*, I can assure you that it is. It comes from a time when them films had to convey a meaning. When they were actually good. If they didn’t have that little something, people simply wouldn’t take the bait. Anyway, enough of this babbling, let’s get to the real deal.

***Honor.*** 

*The whole film* \- is about honor. On paper, honestly, if I hadn’t seen the film, and was presented with this as the backbone of the movie, I would have sold in without doubt. Itself, *it already encompasses various other values it wishes to transmit.* **Furthermore**, when people argue about it being the same old *“white-saviour”* type of Hollywood movie, I just laugh in disbelief because *it’s clearly not.* Unlike those based and outdated narratives, this film actually challenges stereotypes and places the focus on a white man named Nathan Algren, who is clearly, a troubled man. *The Samurai help him,* then he returns the favour *in some ways.*

The whole point of the movie being a story revolving around the white guy, is so that people identify with him, in a sense that he’s also another person who doesn’t know anything about *Samurai ways*. Throughout its entire course, the audience is positioned behind the screens to follow a character which they understand, relate to and seeing him empathize with *Katsumoto* and his people makes it easier for us to follow. It would have been much complicated to use of the foreigners as the main actors in the role - this is not racism, it’s just more logical, that’s all. All the better, join that with *Tom Cruise’s performance* on the film, whether you like him as actor or not, he’s great, and that’s just ‘cause he tends to believe he’s the main character in the world, and in this movie, *he is.* 

&gt;\[…\] *“And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds. Others, that he returned to his own country.""*

&gt;*""But I like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace, that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""*  \[…\]

I hope you liked it guys and if you’d like to ask any questions, feel free to reply down below. Also, down-votes and upvotes are accepted, as long as you spark interest in a discussion, it’s okay, don’t mind me, express your opinion and fuck what other people think!! (To an extent haha don’t go too heavy with the guns if you know what I’m saying).

PS: If you want... I could emm, give you The Complete Motion Score of the movie?

movies,The Real Law Abiding Citizen ,"I just watched ""Law Abiding Citizen"", and it's incredible. But my issue is I don't like the ending. So based on this ending (a good twist but I still don't like it) the REAL ""Law Abiding Citizen"".. is Nick (think about that). Not Clyde. I don't like it. I'm rooting for Clyde.

I hope there will be a sequel, it has the opportunity for it. Even though it was revealed Clyde dug out tunnels and shit, it didn't really show it was actually Clyde. I hope he really had an accomplice, or a copycat that fights for the same thing as him. There's a possibility for a sequel on this character, which the story goes on the way of a cycle, the same thing that happened to Clyde's family, happened to Nick's, but it's the accomplice of Clyde, instead of random murderers.

movies,Why do Tyler Perry movies look so cheap when they mostly aren’t?,"This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. 

I don’t understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. 

My theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn’t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. 

Maybe that’s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap. 

Also I’m not hating on cheap films. There are so many low budget and cheaply made films that I enjoy watching.

Perfect casting (yeah Shia LaBeouf’s character is supposed to be chubby but they didn’t wanna mess with the actor’s health- fair play) and great performances, a smart screenplay that doesn’t talk down to kids OR omit anything major from the story, superb pacing, tone and atmosphere that transports you to the world of the film.

I remember seeing it and thinking- “now this was a fucking movie.” 

It helped that the writer of the book also wrote the screenplay- so he was more than on board.
