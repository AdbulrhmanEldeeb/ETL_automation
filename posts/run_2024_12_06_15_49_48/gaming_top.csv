So my nephew - 12, m - is getting a PS5 from his parents. He's historically gamed on the Switch, and he (and I) LOVES the Legend of Zelda series. We've played BoTW and ToTK together, and regularly share tips, tricks, and advice.

Teardown is a game where you can destroy anything and everything. It’s the perfect vandalism/heist game too. But I do not recommend the DLC’s. Most are hit or miss. But there is a modding community that frequently makes new content for others to play.

As for Children of the Sun. It’s a game where you have one single Sniper Rifle bullet, and you must make the bullet change trajectory to kill multiple enemies. 

Think of it like the Sniper Elite games, but it’s also a puzzle as well. You have to find out the best path and use shortcuts to your advantage.

gaming,Is there any point in getting a PS5 Slim if I own a Desktop already?,"So for more context, Ive just ordered an LG C4 55 inch and im not sure if I should just move my desktop setup closer to it and plug my pc in or buy a PS5 and use that one. PC has 32 gb ram ddr5, 6700 xt, r5 7600 which im not exactly sure if it will be capable of pulling 4K resolution well enough. Another thing to note is that I live in a country that got hit by the Sony region block, so the only way to play their new releases on pc is by sailing the high seas which im not a big fan of if im honest. PC I was planning to use for older titles that arent well supported by PS5 or indies/live service games and movies since it pulls all of that with the tech it has atm, PS5 main use would be just Story games which is mostly what I play.

Feel free to ask any other questions for more info and thanks for checking the post out.",Nurosuki,1h7ikoo,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h7ikoo/is_there_any_point_in_getting_a_ps5_slim_if_i_own/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h7ikoo/is_there_any_point_in_getting_a_ps5_slim_if_i_own/,2024-12-05 20:13:27,0,0.23,0,0,40,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h7ikoo

gaming,"What would ""fair"" microtransactions look like?","We all know how greedy the game industry has become, especially most mobile games. It's insane that +$100 tiers even exist for virtual in-game currencies, but even more so that there are people actually buying them.

This all has made me wonder, can a ""fair"" microtransaction model even exist? If so, what would it look like? Limited purchases? No +$100 tiers? Giving the player something besides just virtual currency, such as DLC type content? Actually being ""micro"" only at 1 or 2 bucks?
