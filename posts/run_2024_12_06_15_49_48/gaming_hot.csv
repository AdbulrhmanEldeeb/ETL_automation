But my initial thoughts are more so about how great of an initial “free to play, GaaS package” this game is starting out as.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs. 

Overall I’m pretty positive on Rivals for now.

So my nephew - 12, m - is getting a PS5 from his parents. He's historically gamed on the Switch, and he (and I) LOVES the Legend of Zelda series. We've played BoTW and ToTK together, and regularly share tips, tricks, and advice.

I want to get his something for his PS5 that he'll enjoy, I'm looking for: open-world, lots of content to explore, appropriate levels of violence and language (he'll be playing it in the same room as his mom/my sister; I don't want it to be over the top), and fun. Something that someone who loves Zelda will be into.

Teardown is a game where you can destroy anything and everything. It’s the perfect vandalism/heist game too. But I do not recommend the DLC’s. Most are hit or miss. But there is a modding community that frequently makes new content for others to play.

As for Children of the Sun. It’s a game where you have one single Sniper Rifle bullet, and you must make the bullet change trajectory to kill multiple enemies. 

Think of it like the Sniper Elite games, but it’s also a puzzle as well. You have to find out the best path and use shortcuts to your advantage.

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't buy weapons or armor. Like its predecessors, you also heal out of combat, KOed characters revive after a fight, and in this game, your healers can be revived KOed characters an unlimited number of times during a fight. As a result, a lot of commonly seen RPG items aren't in this game removing a lot you can spend money on.

There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.

None of this makes these games bad, it just feels weird to carry around so much cash and not have a use for it.",Sensitive-Hotel-9871,1h6g2sj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6g2sj/what_game_has_the_biggest_issue_with_money_being/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6g2sj/what_game_has_the_biggest_issue_with_money_being/,2024-12-04 13:32:56,479,0.86,479,0,605,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6g2sj

gaming,Quick review of (almost) all current mini bluetooth controllers!,"Images here: https://imgur.com/a/SZ3VbEy


I love local multiplayer and the easiest way to find people for it is on the go. Lugging around proper full size controllers* would be a chore, and with micro size I can always have even 4 without thinking.

So for starters: my use case is quick plays, 30-90 minutes. Using these regularly for long time would get uncomfortable (and carpal-tunnely I suppose).

The landscape of small controllers is pretty dire to be honest: 8BitDo (for a long time the only option) and rando chinese suppliers.



**8BitDo Lite 2**

It has every button from a classic PS/Xbox layout - including stick click/L3+R3. High quality plastics. Shoulder and trigger button placement is genius and usable. Joystick has a good movement area. Clicks and presses are exquisite. Size is great for the hand, and still light. This is the one controller I could imagine being usable in daily gaming even.

This would be my dream controller. IF it had XInput. Unrelated, but I'm mighty pissed at 8BitDo for not including this with newer models. Yes, these are all aimed for the Switch, but it would have costed next to nothing to add one more mode. Vibration also only works in Switch mode. Yes you can remap with XOutput and the like, but it's a hassle and strangely does not work in every game.

Modes: Switch, Android
Verdict: so close to be perfect, but not reaching it


**8BitDo Zero 2**

My current go-to mini controller. Has XInput. Sadly charges via micro usb (all other are usb-c). No vibration. Buttons feel right. The L/R button is clickable from all directions despite the length, but not really comfortable - which isn't a problem, this size is only used for simple layout games anyway. I wish it would have toggle for modes, there is no visible sign in which it is (toggle is via shortcut combinations).

There is now also a Micro with the same layout as the Q36 below - not ordered becaus missing XInput and I had enough of that after Lite 2)

Modes: Switch, Android, Windows
Verdict: ol' trusty working horse, shows it's age

**LinYuvo Meteor**

Now this is an interesting animal. You can order it for less than half the zero. It has bajillions of color options - I suggest ordering the covered ones, as the LEDs are so bright that you wouldn't want to use them on transparent versions, despite them looking cool as well. It has a circular dpad which I'm neutral about. For some it's easier to hit corners, but it's not as easy as eg. XBox controller's circular one. But it's really clicky, and a bit hard to press, as you can read in the few reviews it has. So dpad is certainly it's biggest drawback. Has vibration. It has a really interesting feature, you can replace keys - dpad with joystick directions and L/R buttons with trigger - without any software, just shortcuts! You can also toggle the light effects and colors, there are quite a few, as gimmick, or turn it off completely (will be remembered).

Verdict: price/features orders of magnitude better than the Zero 2, even Micro. Buttons just don't feel that good, but it's a close call.

**ShanWan Q37**

There exists a version with horizontal and cross (PS and XBox style) joystick placement. You can tell they used CADs from 8BitDo, the inputs have the same appearance - albeit with a very, very cheap plastic. The rounded off body is a bit smaller but thicker and overall harder to hold. But the presses feel ok. There is vibration - both sides even. It has a weird gyro mode in non-switch mode as well where gyro controls the joystick. Can be accidentally triggered and a useless gimmick. But a very welcomed feature is that every single key can be remapped (including this shortcut). It needs a seemingly unrelated mobile app (""GamepadSpace"") - connecting is hacky as you need to enter firmware upload mode - but once done, you are free to customize, even sensitivity, and everything is saved to the controller. This is great, especially since very stupidly in XInput mode the buttons match the switch layout (eg A is B) by default. Until now you would think this is in the endvery ok controller, but you'd be mistaken. Sadly it all falls apart by how incredibly bad quality this controller is. You will get constant disconnects, lag, ghost presses and stuck input. It's just bad, and generic QC issue. I had multiple controllers showing the same sign.

Verdict: It could be the ""good version"" rip-off of 8BitDo, but sadly it's just a mess, and costs the same as 8BitDo.


Modes: Windows/Android, Switch, Playstation

**ShanWan Q36**

The same as Q37, just with copying the 8BitDo Micro form and layout - which makes it even more sad that it's bad.

Modes: Windows/Android, Switch, Playstation


**Keychain controller**

Being available for 8+ years this is more like an afterthought rather than a serious contender, I included it only for fun. But it's by far the smallest you can go! It only has Android and keyboard function. The ""joystick"" is actually moving only on a 2D plane. Very practical and interesting, but a bit hard to move. Buttons are too mushy. But it is useful as a remote, eg. A is mapped to take a photo in Android.

Modes: IOS/Android, Keyboard",poisonborz,1h6svb8,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6svb8/quick_review_of_almost_all_current_mini_bluetooth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6svb8/quick_review_of_almost_all_current_mini_bluetooth/,2024-12-04 22:15:09,9,0.6,9,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6svb8

gaming,"Open World Games For PS4 That Feel Drenched In Melancholy Despite Not Necessarily Being A ""Sad Story""?","I know this sort of question has been asked many times, but this is my spin on it. As the title says, I'm not looking for a game with a ""sad story"", but rather an open world game where the world, music, overall atmosphere, and the protagonist just feel drenched in a deep sense of melancholy/sadness. I think a good example of what I'm looking for is Red Dead Redemption 1... despite what happens in the end, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a ""sad story"", but rather a story that gives this overwhelming sense that the world is changing, the old ways are dying, and you are powerless to stop it. Just simply stopping to stand somewhere in the middle of the desert plains, and hearing the haunting music in RDR1 gives this feeling, like the whole game just has this constant, overhanging thick layer of melancholy, no matter where you go. In other words, it's as if the world itself is sad.

Any open world game suggestions like this on PS4 would be greatly appreciated!",701921225,1h6yro1,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6yro1/open_world_games_for_ps4_that_feel_drenched_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6yro1/open_world_games_for_ps4_that_feel_drenched_in/,2024-12-05 02:43:27,0,0.48,0,0,58,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6yro1

Classic Doom in Doom Eternal: well in 2016 you can play a lot of the classic levels, they are all in a separate menu so out of universe but in Doom Eternal, you access them in universe in Doomguy’s computer inside his fortress

Crash in Uncharted: in the first few chapters of Uncharted 4 you get to a part where Elena tries to get Nate into a PS1 game she really likes and it happens to be Crash Bandicoot.

Classic Activition Games in Call of Duty Cold War: in Cold War there is a section where you go through a mock city used by the russians to train for a US ground invasion. In this mock city you can find arcades with classic activition games.

gaming,Ghost of Yotei pushback,"So, the latest anti-woke controversy is brewing, and it's giving me a lot of amusement, honestly.

Not gonna delve too far into Ghost of Tsushima because I haven't personally played it, so I'm not able to offer my own opinion on its gameplay or quality, but it was generally highly acclaimed.

Now, following the successful launch of a new IP, the obvious goal for gaming companies is to turn it into a franchise, so a sequel started getting discussed almost before the ink dried on the sales reports. 

Sony just had their - otherwise honestly lackluster - press event to announce upcoming products. 

One of those products was the intended sequel, Ghost of Yotei. As opposed to a direct sequel to the first game, continuing the story specifically of the male protagonist of the first game, Jin Sakai, Sony opted to turn the Ghost series into more of a related anthology apparently; Yotei follows a new character, a female samurai named Atsu.

And there was considerable backlash about that sequel, which Sony apparently didn't expect. 

That backlash has split into three slightly overlapping camps; I'll discuss two before zoning in on one specifically.

The first, and honestly the most reasonable and valid of them, is the gamers who were specifically looking for a continuation of Jin's story. Disappointment there is totally understandable; regardless of how complete a story is, if you are invested in the character, you want there to be more. More time with them, more insight into them, more story about them, more interaction with them, more. 

Since Yotei is still in development, we don't know how much of that there is. It's entirely possible that Sony is taking a page from Mad Max here and using the first game as an origin story for someone who then appears as a recurring character in other people's stories; we *do not know.*

But that viewpoint, that **""we wanted more Jin and this isn't that, wtf""** is the sane people objection to the announcement.

Second is objection to the voice actress. This is less reasonable but comprehensible, because Erika Ishii is a known and outspoken activist. This doesn't affect their voicework in the game one tiny bit - and the people who have discussed it so far have said it is absolutely top notch - but if you disagree with someone's personal stances, disapproving of their choice for your media is understandable.

For me, Erika is a fantastic choice; if you're not familiar, they are on Dimension 20 and a lot of other Dropout network stuff, and is a fairly prominent activist for LQBTQIA+ rights, but they're also immensely talented, creative, and funny. Especially on Dimension 20 you can see this; their characters are usually only second to Emily Axford's routinely game breaking creativity in terms of their impact, and despite their often super extra appearance on the show, they are very very good at submerging herself into the character, which is honestly literally the entire goal of voice acting for video games.

So, the people who are objecting to the game based on Erika have, you know, no taste and are also bigots, but at least it's a comprehensible sort of consistent bigotry.

The third group of objectors, however, is the one I think is funniest.

Now, I'm gonna reveal something totally unimportant that actually I promise will be sort of relevant: in video games, I almost always play a female character. *(In fact, one of my very few actual gaming regrets involves this; right after launch, I decided to play Genshin Impact with two accounts, one for each Traveler, and the account playing as Aether, the male Traveler, got so much luckier in the gacha that I ultimately ended up with that as my main account, and I'd frankly much rather be playing as Lumine.)*

My reasoning is, maybe silly, but very simple: I think girls are pretty. If I'm gonna be playing a game for hours on end and staring at a single character the whole time, I'd rather be looking at a girl. Not because I identify as a girl, but because I think looking at girls is a lot more fun than looking at other guys.

So, the third group of people who are objecting to Ghost of Yotei is entirely made up of guys, who are objecting on the exclusive grounds that they don't want to play a female character.

Unlike the other two reasons for objecting to the game, which while not necessarily reasonable are at least based on something that's a real thing, these guys are objecting based on the fact that a virtual avatar - an inherently unreal, sexless thing made of pixels - is shaped with slightly more curves. 

In other words, they're so utterly dedicated to staring at male bodies that the idea of looking at a female body makes them utterly revolted.

Now, as a guy who likes looking at girls, I gotta say, even as heterosexual as I am, I can't imagine being *offended* that I had to look at a guy; the most I can muster would be *disinterest.*

And that's what makes this so funny for me.

Can you even imagine *how* gay you have to be, to be willing to start a huge flame war online over the idea that you might have to *not* stare at a male for hours and hours on end for the entire duration of your gameplay?

That's way gayer than I am straight, man.

They keep saying it's ""woke"" or ""DEI"" as cover.

But y'all.

They're really saying that they *hunger* for those tasty man butts.

That's fucking funny.

gaming,I've become a demotivated gamer,"I often get into a new game that I've looked forward to, either at launch or because of discounts on Steam, but then I play for maybe 2-3 hours, a would-be normal session which I would naturally resume the next day or later in the week except... I don't.

I feel like in 2024 I've started so many games that I intended to play through but as soon as I get the first break from them the thought of booting them up again a day later, or the week after declines completely. FTR I don't actually ""game"". I never played League or CS or anything, and even my WoW days clocked in at lvl 50 during the Lich King stuff.

But I always had an affinity for single-player games that are anywhere between 12 hours or 100 hours long. I would get hooked on them, love them and obviously play them until the credits roll, especially RPGs. But now it's weird. I love it, I really have nothing negative to say but I just can't get myself to play it again. For example, I made it to Chapter 3 in Half Life Alyx, finally playing a VR game -- loving it.

Games where enemies get Thanos snapped like in Elden Ring or turn into a puddle of blood and few random ribs Dragon Age: Origins style or turn into a lootable pouch like in Witcher 3 kind of lack that magical feeling of realism.

I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004).  Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.

The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I'll play that now for online multiplayer.  I'm curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?

Also, I think it's cool that the original Unreal Tournament (a game from 1999, which I originally played on Windows 98) still runs without a problem on modern PCs (I have it on my current PC, which has Windows 11 and an Intel i9-9900k and an Nvidia 3080 TI).  I have the Game Of The Year edition from Steam though, so I think it was pre-packaged to work on modern PCs.

gaming,I actually found a good mobile game and I want to talk about it. ,"The name of the game is Arcane Rush Battlegrounds. 

It’s a battleroyale card game that’s perfect for folks looking for a TFT like experience but something more casual. 

The game starts with 2 groups of 8, the top 4 players of each group then duke it out to find the top player. The original group stage is based on points and the second stage everyone gets 3 life and last one standing wins. 

The cool thing with this is that you’re playing against offline players. So there is no time pressure if something comes up which is great. I found that in the beginning it was very easy to score first place as I am getting to higher ranks I do take some losses against the AI. You earn gold for each elimination you achieve while offline. 

There is also an arena that takes your top builds from the battleroyale to test them against other players and I have found this to be very challenging. 

The game has dealers that have their own cards, and a hero collection they can draft from every game. On top of their being a number of unique races to play while in game each with their own strategy. My personal favourite race are demons and the discard strategy they play with. 

The only time the game pushes ads is to gain extra gold rewards or arena battle chances. Otherwise there are no ads. 

The negative, each of the races are kind of insular, there isn’t many combos to be found. If you start building a race your only real option is to fully build that race since they are all designed to work with themselves. Also the cost of upgrading your dealers is high,300 gold a shot where dailies may not give you enough to enough gold for an upgrade. There are currently 2 dealers with a third on the way and I hope they make some changes to upgrade costs or the amount of gold you can get. 

Well that’s the long and short of it. I hope you all check it out because I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the game. 

Thank you.
