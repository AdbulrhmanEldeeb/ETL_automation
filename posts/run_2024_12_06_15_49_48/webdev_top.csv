webdev,"When I started as a developer, I thought I had to be good at everything","When I first started out, I felt this pressure that I had to be good at everything: coding, designing, choosing fonts, colors, layouts. It quickly became overwhelming.

I thought being a ""developer"" meant mastering not just code but also design, UX, and sometimes even marketing. But over time, I've realized that it's okay to not excel at everything, whether it's right away or ever.

Did you also feel this way when you started? How many hats were you able to wear?",yeahimjtt,1h7dwbn,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7dwbn/when_i_started_as_a_developer_i_thought_i_had_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7dwbn/when_i_started_as_a_developer_i_thought_i_had_to/,2024-12-05 17:00:44,200,0.96,200,0,70,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7dwbn
webdev,"Recently, I have been trying out LLMs for coding and they are surprisingly bad for anything even a tiny bit complex?","Since LLMs (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.) became popular, I have used them for basic things, but only sporadically for coding. Recently, I was entrusted a Vue 3 codebase, and since I didn't know Vue, I thought to myself: Why not get some help from AI? So, I started trying out different models and to my surprise, it's incredible how even basic things such as flexbox in component styling is just too much for them. Anything that has to do with styling, really, that goes beyond ""Set this component's border color to light gray"". If you use Vuetify and custom style classes, then the machine just doesn't WTH is going on anymore. Also, I tried it to make it tell me the difference between React's portals and Vue 3's teleport functionality, and it was disappointing to say the least. The fun became real, though, when I asked it how to teleport a Vue 3 component into a Cytoscape JS node; After 30 minutes or so of back and forth prompting, I gave up, and this is in general how my sessions end: With time wasted, frustration and back at the start of the task.

Other behaviours I have noticed are:

* In the same chat, repeating the same answer to different prompts (this is typical of Mistral), even though you try to nudge it in the right direction by telling it the answer wasn't satisfactory.
* Making up random stuff, e.g., CSS directives or a function's options and then saying ""My bad, you're right. Function x doesn't have the option y"".
* Mixing up versions (e.g., Vue 2 patterns in Vue 3)

... and more.

Honestly, the majority of the time it's useless. Also, for beginners, this is probably the worst one can do to learn programming, people should stay the hell away from it under they have some experience under the belt. Ultimately, I agree that it's just a fancy information retrieval algo and nothing more, and for basic, simple info, it's infinitely superior to e.g. Google.",skwyckl,1h7wmcg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7wmcg/recently_i_have_been_trying_out_llms_for_coding/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7wmcg/recently_i_have_been_trying_out_llms_for_coding/,2024-12-06 08:11:38,135,0.85,135,0,152,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7wmcg
webdev,"What is the ""Meta"" in Web Development right now?","So basically, I'm unemployed. I quit my job due to an extremely toxic environment. I was a QA Engineer but Web Dev was always my passion and strength. During my bachelors degree I would constantly get top of the class in the Web Development courses only and they were the classes I enjoyed most.

Now I'm thinking of Cold Emailing small businesses and offering to create a website for them during my unemployment period so that I have some money to live off of, but I've been out of the web dev loop for a few years that I don't know what the optimal web-dev tools are anymore, especially with the rise of AI.

I'm best suited in PHP, HTML, CSS and JS. What other languages should I sharpen to improve the quality of my websites? Or is No-Code the way to go nowadays?

And for those who started a similar venture, would you recommend hiring sub-contractors or doing the work yourself?

Hoping you can help - Reddit is usually a good place for sourcing information like this! I did notice there was an AppDev space but it had fewer members!

I am on the board of a small football (soccer) club, we have a club app that is outsourced to a third party who create similar apps for other clubs of our size. The creator of the app basically uses the brand names of these football clubs to gain advertising revenue, the clubs then take a commission - the deal to me is terrible it's between 3-5% of Ad Revenue depending on targets. We plan on cancelling the deal ASAP don't worry about that. 

In terms of volume, the app itself has circa 10k downloads, and around 500 active users monthly. All it features is club news, club videos and ads, its very basic. It features no user log in or anything of that nature. 

Generally speaking how much would an initial setup of an app of this basic nature cost and would there be any cost to maintaining it? Are we talking a few thousand or ?. 

I was actually surprised at the amount of money generated by the ads on said app - these tend to be local sponsors who think they are benefitting the club when realistically we see very little of it. We are talking mid five figures anually.

webdev,"[Asking for Assistance] Typescript, browsers and node.js are being annoying","Hi. So; I'm somewhat new to webdev, and I'm making a small website. Now, the problem: I am using bootstrap because it pretty and I have no eye for style, so, eventually, I am in need of using its' javascript stuffs to fill in some text on a modal before it is displayed. I have a work-around, but I'd very much like to solve the issue in case I actually need to use this in the future. I have uploaded some files to a pastebin for reference: [https://pastebin.com/QFQj8Zhx](https://pastebin.com/QFQj8Zhx)  
tsc's chief complaint right now is:

    node_modules/@types/bootstrap/js/dist/dropdown.d.ts:1:25 - error TS2792: Cannot find module '@popperjs/core'. Did you mean to set the 'moduleResolution' option to 'nodenext', or to add aliases to the 'paths' option?
    
    1 import * as Popper from ""@popperjs/core"";

Doing as recommended causes browsers (yes, I checked Firefox and Chrome) to complain:  
`Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier ""bootstrap"". Relative references must start with either ""/"", ""./"", or ""../"".`

Changing the import to be a relative path makes tsc complain that it can't find a declaration for the file.

So, basically, I am stuck. A good hour of googling and questiong copilot and phind have brought no working results. I'd appreciate any constructive help (no, ""Just don't use typescript"" is not constructive).

webdev,How to get clients to send images and text?,I built websites for 2 businesses and they were very happy with their websites.

webdev,Force page reload when using browser back button React.,"Hey everyone, 

Not sure if the title correctly fits the problem but…

I am currently creating a Netflix clone using React and the TMDB api. You can view it here.

https://filmflix.strong-concepts.com

I’m having this problem when I’m viewing the page for a tv show or movie. If I go to the “you may like section” and click on the link to another show’s page, everything works fine. The problem happens when i click the browser back navigation button and the image, video, and text files wont update. 

So, I’m on the From description page and  I navigate to the Teacup page and press the back button. The link will say that your on the From page, but it will still be displaying the Teacup page information.

Does anyone know how I can fix this issue?",TheSensibleProdigal,1h7e8h7,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7e8h7/force_page_reload_when_using_browser_back_button/,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7e8h7,2024-12-05 17:14:23,0,0.2,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/y0jEuOaVBHdRygxymSwHBG8UfKU-HCfVBxRQ5rgc_bM.jpg,t3_1h7e8h7
