webdev,"Recently, I have been trying out LLMs for coding and they are surprisingly bad for anything even a tiny bit complex?","Since LLMs (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.) became popular, I have used them for basic things, but only sporadically for coding. Recently, I was entrusted a Vue 3 codebase, and since I didn't know Vue, I thought to myself: Why not get some help from AI? So, I started trying out different models and to my surprise, it's incredible how even basic things such as flexbox in component styling is just too much for them. Anything that has to do with styling, really, that goes beyond ""Set this component's border color to light gray"". If you use Vuetify and custom style classes, then the machine just doesn't WTH is going on anymore. Also, I tried it to make it tell me the difference between React's portals and Vue 3's teleport functionality, and it was disappointing to say the least. The fun became real, though, when I asked it how to teleport a Vue 3 component into a Cytoscape JS node; After 30 minutes or so of back and forth prompting, I gave up, and this is in general how my sessions end: With time wasted, frustration and back at the start of the task.

Other behaviours I have noticed are:

* In the same chat, repeating the same answer to different prompts (this is typical of Mistral), even though you try to nudge it in the right direction by telling it the answer wasn't satisfactory.
* Making up random stuff, e.g., CSS directives or a function's options and then saying ""My bad, you're right. Function x doesn't have the option y"".
* Mixing up versions (e.g., Vue 2 patterns in Vue 3)

... and more.

Honestly, the majority of the time it's useless. Also, for beginners, this is probably the worst one can do to learn programming, people should stay the hell away from it under they have some experience under the belt. Ultimately, I agree that it's just a fancy information retrieval algo and nothing more, and for basic, simple info, it's infinitely superior to e.g. Google.",skwyckl,1h7wmcg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7wmcg/recently_i_have_been_trying_out_llms_for_coding/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7wmcg/recently_i_have_been_trying_out_llms_for_coding/,2024-12-06 08:11:38,136,0.85,136,0,152,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7wmcg

webdev,"What is the ""Meta"" in Web Development right now?","So basically, I'm unemployed. I quit my job due to an extremely toxic environment. I was a QA Engineer but Web Dev was always my passion and strength. During my bachelors degree I would constantly get top of the class in the Web Development courses only and they were the classes I enjoyed most.

Now I'm thinking of Cold Emailing small businesses and offering to create a website for them during my unemployment period so that I have some money to live off of, but I've been out of the web dev loop for a few years that I don't know what the optimal web-dev tools are anymore, especially with the rise of AI.

I'm best suited in PHP, HTML, CSS and JS. What other languages should I sharpen to improve the quality of my websites? Or is No-Code the way to go nowadays?

And for those who started a similar venture, would you recommend hiring sub-contractors or doing the work yourself?

I really appreciate the advice. I've been thinking about launching a business for months now and I can't imagine it being in a different field.

webdev,Exploring a faster alternative to dom-accessibility-api: Your thoughts?,"Hi everyone !  


After encountering performance issues with `jsdom` while trying to integrate the [dom-accessibility-api](https://github.com/eps1lon/dom-accessibility-api) library, I started working on a similar library that is potentially faster.

[https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils](https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils)

Having tested the library on some previously heavy tests that could even lead to timeouts, I noticed a performance improvement of about 50% when using my library when retrieving element accessible names. When combined with `happy-dom`, the improvement is even greater.  


Would it be possible for some of you who have experienced similar performance issues to let me know if this library provides any improvements in that regard? Also, feel free to share any feedback on potential issues—it’s still a library in development :)
