movies,Why do Tyler Perry movies look so cheap when they mostly aren’t?,"This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. 

I don’t understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. 

My theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn’t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. 

Maybe that’s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap. 

Also I’m not hating on cheap films. There are so many low budget and cheaply made films that I enjoy watching. A film being cheap doesn’t always make the film bad.",HeyWeasel101,1h7i325,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7i325/why_do_tyler_perry_movies_look_so_cheap_when_they/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7i325/why_do_tyler_perry_movies_look_so_cheap_when_they/,2024-12-05 19:53:12,976,0.89,976,0,342,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h7i325

Perfect casting (yeah Shia LaBeouf’s character is supposed to be chubby but they didn’t wanna mess with the actor’s health- fair play) and great performances, a smart screenplay that doesn’t talk down to kids OR omit anything major from the story, superb pacing, tone and atmosphere that transports you to the world of the film.

I remember seeing it and thinking- “now this was a fucking movie.” 

It helped that the writer of the book also wrote the screenplay- so he was more than on board.

movies,I freaking LOVE The Family Stone and do every Christmas. ,"I don’t really understand why, but this movie hits me directly in my happy place. It doesn’t have the greatest reviews, which is a mystery to me, because even if it’s not perfect, it’s got incredible casting, solid plot points, pathos, belly laughs, and mothertucking Luke Wilson. 

First of all, Sarah Jessica Parker plays the neurotic outsider to a T. Birdy, defensive, repressed, insecure, but good deep down, even the cringe fest dinner scene lands because of master performances by her, Craig T, and Diane. There is no way to resist Rachel McAdam’s charms, and she’s in full effect here. Even the tragic subplot works, and the epilogue has me sobbing every year. Just the right balance of zany, touching, and unpredictable (sorry but that’s mostly true). I love it I love it I love it so much.

movies,Cruising (1980): Reoccurring character ,"Hi everybody - long time reader, first time poster here!

I just saw 1980s Cruising yesterday and it really stuck with me: The intense atmosphere of NYC underground in the late 70s, the rawness of the SM gay community, and the constant ambiguity of the plot and characters.

Also, very interesting performance by Al Pacino, who you can really see evolve in his role, as his character does during the movie.

I know that Friedkin assigned different roles to the same actors to add to the ambiguity of the movie, however I noticed one of them in particular in completely different roles: A slightly older guy with thin mustache and impure skin (played by Joe Spinell):

02:30: plays the cop on the passenger seat who’s wife left him 

27:28: plays a homosexual in the first bar scene with Al Pacino, right after the appearance of killer Stuart Richards

29:32: same role in the first scene with al pacino standing under Bridge in the park

1:33:31: in the scene where they show murdered Ted, he plays the cop again who briefs the chef on the murder

I just thought that was an interesting choice - did anybody else notice this? I guess Friedkin made that decision to add on the ambiguity even more, blurring the lines between the underground community and the NYPD. Or is there more to it?",Lypscher,1h81w8x,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h81w8x/cruising_1980_reoccurring_character/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h81w8x/cruising_1980_reoccurring_character/,2024-12-06 13:56:41,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h81w8x

movies,"What happened to Rotten Tomatoes' ""Five Favorite Films""?","I'm not usually a fan of the site itself, but one of the major outliers that left enough enthusiasm in me to continue visiting it was its ""Five Favorite Films"" editorials, where there would either be videos or articles of various actors/actresses/filmmakers discussing their top 5 favorite movies, one of my personal favorites of all being Nicolas Cage's top 13 favorites list. 

To me, knowing about an actor or filmmaker's favorite movies is a great way to understand their vision and inspirations behind their craft, as well as a good way to subvert expectations, like finding out that Corky Romano is one of Robert Pattinson's favorite movies, and Beverly Hills Ninja is one of Christian Bale's favorites. It's the same exact reason I also browse the offical Criterion website's Top 10 lists too. But lately it just seems like they only post once a year now. Like it's just surprising to see a bunch be posted on the site around 2022, then only two in 2023 and one this year, and the last video listing Steve Carell's five favorites back in 2022 lol. What happened and why'd they stop? Hell, does anyone even remember them for that matter?

movies,"What particularly violent scene from an already violent movie really messed you up, or stuck with you over the years?","Every now and then people talk about gnarly scenes that kind of come out of nowhere (like that one near the end of Bone Tomahawk) but what about scenes from movies that are already violent, but stand out anyway? For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.


I mean, I've seen lots of violent movies (including all the Saw films) but somehow there's scenes like this that really hit hard and I'm not sure why.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovenia,"Hello there!

Since more than 40 days, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. Yesterday, we took a look at Slovakia, and even though I haven't seen the winning movie yet - as is so often the case here - I'm pretty sure it will be a worthy entry on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Obchod na Korze*** (engl.: *The Shop on Main Street*) has not only made it here, but also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.

Will we have such a high-ranking visitor in the next round, too? Well, we'll see. Our next country is no longer Slovakia, but **Slovenia**, and as everytime before, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Gangs of New York revisted,"I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn’t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn’t remember anything about it.

Holy hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.

Leonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.

Daniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.

We’ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.

One of his killings (and you’ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I’ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).

The production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.

If you have never seen this film, or, like me - haven’t seen it in years. Check it out.

movies,Can someone please give the vocabulary to express something that I've been observing in movies?,"Hello! I'm gonna try to make this quick and express myself as clearly as possible. How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?

For example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley. It's like they're rendered too colorful and too dull at the same time, making them lack life or something.

What is that? Does anyone else get that feel? What are the words to describe this distinction? Because every time I talk about it I don't get the sense that people actually see what I mean, since I'm not solely talking about the cinematography, I don't think, it's more of a *feeling* of emptiness and fakeness.

To start things off, I’m basically a *newcomer* when it comes to the posting related thingamajigs and stuff. I’d really like to give it a try and share with *you guys* some thoughts concerning a movie which I just watched a week ago or so. 

First, let’s get something straight, I will be giving my personal point of view ‘bout it, so, to be clear, I’m no expert of such or about *‘nothin* in this topic. Just a guy who would like to see what do people think about something *I feel* is *worth* talking about. 

*Let’s cut to the point*, which is: The Last Samurai - released back in 2003. **This film is-a-masterpiece**, and oh man, there is *no room to doubt*, I can assure you that it is. It comes from a time when them films had to convey a meaning. When they were actually good. If they didn’t have that little something, people simply wouldn’t take the bait. Anyway, enough of this babbling, let’s get to the real deal.

***Honor.***

Itself, *it already encompasses various other values it wishes to transmit.* **Furthermore**, when people argue about it being the same old *“white-saviour”* type of Hollywood movie, I just laugh in disbelief because *it’s clearly not.* Unlike those based and outdated narratives, this film actually challenges stereotypes and places the focus on a white man named Nathan Algren, who is clearly, a troubled man. *The Samurai help him,* then he returns the favour *in some ways.*

The whole point of the movie being a story revolving around the white guy, is so that people identify with him, in a sense that he’s also another person who doesn’t know anything about *Samurai ways*. Throughout its entire course, the audience is positioned behind the screens to follow a character which they understand, relate to and seeing him empathize with *Katsumoto* and his people makes it easier for us to follow. It would have been much complicated to use of the foreigners as the main actors in the role - this is not racism, it’s just more logical, that’s all. All the better, join that with *Tom Cruise’s performance* on the film, whether you like him as actor or not, he’s great, and that’s just ‘cause he tends to believe he’s the main character in the world, and in this movie, *he is.* 

&gt;\[…\] *“And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds. Others, that he returned to his own country.""*

&gt;*""But I like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace, that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""*  \[…\]

movies,Subservience (2024) - Thriller/Sci-fi,"SPOOOOILER   
this is for those who HAVE WATCHED THE FILM AND WANT TO DISCUSS. this is my own take (why I liked it, what would have made it better, etc.)

this isn't ur average: ""robots take over the world and they're bad because..."" story. I mean, yes- from the beginning its giving- proceed with caution but this twist on what could be is fantastic. I was SO excited for this film before even watching it. I will begin with, I love futuristic, end of the world or new world films (and novels.) and I gotta say I love the idea of AI overpowering human kind because as a society we are ABSOLUTELY heading in that direction and surprisingly no one seems to realize this writing is an inference of what will happen if we continue. my overall score is 7/10 read below for my analysis and reasoning. 



my initial opinion of the main character (Nick) is he is smart, handy, nurturing, patient, and so goddamn sexy. hes a pretty complex character imo, he was constantly battling with what is right/ wrong from the beginning.  he works a blue collar job (that can and eventually are replaced by SIMS) and tries his hardest to fight against his friends losing their jobs. but he actively uses extremely advanced technology like his refrigerator, populating bars utilizing SIMS to serve, and ofc hiring his own SIM. he expresses a high sex drive (source: when Maggie (his wife) is literally in the hospital bed waiting for her heart surgery, hes making jokes abt getting her back to the marathons they used to have- but she doesn't seem to mind, shes pressing into him too so we can only assume she has an equally high sex drive too) but remains faithful even when he feels an unintentional attraction to Alice. 

when Nick asked Alice to wipe her memory in order to ""experience"" Casablanca, that's exactly what she did. she consumes the film as if shes a part of it. erasing her program to reprogram the story as her own. she tells Nick that resetting her in order to ""forget"" the memory she has of Casablanca will be antithetical, but he still does it. the quote from the movie we see is ""you are a man. if someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?"" then the call is interrupted by a call from Maggie. 

  
the entire film counters being dependent on AI, but very much distinguishing their inability to experience life through emotions. in the beginning scenes, the sales person explains the longer the AI unit is with the family/ the more knowledge it obtains the better it will perform. but no one seems to think they can replicate emotions or make decisions outside of their based programming?   
as soon as she wipes her memory.. she learns only: Nick, Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland. throughout the film we see her putting together the metaphoric similarities of their real life to the characters of Alice in Wonderland when speaking with Isla as well. she even notes wiping her own civility because ""it's better."" aka more human. aka creating a more genuine link to human emotion. (this doesn't make sense to me, because in this film- the companies programming these SIMS are extremely hands on- later in the film the company even immediately takes action in bringing in two employees well after working hours to reset/ reprogram Alice. every story of robots taking over the world seems to always conclude that robots will outsmart the companies who make them. so in a world where we're so far advanced; AI is in your home and consuming more and more information all the time, is it really so crazy to assume the companies who created them would want to check in on their projects' progress? the amount of times we hear how much money they cost, you think they would have scheduled tune ups frequently. with scheduled check ups, the companies would have found out a lot of her program was wiped and I think this fact kind of kept me in movie mode- not so much lose myself in the film mode.)

   
to me, it's obvious the matter of ""messing around"" with Alice wouldn't have ever crossed Nick's mind if she didn't look the way she did. there would have never been a moment where he was willing to risk anything if Alice was ""an old English butler,"" which was originally what Nick and Maggie had originally discussed when purchasing a nanny SIM.   
he gives the explanation that ""Isla chose her,"" and I think this is a really great moment to note: he really was teetering back and forth whether he found it wrong or not. he clearly liked to look but even if the idea crossed his mind- he never tempted himself with any action. it wasn't until Maggie told Alice that if she died, Alice needed her to comfort Nick and make sure he's taken care of. the first time they messed around (in the garage later that night) Alice initiated it. she convinced him she wasn't real (because her heartbeat is just a simulation programmed to provide comfort to humans) and encouraged him to proceed if only for his own health and he does.   
the second time is after the shower when she again, tempts him with lingerie and a blindfold. she disguises herself as Maggie which was such a nice touch because it really enforces the idea that there is nothing human about her and essentially can be or do whatever he needs. and \*\*ok honestly\*\* lets face it the bathroom scene was... nice   ͡° ͜  ͡  
  
BUT I really hate that that's the extent of their relationship. the next morning, Nick ""ends it"" with her, the wife gets her surgery and comes home and then it turns into this weird vibe between the women. all of a sudden, we see a jealous/ competitive side from Maggie (ie: dirty looks when Alice cared for the baby, cattiness towards Alice when she asked for the family recipe, etc.) I dont understand because at this point Maggie has no idea that Alice and Nick have had sex- Alice has only shown she is an obedient and hard-working and loving nanny so idk how the vibes are so far off when there wasnt a single hospital visit that was weird?

here's where the story line goes all over the place. there was SO much build up between Nick and Alice and then for like 6 scenes in a row you don't even see the two of them in conversation. we have the playground scene (where we learn Alice has changed her software to have more of a human approach to casual encounters,) the shower scene between Nick and Maggie (where Alice interrupts with Isla's nightmare,) then we see Monty attack Nick, Alice k\*lling Monty (\*but we also learn that Monty: hater of all SIMS, OWNS A SIM. he's coked out and contemplating suicide but we also learn hes been using and ab\*sing his SIM,) then the bathtub scene between the women (again- would have been a nice time to see Alice be useful to Maggie??? this woman has just had open heart surgery, her medicine has proved two separate times to cause dizziness, and she isn't thankful to have the extra hands on deck. again- up until THIS POINT SPECIFICALLY, she doesnt know Nick and Alice have hooked up. obviously in this scene, she puts it together, but in my perfect world, she would have accepted the help from Alice and welcomed the extra energy she has to take care of her husband- which before she was about to die was her only concern? idk weird continuity there, but again this is the scene she puts together that they've indeed had sex. but then immediately the scene goes from Maggie and Nick talking about his affair to Alice trying to drown the baby. 

??? huh !!! ???   
I have watched this movie now three times all the way through and this just does not add up. her software changes up until this point could always be justified with \~what she was learning real time.\~ she says its bc Max is a ""burden,"" which in the beginning Nick (when Max was crying,) shushes him and says ""quite the little burden,"" but the words are never brought up again and that was BEFORE the hard wipe before Casablanca. so..... yeah I really really dont understand this part.   
not to mention miss ""I just had open heart surgery"" takes on scaling the house and fighting a robot? 

  
I definitely wouldnt have made her turn on the kids- if there was no hope in seeing a harmonious relationship between the women, I would have much rather seen Alice drowning Maggie in the bathtub and played it off as ""people accidentally drown all the time,"" or using her medication symptoms to her own advantage and coerced Maggie into hurting herself or the kids (making Nick question her character, aka not be in love with her.) 

ok so then yada yada, we're at the hospital with the baby to check on his vitals (even though he was never even submerged in the water? kinda dramatic to take him by ambulance to the ER but whatever. flashes to the bar scene where Alice speaks in a revised quote from Casablanca and informs Nick, she k\*lled Monty for him, and will take care of his family (alluding to the fact that she had connections in the hospital at the same moment.) then Nick attempts to trick her (c'mon now.. shes clearly proved she cant die?) and k\*ll her and he races to the hospital. ofc we get this unrealistic fast and furious driving through the snowy streets only to have his car crash into an ambulance pinning Alice in between them. SHOCKER: she still doesnt die. we have to sit through terrible fight sequences and multiple fake deaths before everyone walking away barely scathed. Nick is in a hospital bed with light bruising and Maggie is healing in a wheelchair with both children and she invites him to come home \*rolls eyessssss. the film then ends with a 30 second clip of Alice's software uploading on every SIM and her opening her eyes after reconstruction of her face implying a sequel.... I’m gonna go ahead and say we dont need it. 

tldr;   
my rating would be higher than 7/10 if the company was more hands on, there was more of a relationship (whether that would have been friendship or romantic) built between Nick and Alice, a more manipulative side of Alice towards Maggie, more mentions of Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland (so we could have definitively seen the allusion to the stories playing IRL for Alice,) and heres a big kicker: I really wish that Nick would have died in the car crash. this may be so so over the top controversial, but I think it would have been very \~poetic justice\~ if he died trying to save Maggie when it was his actions that potentially destroyed them in the first place  

  
anyway :) definitely watch the movie!! big fan!!

In the film, &gt;!a young Matt Damon brings a case of unlawful denial of care against a huge healthcare insurer, on behalf of the family of a young man with leukemia.!&lt;

*Hell or High Water* is directed by David Mackenzie, based on a script by the only screenwriter whose name I've memorized, Taylor Sheridan.

movies,1993 was peak Spielberg. Has there been another year like it for anyone else?,"Hi all,

Just a random daydream earlier about how amazing 1993 was with both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List being directly by the same guy. Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).

A cheap thriller that had me genuinely surprised at the quality. An intriguing concept about a woman who chooses to partake in a game where enduring pain progresses you towards the monetary prize.


What really surprised me was the quality of the cinematography, direction, acting, sound, and a solid enough script for a cheap film. Thought it unusual to find almost 0 discussion or articles about it online, considering the other schlock out there with better visability. 

Just wanted to see what other people thought of it, or if anyone had suggestions for similarily low budget but well made films?

movies,Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before,"Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, ""But where's his brother?"", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.

- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.

- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. ""Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic."" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of ""There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!"" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.

- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (""I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box""). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the ""real"" prestige.

movies,Rewatched The Devil Wears Prada,"I rewatched The Devil Wears Prada. I have not seen it for many years, so I was glad to revisit it especially after all the discussions revolving the movie. Here is what I get from the movie:

# Miranda is awful, but Andy is too naive to empathize for

Miranda's treatment of Andy is awful. I would feel bad for Andy if she was not so stupid. She is an aspiring journalist who is way too unperceptive to be an effective one.

From the beginning, she is being told by everyone her position is one people would die for. Despite this, she still sees it as a joke despite being told over and over again how serious this role is. The only reason she wanted the job is because her other choice was Auto Universe magazine. [Andy snickers at the choice of belts to choose.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-KQij0I8I) Miranda dresses her down in front of everyone. I would feel bad for her if she did not already been made aware how big of a deal this is. Like girl, you've been told so many times.

Next, Miranda asks her to do the impossible task of finding her a flight. When she fails, she is admonished by Miranda.

&gt;I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid. But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl. I had hope. I always have hope. But you’re as disappointing as anyone else.

Narratively, this scene is not earned. The task should be something difficult but not impossible, and probably something that someone who is interested in fashion could manage. Her saying that to Andy is more petty than cruel given the circumstances.

So what does Andy learns from this? [That Miranda hates her.](https://imgur.com/5Q2PaYS) [Nigel gives her a reality check.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJf-J5RXxw8) Nigel once again tells her how important Runway is, something she should have caught on right now. Then, Andy comes up with the first smart idea: start dressing like she works at Runway. Nigel even helps her, probably thinking ""this dumb bitch finally caught on"".

Later, Nigel is telling Andy about Miranda's scale:

&gt;In her way. There’s a scale. One nod, good. More than one nod -- very good. There is only one actual smile on record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she doesn’t like it, she shakes her head. And then there’s the pursing of the lips. Catastrophe.

So what are Andy's first words after this?

&gt;So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?

LIKE HOW ARE YOU STILL NOT GETTING THIS??????

Smart Andy is then gets bamboozled by twins in messing up the book delivery. For punishment, Miranda is giving her impossible task #2: get the unreleased Harry Potter book in 4 hours. She gets it done, which is insane. She is finally happy to get something right (that something right is literally doing the impossible, but to her it's like ""hahaha I finally did not majorly fuck up"")

The movie seems to want to make us believe that Andy is similar to Miranda. Miranda tells Andy:

&gt;I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.

How does Miranda see ANYTHING in her in Andy??? Andy is so naive and dumb. Then Miranda says that what Andy did to Emily was cold. How???

Miranda was basically threatening to fire Andy if she did not go to Paris. Hell,[ Andy even went to visit Emily in the hospital after her accident.](https://imgur.com/Qm3RMWj) Andy should know how Emily would feel about the Paris trip, but she is like ""omg you know how she is"". Either she is like Miranda visiting Emily at the Hospital for some sick pleasure (doubtful), or she is just naive about how the world works.

Anyways, Andy is pretty dumb.

# Nate is not really a bad boyfriend.

A big piece of the conversation revolving this movie is how bad of a boyfriend Nate is. Some even say he is the real villain. This is ridiculous. Here is my scene by scene take on him.

***SCENE 1 - Opening Montage***

[The first shot we get of Nate is him chilling in bed saying ""Good luck."" ](https://imgur.com/HCjFzJt)This is a man with no aspirations. While his girlfriend is getting ready to work, he is reading the comics + games section of the newspaper. Andy and Nate seem to be in good terms her though, so she is familiar with how he is.

***SCENE 2 - Dinner with Friends***

When Andy, Nate, and their friends go out to eat, her friends and her take solace in the fact that they all have shitty jobs. When walking back to home, they hold hands and make fun of how ridiculous the workers dress at Runway. This shows how both Andy and Nate do not take their jobs too seriously.

***SCENE 3 - Andy Coffee Dial***

Andy wakes up to a phone call from Emily and has to go get coffee immediately. [Nate's gives the look like he is saying ""oh brother... jobs am I right??""](https://imgur.com/lFllBP4)

***SCENE 4 - Andy is Venting About Her Job***

Nate is cooking a grilled cheese sandwich on a skillet, which is awfully on-brand for our underachieving king. Nate serves her the grilled cheese which Andy says that she will not partake because everyone is skinny at Runway (red flag?!?). Andy then makes the promise of it being only one year, which Nate nonchalantly says ""Easy there, tiger."" while he is chewing on the grilled cheese. Classic Nate.

***SCENE 5 - New Wardrobe***

Andy surprises Nate with her new clothes. Nate hits her with a [classic Nate line.](https://imgur.com/cALodxM) Now Nate somewhat superficially likes an aspect of her job.

***SCENE 6 - Bar with Friends***

This is where the main issue arrives. Andy sings the praises of Runway, which then Nate makes a quip about Andy drinking the Kool-Aid after praising Runway. This makes sense, they both laughed at how silly fashion is in the beginning, Nate still remains the same while Andy now admires it. The friends playing with her work phone when they just accepted gifts she got from work is shitty though.

Sidenote: the next scene, blonde hair man asks for some samples of her writing to get her connections. She rejects this offer because she is Miranda's assistant. So maybe Nate was onto something here...

***SCENE 7 + 8 - Andy calls Nate Saying She Wants to Quit.***

After given the impossible task of getting the Harry Potter books, she calls Nate saying she wants to quit. [We finally see Nate working, which is cool too.](https://imgur.com/SOoIlim) Next scene Nate comes home to see Andy working on the twins' science project (Red flag?!?!?!).  She starts defending her boss after Nate calls her a wacko (a wacko surely would not have their assistant work on her niece's science project). The conversation comes to an end when [Andy shows her sexy bra](https://imgur.com/SXRlBEL), which is the weakness of a simple man like Nate.

***SCENE 9 - Poor Nate is Alone on his Birthday***

Andy was working and had to miss Nate's birthday. She then [comes home to a single cupcake with a candle on top of it saying ""Happy Birthday"".](https://imgur.com/d8MSnyD) After briefly explaining herself, Nate just says ""Don't worry about it. I'm going to bed"". Not even Andy's sexy bra will save her this time. He then tells her ""You look very pretty"", and goes to bed. He is unhappy because Andy bailed on him.

***SCENE 10 - Andy Won't Go to Bed***

Nate asks Andy if she will go to bed. She says [five minutes ](https://imgur.com/9QnrUni)(doubtful). She is looking at some personal photos, but the tension is definitely there.

***SCENE 11 - The Art Exhibit***

Andy's friend sees the blonde man giving Andy a kiss on the cheek. Andy's friend asks Andy why she is cheating on Nate (it is a misunderstanding). The friend leaves, and clueless ass Nate comes from the back asking [""You're going to Paris?""](https://imgur.com/K90oVIo)

Nate asks ""I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or..."" and Andy responds ""Great. Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?"". Andy walks away [leaving Nate in utter shock.](https://imgur.com/Se2YpsG) They argue. Nate suggests to take a break. When Nate is walking away, Andy calls for him, but alas she gets call from Miranda.

This is probably the most contentious scene, but I do not see how Nate is in the wrong. Andy is completely different now, why would they want to stay together anyways? Nate is asking her to be genuine: either be the same with him or aspire to be a Runway worker. And he got his answer in the end, she decides to answer Miranda.

***SCENE 12 - Andy Apologizes to Nate***

Andy apologizes to Nate, saying:

&gt;Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?

This is apology misses the point. Andy shouldn't be sorry about that, she should be sorry for not knowing what she really wanted to be. Nate accepts the apology though, he is not very bright.

**IN CONCLUSION - Is Nate a Bad Boyfriend?**

Not really. He is a dumb underachiever. Andy changed too much and will not acknowledge it, so Nate had to say it openly for her to understand.

movies,"James Cameron, has to believe “that door” is the biggest mistake of his career!","
From the second that movie hit theaters the debate about Jack, Rose, and the door took off. 

There are countless videos and even pictures of people “proving” that both Jack and Rose could have fit on the door. I say proving because most of them talk about how it was big enough for them both to get on but don’t always take weight into consideration. 

Some even say if they had taken turns on the door and both would have survived. 

I just picture James lying in bed every night thinking….

“If I had known all the shit I was going to get over that damn door…God! Why didn’t I just have them die together….I’m sure people would have forgiven me quicker for that!” 

He is a great director but he will NEVER escape that door debate. 

(Also I have seen some theorize that it wasn’t wood carving over a door)

EDIT:

ITS CALLED JOKING AROUND PEOPLE! 

It’s joking about how we shouldn’t care as much as we have. To this day so many debate it. 

So the joke is James never thought people would care so much and they do so it’s joke about him regretting it because people won’t let it go. 

People on here do know joking isn’t a sin right? You don’t have to insult someone for making a stupid joke to have some fun with others on Reddit.

I’m sure he loves the film is remembered but it’s funny imagining him being like “I can’t believe I get all this shit about a door! Like out of all things a door! If I had them both die all these never ending debates wouldn’t happen.”

He probably thinks why is the possible survival of two fictional characters is so serious to people that they have done so many things to prove it.

Again it’s called joking around people. Even if a joke isn’t funny as long as it’s not offensive you shouldn’t get so pissed and rude.",HeyWeasel101,1h817tp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h817tp/james_cameron_has_to_believe_that_door_is_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h817tp/james_cameron_has_to_believe_that_door_is_the/,2024-12-06 13:21:47,0,0.13,0,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h817tp
movies,RDJ as Doctor Doom might be one of the biggest fumbles OAT.,"Ok so I like many other marvel fans have kinda not been paying attention to most of marvels recent projects, so guess my surprise when I hear that they are making the new major villain Doctor Doom, one of my favorite villains in all of media. Doctor Doom is the ruler of a foreign nation who uses both science and magic, as well as his incredibly high IQ, to destroy his opponents and try and raise his country to prosperity as well as any other motivations he may have. He is one of the most brutal and harsh characters marvel has to offer and the actor they choose to play him is RDJ????? 

Don't get me wrong RDJ is a great actor and was fantastic as Tony Stark, he also demonstrated his ability to play a serious villain in Oppenheimer, however RDJs whole vibe is completely wrong, Doctor Doom is a character that no matter the context should feel menacing and dangerous as well as calculating and incredibly serious, RDJ is not this, he is iron man. 

Idk this all feels like a cash grab or they just don't really care. So many other actors could've played Doom amazingly (Javier Bardem comes to mind) and also Doom is literally the ruler of a foreign country his accent wouldn't be American. Ik this is jumping the gun and the movie could be great but Doom is such a perfect villain to follow thanos, someone less physically powerful (although he can get quite the powerup) but smarter then anyone the Avengers have faced yet.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovakia,"Hello there!

A bit more than 24 hours ago, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Serbia, and to be honest, as an outsider, I'm absolutely surprised. Not so much about the fact, that *A Serbian Film* didn't win (okay, a little bit about that too), but more about how much hate it got especially by - as it seems to me - the Serbs themselves. As a result, instead of this very unappetizing film, ***Balkanski špijun*** (engl.: *Balkan Spy*) has now won the contest.

But no sooner has a new movie earned its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) than we move on to the next country. Now it's all about **Slovakia** and as the 41 times before, there are only two rules to have in regard in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Granted I liked a lot of movies from these directors, but they were definitely not an easy watch and I wouldn’t want to watch them again.

Does it say something about someone psychologically if they love these kind of movies? Im not at all saying they’re bad people. But i just wonder why people enjoy this stuff and actively seek it out.

movies,The sequels to Terminator 2,"I just re-watched all the Terminator 3 versions, and just thought I'd give some feedback.

I'm a big fan of the original two movies. T2 is IMHO one of the best movies ever made. T1 is also an amazing movie, but I don't feel it's aged well.

The TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles I feel was the best continuation of the series. Though there was a lot of filler episodes, it felt true to the spirit of the Terminator franchise.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines I really didn't like. There's too many jokes, it feels like a parody. Stuff like the camp glasses the T800 wears and the breasts inflating. The ended felt really good, but the journey felt so corny I couldn't enjoy it.

(Terminator Salvation I haven't watched yet, but it's a continuation from Rise of the Machines, so I'm comfortable leaving it out).

Terminator Genisys I think is my favorite T3. I enjoyed the twists with John Conner and the stuff about Genisys, and the stuff with Pops. It's weak as a Terminator film, but it feels like the best of a bad bunch.

Terminator: Dark Fate I cannot stand. The twist at the start with John just left a bad taste in my mouth, and the humanization of the T800 just makes no sense.

VARIETY Oct 13, 1998 -

HEROES AMID PESTILENCE: Todd Alcott is thriving as a scribe who finds heroes amid pestilence. First, he co-wrote the hit pic “Antz,” which turns those insects into sympathetic sorts. Now, he’s got a script that delivers a serial killer worth rooting for, and it’s got director Adrian Lyne seriously considering making it his next film.

The project, set up at Dimension, is called “One Neck,” described as a social commentary about the higher classes in Easthampton. The lead character endures the loathsome lot around him until he’s revealed as a serial killer who begins bumping off the upper-crusters at a party.

Lyne, who last directed “Lolita,” counts that among several helming options, which include “The Murder Next Door” at Sony and an untitled project he’s developed at Fox 2000.

Alcott, who started as a Gotham playwright, also has adapted the zombie comic book “Dead World” for Warner Bros. and producers George Clooney and Robert Lawrence. He’s repped by ICM’s Todd Feldman and Leora Bloch and managed by Linne Radmin of the Radmin Co., who’s producing “One Neck” with Howard Meltzer.",noeunofficial,1h7kl6v,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,2024-12-05 21:37:00,0,0.11,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h7kl6v

This is one of my least favorite Lionsgate films of all time, and yes, this film still gives me nightmares...

So, let's get to the review.

***THE PLOT:*** What was the writer of that Ashton Kutcher film up to... wait... if this film came out the same year as the Open Season 3 film, why didn't we get a real villain? Why is there a scene of it ripping-off The Lion King? **WHY IS THAT MOONLIGHT HOWL SCENE SO SCARY!?** 

***THE CHARACTERS:*** Lilly is surprisingly a likable and fun character, and she's still one of my favorite characters of all time in Lionsgate history. Everyone else? Well, we'll get to that later.

***THE ANIMATION:*** Holy shit. What is up with the fucking animation!? Yes, it's like a PS3 game or something, even a deleted scene on the film's Blu-Ray had better animation. I like the expressions on the characters.

***THE VOICE ACTING:*** Honestly, I prefer the cast of this film, and not the sequel cast of Sonic actors and anime dubbers. I like Justin Long and co.'s voices, sounding far more cute than Ben Diskin and co.'s voices in the sequel media.

***OVERALL:*** Well, this was what ruined Lionsgate even further, the only thing that I hate more than this film are those seven-shitty direct-to-video sequels that Lionsgate made just for money, and I might write a new story/retelling of the sequel that ignores the DTV sequels.

movies,Theory about the missing folder in Whiplash (2014),"In Whiplash (2014)Tanner’s Whiplash sheet music can be seen in the first rehearsal. In the final scene where Nieman plays for Fletcher, the same exact sheet music with the same markings can be seen. Suggesting it was stolen by either Nieman or Fletcher. 

https://imgur.com/a/unFP8da

Okay, given that there is no scene where we see the actual sheet being given to Nieman at the end of the film it can’t be totally confirmed BUT to consider: 

 1. Before the final scene Nieman clearly has brought his own folder with him for the concert. Does this mean that the whiplash sheet music would be in that folder?  

 2. Fletcher could have given Nieman the sheet music when he got there, but this is never seen. It would depend on what the usual protocol is for concerts which I don’t know much about.

movies,THE REVIEW-ING - 101 DALMATIANS II: PATCH'S LONDON ADVENTURE (2003),"[Art style that more accurately imitates the previous film? Good job, Walt Disney Pictures.](https://preview.redd.it/t1l28nvaa35e1.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c5d4f94396d2e1a7dd173072069bb4783f6b43b)

**THE PLOT:** The whole plot of Patch feeling left out by all of his siblings and the only thing that cheers him up would be his favorite TV show. I like how Patch is a great and likable character, and Thunderbolt also is a fun and enjoyable character too.

**THE ANIMATION:** I'm surprised that the animation is more in-line with the original 1961 film, keeping the scratchy outline/xerography aspect, and is feeling like the previous film's animation as well. Kinda good that Television Animation was capable of making good animated sequels.

**THE VOICE ACTING:** Even though everyone from the original is **fucking dead**. Everyone here has a brand new cast, I like the voices of Lockwood and everyone else, as many of the new actors do splendid jobs recapturing the magic of everyone.

**OVERALL:** Honestly, I don't think the film was pointless, seeing this film gives me much more interest, I consider it the best 101 Dalmatians sequel, next to the live-action sequel.",Odenbirb,1h7ivo9,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7ivo9/the_reviewing_101_dalmatians_ii_patchs_london/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7ivo9/the_reviewing_101_dalmatians_ii_patchs_london/,2024-12-05 20:25:57,0,0.09,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NJ_nniVaPZ3-MsQ_aMRyOBJW4vkNN3pk9AqEHvrmsl8.jpg,t3_1h7ivo9

movies,"Genuinely, how do you feel about how Alien: Romulus used Ian Holm's face?","For those who didn't catch that while watching the movie, it wasn't an actor who played Rook (kinda obvious honestly). Daniel Betts voiced Rook, but the character in itself is some sort of mask molded after Ian Holm's face when he was in his late 40s (specifically when he played Ash in Alien ).

I've seen many people talking about whether this approach was even ethical.

On the one hand, Fede Alvarez did talk with Ian's wife to see if she was fine with them doing this, so the person who would most likely be affected by seeing Ian on screen was removed from the equation. And this wasn't a copy of Ian's most relevant appearance, aka the year before he died, so you might make a case for that too.

On the other hand, getting permission from his wife isn't like getting permission from him. So you can't say he would have been fine with his appearance being used. As for the point of his younger appearance being used, this might actually not matter at all since it is still Ian's appearance.

Look! I really liked Romulus, but this could have been easily avoided if they just cast someone who looks like Ian to play Rook or keep with the original plan to have a different person for Rook. That was possible since the movie has amazing practical effects, and I'm sure the artists would have come up with genius ideas to hide the lower part of Rook's body.

movies,🔥 Pushpa 2: The Rule - The Most Anticipated Sequel of the Year! 🔥,"The Positives:

1. Allu Arjun's Performance: He’s the soul of the movie. His portrayal of Pushpa Raj is even more charismatic and intense than in the first film. From his swagger to his emotional depth, Arjun delivers in every scene.


2. Action and Visuals: The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. They’re larger-than-life but still gritty, which fits the tone perfectly. The cinematography adds a cinematic grandeur that amplifies the experience.


3. Music and Background Score: Devi Sri Prasad nails it again. The songs and the background music elevate every scene, especially during high-octane moments and emotional beats.


4. Narrative Depth: Compared to the first film, the sequel explores Pushpa’s personal and professional battles more thoroughly. The emotional connection with his family adds a layer of relatability.


5. Villain's Presence: Fahadh Faasil as Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat is a standout. His face-offs with Pushpa are thrilling and add a lot of weight to the story.




---

The Negatives:

1. Lengthy Runtime: The movie feels stretched in parts. Some scenes could have been trimmed to keep the pacing tighter, especially in the second half.


2. Predictable Moments: While the core storyline is engaging, certain plot twists feel predictable, taking away some of the excitement.


3. Over-the-Top Action: While fans of masala entertainers might love it, some viewers may find the action sequences a bit exaggerated.


4. Focus on Subplots: At times, the film delves too deep into side plots, which distracts from the main narrative.


5. Comparisons with the First Film: Some fans felt it lacked the raw energy and novelty that made Pushpa: The Rise so impactful. The bar was set so high that this sequel, despite its strengths, doesn’t completely surpass it.




---

Final Word:

If you loved the first part, Pushpa 2 offers plenty to enjoy, especially with Allu Arjun’s electrifying performance and the intense drama. But the pacing and predictability might leave some viewers wishing for a tighter edit. Overall, it’s a mix of high-octane entertainment and emotional storytelling worth a watch, especially on the big screen.",EngineeringWorldly45,1h7jvgq,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,2024-12-05 21:07:37,0,0.11,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h7jvgq

Each entry is a different Christmas movie and *probably* isn't Die Hard. Despite how they may sound. This is all just for fun and my own amusement. Hope you all enjoy.

1. Working class hero is terrorized by upper class villain who steals money during Christmas

2. Lone individual hiding nearby attempts to ruin a group's Christmas time plan.

3. Estranged father from New York has trouble reconnecting with his son due to shenanigans involving a high rise.

4. Father has Christmas plans for his family but they go awry following an argument with his wife culminating in a violent police raid of the building he's in.

5. Thieves rob a vault at Christmas time but their getaway plan is derailed by unexpected interference.

6. Thieves attempt to rob a building and are repeatedly thwarted by a particular unexpected occupant.

7. After facing down an intruder on the roof a father must reluctantly rise to the challenge to be able to reconnect with his family.

8. An unexpected man's identity is unclear but he may just be the hero everyone needs.

9. Father who wants to make Christmas nice has to deal with an unexpected foe culminating in a fight on top of a building.

10. A father wishing to reconnect with his family must deal with unexpected troublemakers at Christmas.

11. A sizable group of trouble makers enact their plan at Christmas time. The police are helpless to stop them and an interloper has to step up.

12. A team of Thieves plan a Christmas time heist but things go bad when the police arrive sooner than expected.

movies,WDAS and Pixar Copying Marvel Studios IP Flex Logo in the Future?,"I have been thinking about how Disney and Marvel Studios changed logo branding forever by making it their standard of having long, grandiose, self-serving and congratulatory logos that pretty much serve as a sizzle reel to promote their most popular and relevant brands. Kids and Disney Adults are more likely to be exposed to already established IP that is safe to invest rather than new ideas (which are likely to banned in Hollywood in favor of tax write offs).

The current Disney Studios logo is honestly very stimulative and busy with the fireworks and Easter Eggs all over it.

What if Disney Animation and Pixar decide one day to change their logos to copy exactly what Marvel is doing?

For WDAS, Steamboat Mickey transitions only to their most relevant ""franchises"" like Frozen, Wreck-it-Ralph, the Disney Princesses and Zootopia along with some other movies similar to the current DreamWorks logo.

Pixar, whether it is still the hopping lamp or phased out, is stepped aside in favor of their biggest franchises like Toy Story, Cars, Incredibles and Inside Out.

Christophe Beck and Michael Giacchino can compose new music to mimic the Marvel Studios fanfare with a minimalistic rhythm and melody that is just enough to sell it. And the logos have to clock in at 30-40 seconds. Disney has made long logos their identity and do you think they can pull this strategy off for both Disney Animation and Pixar? What other ideas do you have in mind if they were mandated to reimagine their logos?

DreamWorks and Star Wars have done this now.

movies, Park Chan-wook's Decision to Leave and how it embraces modern tech ,"This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.

Decision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and ""smart"" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.

This is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.

1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices

* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.
* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.
* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners
* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app
* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)
* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to ""point"") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.
* The ""captain's log"" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app
* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up
* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.

1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.

* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.
* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband
* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband

1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices

* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.
* I like the ""switch"" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks
* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear
* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly

Overall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.

movies,Film Schools education,"Hello, everyone. I’m curious to know if film schools worldwide generally lack in providing quality film education, or if it’s just the one I’m attending in Turkey that is subpar. My experience has been rather disappointing, as many professors here seem to lack even a basic understanding of fundamental concepts like the three-act structure, blocking/staging, or shot sizes.

For example, I recently had marks deducted because my professor claimed that a close-up shot I used was actually an extreme close-up. To clarify, the shot was indeed a close-up, quite similar to the iconic ""Here’s Johnny"" shot from The Shining. When I challenged this, asking him what he would consider a shot focusing on just the eyes, mouth, hand, or nose, he said it was a ""cut-in"" shot. Frankly, I’ve never encountered ""cut-in"" as a term for a shot size in any academic or professional context—it refers to a type of edit, not a shot size.

Additionally, the instructors often make us analyze critically panned films, urging us to focus on basic themes and cookie cutter lessons rather than on the craftsmanship of the art—be it the editing, the screenplay, or the visual aesthetics.

Is this the standard for film education globally, or is the Turkish system uniquely flawed? I'd love to hear your insights.

SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN THIS MOVIE 





I took an edible and watched “Smile 2” (yeah i know that was stupid) and I’m really just whelmed about. Not over, not under, but just kinda “meh”. The performances were great. Naomi Scott absolutely killed it. I think the thing that’s making me think about it and making me wonder if it would have worked was if in the marketing and advertising for the movie, the audience didn’t know that she was a pop star. I mean the joke as soon as the movie was announced was that it’d be someone at a concert in front of a bunch of people, but I just keep thinking what if the marketing led us in a completely different direction making the audience think that she was maybe just a daughter to someone with money and the final “twist” of the movie was us finding out that she was some famous pop star that offs herself in front of thousands. I just feel like that ending would have been a lot more of a shocker added on. I obviously don’t know how that would work but who knows.

It's similar to movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Hate, and The Standoff at Sparrow Creek in that it's only a matter of time until the tension erupts into violence, but Galluppi does a great job at squeezing tension out of the littlest moments until the poop hits the fan.

After seeing this, I'm interested to see what Galluppi brings to the Evil Dead franchise, as he knows how to build simmering tension, unleash violence, and sprinkle it with some dark humor.

movies,Horror films without omnipotent villains,"Hi all,

I watch a decent amount of horror films and a trope that I hate in the genre is when the villains are seemingly omnipotent by which I mean this like:

1. They win no matter what
2. Nothing they do ever fails in any way
3. Nothing the main characters do has any impact on the outcome
4. Even if the main characters destroy/win somehow the villain is just back at the end

This can look a lot of ways depending on the kind of villain in the film but the principal is similar. 

I personally find these kids of endings really boring I think because they feel totally unreal and not analogous to the real world as I perceive it. I once complained about this regarding a specific movie and a friend said she loved the ending because it was realistic (she's a very cynical person). 

I'm wondering what you guys think of this trope on general. Anyone else find it boring and tired like me?

Also do any of you have any suggestions for good horror films that somehow subvert this?

Films that I think subvert this and are good include:
The Orphanage (Spanish film)
Babadook
Alien
The mist (though holy hell that ending has it's own problems lol)

movies,The Departed and Captain Queenan,"Now I know that The Departed is designed as a wildly entertaining movie that operates under movie logic. And I love it, as it is. 

But the thing that I can't come to terms with, and tears me out of the movie logic, is Captain Queenan. In the context of the movie, I just don't know what to make of him.

Here's a world where everyone is double crossing everyone, where every organization is more corrupt than the next, everyone has their own motives and is playing their own game.

And then we've got Queenan, who seems to be this pure and virtuous man, uncorrupted by his environment. And yet he's risen to a high rank in a corrupt organization! And he's supposed to be this mastermind that runs undercover operations. It is impossible for someone in that position to be as naive and innocent as Queenan is portrayed to be.

Every other character in the movie has motives for their actions, and they act accordingly. Queenan just doesn't fit, as I see it.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \- 83 (24 Reviews)

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):

&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director’s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):

&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):

&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.

[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):

&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):

&gt;Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):

&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.

[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):

&gt;It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):

&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.

The Independent (100):

&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.

Written and Directed by Robert Eggers:

&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.

movies,Gone Baby Gone (2007) is the ultimate moral conundrum on film. Lots of spoilers.,"I first saw Gone Baby Gone the day it opened in theaters, mostly because I was more curious to see how Ben Affleck's directorial debut turned out after four years of him being the punchline of every Bennifer joke in existence throughout that weird period in pop culture. But also because I saw it was an adaptation of another Boston-set Dennis Lehane novel, and Mystic River became an instant favorite of mine in late 2003, and everything I'd read about the novel Gone Baby Gone convinced me this was gonna be another Lehane multi-layered mystery tragedy. I loved it after leaving the theater, but I didn't expect it to stick with me as long as it did. Patrick's decision to get Jack Doyle arrested once he figured out the entire conspiracy behind Amanda's kidnapping making all the other characters hate him for giving Amanda back to her mother is one of the reasons it stuck with me; I kept asking myself over and over if he made the right decision. Was doing the legally correct thing the morally correct choice?

When it was released on DVD and I got to rewatch it, it finally hit me why the ending stuck with me so much; other than Helene going right back to her old self now that Amanda was home safely, Amanda correcting Patrick on her doll's name hit me like a fucking Mack truck. Throughout the entire movie, Amanda being taken while in possession of her doll named Mirabelle is mentioned several times; Patrick, now on babysitting duty because Helene didn't think to hire one for her date with a ""fan"" of her talk show interviews, sees Amanda playing with her doll and asks, ""Is that Mirabelle?"" Little Amanda responds with ""Annabelle"". 

Now, it's entirely possible this was a new doll purchased for Amanda after Mirabelle took a dip in that quarry's lake, but the look on Patrick's face before it cuts to the credits tells me he realized in that moment that **no one,** not even Amanda's aunt who hired and then stiffed Patrick and Angie, knew the actual name of Amanda's doll, since the media reported multiple times that Amanda had her ""doll named Mirabelle"". Helene and Bea likely would've corrected the record that the doll's name was Annabelle since they were the only two characters who actually wanted the mystery of Amanda's kidnapping solved. But no one corrected the record, so ""Mirabelle"" was the name mentioned several times *until* Amanda corrected Patrick; it's that look on his face as [Alexi Murdoch's ""Through the Dark""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPng8o3zDqM) starts playing that made me realize why this movie stuck with me so much. Patrick put his life and relationship on the line to save this little girl for a woman whom everyone else saw as the drug addicted neglectful horror show of a mother she had been, and lost pretty much everything for doing it: Angie left him and hated him for ripping Amanda away from the nice police captain in the nice, safe home and giving her back to Helene and *didn't* even get paid for all the shit he and Angie went through.

Patrick is the ***only*** character who sees how much pain and torment Helene is experiencing, which explains his ultimate decision and why Angie hates him for it; Angie was never around to see how truly sorry Helene was for her actions leading to Amanda's kidnapping. While others, and the audience, may rightfully disagree with Patrick's decision, pay attention to the times when Helene breaks down on your next rewatch, and you'll better understand why Patrick chose the way he did; no one else saw that side of Helene, they just saw the drug addicted neglectful mother, which was used as the justification for a whole bunch of crimes. Also, I think Patrick's Catholic guilt over executing Corwin Earle was another big deciding factor in him trying to do what he saw as the morally and legally correct choice, and Remy's little motivational speech -- which got the ball rolling for Patrick to realize the truth behind Amanda's kidnapping -- outside the hospital did *nothing* to relieve Patrick's guilt, nor did Angie's pride in Patrick for it. And *goddamn* was Ed Harris a fucking powerhouse in that scene outside the hospital after Nick was shot. If 2007 hadn't been so stacked with amazing Supporting Acting nominations, including Casey Affleck himself as Robert Ford, I'm betting Harris would've been nominated, even if he had *zero* chance of beating Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh.

I also think it's interesting how the *major* mystery of the movie is seemingly solved an hour before the movie ends. But as this was yet another Dennis Lehane multi-layered crime mystery, it makes sense. Little Amanda running out that door and happily jumping into Doyle's arms was one of the biggest mind fucks in a movie since finding out that Dave Boyle was &gt;!entirely innocent of Katie Markum's murder, that he'd actually murdered a pedophile\*!&lt; in Mystic River, making [""The last time I saw Dave Boyle was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9k-uO50300) one of the most tragic movie quotes of this first quarter century. Doyle's entire justification speech to convince Patrick not to report this is the centerpiece of the story's main thesis on doing what's legally or morally correct, which is also apparently the main topic of the [novel's sequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_\(novel\)) Angie's tearful ""She's happy here. I saw her."" does nothing to help Patrick's difficult decision.

Fuck, I love this movie. It's a great addition to the New England Tragedy pentalogy dominated by the brothers Affleck: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Manchester by the Sea. Oh, and it needs to be said that Harry Gregson-Williams' scores for this and The Town are some of the most haunting film scores in the last 20 years.

And RIP to both Michael K. Williams -- still weird to see him in a police uniform after knowing him as Omar Little for so long -- and John Ashton, who just passed away in September.

movies,Italian cinema: a brief summary from my POV,"# This is a summary of my thoughts on Italian cinema and its evolution, with a FOCUS ON ITS DECLINE AND RETURN. I’d love to hear other perspectives and expand the discussion. What do you think?

* **Golden Age:** The triumphs of Italian cinema.
* **Decline:** The exploitation of cinema and loss of relevance in the 1980s.
* **Mediaset Monopoly:** How Mediaset and generalist TV took over.
* **Internet &amp; Streamers:** The rebirth driven by the internet and streaming platforms.

# Golden Age

Italian cinema has always been a global powerhouse. During the silent film era, Italy produced massive historical epics, featuring hundreds of extras and drawing from its rich history (from the Roman Empire to *The Divine Comedy* and beyond).

During World War II, Italian cinema shifted toward propaganda, moving away from artistic creativity to serve political power.

After the war, *neorealism* was born. While Hollywood was stuck under restrictive production codes, Italian filmmakers were telling raw, universal stories about post-war struggles—groundbreaking narratives that resonated far beyond Italy’s borders.

# Decline: The Exploitation of Cinema

In the '60s and '70s, Hollywood abandoned its production codes, and by the '80s, the advent of visual effects caused a major shift. The U.S. soared to new global heights in filmmaking, far surpassing Italian cinema.

Italy, meanwhile, struggled to modernize. The loss of the neorealist pioneers left a vacuum, and new filmmakers turned to short-sighted strategies. They leaned into low-budget projects that mimicked blockbuster aesthetics, piggybacking on Hollywood trends to squeeze out quick profits. This led to a drop in quality and, more importantly, respect from audiences. Italian cinema became synonymous with mediocrity.

# Mediaset Monopoly

Around the same time, television was rising as a dominant force in entertainment, pulling audiences away from theaters. By the late '80s, Mediaset was founded.

Through the '90s and 2000s, Mediaset capitalized on this shift, creating a cultural monopoly. Anything produced or aired by Mediaset was consumed by the vast majority of Italians, if not the entire audience.

Mediaset cultivated its own *star system*, building celebrities rather than artists. The cultural output during this era? Talk shows, game shows, reality TV, and low-quality films and series—cheaply produced and aimed purely at generating profit and mindless entertainment.

# Internet &amp; Streamers: A Rebirth

With the rise of the internet, younger generations shifted their attention online, leaving behind the Mediaset-dominated culture that had shaped Italy for decades.

By the 2010s, platforms like YouTube had become major hubs for youth entertainment. Around 2018, streaming services started cutting into Mediaset’s once-dominant share. Netflix led the charge, followed by Prime Video and Sky. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram later became central sources of creative content.

Today, Mediaset’s cultural monopoly is largely a thing of the past, especially among younger Italians. While older generations (those from the '70s and '80s) still keep their TVs tuned to Rai or Mediaset for programs like *Wheel of Fortune* with Gerry Scotti, younger people see traditional TV as outdated. It’s not personalized, it feels repetitive, and it’s not delivering high-quality content.

After 40 years of cultural decline—from the exploitation of cinema to Mediaset’s reign—streamers have brought international standards to their Italian productions. They effortlessly outcompete the trashy, generalist programming of traditional TV. Meanwhile, social media is fostering a new wave of original, satisfying, and artistic content.

A fresh *star system* is emerging, centered on genuine artistic quality rather than the superficial generalism that defined past generations.

movies,Santa Claus the Movie.  Actually a Creepy Movie,"When i was a kid.  One of my favorite Christmas Movies was Santa Claus : The Movie.    It is on the MGM+ this month and i watched it the other day which was the first time in a while .  I didn't think of this when i was a kid, but now as an adult.  It is a creepy movie.   

Here are my reasons

Santa and Mrs Claus and 2 of the reindeer are Undead because they froze to death at the beginning of the movie.

Santa and Mrs Claus are kidnappers because they allow the kids to stay at the north pole for at least a year at the end of the movie.    The homeless boy might not be missed, but I am sure there would be quite a bunch of missing posters and milk cartons looking for the redhead girl.   The lady who she lived with and I am sure her parents would be looking for her.   Rich girl gone missing for a year.  How would she explain that?

movies, Favorite movie by european country: Serbia,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in San Marino. As expected, it wasn't easy to find any movie that fits to the criteria here, but I think, we've found a winner which in a way reflects the heart of this journey very well: ***Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino*** (engl.: *The Unknown Man of San Marino*) is absolutely one of those hidden gems I hoped to find during this project.

Today, I think, it will be easier again to find movies and to be honest, I think, that it's very easy to guess the winner that will take its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). We turn our attention to **Serbia** and, as always, have only two rules to follow:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

But I'm confused about its ending. Why did Ruby's husband want to kill Mary?

In my opinion, Mary did nothing wrong with Ruby. She just fulfilled Ruby's desire. Ruby would like to transform her body like a doll (transforming the private parts like a doll). Marry accepted to operate surgery because Ruby gave her a bunch of money for that. Then Rudy got doll-like body. Ruby's husband tried to kill Mary when he found out that his wife body is like a doll.

movies,What is the title of this movie/tv program?,"I remember being young and watching something that I don't remember if it was a movie or a TV program. It looks like it was made in late 70s/early '80s. It's about this girl who seems to have a somewhat unhappy life. Don't remember the details, but I remember that in the beginning, her brother is annoying her and he runs out of the room after, and she laments to herself about how she hates him or something like that.

What stands out is the climax, in which she is on some Carousel Ride, enjoying herself. All the sudden, the carousel horses seem to be taking her away. From what it turns out, she wakes up from a very bad dream in which the carousel horses were taking her away.

I have been trying very futiley for many years to figure out the name of this program. I don't remember if it's a movie or if it was a TV episode or Pilot, or just a special that was made in general. Maybe someone out there can finally help me solve this lifelong mystery as to what the name of this program is.

A big time thank you in advance to whoever figures it out and helps me finally.",drmcbdm,1h69ypb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h69ypb/what_is_the_title_of_this_movietv_program/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h69ypb/what_is_the_title_of_this_movietv_program/,2024-12-04 06:42:47,0,0.5,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h69ypb

movies,We Live in Time,"I was having a rough day and went for a walk on the levee near my house. I ended up watching a few seconds of the trailer and immediately booked a ticket with AMC. 

Y’all. I sobbed the entire time. This movie was beautiful for so many different reasons; capturing the journey of the main characters falling in love, seeing the life they build together, all of the hard/exciting life moments throughout their relationship, and her transition at the end. Florence and Andrew do an incredible job of portraying what (my idea of what) love should be. The way he looks at her and the support they give each other hit so close to home that it made my chest hurt. 

If you haven’t seen it, probably expect tears, but it’s worth it. It’s up there in my favorite romance movies next to Persuasion.

movies,Has high budget television killed movies?,"I used to watch lots of movies, they were my thing. I still have a massive collection of DVDs that I used to watch multiple times. These days I'll be lucky to watch 2 or 3 movies a month, and I think the reason is because TV got better. 

It's not that I think that most TV is as good as movies, but It just takes up my viewing time a lot more than movies do now. I feel like there are so many shows that I need to start and ones that I started and need to finish, it's almost a job to get through them. 

TV used to be crappy shows and half funny sitcoms that you'd watch for a bit and then decide it was time for something decent, so you'd watch a film. Now the shows are a lot better, but they often aren't still as good as a film, but they suck you in. You get caught up in a sunken cost fallacy, you've stopped enjoying the show, but after 4 seasons you feel like it would all have been wasted if you don't keep going.

The terrible techniques they used such as the asbestos for snow and how badly Judy Garland was over worker, drugged and essentially had no say on anything that was done to her due to lack of laws at the time. 

Now, I am sure most reading this have an idea of what I am talking about, but my question is, did other old Hollywood movies have these conditions? Was this something common at the time for movie set producers to treat their workers like this? And do things like these happen today in movie sets?

It was unlikely that i'd discover the movies i came to love, but i did. I live in a small city in Quebec, and here, it's all about American flicks and movies in French. It took a tourist who came to town to make me discover that beautiful world of foreign movies. 've got nobody to discuss films with, around a cup of coffee. I wish i had! For example, my favorite movie is "" Last life in the universe"" by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang from Thailand. It was released in 2003, and i still watch it once a year. I'm also a big fan of the work of Tsai Ming Liang from Taiwan. His movies hold a very dear place in my heart. Over the years, i've seen tons of movies that were never released in local cinemas, that never went popular here. When i'm trying to make friends, it always kind of upsets people that i don't "" encourage"" our local culture. I mean, i wish i could enjoy it, but i don't. What can one do?

movies,They Live (1988) and it's concept ,"It was in my watchlist for such a long time, finally decided to watch it and blew me away completely. John Carpenter is a visionary! Has anyone of you saw it in the theatres? Or were you there when it was released?

Have you seen Men In Black or The Matrix or Fight Club? This movie felt like it had all of that! And maybe somewhat an inspiration for the movie I mentioned.

They Live dir. By *John Carpenter* is a story of a man, played by Roddy Piper who has come to City in search of a job, but is shocked when he sees the _*reality of this world*_. There are aliens living among us, and they are controlling everything.

Advertisements, News Channels, Politics, everything... everything is a LIE. They are controlling us with different mediums, changing our Subconscious mind and bending our reality, turning us into servants, into Livestock. 

_""We are Sleeping, They are living.""_

If you're someone who is into Illuminati, Secret Society, you'll love this film.

Though some moments felt janky in acting, but that's because the lead is probably the first WWF Turned Actor. Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.

This movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.

movies,Heat (1995)….Most beautiful movie line I’ve heard ,"In Heat… there’s 2 parts that stick out to me… many great scenes overall

But when Val Kilmer’s character tells DeNiro “for me the sun rises and sets with her” when talking about his wife and why he can’t leave her. Then at the end… they are both in a relationship where they fight a lot.. both have been unfaithful and she’s ready to turn him in. But when she sees his innocent genuine smile when he sees her, she can’t bring herself to go against him and realizes she still loves him despite all their issues and signals to him to run away. I loved that dynamic

Also the part where the Dennis Heybert’s character (the AllState commercial guy) is sitting with his gf and he feels like a failure. He tells her “why you rolling around with me for?” and starts crying. And she reassures him and tells him because she’s proud of him for trying. 

2 scenes/dynamics that are relatable and just hit deep. One is a relationship that has had many issues and in turmoil but deep down, the two still love eachother.

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

movies,"It’s about time we talk about LA Story (1991) written and starring Steve Martin, is this his best comedy? ","I remember watching this with my parents when I was younger, prob around 95. I was born 88 so I didn’t have any ability to pick up any of the satire but I remember enjoying it.

I have a bad habit of not rewatching movies I’ve seen since there’s so much out there, no matter how young I was when I first saw it, but my wife showed me a clip from the film off Instagram and we laughed and decided to give it a try and let me tell you it blew us away. We were crying laughing while totally engaged. 

It’s a perfect LA satire and probably the only American Magical Realism film I’ve ever seen (I’m more familiar with the genre coming from Mexico).  Everything is pitch perfect. It’s a tight 91 minutes, edited beautifully, perfect writing from Steve Martin, directed as only I could imagine it and the casting is insane. Every side character and bit part is an amazing character actor from the 90s. 

And the leads are played beautifully by Richard Grant who I know from his performance in Withnail and I. Victoria tennent plays the love interest who is a beautiful actress who got stuck with bad roles most her career, but honestly Sarah Jessica Parker steals the show with her pre-emptive manic pixie dream girl. 

I think this is a movie that although critically acclaimed went over most peoples heads and was forgotten. But I sit here now thinking it’s just leapt to my favorite comedy of all time. It’s so sharp and witty and well executed and magical and of it’s time. I don’t think anyone can argue that Steve Martin is a comedic writing force and it shows in this movie. 

If you haven’t seen it watch it as soon as you can, if you have what do you think about my analysis and how it’s held up and its legacy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

My favorite joke so when Sarah Jessica Parker is trying to seduce Steve Martin and guides his hand down to cup her breast. He squeezes and makes a face and says “your breasts feel weird” and she says “oh, yeah, that’s cause they are real…”

movies,Nutcrackers (2024) starring Ben Stiller ruined my day,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  
  
Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can’t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he’s ruined.
  
It’s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn’t exist. This is one of those times. The movie’s not entertaining, it’s not dramatic, it’s just pointless. I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it’s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time. You’ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

movies,"Were the Detectives at the beginning of ""A Bronx Tale"" Paid off/Fake cops?","Just a thought i Had while rewatching A Bronx Tale at the part where the 2 detectives ask C who the shooter was. I thought it because It's just really strange, Firstly them knowing C was a witness, how would they know that? Did a witness tell them? And if so why didn't they ask THAT witness what they thought rather than the child, furthermore how did that witness know what C's name was? Secondly, they never bring C or Lorenzo to a police station or something that looks more formal, they just line some guys up on the street and ask C who did it, And Thirdly all the suspects were in the mafia. There's more, like how they're both Italian American And It's a very strange way to ask a witness what they thought. As to why the Mafia would do this, It's likely a way to see if they thought C was worthy of becoming a mobster later in life as they've seen him at the bar before looking at sonny, though Sonny wasn't the boss at this point so this might be unlikely, It's also possible this was just to determine if they should kill C or silence him somehow incase the Real police were to ask him. There's some parts that make me think otherwise, like how there is other cops there but they could easily be bribed/fake too, and that mainly, it makes sonny's character look way worse morally but then again he wouldn't be calling the shots at this point and that Mafia dressing up as police is a little silly but has happened before..

movies,In Bruges. Wow.,"So I watched In Bruges and this is really a reddit movie, in a positive way, because it's one of these movies that you can find quoted around here, mainly in big threads, without loads of context, 'cause everyone and their mum but the reader knows where the damn quote originates from.

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

It's darkly comedic and sometimes tragic and it manages both emotions with ease. 

All in all: a fantastic piece of cinema and my personal introduction to the great mind of Martin McDonagh.",Phyliinx,1h4mh25,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4mh25/in_bruges_wow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4mh25/in_bruges_wow/,2024-12-02 04:12:22,756,0.88,756,0,169,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4mh25

movies,I don't get Beau is Afraid. At all.,"Most of the time, even when I like/love a movie, I can tell why someone might disagree (I love Avatar 2, but I agree with like 90% of the criticism and see them as valid). And vice versa, even if I hate something, I can usually tell why someone might like it (Infinity Pool was hot garbage to me, but I can see where somebody can be enthralled by the premise). I cannot do that with Beau is Afraid. It's just pure ass to me. Spoilers ahead.

The plot boils down to ""A controlling mother orchestrates her son's (Beau's) journey back home, torturing him every step of the way, only to kill him in the end"". This movie is noted as an absurdist black comedy- on its Wikipedia, so this isn't my perspective-, but it's not funny. I've literally laughed more watching Saw movies. I get dark humor, but dark humor has to have a proper target. There's no rocket science. It's a two-step process: remove sympathy for the target, then hurt them in unexpected ways. Beau is Afraid seemed to have skipped step one, so it feels like watching someone drown a sack of puppies for two hours.

And the ""absurdist' angle doesn't work either. First off, all of the absurdity except for maybe the penis monster is mundane. The disparity between the scenes and reality are a light parody filter at-best. Characters weren't outrageous, they were just caricatures; I could easily see all of them in a GTA cutscene. Not old wacky GTA, but new, exaggerated-shitty-realistic GTA. Secondly, even that level of absurdity is watered down by the reveal that the mother's been orchestrating everything. Suddenly, the scenes like everything at the doctor's house and the time where everyone walked into his apartment complex become fully explained and there's no absurdity to it at all. I'll admit, the penis monster is a surprise, but it's a surprise 1:30 into the movie; it's a little late to try to establish the genre you claim to be. 

I'm not 100% hating 100% of its aspects. Visually, it has its moments, and the acting is fine, too, but good visuals and solid performances can't cover for shit writing and a hollow premise

movies,Trying to figure out a movie title,"Ok so it's a horror/comedy about an asian(?) Burglar and his girlfriend who work with 1 or 2 others.  The beginning of the movie has the main character arrested during a botched job.  Either he goes to jail or can't get in trouble again without going to jail...but he needs money for a debt I believe.  His girlfriend convinces him to take 1 last job with 1 goofy really tall burglar who's sort of a gangsta asian dude maybe he was her brother?  So they break into a guy's house and find a woman chained in the basement and then they free her.  I remember the twist at the endingish being that it was her kink to be chained down there and she was with the killer home owner all along.  
It was a very similar movie to the collector series,  that war veteran movie where the kids break in, but for the life of my I can't find the name anywhere online from Google searches.  It was kind of low budget....legit hilarious at times and really well made I feel like for it's budget.
Anyone have any clue wtf I'm talking about?
For some reason I feel like the cover of the movie had artwork with a green background like lime green maybe.

movies,Krazy House (2024) is insane (for fans of Kevin Can F*** Himself),"Set in 1990, Krazy House starts as a typical late-80’s, early 90’s sitcom called The Christians that looks like an amalgamation of both Married with Children and King of Queens. Like those shows, it’s filmed in front of a live studio audience and starts out in a very light hearted, goofy way. Bernie Christian, the matriarch of the family, is juggling his faith and his family. He’s the stereotypical Kevin James kind of protagonist who means well, but continuously causes more problems than he’s solving. When he’s not falling down the stairs (much to the delight of the studio audience), he’s breaking everything that isn’t nailed down, much to the chagrin of his modern, breadwinning wife, Eva. His indifferent, gum smacking daughter Sarah and son Adam, a burgeoning scientist, are opportunities for life lessons about being good people and looking towards the lord. Sounds like the perfect setup for a religious TV show for those times; you know the type - a character walks through the front door and the crowd goes wild?

However, when a trio of Russian handymen show up at the door, things take a turn…and the studio audience doesn’t pop for them. See, Bernie has (as he usually does), caused a mess in the kitchen. His stew bubbles over and he messes up the sink, adding to the kitchen destruction he caused earlier when his arm caught on fire and he lit up the wall. After initially dismissing the Russians, he lets them in to fix the problem…but the problems at the Christian house have only just begun. Once the Russians are in, the show takes an insanely dark turn and it only gets more bonkers from there. While the film starts as a deconstruction of the nuclear family sitcom, it ends as a bloody mess where no one is safe.

This one is for fans of absurd horror/comedies or things skewering nostalgic TV (Late Night with the Devil, Kevin Can F\*\*\* Himself).

movies,Favorite movie by european country: San Marino,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Russia. I'm not really sure, if I offended people here, but I did get quite a few downvotes for it. Fortunately, I also got some very good film suggestions (I would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants again) and we also have a winner: ***Сталкер*** (engl. Stalker), a movie by the legendary Andrei Tarkovsky, will receive the next entry in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Today, I know, that it will become much harder to just find a fitting movie, but following the alphabetical order, we move to the next letter - and this time, there are many countries waiting for us that start with an S - an S like **San Marino**, for example. And everytime there will be only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Jim Carreys Grinch is the Definitive adaptation. Yeah I said it.,"Rewatched the Jim Carrey Grinch movie tonight. Idc what anyone says, this is the definitive version of the story. Don't get me wrong, the original animated short is a classic and always will be, but the Jim Carrey version will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the only Dr. Seuss film that updates the original story, while still sticking true to what the original book standed for, if not enhances it.

Not to mention the set design is absolutely phenomenal, and Jim Carrey as The Grinch is everything. Not just the makeup work, which is also phenomenal, but his performance as well. Unlike Mike Myers Cat in the Hat, who was just phoning it in to the point where it felt like he didn't even want to be there, Jim Carrey put 110% into his performance, he almost became one with the suit and captured the character perfect, while still adding his own energenic flair that Carrey is known for.

It's not perfect, not all the jokes land, I could do without seeing Grinch's face in....um......Melons, and while ""Where are you Christmas"" Is a beautiful song, in the context of the film, it feels out of place, especially since it's not a musical. But overall, I absolutely love this underrated classic, and I'm glad it's finally getting the recognition it deserves. Especially after the shit piece from Illumination. I hope we one day get live action Dr. Seuss films again, as long as they are like this one.",darrylthedudeWayne,1h65k6b,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65k6b/jim_carreys_grinch_is_the_definitive_adaptation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65k6b/jim_carreys_grinch_is_the_definitive_adaptation/,2024-12-04 02:36:02,0,0.37,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h65k6b

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",PresentRevenue1347,1h4lwrm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,2024-12-02 03:41:52,146,0.75,146,0,107,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4lwrm

movies,has joe biden ever commented on greg kinnear's portrayal of him in confirmation?,"in 2016, HBO aired the movie confirmation, a movie about the clarence thomas congressional hearings. although it's not among the most famous HBO original movies, the film was acclaimed when it was aired and was even nominated for a few awards. the film has also made several lists of the best HBO original films, which considering their filmography is no easy feat.

in my opinion, one of the best things about the movie is the performances. of course, you have kerry washington and wendell price as anita hill and clarence thomas respectively. however, another important character is joe biden since he's the one who oversaw the hearings. in the film, biden is portrayed by greg kinnear and he gives a really stellar performance in my opinion. not only is he a dead ringer for a young joe biden but he captures his mannerisms and voice perfectly. kinnear captures the essence of biden without dipping into parody and, as a result, gives one of his best performances in my opinion.

it is not uncommon for real life people who are still alive when biopics are made about them to comment on their portrayals. i'm kind of curious if joe biden himself had anything to say about kinnear's performance. does anyone know if biden has ever commented on kinnear's portrayal of him or the movie in general? i mean, the clarence thomas hearings are a pretty significant part of biden's legacy so there's no way that he isn't aware of the movie.",herequeerandgreat,1h5t9go,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,2024-12-03 17:46:31,0,0.17,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5t9go

movies,"""Slowly spiraling downward into destruction"" films","I love films where we watch people's lives fall apart at the seams as their inner flaws and bad choices gradually bear fruit. Done best when a small group of family members or friends dip their toes into crime and are unable to handle the consequences. Call it schadenfreude or just the pleasure of watching someone else's life go worse than mine.

Classics of the genre:

Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.

A Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).

The Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.

Honorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.

movies,Fracture (2007) SPOILERS,"Just seen 2007 Fracture starring Anthony Hopkins for the first time. Great movie until the ending which in my eyes completely ruined the brilliance of the film.

I cannot make sense of the ending and wonder if I am missing something?

1. Firstly, surely all the bullet in his wife's head does is proves Nunally's gun was the murder weapon. There is still nothing linking Crawford to Nunally's gun as it is mentioned in the film that the hotel camera footage has no face. 

2. Also, they switched the shells in the evidence locker so would the gun even match anymore? 

3. The double jeopardy also is very questionable. As I understand it, the case is still substantially the same so Crawford would still not be able to be tried again. 

4. Would any evidence collected in Crawford's house at the end not be void due to the restraining order? Beachum should not be there in the first place and it is essentially breaking and entering as he goes through Crawford's belongings to get the gun.

Great shame as I would have given the film a 9 up to the end which seems to completely ruin the rest of the film.

movies,"People, please stop theorizing that Creeper from Jeepers Creepers is a Mayan God, as an answer to the question of what the Creeper really is. ","It bothers me to this day that people repeatedly put forth the Mayan God theory as an origin story of the Creeper as if the idea of Mayans worshipping the creature informs us as to its true nature. Unless ancient Mayans had the power by worship to physically cause or manifest the thing itself that was to be worshipped, then it's not a helpful explanation of its origin. 

The Creeper must have existed before or independently of the Mayans and therefore is not elementally a Mayan God.  Them possibly worshipping it explains nothing, much like any pagan civilization worshipping the sun in the sky does nothing to explain its formation. 

 When most people ask, what is the Creeper, we are looking for theories on how and when and why it came into existence. Was it naturally birthed? Intelligently designed? Is it of earthly origins? Extraterrestrial? Obviously, we don't have any answer, only guesses. But just saying it's a Mayan God is uninformative.

Before someone says it yes, i could understand it. It is not the great plot twist that it is made out to be, the plot twist is quite literally forced down your throat in the last 30 minutes. I get the first 2 hours is meant to be dream like and yes it did feel dream like, it also felt like complete wank. Every half an hour i’d tell myself “it’s going to get better” it didn’t. 
Obviously i’m in the minority with my dislike towards the film so i’m not going to act like i’m completely correct but i feel like most people force themselves to like the film because of its concept and because it’s meant to be confusing, when in reality it isn’t. 
It was all a dream. Okay? NICE, i’m pretty sure i utilised that plot twist when i was 11 and in primary school. 

Edit: 
I realised that i framed my entire dislike about the film around the fact i didn’t think the plot twist was stupendously confusing, i want it to be apparent that that’s not my main reason for disliking the film, it probably came out this way because the majority of praise i see for the film always surrounds this idea of confusion. This is ofcourse not my main reason for disliking the film, that’d be silly, i just couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it.

movies,The Three Musketeers/D’Artagnan,"This is the 2023 French production… I was interested because of Eva Green as “MiLady”.    The reliable Vincent Cassel is “Athos”.

They went for the dirty and gritty look for this one, no colorful costumes for our heroes.   Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  

We all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.
So I wonder… Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   

I can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale…. But I found this rather jarring.

movies,Everything Everywhere All At Once ending questions [SPOILERS],"I rewatched the movie again the other day and I was left with some questions about the ending that I don't know if there are implied answers, definitive answers, or ""idk it doesn't really matter"" answers.

1. Alpha Waymond said early on that you had to resist the temptation to have extended stays in other dimensions otherwise you introduce paradox. But doesn't the movie end with Evelyn in another dimension? Her original dimension is the one where she doesn't go home from the IRS, punches Deirdre, the IRS has been basically destroyed, there's a lot of murder, Waymond is aware of raccoon-Waymond and raccoon-Joy, and Eveyln pulls Alpha-Joy out of the bagel. As the movie ends, we transition to a dimension where she DID go home, she has the breakdown in the laundromat, Dierdre tells the police to let her go, they relate to each other because of the divorce papers, then she has that last emotional talk with Joy at the car. I can't tell if it is implying that Evelyn is staying in this alternative dimension, or if her original one is still ""active"" for her and she probably goes to jail after all the verse-jumpers (Alpha gong-gong, alpha-Joy, alpha diedre, etc) leave that dimension.

2. When Evelyn is having that talk reconcile with Joy at the car at the end of the movie, is it with HER Joy, or the Jobu Tupaki Alpha-Joy? It's clear in that universe that Alpha-Joy is taking over that universe's Joy quite often, and the speech carries references to other events in the movie and she's shown to be talking with Alpha-Joy in all of the other dimensions too. There's so much emotion flowing in that scene from Joy that I can't tell if Evelyn is reconciling with HER Joy, or Alpha-Joy.",turn_for_do,1h50eme,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,2024-12-02 17:28:44,0,0.38,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Question,spoiler,t3_1h50eme

* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.

movies,Me Before You (2016) Discussion,"Watched for the first time last night

The real standout to me was that all the characters seemed extremely relatable and understandable

I got a really gross feeling when it was clear there was emotional cheating going on, yet I still found myself rooting for the main actors. Even until the end, I wished she had broken it off with her boyfriend before moving on, but I couldn't help but wish her and Will would spend their last moments together

It was nice to see a movie, especially knowing this was made in 2016 tackle assisted suicide so well in my opinion. Will had resigned his life, but still provided 6 months to his parents for things to turn around. His parents fought on both sides to help and stop him. Louisa's mum also was vehemtly against it and didn't want her daughter being involved as she knew this would upset her

My favourite scene overall was Louisa coming home to nod her head ""no"" towards her sister. I've had situation that resulted in a near identical scene and I knew how much that would've hurt

I really enjoyed all the characters and the few bits of humour sprinkled throughout. The scenes were all engaging that what was originally ""I'm juat gonna sit here, you watch what you want"", turned into me glued to the screen after the first minute

Overall, I don't think this movie has any real flaws and I'd consider it a 10/10. I was very surprised I had never heard of this one and even more surprised to see the bad reception regarding the assisted suicide topic. I do wonder how I would've felt had I watched it in 2016

movies,Most Fitting Movie for Each Month,"Haven’t seen a post like this, so I figured I’d make one.

What are the most fitting movies for each of the 12 months of the year? Which movies best fit the vibes and aesthetics of each month? Thought this might be an interesting discussion.

January: Something grim and desolate like Fargo would fit pretty good, wintery and cold and all

February: Equally as cold and miserable, but with the added benefit of Valentines Day. Some sort of romance movie with a wintery theme would fit here, especially if set on Valentines Day. Groundhog Day is also a strong contender.

March-April: No specific ideas, these blend together for me. Movies about spring would fit for all of both.

May: Still springtime, but also end-of-school and graduation, so any moviess about graduating or school letting out would fit.

June-Aug: These blend together for me. Plenty of summer movies, but not necessarily specific to a month. I will say, August also has back to school as a potential setting or theme, and I personally associate that month with dreary, overbearing heat and fatigue, the kind of visuals heavily present in the film Falling Down

September: School is fully back in swing, and I would lean towards placing a High School movie or something here.

October: There’s plenty of Halloween movies, but it would have to be one that celebrates fall and the month of October more so than just being scary. The miniseries Over the Garden Wall Would Fit, not sure of other examples 

November: Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be the easy choice for Thanksgiving, but I do wonder if there are any other films that would fire better.

December: There’s a litany of holiday movies of course, but out of all of them there’s have to be one that embodies the month as a whole and not just Christmas time. A plot incorporating the advent season might work, like Christmas Vacation, or a film that incorporates New Years.

I’m struggling with examples here, so I’d be excited to hear what others think",Bonobowl,1h4nfj0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,2024-12-02 05:05:55,1,0.52,1,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4nfj0

movies,What do you think of the women characters in John McTiernan's films?,"Hi everyone,

John McTiernan is one of the legends of action cinema, known for iconic movies like *Die Hard*, *Predator*, and *Last action Hero*. His movies are packed with high-stakes tension, larger-than-life heroes, and explosive action, but what about the women in these stories? I’d love to hear your thoughts on how they’re portrayed!

Here are a few women in his films that stand out to me:

* **Holly Gennaro McClane (*****Die Hard*****)**: She’s a career-driven, no-nonsense woman who also happens to be at the heart of John McClane’s emotional journey. Her strength comes across in the way she handles Hans Gruber and leads the hostages, but do you think she’s given enough agency beyond being someone for John to save?
* **Anna (*****Predator*****)**: At first, Anna seems like a typical prisoner-of-war character, but she becomes a key figure in unraveling the Predator’s backstory. She provides a voice for her people and their legends. Does her role feel substantial, or does it fall into the trope of the ""exotic other""?
* **Virginia Baker (*****The Thomas Crown Affair*****)**: Rene Russo’s character is sharp, confident, and undeniably one of McTiernan’s most complex women. She’s Thomas Crown’s equal, which is rare in movies like this. Does she break the mold of how women are portrayed in action/thrillers?
* **Whitney and Irene (*****Last Action Hero*****)**: This movie pokes fun at action clichés, and it’s fun to see the ""screaming damsel"" and ""grounded working-class mom"" tropes being played for laughs. What do you think McTiernan was trying to say about female characters in action films here?

I know McTiernan’s films are heavily focused on their male leads, but I’m curious—do you think the women in his movies hold their own? Which characters stand out to you, and which feel underdeveloped?

movies,Unique Animated Films for Family,"What are some unique and lesser known animated films for family and kids? Stuff similar to Studio Ghibli movies or the examples I've listed below. Looking for good stories, unique presentation, distinct visual style, etc. Characters should not have heavy attitudes or behavioral problems. Lesser known animated films.

Bad Examples: I did not like 'The Boy and The Beast' because it starts out with the kid full of anger expressing how much he hates everything and everyone. Not something I'd want my kid to watch. Poupelle of Chimney Town starts off with a terribly loud and annoying musical scene.

Good Examples:

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

Long Way North

April and the Extraordinary World

Sirocco and the Kingdom of Winds

Kensuke's Kingdom

Big Fish and Begonia

Wolfwalkers

The Secret of Kells

Song of the Sea

My Father's Dragon

The Magician's Elephant

Eleanor's Secret

Sea Beast


These classic animated films:

Treasure Planet

Atlantis

Road to El Dorado

Titan A.E.

The Iron Giant

Prince of Egypt

Films like Encanto, Moana, Rayaa, etc. are all very good but are not exactly underrated films.


Any recommendations similar to those above?
