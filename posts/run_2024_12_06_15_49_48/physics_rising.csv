Physics,Resources for Numerical Condensed Matter?,"I was wondering where can I find some resources (books, websites etc) for numerics in condensed matter?  I find that in undergrad usually the focus is on numerically solving differential equations, but often in condensed matter we're looking at algebraic equations and solving those.  I thought it could be useful for people to have some resources on the numerical methods used.  I'm mainly thinking of things like the Anderson model and graphene, as well as quantum computational methods such as VQE and methods for setting up a system in a quantum computer, but I'd be interested in finding out more about different aspects of numerics which focus on the algebraic aspects of condensed matter!",redcrazyguy,1h807ns,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h807ns/resources_for_numerical_condensed_matter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h807ns/resources_for_numerical_condensed_matter/,2024-12-06 12:26:10,15,0.91,15,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h807ns

Physics,How come tin foil or aluminum is commonly used in extreme cold situations? Doesn’t it dissipates heat?,So I understand the principle of a blanket keeping you warm since it traps the heat you generate. I understand as well that aluminum foil doesn’t let any air come out (so would a garbage bag) but isn’t aluminum used as a heat dissipation for electronics? How are these principles coherent with each other? Would a garbage bag be better at trapping heat since it’s plástic isolates you better than any metal conductor would?,PanchoZansa,1h7t9r9,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h7t9r9/how_come_tin_foil_or_aluminum_is_commonly_used_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h7t9r9/how_come_tin_foil_or_aluminum_is_commonly_used_in/,2024-12-06 04:35:50,19,0.67,19,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h7t9r9

Physics,Information trade while moving at near light speed,"When moving at very high speeds, time slows down. What happens when something travelling at such speeds trades information in real time with something not at such speeds?

For example: imagine we create a two item system: one is a stationary center, capable of trading information with the second item, which is a probe that travels in orbit of the center, so the probe is at a constant distance from the center. Let's say the center is also a Bluetooth music player and the probe can connect to it and send audio signals for it to play.

1st experiment: The probe, while stationary, starts to send a song for the center to play, which it does normally. Then the probe starts to accelerate, getting increasingly closer to the speed of light. What happens with the song being played by the center? (We are observing the center, while stationary)

2nd experiment: let's say we replace the probe with a small spaceship and we are inside it, initially without moving. The spaceship receives a signal from the center with songs and play them for us. Say the songs played are radio songs from the US. Then the spaceship starts to accelerate to NLS. What happens with the songs we are listening to? 


If in the second experiment we listen to years of musical development, could that mean we could put someone that's terminally I'll in a light speed moving spaceship at orbit until we discover a solution for their illness?",vinicius_h,1h811pk,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h811pk/information_trade_while_moving_at_near_light_speed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h811pk/information_trade_while_moving_at_near_light_speed/,2024-12-06 13:12:45,1,0.55,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h811pk
