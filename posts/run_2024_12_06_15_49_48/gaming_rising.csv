gaming,What games can you play as hulk? My son wants a hulk video game. ,My 5 year old wrote “hulk video game” on his Santa list. They haven’t made a hulk specific game in awhile. I was thinking either Lego avengers or Lego super hero’s but I’m not clear which you can actually play as hulk or what’s better. He’s on the cover of both. We have a switch and an Xbox series x in terms of systems.

gaming,Initial Marvel Rival Thoughts?,"I’ve only put about 3-4 hours into Marvel Rivals last night, so it’s still really early, and I don’t have any real definitive opinions yet.

But my initial thoughts are more so about how great of an initial “free to play, GaaS package” this game is starting out as.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs. 

Overall I’m pretty positive on Rivals for now.
