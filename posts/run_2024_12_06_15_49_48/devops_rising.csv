devops,Rant DevOps and SRE Part 2,"When my colleagues and I joined a multinational corp a few years ago, one of the first hurdles we faced was figuring out how to access their internal network to contribute to the codebase. Installing a VPN on our personal devices wasn’t an option, so we were given two choices: get corporate-issued laptops with a pre-installed VPN or use virtual machines inside their network that we could access remotely from our own devices.  
Since the issued laptops all ran Windows and none of us were exactly fans of it, we opted for the VM option. Personally, I wanted to stick with Linux and avoid the nightmare of juggling two work laptops, especially since I already needed one for other customers.

The company set us up with Citrix Workspace to access the VMs, and honestly, it worked like a dream. The connection was stable, latency was low, and we had great quality-of-life features like multi-monitor support, a bilateral clipboard between the VM and host OS, and even seamless keyboard shortcuts inside the VM. For two years, it was smooth sailing.

The connection was stable, latency was low, and we had great quality-of-life features like multi-monitor support, a bilateral clipboard between the VM and host OS, and even seamless keyboard shortcuts inside the VM. For two years, it was smooth sailing.  
Then came the bombshell: the company announced they were shutting down the Citrix infrastructure and moving to Microsoft Remote Desktop. At first, we thought it wouldn’t be a big deal. But then we realized that while RDP has native clients for Windows and Mac, it offers nothing official for Linux.  
Then came the bombshell: the company announced they were shutting down the Citrix infrastructure and moving to RDP. At first, we thought it wouldn’t be a big deal. But then we learned that we actually had to use not just any RDP client (like the Ubuntu-native Remmina), but the Microsoft Remote Desktop app, which leverages the native RDP client on Windows and Mac that isn't present on Linux.  
This is where things started to fall apart. My colleague on Mac was able to install the RDP client and connect without much trouble. I decided to dual-boot Windows so I could keep using multi-monitor setups, even though it added an annoying layer of inefficiency to my workflow. But our third teammate, who stayed on Linux, was stuck with the RDP web client. That thing is a nightmare—slow, clunky, and missing basic features like multi-monitor support.

The overall experience has been a huge downgrade. RDP connections aren’t as stable as Citrix, and most of the little conveniences we’d taken for granted are gone. Personally, I’m managing to limp along with my dual-boot setup, but I can’t imagine how much worse it must be for my Linux-only colleague.  
The overall experience has been a huge downgrade. RDP connections aren’t as stable as Citrix, and most of the little conveniences we’d taken for granted are gone. Even the keyboard shortcuts and bilateral clipboard, which are supported by the app, have been forcibly disabled. Personally, I’m managing to limp along with my dual-boot setup, but I can’t imagine how much worse it must be for my Linux-only colleague.  
For some of the developers on our team, there’s a workaround: they write code on their local machines, upload it to the VM, and commit from there. But as an SRE, I don’t have that luxury. My work revolves around managing CI/CD pipelines and deployments, which means I have to do everything inside the VM.

devops,How we handle Terraform downstream dependencies without additional frameworks,"Hi, founder of Anyshift here. We've build a solution for handling issues with Terraform downstream dependencies without additional frameworks (mono or multirepos), and wanted to explain how we've done it.

**1.First of all, the key problems we wanted to tackle:**

* Handling hardcoded values
* Handling remote state dependencies
* Handling intricate modules (public + private)
* we knew that it was possible to do it without adding additional frameworks, by going through the Terraform State Files.

**2.Key Assumptions:**

* Your infra is a graph. To model the infrastructure accurately, we used Neo4j to capture relationships between resources, states, and modules.
* All the information you need is within your cloud and code: By parsing both, we could recreate the chain of dependencies and insights without additional overhead.
* Our goal was to build a digital twin of the infrastructure. Encompassing code, state, and cloud information to surface and prevent issues early.

**3.Our solution:**

To handle downstream dependencies we are :

1. Creating a digital twin of the infra with all the dependencies between IaC code and cloud
2. For each PR, querying this graph with Cypher (Neo4J query language) to retrieve those dependencies

**-&gt; Build an up-to-date Cloud-to-Code graph**

i - Understanding Terraform Stat Files

Terraform state files are super rich in term of information, way more than the files. They hold the exact state of deployed resources, including:

* Resource types
* Unique identifiers
* Relationships between modules and their resources

By parsing these state files, we could unify insights across multiple repositories and environments. They acted as a bridge between code-defined intentions and cloud-deployed realities. By parsing these state files, we could unify insights across multiple repositories and environments. They acted as a bridge between code-defined intentions and cloud-deployed realities.

ii- Building this graph using Neo4J

Neo4j allowed us to model complex relationships natively. Unlike relational databases, graph databases are better suited for interconnected data like infrastructure resources.

We modeled infrastructure as nodes (e.g., EC2 instances, VPCs) and relationships (e.g., ""CONNECTED\_TO,"" ""IN\_REGION""). For example:

* Nodes: Represent resources like an EC2 instance or a Security Group.
* Relationships: Define how resources interact, such as an EC2 instance being attached to a Security Group.

iii- Extracting and Reconciling Data

We developed services to parse state files from multiple repositories, extracting relevant data like resource definitions, unique IDs, and relationships. Once extracted, we reconciled:

* Resources from code with resources in the cloud.
* Dependencies across repositories, resolving naming conflicts and overlaps.

We also labeled nodes to differentiate between sources (e.g., TF\_CODE, TF\_STATE) for a clear picture of infrastructure intent vs. reality.

**-&gt; Query this graph to retrieve the dependencies before a change**

Once the graph is built, we use Cypher, Neo4j's query language, to answer questions about the infrastructure downstream dependencies.

Step 1 : Make a change

We make a change on resource or a module. For instance expanding an IP range in a VPC CIDR.

Step 2 : Cypher query

We're going query the graph of dependencies through different cypher queries to see which downstream dependencies will be affected by this change, potentially in other IaC repositories. For instance this change can affect 2 ECS and 1 security group.

Step 3 : Give back the info in the PR

**4. Current limitations:**

* To handle all the use cases, we are limited by the Cypher queries we define. We want to make it as generic as possible.
* It only works with Terraform, and not other IaC frameworks (could work with Pulumi though)
