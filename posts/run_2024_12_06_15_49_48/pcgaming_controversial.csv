pcgaming,"I'm working on a new game ""Roguebound Pirates"", inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates! If you've played Pirates!, I would love to hear what your favorite features were in it.","I was thinking about new game ideas and somehow I always kept going back to nostalgic memories of playing Sid Meier's Pirates! I feel like there hasn't been a similar game since, so why not make my own and try to scratch that same itch?

I'm trying to strike a good balance between making my game unique (for example my game will have a focus on deep ship customization by letting the player have full control over what kind of weapons &amp; equipment the ship has and where they are placed) and still scratching that nostalgic Pirates! itch. To help with this, I would love to hear what you enjoy the most in Pirates! Hopefully I can add those features/aspects to my game also.

If you are interested in the project, I just opened a Steam page for it:
