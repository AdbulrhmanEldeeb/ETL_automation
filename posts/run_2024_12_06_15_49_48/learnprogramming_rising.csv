learnprogramming,I ask 'why' too often and always end up in rabbit holes making me feel inadequate,"I am a programming student for 4 years now and i still feel like i lack basic knowledge. I made an .NET API which uses signalR for realtime communication, Docker to containerize it, and MongoDb as database. I use onion architecture to connect everything together. I feel like those things are somewhat more advanced topics, but at the same time i feel like i dont understand the depth of it. I know the abstracts and why to use them, but i wouldn't be able to create it without the use of Google.   
  
An example was creating the db connection. Those are two lines of the code i used:  
`var settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(connectionString);`

`_client = new MongoClient(settings);`  
It gets a connection string from the methods params, and creates ClientSettings. Then is creates a new MongoClient with those settings. This is when i ask 'why?' as in 'why do i need to create a settings object?', 'why do i need a MongoClient?' et cetera. The answer to those questions dont really matter for further developing. Trying to understand those 'why's' I always end up in rabbit holes to the point i just accept that this is how it has to be done. But this makes me feel inadequate because i feel like im supposed to know 'why'. 

Im not looking for an actual answer to the example above. I'm interested how others handle situations where thing become a bit more complex when you question it.   
  
I kinda have this mentality: ""To drive a car you dont need to know how a car works internally you only need to know how to use it."". Do you think this is how you should approach coding as wel?

I’m a fullstack software engineer with 10 years of experience. I’m comfortable with coding, but I always get stuck when it comes to web design (devs, you know what I mean).

I don’t aim to become an expert, but I want to be self-sufficient in web design as quickly as possible. How would you achieve this goal? Any recommendations for YouTube channels, books, or other resources?

learnprogramming,Should I Get An AA In CS Or Self Teach? ,"Hey guys, so pretty much what the titile says. I want to get a job as a software developer.

(I know the market sucks right now but it can’t last forever)

I don’t have any experience in tech or coding. I was just thinking about going down the self taught route but i was looking at some courses I could take at my community college that i graduated from a few years ago and saw that I can pretty much get an AA in computer science in 3 semesters due to me already completing all of my gen-eds and electives. 

My question is, is it worth going for an AA for this or just stick to self teaching and maybe a boot camp? 

Would me having this associates degree look good for getting a job?

learnprogramming,Should I continue learning game dev?,"I'm a high school student that has been interested in programming video games since I was around 7-8, but I've only recently been actually trying to get into it, outside of messing around and learning Scratch &amp; Tynker when I was younger. I was originally learning Godot and the GDScript that came with it, however I've heard Godot isn't exactly a good engine for landing jobs. I've also heard that game development doesn't pay as much as something like web dev alongside being more stressful and unstable, so I've been wondering if I should look at other careers like web development, mobile app development, ect.

Also would python be a good language to learn that's applicable to a lot of careers? I liked GDScript a lot and apparently python is very similar to it.

I am really interested in game development but I would like your takes and some advice.",PotPotted,1h7tb3p,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7tb3p/should_i_continue_learning_game_dev/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7tb3p/should_i_continue_learning_game_dev/,2024-12-06 04:38:04,6,0.72,6,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h7tb3p
learnprogramming,When it starts to get hard I often ask. ,"Thank you for any feed back

TLDR

1. Is there still opportunity/ Job security? 

2. Is it worth all the effort to learn it ? 

3. Is there really a lot of age discrimination? 

I have been leaning coding for a bit now, and everytime it starts to get really hard I ask myself am I just wasting my time anyway? I love the idea of being able to build whatever I need for home use, but as far as a career 

Things I keep hearing 

It's so hard to get a job just to be laid off a few months later.

projects to learn coding that would give med school a run for its money. 

If you are in your 30s which I am you are considered unable to keep up. 

  
are these legitament concerns or is it just the loud minority?

So I'm learning PHP/Laravel/Blade.

For now, I created Supplements project, with CRUD / Auth.

Edit: [https://i.imgur.com/sx0NyFS.png](https://i.imgur.com/sx0NyFS.png)

I'm also going to work with Vue in the future.  
I will create Pizza Management System:

Order:  
\- Employee puts customer's number on first ""page""  
\- Then he will be able to see data about the customer (or even fast order as last the one), edit/create new address  
\- Then he will be able to mention how many pizzas  
\- Then he will be able to apply slices amount and toppins (for example onions on 2 slices)  
\- Then he will be asked to ""pay"" (will just click continue cuz it is not real)  
\- Then the order will be move to ""in progress"" and there will be able to put ""On Delivery""

Roles:  
\- Employee - will be able to create orders, update status  
\- Manager - has everything as employee, but will be able to CRUD employee

Also, if you have some suggestions I should study, let me know!

One more thing, I found the project in a YouTube tutorial where a Russian guy provided the code. However, he was going too fast, so I understood very little, and he’s also using a different board, not the NODEMCU ESP8266. [Video link below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQAs1E4PgZI).

Altra cosa, il progetto l'ho trovato su un tutorial su youtube dove questo ragazzo russo forniva il codice, tuttavia andando troppo veloce ci ho capito poco e niente e soprattutto usa un'altra scheda e non il NODEMCU esp8266 [Link video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQAs1E4PgZI).

learnprogramming,Cronjobs not working on MacOS Sequoia after 15.1.1 (24B91) update,"I’ve been using `crontab` to run a Python script every 15 minutes, logging the output to a text file. This setup was working fine until December 4, 2024. Here’s the cron job I was using:

`*/15 * * * * /Users/strife/Desktop/daily/.mimu/bin/python3 /Users/strife/Desktop/daily/script.py &gt;&gt; /Users/strife/Desktop/daily/cron.log 2&gt;&amp;1`

On Dec 4, I removed the crontab entry, **but after updating macOS to 15.1.1 (24B91)** this morning, I tried adding the same cron job back (from my backup), but it's no longer working.

Here’s what’s happening:

* After I add the cron job, it shows the message `crontab: installing new crontab`.
* However, the script does not run as expected, and no new logs have been written after Dec 4, 2024.
* I even tried some simple cron jobs like these:

`* * * * * echo ""Hi from Cron"" &gt;&gt; /Users/strife/Desktop/log.txt` and `* * * * * /bin/date &gt;&gt; /Users/strife/Desktop/log.txt`  
but none of them worked either. These scripts do work when I run them manually.

Has anyone else noticed this issue after the macOS 15.1.1 update? Could there be a compatibility issue with cron on this version, or maybe it’s being deprecated altogether?

And I don't want to waste time self-studying something that I'll just re-learn in college, though I know for many of these things prior knowledge is very helpful.
