learnprogramming,Is it possible to build a automated bot that downloads the recent image on Instagram and auto uploads to another web service?,"I primarily use Instagram to follow artists whose work I admire, and I use Pinterest as a platform to create mood boards of the artwork that inspires me. I was wondering if it's possible to develop a bot that can scrape the most recent image from an Instagram account and automatically upload it to a Pinterest board.

I have already built a Pinterest bot using the Selenium framework with Python, which uploads local images from your file path onto a Pinterest board. However, I'd like to enhance it by enabling the bot to download the latest image from an artist’s Instagram account and upload it to my Pinterest board. Ideally, I would like to keep this program running without it stopping (until a curtain issue/bug occurs). I want the program to have some sort of timestamp and check if the Instagram account has uploaded a new image.

I am still quite new to all of this so please give me some advice or recommendations to learn on where I can start.",SniperDragon06,1h7viyl,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7viyl/is_it_possible_to_build_a_automated_bot_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7viyl/is_it_possible_to_build_a_automated_bot_that/,2024-12-06 06:52:48,2,0.6,2,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h7viyl

learnprogramming,How to focus in classes,"Hi everyone,

I'm a student currently learning programming at one of the top schools in my country. I'm doing really well in my programming classes and consider myself one of the best in my group. However, I feel like classes in subjects like biology, chemistry, and geography are a waste of time for me.

The good part is that many of my teachers are pretty chill and don’t mind if I’m on my phone during class. So, I’ve been using that time to focus on programming. I think I'm pretty good in frontend development, and right now, I’m learning Java through MOOC.fi.

The problem is that I can’t focus properly while reading the course material on my phone during class. The teacher talking and the noise from other students make it hard for me to concentrate and fully understand what I’m reading.

TL;DR: How can I stay productive and better understand what I’m learning when reading programming material on my phone during noisy classes?",GladRefrigerator7285,1h7xcm9,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7xcm9/how_to_focus_in_classes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7xcm9/how_to_focus_in_classes/,2024-12-06 09:06:54,1,0.6,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h7xcm9

learnprogramming,I ask 'why' too often and always end up in rabbit holes making me feel inadequate,"I am a programming student for 4 years now and i still feel like i lack basic knowledge. I made an .NET API which uses signalR for realtime communication, Docker to containerize it, and MongoDb as database. I use onion architecture to connect everything together. I feel like those things are somewhat more advanced topics, but at the same time i feel like i dont understand the depth of it. I know the abstracts and why to use them, but i wouldn't be able to create it without the use of Google.   
  
An example was creating the db connection. Those are two lines of the code i used:  
`var settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(connectionString);`

`_client = new MongoClient(settings);`  
It gets a connection string from the methods params, and creates ClientSettings. Then is creates a new MongoClient with those settings. This is when i ask 'why?' as in 'why do i need to create a settings object?', 'why do i need a MongoClient?' et cetera. The answer to those questions dont really matter for further developing. Trying to understand those 'why's' I always end up in rabbit holes to the point i just accept that this is how it has to be done. But this makes me feel inadequate because i feel like im supposed to know 'why'. 

Im not looking for an actual answer to the example above. I'm interested how others handle situations where thing become a bit more complex when you question it.   
  
I kinda have this mentality: ""To drive a car you dont need to know how a car works internally you only need to know how to use it."". Do you think this is how you should approach coding as wel?

COMP 171: Final Exam Study Guide

This study guide notes the topics that will be covered by the exam, and offers some breakdown of the topics into important sub-topics to keep in mind.

For all topics listed, you should be able to write code, understand/trace code, and answer open-ended questions relying on these topics (as you’ve seen on the quizzes).

Design

	•	Important components of software design:
	•	Input, Output, Examples
	•	Domain Knowledge, Algorithm
	•	Know how to write a complete design from a client request.
	•	Design as related to functions (see Testing/Designing Functions).

Creating and Using Variables

Primitive Data Types

	•	int, float, str, bool
	•	How to convert between data types.

Expressions

	•	Math operators: +, -, *, /, //, %
	•	Boolean Expressions:
	•	Getting True or False with ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=.
	•	Combining Booleans with and, or, not.
	•	Order of operations.

Control Structures

	•	if, elif, else statements, while loops.
	•	How these structures make use of Boolean Expressions.
	•	for loop:
	•	range function (1, 2, or 3 arguments).
	•	for loops vs. while loops:
	•	Why choose one over the other.
	•	How to convert between them.
	•	Nested control structures (e.g., if inside while, nested for loops, etc.).

Functions

	•	Calling functions, passing arguments, saving return values.
	•	Built-in functions: print, input, range.
	•	Defining your own functions:
	•	docstrings, parameters, returning values, side effects (see also: collections).
	•	Tracing functions:
	•	Tracing variables, arguments, parameters, return values, and side effects in programs with function calls.

Testing/Designing Functions

	•	Test Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before writing the code for the function.
	•	Tests and function stubs as designs:
	•	docstrings show input/output from functions.
	•	Tests show examples.
	•	Choosing good test cases, writing several different tests to check different behavior.

Strings as Collections

	•	Simple actions to use strings as collections:
	•	Creating, indexing, looping, concatenating.
	•	Using these simple actions to make more complex functions:
	•	find, count, slice, remove, etc.

Lists

	•	Common actions on lists:
	•	Creating, indexing, looping, appending.
	•	Searching for an item in a list (find function).
	•	Indexing to access/change items in lists.
	•	Using a for loop to:
	•	Access/change items in a list.
	•	Passing lists as parameters, and returning lists.
	•	Tracing how lists are stored differently in memory, and the results.
	•	Side effects:
	•	How/why passing lists is different than other data types.
	•	When/how side effects are possible with lists.

Here is the extracted content from the latest image:

2D Collections

	•	2D lists: Lists of lists, lists of strings.
	•	Accessing, creating, changing individual items in 2D lists.

Dictionaries

	•	Putting key-value pairs into dictionaries.
	•	Checking if a key is in a dictionary.
	•	Accessing values with a key from dictionaries.
	•	Iterating through all keys and values in a dictionary.
	•	Side effects on dictionaries.

Lists vs. Dictionaries

	•	When to use a dictionary over a list?
	•	When to use a list over a dictionary?

Reading Information from Files

	•	Opening and closing files.
	•	Getting data from text files using readlines().
	•	Cleaning up data:
	•	Changing strings into lists (split function).
	•	Removing \n.
	•	Turning strings into integers or floats.

(I know the market sucks right now but it can’t last forever)

I don’t have any experience in tech or coding. I was just thinking about going down the self taught route but i was looking at some courses I could take at my community college that i graduated from a few years ago and saw that I can pretty much get an AA in computer science in 3 semesters due to me already completing all of my gen-eds and electives. 

My question is, is it worth going for an AA for this or just stick to self teaching and maybe a boot camp? 

Would me having this associates degree look good for getting a job?

learnprogramming,Connecting to Public Databases,"I have very little coding knowledge, but I have a really interesting idea that I can’t seem to advance further.

I used chat gpt to create a basic user interface using html, css, and js. The interface is essentially a calculator, which uses a user input value and returns a list of calculated values based on other data.

Given my extremely novice knowledge on how all this shit works, I “hard coded” the other data needed for the calculations into the code. This data needs to be updated regularly for the calculations to be accurate, which is a very tedious process, but it is open source data found on the web. I understand there’s a way to automate this, but chat gpt and my online research hasn’t really helped.

Basically, I’m looking for a way to connect a public data source to my code so the most recent data will be used in the calculations. If I understand the process right, I think I need some kind of “crawling”? application to pull the data, a database to store it in, and a function within my html/css/js to call the data into the calculations. So the flow would be:

Public DB -&gt; personal DB (backend static data) -&gt; interface (front end calculated data)

Can anyone help me get started with the right services to try this out on for free? I really don’t know what I’m doing so I can’t justify spending money on some of the services I’ve found, especially since I don’t know if it’s right.

learnprogramming,How do I get started building a “tech portfolio” to show hiring companies once I feel ready? ,"
I am pretty new to all of this and starting from scratch. But quite lost when it comes to the “building my portfolio” realm. 

I am starting off with saving my homework and projects from classes I am taking for free right now. (cannot afford to pay for classes but edx.org is great for this atm.) currently just taking the mere basics: intro to CS, have done basic python, and scratch so far. Then will take intro to prog with python. I’ve done a project for HTML5 already so I’ll be adding that too. 

1) should I save the homework and projects I am doing with the classes I’m taking rn? 

2) how am I able to build a website for free? I see a lot of portfolios have their own domain… how can I do this? 

3) is a “portfolio” basically a domain where you attach all your work in there? If so, how can I make it where all my work is cohesive in there to show candidates once I do finish some classes? 

4) have any of you started from scratch, no degree in CS, but learned the skillset, got your portfolio right, and got entry level positions? 

5) would internships be applicable to me even if I am not enrolled in an institution but rather taking free classes that teaches you how to code? 

Currently using edx.org 

Professor David Malan from Harvard University is teaching these classes. Pre recorded ofc. just in case anyone needs then information. Completely free and pretty much feels like you’ve paid for the course itself. 

6) how would I go about adding these skills? In my resume? Would I be able to add the institution I took it with regardless if I paid for it but am currently enrolled  except it’s free? 

I am pretty lost in this and prob not asking the right questions but I hope I can find some clarity on here. Thank you.

Also I forgot to mention I am in an engineering college so it's not like I am totally disconnected with maths academically . Nowwwww what I need ! , There are tons of Youtube tutorials on how one should proceed and roadmaps (afterall i have to learn from youtube right?) , the reason I am here (again , changed) is to ask what should be the best

1)source

2)roadmap

3)suggestion of language and projects

I umm do not believe there is something best which i would follow and get all einsteined!! but what i need is from y'all experts that a noob like me who can use is hibernating brain and wake it up again and get going into what he really wants. Some other questions which i want to be answered is after this AI effect and all this machine learning being a necessity what should i target from a financial point of view and some good job prospective. I stated above that cs is my passion but to say it in a more broader way about my passion I like Quants , business and shit and programming and AI are like a addon to them which i also like .  It's like years before when i was in the game i had targeted i would do sql , data science , quants and all but now after being brain rotted all these years I have no ffin clue so I am here. :)

PS: Was a fulltime reddit rot (thankfully deleted that) , one of the reasons for downfall , should've controlled . sheeshhhhh not going down the memory lane       past is past , i don't wanna look back and even if i do wanna look back it would be a moment where i think of it as a good time spent posting skibidi memes lol (still got the humor i guess , will continue but not the same way as it was)

Will check all yours suggestions after my sem exams are over (prolly 3 weeks at most) , old me wouldn't had did this but i don't wanna repeat the same mistake of wasting time at time of exams lol which if i utilized i would've been a mod here rather than being a mod for some brain rot meme page ( no hate , laughing is life) .

learnprogramming,Cronjobs not working on MacOS Sequoia after 15.1.1 (24B91) update,"I’ve been using `crontab` to run a Python script every 15 minutes, logging the output to a text file. This setup was working fine until December 4, 2024. Here’s the cron job I was using:

`*/15 * * * * /Users/strife/Desktop/daily/.mimu/bin/python3 /Users/strife/Desktop/daily/script.py &gt;&gt; /Users/strife/Desktop/daily/cron.log 2&gt;&amp;1`

On Dec 4, I removed the crontab entry, **but after updating macOS to 15.1.1 (24B91)** this morning, I tried adding the same cron job back (from my backup), but it's no longer working.

Here’s what’s happening:

* After I add the cron job, it shows the message `crontab: installing new crontab`.
* However, the script does not run as expected, and no new logs have been written after Dec 4, 2024.
* I even tried some simple cron jobs like these:

`* * * * * echo ""Hi from Cron"" &gt;&gt; /Users/strife/Desktop/log.txt` and `* * * * * /bin/date &gt;&gt; /Users/strife/Desktop/log.txt`

learnprogramming,C vs python/webdev,"Hey r/learnprogramming,

I’m a first-year B.Tech student facing a dilemma: Should I focus on mastering C first, or jump straight into Python and web development to start building projects and participating in hackathons?

Here’s where I’m at:

I’ve completed up to Week 3 of CS50x a while ago, but I don’t remember much now. I’ve been considering revisiting it and combining it with K.N. King’s C Programming: A Modern Approach to really solidify my C skills.
However, I’m feeling stuck because I want to participate in hackathons and other events, but I currently don’t have the skills to create projects or implement my ideas.
Many of my friends are already learning Python and web dev (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and are actively participating in events, building projects, and showcasing their work. I’m eager to do the same, but I feel held back because C is not as easy to work with for project-building. I’m struggling to master C as it’s a more complex language compared to Python, and I can’t seem to make as much progress.
On top of this, I have to eventually move to C++ because it’s part of my college curriculum.
So now I’m wondering:

Is it worth the hassle to go back and fully master C through CS50x and K.N. King's book, or should I focus on Python and web dev to get started on projects faster?
If I skip C for now, will that hurt me later when it comes to understanding core programming concepts or low-level development, especially since I have to learn C++?
Is there a way to balance learning C for the long-term with diving into Python or web dev for immediate application and project building?
I’d love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar position. Did learning C first pay off for you in the long run, or would you recommend focusing on Python and web development to get results quicker?

learnprogramming,In the woods and I can't see the trees. Need some help with this CS Lab,"Hello. I've been stuck on this Lab program for my CS course for the past 2 days and I am so deep in the forest I can't see the trees around me anymore.

I was wondering if anyone could take a look and help me determine the issue in my logic for why I am returning the wrong node when I ""check an invalid tree with a right child linking to it's ancestor node.""

Missing code breakdown:

\- The ""Node.java"" file provides the Node class with access to the node value using getData, and the  left and right node values through getLeft and getRight methods.

\- The ""Main.java"" file breaks apart the input through a ""tuple-based"" representation of a binary search tree.

The input looks like this:

(50, (25, None, (60)), (75))

Here, the program would return 60, because that node violates a BST because the node 60 would be on the left side of the tree, and 60 is greater than the root node 50.

           50
       /          \
    25             75
       \
         60
    
    
    
    
    import java.util.*;
    public class BSTChecker {
    public static Node checkBSTValidity(Node rootNode) {
    // helper method with null boundaries and an empty set for ancestors
      return checkBSTHelper(rootNode, null, null, new HashSet&lt;&gt;());
    }
    
    private static Node checkBSTHelper(Node node, Integer nodeMin, Integer nodeMax, Set&lt;Node&gt; ancestors) {
    // base case: if the node is null, the subtree is valid
      if (node == null) {
        return null;
      }
    
    // if node is not null and less than min, then violation and return node
    // or
    // if node is not null and greater than max, then violation and return node
      if ((nodeMin != null &amp;&amp; node.key &lt;= nodeMin) || (nodeMax != null &amp;&amp; node.key &gt;= nodeMax)) {
        return node;
      }
    
    // check ancestor set for violation
      if (ancestors.contains(node)) {
        return node;
      }
    
    // return the current node causing the left child violation
      if (node.left != null &amp;&amp; ancestors.contains(node.left)) {
        return node;
      }
    
    // return the current node causing the right child violation
      if (node.right != null &amp;&amp; ancestors.contains(node.right)) {
        return node;
      }
    // add current node in traversal to ancestor hash set
      ancestors.add(node);
    
    // recusively check left side
      Node leftViolation = checkBSTHelper(node.left, nodeMin, node.key, ancestors);
      
      if (leftViolation != null) {
          return leftViolation;
      }
    
    // recursively check right side
      Node rightViolation = checkBSTHelper(node.right, node.key, nodeMax, ancestors);
    
      if (rightViolation != null) {
        return rightViolation;
      }
    
    // remove node once traversed
      ancestors.remove(node);
    
    // return null if no violation detected in subtree
      return null;
      }
    }

The criteria for this program:

\`\`\`Java  
A violating node X will meet one or more of the following conditions:

* X is in the left subtree of ancestor Y, but X's key is &gt; Y's key
* X is in the right subtree of ancestor Y, but X's key is &lt; Y's key
* X's left or right child references an ancestor

\`\`\`

All of my unit tests pass except # 9, where ""X's left or right child references an ancestor"" is not returning the correct node.

Here are my unit tests:

1: Input

    (10, (20), (30, (29), (31)))

    20

2: Input
