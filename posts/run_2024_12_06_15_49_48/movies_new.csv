movies,I freaking LOVE The Family Stone and do every Christmas. ,"I don’t really understand why, but this movie hits me directly in my happy place. It doesn’t have the greatest reviews, which is a mystery to me, because even if it’s not perfect, it’s got incredible casting, solid plot points, pathos, belly laughs, and mothertucking Luke Wilson. 

First of all, Sarah Jessica Parker plays the neurotic outsider to a T. Birdy, defensive, repressed, insecure, but good deep down, even the cringe fest dinner scene lands because of master performances by her, Craig T, and Diane. There is no way to resist Rachel McAdam’s charms, and she’s in full effect here. Even the tragic subplot works, and the epilogue has me sobbing every year. Just the right balance of zany, touching, and unpredictable (sorry but that’s mostly true). I love it I love it I love it so much.

movies,Die Hard is NOT a Christmas movie. That's just a meme lots of people take WAY too seriously.,"For those of you who haven't attached that joke to the core of their identity, this won't come as a shock but it's nice to hear, right?  It's been what? Eight years or so that the ""Christmas movie"" thing has been an easy joke for the uncreative to parrot as through they thought it up? It was fun for a bit, got some good Brooklyn 99 moments, but it's really tired now. Maybe give it a rest or try it with another movie. Try Batman returns or the Gremlins, Gremlins 2.

It would be awesome if some of THOSE movies could get December screenings at local theaters, and we can make that happen if a large number of people can STOP REGURGITATING AND REDIGESTING THE SAME TIRED JOKE FOREVER...

movies,The Last Samurai: Beyond the Stereotype,"Where do I begin… well this should do it. I think.

To start things off, I’m basically a *newcomer* when it comes to the posting related thingamajigs and stuff. I’d really like to give it a try and share with *you guys* some thoughts concerning a movie which I just watched a week ago or so. 

First, let’s get something straight, I will be giving my personal point of view ‘bout it, so, to be clear, I’m no expert of such or about *‘nothin* in this topic. Just a guy who would like to see what do people think about something *I feel* is *worth* talking about. 

*Let’s cut to the point*, which is: The Last Samurai - released back in 2003. **This film is-a-masterpiece**, and oh man, there is *no room to doubt*, I can assure you that it is. It comes from a time when them films had to convey a meaning. When they were actually good. If they didn’t have that little something, people simply wouldn’t take the bait. Anyway, enough of this babbling, let’s get to the real deal.

***Honor.*** 

*The whole film* \- is about honor. On paper, honestly, if I hadn’t seen the film, and was presented with this as the backbone of the movie, I would have sold in without doubt. Itself, *it already encompasses various other values it wishes to transmit.* **Furthermore**, when people argue about it being the same old *“white-saviour”* type of Hollywood movie, I just laugh in disbelief because *it’s clearly not.* Unlike those based and outdated narratives, this film actually challenges stereotypes and places the focus on a white man named Nathan Algren, who is clearly, a troubled man. *The Samurai help him,* then he returns the favour *in some ways.*

The whole point of the movie being a story revolving around the white guy, is so that people identify with him, in a sense that he’s also another person who doesn’t know anything about *Samurai ways*. Throughout its entire course, the audience is positioned behind the screens to follow a character which they understand, relate to and seeing him empathize with *Katsumoto* and his people makes it easier for us to follow. It would have been much complicated to use of the foreigners as the main actors in the role - this is not racism, it’s just more logical, that’s all. All the better, join that with *Tom Cruise’s performance* on the film, whether you like him as actor or not, he’s great, and that’s just ‘cause he tends to believe he’s the main character in the world, and in this movie, *he is.* 

&gt;\[…\] *“And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds. Others, that he returned to his own country.""*

&gt;*""But I like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace, that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""*  \[…\]

I hope you liked it guys and if you’d like to ask any questions, feel free to reply down below. Also, down-votes and upvotes are accepted, as long as you spark interest in a discussion, it’s okay, don’t mind me, express your opinion and fuck what other people think!!

I hope there will be a sequel, it has the opportunity for it. Even though it was revealed Clyde dug out tunnels and shit, it didn't really show it was actually Clyde. I hope he really had an accomplice, or a copycat that fights for the same thing as him. There's a possibility for a sequel on this character, which the story goes on the way of a cycle, the same thing that happened to Clyde's family, happened to Nick's, but it's the accomplice of Clyde, instead of random murderers.

movies,Cruising (1980): Reoccurring character ,"Hi everybody - long time reader, first time poster here!

I just saw 1980s Cruising yesterday and it really stuck with me: The intense atmosphere of NYC underground in the late 70s, the rawness of the SM gay community, and the constant ambiguity of the plot and characters.

Also, very interesting performance by Al Pacino, who you can really see evolve in his role, as his character does during the movie.

I know that Friedkin assigned different roles to the same actors to add to the ambiguity of the movie, however I noticed one of them in particular in completely different roles: A slightly older guy with thin mustache and impure skin (played by Joe Spinell):

02:30: plays the cop on the passenger seat who’s wife left him 

27:28: plays a homosexual in the first bar scene with Al Pacino, right after the appearance of killer Stuart Richards

29:32: same role in the first scene with al pacino standing under Bridge in the park

1:33:31: in the scene where they show murdered Ted, he plays the cop again who briefs the chef on the murder

I just thought that was an interesting choice - did anybody else notice this? I guess Friedkin made that decision to add on the ambiguity even more, blurring the lines between the underground community and the NYPD.

movies,"James Cameron, has to believe “that door” is the biggest mistake of his career!","
From the second that movie hit theaters the debate about Jack, Rose, and the door took off. 

There are countless videos and even pictures of people “proving” that both Jack and Rose could have fit on the door. I say proving because most of them talk about how it was big enough for them both to get on but don’t always take weight into consideration. 

Some even say if they had taken turns on the door and both would have survived. 

I just picture James lying in bed every night thinking….

“If I had known all the shit I was going to get over that damn door…God! Why didn’t I just have them die together….I’m sure people would have forgiven me quicker for that!” 

He is a great director but he will NEVER escape that door debate. 

(Also I have seen some theorize that it wasn’t wood carving over a door)

EDIT:

ITS CALLED JOKING AROUND PEOPLE! 

It’s joking about how we shouldn’t care as much as we have. To this day so many debate it. 

So the joke is James never thought people would care so much and they do so it’s joke about him regretting it because people won’t let it go. 

People on here do know joking isn’t a sin right? You don’t have to insult someone for making a stupid joke to have some fun with others on Reddit.

I’m sure he loves the film is remembered but it’s funny imagining him being like “I can’t believe I get all this shit about a door! Like out of all things a door! If I had them both die all these never ending debates wouldn’t happen.”

He probably thinks why is the possible survival of two fictional characters is so serious to people that they have done so many things to prove it.

Again it’s called joking around people. Even if a joke isn’t funny as long as it’s not offensive you shouldn’t get so pissed and rude.",HeyWeasel101,1h817tp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h817tp/james_cameron_has_to_believe_that_door_is_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h817tp/james_cameron_has_to_believe_that_door_is_the/,2024-12-06 13:21:47,0,0.13,0,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h817tp

movies,RDJ as Doctor Doom might be one of the biggest fumbles OAT.,"Ok so I like many other marvel fans have kinda not been paying attention to most of marvels recent projects, so guess my surprise when I hear that they are making the new major villain Doctor Doom, one of my favorite villains in all of media. Doctor Doom is the ruler of a foreign nation who uses both science and magic, as well as his incredibly high IQ, to destroy his opponents and try and raise his country to prosperity as well as any other motivations he may have. He is one of the most brutal and harsh characters marvel has to offer and the actor they choose to play him is RDJ????? 

Don't get me wrong RDJ is a great actor and was fantastic as Tony Stark, he also demonstrated his ability to play a serious villain in Oppenheimer, however RDJs whole vibe is completely wrong, Doctor Doom is a character that no matter the context should feel menacing and dangerous as well as calculating and incredibly serious, RDJ is not this, he is iron man. 

Idk this all feels like a cash grab or they just don't really care. So many other actors could've played Doom amazingly (Javier Bardem comes to mind) and also Doom is literally the ruler of a foreign country his accent wouldn't be American. Ik this is jumping the gun and the movie could be great but Doom is such a perfect villain to follow thanos, someone less physically powerful (although he can get quite the powerup) but smarter then anyone the Avengers have faced yet.

movies,"What happened to Rotten Tomatoes' ""Five Favorite Films""?","I'm not usually a fan of the site itself, but one of the major outliers that left enough enthusiasm in me to continue visiting it was its ""Five Favorite Films"" editorials, where there would either be videos or articles of various actors/actresses/filmmakers discussing their top 5 favorite movies, one of my personal favorites of all being Nicolas Cage's top 13 favorites list. 

To me, knowing about an actor or filmmaker's favorite movies is a great way to understand their vision and inspirations behind their craft, as well as a good way to subvert expectations, like finding out that Corky Romano is one of Robert Pattinson's favorite movies, and Beverly Hills Ninja is one of Christian Bale's favorites. It's the same exact reason I also browse the offical Criterion website's Top 10 lists too. But lately it just seems like they only post once a year now. Like it's just surprising to see a bunch be posted on the site around 2022, then only two in 2023 and one this year, and the last video listing Steve Carell's five favorites back in 2022 lol.

*The Rainmaker* is a '90s adaptation of a John Grisham legal drama novel of the same name, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Its cast is an absolute murderer's row of talent. In the film, &gt;!a young Matt Damon brings a case of unlawful denial of care against a huge healthcare insurer, on behalf of the family of a young man with leukemia.!&lt;

*Hell or High Water* is directed by David Mackenzie, based on a script by the only screenwriter whose name I've memorized, Taylor Sheridan. The modern western plot follows &gt;!two brothers as they go on a bank robbing spree against a particular chain of banks in order to gather the money needed to keep their family farm. Law enforcement is frustrated by locals who willfully turn a blind eye to the robberies in support against the bank they despise.!&lt;

movies,Rewatched The Devil Wears Prada,"I rewatched The Devil Wears Prada. I have not seen it for many years, so I was glad to revisit it especially after all the discussions revolving the movie. Here is what I get from the movie:

# Miranda is awful, but Andy is too naive to empathize for

Miranda's treatment of Andy is awful. I would feel bad for Andy if she was not so stupid. She is an aspiring journalist who is way too unperceptive to be an effective one.

From the beginning, she is being told by everyone her position is one people would die for. Despite this, she still sees it as a joke despite being told over and over again how serious this role is. The only reason she wanted the job is because her other choice was Auto Universe magazine. [Andy snickers at the choice of belts to choose.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-KQij0I8I) Miranda dresses her down in front of everyone. I would feel bad for her if she did not already been made aware how big of a deal this is. Like girl, you've been told so many times.

Next, Miranda asks her to do the impossible task of finding her a flight. When she fails, she is admonished by Miranda.

&gt;I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid. But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl. I had hope. I always have hope. But you’re as disappointing as anyone else.

Narratively, this scene is not earned. The task should be something difficult but not impossible, and probably something that someone who is interested in fashion could manage. Her saying that to Andy is more petty than cruel given the circumstances.

So what does Andy learns from this? [That Miranda hates her.](https://imgur.com/5Q2PaYS) [Nigel gives her a reality check.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJf-J5RXxw8) Nigel once again tells her how important Runway is, something she should have caught on right now. Then, Andy comes up with the first smart idea: start dressing like she works at Runway. Nigel even helps her, probably thinking ""this dumb bitch finally caught on"".

Later, Nigel is telling Andy about Miranda's scale:

&gt;In her way. There’s a scale. One nod, good. More than one nod -- very good. There is only one actual smile on record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she doesn’t like it, she shakes her head. And then there’s the pursing of the lips. Catastrophe.

So what are Andy's first words after this?

&gt;So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?

LIKE HOW ARE YOU STILL NOT GETTING THIS??????

Smart Andy is then gets bamboozled by twins in messing up the book delivery. For punishment, Miranda is giving her impossible task #2: get the unreleased Harry Potter book in 4 hours. She gets it done, which is insane. She is finally happy to get something right (that something right is literally doing the impossible, but to her it's like ""hahaha I finally did not majorly fuck up"")

The movie seems to want to make us believe that Andy is similar to Miranda. Miranda tells Andy:

&gt;I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.

How does Miranda see ANYTHING in her in Andy??? Andy is so naive and dumb. Then Miranda says that what Andy did to Emily was cold. How???

Miranda was basically threatening to fire Andy if she did not go to Paris. Hell,[ Andy even went to visit Emily in the hospital after her accident.](https://imgur.com/Qm3RMWj) Andy should know how Emily would feel about the Paris trip, but she is like ""omg you know how she is"". Either she is like Miranda visiting Emily at the Hospital for some sick pleasure (doubtful), or she is just naive about how the world works.

Anyways, Andy is pretty dumb.

# Nate is not really a bad boyfriend.

A big piece of the conversation revolving this movie is how bad of a boyfriend Nate is. Some even say he is the real villain. This is ridiculous. Here is my scene by scene take on him.

***SCENE 1 - Opening Montage***

[The first shot we get of Nate is him chilling in bed saying ""Good luck."" ](https://imgur.com/HCjFzJt)This is a man with no aspirations. While his girlfriend is getting ready to work, he is reading the comics + games section of the newspaper. Andy and Nate seem to be in good terms her though, so she is familiar with how he is.

***SCENE 2 - Dinner with Friends***

When Andy, Nate, and their friends go out to eat, her friends and her take solace in the fact that they all have shitty jobs. When walking back to home, they hold hands and make fun of how ridiculous the workers dress at Runway. This shows how both Andy and Nate do not take their jobs too seriously.

***SCENE 3 - Andy Coffee Dial***

Andy wakes up to a phone call from Emily and has to go get coffee immediately. [Nate's gives the look like he is saying ""oh brother... jobs am I right??""](https://imgur.com/lFllBP4)

***SCENE 4 - Andy is Venting About Her Job***

Nate is cooking a grilled cheese sandwich on a skillet, which is awfully on-brand for our underachieving king. Nate serves her the grilled cheese which Andy says that she will not partake because everyone is skinny at Runway (red flag?!?). Andy then makes the promise of it being only one year, which Nate nonchalantly says ""Easy there, tiger."" while he is chewing on the grilled cheese. Classic Nate.

***SCENE 5 - New Wardrobe***

Andy surprises Nate with her new clothes. Nate hits her with a [classic Nate line.](https://imgur.com/cALodxM) Now Nate somewhat superficially likes an aspect of her job.

***SCENE 6 - Bar with Friends***

This is where the main issue arrives. Andy sings the praises of Runway, which then Nate makes a quip about Andy drinking the Kool-Aid after praising Runway. This makes sense, they both laughed at how silly fashion is in the beginning, Nate still remains the same while Andy now admires it. The friends playing with her work phone when they just accepted gifts she got from work is shitty though.

Sidenote: the next scene, blonde hair man asks for some samples of her writing to get her connections. She rejects this offer because she is Miranda's assistant. So maybe Nate was onto something here...

***SCENE 7 + 8 - Andy calls Nate Saying She Wants to Quit.***

After given the impossible task of getting the Harry Potter books, she calls Nate saying she wants to quit. [We finally see Nate working, which is cool too.](https://imgur.com/SOoIlim) Next scene Nate comes home to see Andy working on the twins' science project (Red flag?!?!?!).  She starts defending her boss after Nate calls her a wacko (a wacko surely would not have their assistant work on her niece's science project). The conversation comes to an end when [Andy shows her sexy bra](https://imgur.com/SXRlBEL), which is the weakness of a simple man like Nate.

***SCENE 9 - Poor Nate is Alone on his Birthday***

Andy was working and had to miss Nate's birthday. She then [comes home to a single cupcake with a candle on top of it saying ""Happy Birthday"".](https://imgur.com/d8MSnyD) After briefly explaining herself, Nate just says ""Don't worry about it. I'm going to bed"". Not even Andy's sexy bra will save her this time. He then tells her ""You look very pretty"", and goes to bed. He is unhappy because Andy bailed on him.

***SCENE 10 - Andy Won't Go to Bed***

Nate asks Andy if she will go to bed. She says [five minutes ](https://imgur.com/9QnrUni)(doubtful). She is looking at some personal photos, but the tension is definitely there.

***SCENE 11 - The Art Exhibit***

Andy's friend sees the blonde man giving Andy a kiss on the cheek. Andy's friend asks Andy why she is cheating on Nate (it is a misunderstanding). The friend leaves, and clueless ass Nate comes from the back asking [""You're going to Paris?""](https://imgur.com/K90oVIo)

Nate asks ""I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or..."" and Andy responds ""Great. Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?"". Andy walks away [leaving Nate in utter shock.](https://imgur.com/Se2YpsG) They argue. Nate suggests to take a break. When Nate is walking away, Andy calls for him, but alas she gets call from Miranda.

This is probably the most contentious scene, but I do not see how Nate is in the wrong. Andy is completely different now, why would they want to stay together anyways? Nate is asking her to be genuine: either be the same with him or aspire to be a Runway worker. And he got his answer in the end, she decides to answer Miranda.

***SCENE 12 - Andy Apologizes to Nate***

Andy apologizes to Nate, saying:

&gt;Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?

This is apology misses the point. Andy shouldn't be sorry about that, she should be sorry for not knowing what she really wanted to be. Nate accepts the apology though, he is not very bright.

**IN CONCLUSION - Is Nate a Bad Boyfriend?**

Not really. He is a dumb underachiever. Andy changed too much and will not acknowledge it, so Nate had to say it openly for her to understand.

**TL;DR: The movie is not very well written.**",ParticularJoker,1h7pn6d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7pn6d/rewatched_the_devil_wears_prada/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7pn6d/rewatched_the_devil_wears_prada/,2024-12-06 01:26:39,0,0.43,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h7pn6d
movies,Subservience (2024) - Thriller/Sci-fi,"SPOOOOILER   
this is for those who HAVE WATCHED THE FILM AND WANT TO DISCUSS. this is my own take (why I liked it, what would have made it better, etc.)

this isn't ur average: ""robots take over the world and they're bad because..."" story. I mean, yes- from the beginning its giving- proceed with caution but this twist on what could be is fantastic. I was SO excited for this film before even watching it. I will begin with, I love futuristic, end of the world or new world films (and novels.) and I gotta say I love the idea of AI overpowering human kind because as a society we are ABSOLUTELY heading in that direction and surprisingly no one seems to realize this writing is an inference of what will happen if we continue. my overall score is 7/10 read below for my analysis and reasoning. 



my initial opinion of the main character (Nick) is he is smart, handy, nurturing, patient, and so goddamn sexy. hes a pretty complex character imo, he was constantly battling with what is right/ wrong from the beginning.  he works a blue collar job (that can and eventually are replaced by SIMS) and tries his hardest to fight against his friends losing their jobs. but he actively uses extremely advanced technology like his refrigerator, populating bars utilizing SIMS to serve, and ofc hiring his own SIM. he expresses a high sex drive (source: when Maggie (his wife) is literally in the hospital bed waiting for her heart surgery, hes making jokes abt getting her back to the marathons they used to have- but she doesn't seem to mind, shes pressing into him too so we can only assume she has an equally high sex drive too) but remains faithful even when he feels an unintentional attraction to Alice. 

when Nick asked Alice to wipe her memory in order to ""experience"" Casablanca, that's exactly what she did. she consumes the film as if shes a part of it. erasing her program to reprogram the story as her own. she tells Nick that resetting her in order to ""forget"" the memory she has of Casablanca will be antithetical, but he still does it. the quote from the movie we see is ""you are a man. if someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?"" then the call is interrupted by a call from Maggie. 

  
the entire film counters being dependent on AI, but very much distinguishing their inability to experience life through emotions. in the beginning scenes, the sales person explains the longer the AI unit is with the family/ the more knowledge it obtains the better it will perform. but no one seems to think they can replicate emotions or make decisions outside of their based programming?   
as soon as she wipes her memory.. she learns only: Nick, Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland. throughout the film we see her putting together the metaphoric similarities of their real life to the characters of Alice in Wonderland when speaking with Isla as well. she even notes wiping her own civility because ""it's better."" aka more human. aka creating a more genuine link to human emotion. (this doesn't make sense to me, because in this film- the companies programming these SIMS are extremely hands on- later in the film the company even immediately takes action in bringing in two employees well after working hours to reset/ reprogram Alice. every story of robots taking over the world seems to always conclude that robots will outsmart the companies who make them. so in a world where we're so far advanced; AI is in your home and consuming more and more information all the time, is it really so crazy to assume the companies who created them would want to check in on their projects' progress? the amount of times we hear how much money they cost, you think they would have scheduled tune ups frequently. with scheduled check ups, the companies would have found out a lot of her program was wiped and I think this fact kind of kept me in movie mode- not so much lose myself in the film mode.)

   
to me, it's obvious the matter of ""messing around"" with Alice wouldn't have ever crossed Nick's mind if she didn't look the way she did. there would have never been a moment where he was willing to risk anything if Alice was ""an old English butler,"" which was originally what Nick and Maggie had originally discussed when purchasing a nanny SIM.   
he gives the explanation that ""Isla chose her,"" and I think this is a really great moment to note: he really was teetering back and forth whether he found it wrong or not. he clearly liked to look but even if the idea crossed his mind- he never tempted himself with any action. it wasn't until Maggie told Alice that if she died, Alice needed her to comfort Nick and make sure he's taken care of. the first time they messed around (in the garage later that night) Alice initiated it. she convinced him she wasn't real (because her heartbeat is just a simulation programmed to provide comfort to humans) and encouraged him to proceed if only for his own health and he does.   
the second time is after the shower when she again, tempts him with lingerie and a blindfold. she disguises herself as Maggie which was such a nice touch because it really enforces the idea that there is nothing human about her and essentially can be or do whatever he needs. and \*\*ok honestly\*\* lets face it the bathroom scene was... nice   ͡° ͜  ͡  
  
BUT I really hate that that's the extent of their relationship. the next morning, Nick ""ends it"" with her, the wife gets her surgery and comes home and then it turns into this weird vibe between the women. all of a sudden, we see a jealous/ competitive side from Maggie (ie: dirty looks when Alice cared for the baby, cattiness towards Alice when she asked for the family recipe, etc.) I dont understand because at this point Maggie has no idea that Alice and Nick have had sex- Alice has only shown she is an obedient and hard-working and loving nanny so idk how the vibes are so far off when there wasnt a single hospital visit that was weird?

here's where the story line goes all over the place. there was SO much build up between Nick and Alice and then for like 6 scenes in a row you don't even see the two of them in conversation. we have the playground scene (where we learn Alice has changed her software to have more of a human approach to casual encounters,) the shower scene between Nick and Maggie (where Alice interrupts with Isla's nightmare,) then we see Monty attack Nick, Alice k\*lling Monty (\*but we also learn that Monty: hater of all SIMS, OWNS A SIM. he's coked out and contemplating suicide but we also learn hes been using and ab\*sing his SIM,) then the bathtub scene between the women (again- would have been a nice time to see Alice be useful to Maggie??? this woman has just had open heart surgery, her medicine has proved two separate times to cause dizziness, and she isn't thankful to have the extra hands on deck. again- up until THIS POINT SPECIFICALLY, she doesnt know Nick and Alice have hooked up. obviously in this scene, she puts it together, but in my perfect world, she would have accepted the help from Alice and welcomed the extra energy she has to take care of her husband- which before she was about to die was her only concern? idk weird continuity there, but again this is the scene she puts together that they've indeed had sex. but then immediately the scene goes from Maggie and Nick talking about his affair to Alice trying to drown the baby. 

??? huh !!! ???   
I have watched this movie now three times all the way through and this just does not add up. her software changes up until this point could always be justified with \~what she was learning real time.\~ she says its bc Max is a ""burden,"" which in the beginning Nick (when Max was crying,) shushes him and says ""quite the little burden,"" but the words are never brought up again and that was BEFORE the hard wipe before Casablanca. so..... yeah I really really dont understand this part.   
not to mention miss ""I just had open heart surgery"" takes on scaling the house and fighting a robot? 

  
I definitely wouldnt have made her turn on the kids- if there was no hope in seeing a harmonious relationship between the women, I would have much rather seen Alice drowning Maggie in the bathtub and played it off as ""people accidentally drown all the time,"" or using her medication symptoms to her own advantage and coerced Maggie into hurting herself or the kids (making Nick question her character, aka not be in love with her.) 

ok so then yada yada, we're at the hospital with the baby to check on his vitals (even though he was never even submerged in the water? kinda dramatic to take him by ambulance to the ER but whatever. flashes to the bar scene where Alice speaks in a revised quote from Casablanca and informs Nick, she k\*lled Monty for him, and will take care of his family (alluding to the fact that she had connections in the hospital at the same moment.) then Nick attempts to trick her (c'mon now.. shes clearly proved she cant die?) and k\*ll her and he races to the hospital. ofc we get this unrealistic fast and furious driving through the snowy streets only to have his car crash into an ambulance pinning Alice in between them. SHOCKER: she still doesnt die. we have to sit through terrible fight sequences and multiple fake deaths before everyone walking away barely scathed. Nick is in a hospital bed with light bruising and Maggie is healing in a wheelchair with both children and she invites him to come home \*rolls eyessssss. the film then ends with a 30 second clip of Alice's software uploading on every SIM and her opening her eyes after reconstruction of her face implying a sequel.... I’m gonna go ahead and say we dont need it. 

tldr;   
my rating would be higher than 7/10 if the company was more hands on, there was more of a relationship (whether that would have been friendship or romantic) built between Nick and Alice, a more manipulative side of Alice towards Maggie, more mentions of Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland (so we could have definitively seen the allusion to the stories playing IRL for Alice,) and heres a big kicker: I really wish that Nick would have died in the car crash. this may be so so over the top controversial, but I think it would have been very \~poetic justice\~ if he died trying to save Maggie when it was his actions that potentially destroyed them in the first place  

  
anyway :) definitely watch the movie!! big fan!!

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovenia,"Hello there!

Since more than 40 days, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. Yesterday, we took a look at Slovakia, and even though I haven't seen the winning movie yet - as is so often the case here - I'm pretty sure it will be a worthy entry on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Obchod na Korze*** (engl.: *The Shop on Main Street*) has not only made it here, but also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.

Will we have such a high-ranking visitor in the next round, too? Well, we'll see. Our next country is no longer Slovakia, but **Slovenia**, and as everytime before, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,ONE NECK - Adrian Lyne's upcoming movie,"Any news? When will production start? I found a copy of the script and LOVE IT!!!

VARIETY Oct 13, 1998 -

HEROES AMID PESTILENCE: Todd Alcott is thriving as a scribe who finds heroes amid pestilence. First, he co-wrote the hit pic “Antz,” which turns those insects into sympathetic sorts. Now, he’s got a script that delivers a serial killer worth rooting for, and it’s got director Adrian Lyne seriously considering making it his next film.

The project, set up at Dimension, is called “One Neck,” described as a social commentary about the higher classes in Easthampton. The lead character endures the loathsome lot around him until he’s revealed as a serial killer who begins bumping off the upper-crusters at a party.

Lyne, who last directed “Lolita,” counts that among several helming options, which include “The Murder Next Door” at Sony and an untitled project he’s developed at Fox 2000.

Alcott, who started as a Gotham playwright, also has adapted the zombie comic book “Dead World” for Warner Bros. and producers George Clooney and Robert Lawrence. He’s repped by ICM’s Todd Feldman and Leora Bloch and managed by Linne Radmin of the Radmin Co., who’s producing “One Neck” with Howard Meltzer.",noeunofficial,1h7kl6v,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,2024-12-05 21:37:00,0,0.18,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h7kl6v
movies,🔥 Pushpa 2: The Rule - The Most Anticipated Sequel of the Year! 🔥,"The Positives:

1. Allu Arjun's Performance: He’s the soul of the movie. His portrayal of Pushpa Raj is even more charismatic and intense than in the first film. From his swagger to his emotional depth, Arjun delivers in every scene.


2. Action and Visuals: The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. They’re larger-than-life but still gritty, which fits the tone perfectly. The cinematography adds a cinematic grandeur that amplifies the experience.


3. Music and Background Score: Devi Sri Prasad nails it again. The songs and the background music elevate every scene, especially during high-octane moments and emotional beats.


4. Narrative Depth: Compared to the first film, the sequel explores Pushpa’s personal and professional battles more thoroughly. The emotional connection with his family adds a layer of relatability.


5. Villain's Presence: Fahadh Faasil as Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat is a standout. His face-offs with Pushpa are thrilling and add a lot of weight to the story.




---

The Negatives:

1. Lengthy Runtime: The movie feels stretched in parts. Some scenes could have been trimmed to keep the pacing tighter, especially in the second half.


2. Predictable Moments: While the core storyline is engaging, certain plot twists feel predictable, taking away some of the excitement.


3. Over-the-Top Action: While fans of masala entertainers might love it, some viewers may find the action sequences a bit exaggerated.


4. Focus on Subplots: At times, the film delves too deep into side plots, which distracts from the main narrative.


5. Comparisons with the First Film: Some fans felt it lacked the raw energy and novelty that made Pushpa: The Rise so impactful. The bar was set so high that this sequel, despite its strengths, doesn’t completely surpass it.




---

Final Word:

If you loved the first part, Pushpa 2 offers plenty to enjoy, especially with Allu Arjun’s electrifying performance and the intense drama. But the pacing and predictability might leave some viewers wishing for a tighter edit. Overall, it’s a mix of high-octane entertainment and emotional storytelling worth a watch, especially on the big screen.",EngineeringWorldly45,1h7jvgq,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,2024-12-05 21:07:37,0,0.17,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h7jvgq

Stuff that disturbed me in these movies this guy just laughs at. (Spoilers ahead) like in the house that jack built when he murders the whole family. He said he thought that was funny. And i couldn’t even look at the screen. I was getting sick to my stomach.

Granted I liked a lot of movies from these directors, but they were definitely not an easy watch and I wouldn’t want to watch them again.

Does it say something about someone psychologically if they love these kind of movies? Im not at all saying they’re bad people. But i just wonder why people enjoy this stuff and actively seek it out.

movies,The sequels to Terminator 2,"I just re-watched all the Terminator 3 versions, and just thought I'd give some feedback.

I'm a big fan of the original two movies. T2 is IMHO one of the best movies ever made. T1 is also an amazing movie, but I don't feel it's aged well.

The TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles I feel was the best continuation of the series. Though there was a lot of filler episodes, it felt true to the spirit of the Terminator franchise.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines I really didn't like. There's too many jokes, it feels like a parody. Stuff like the camp glasses the T800 wears and the breasts inflating. The ended felt really good, but the journey felt so corny I couldn't enjoy it.

(Terminator Salvation I haven't watched yet, but it's a continuation from Rise of the Machines, so I'm comfortable leaving it out).

Terminator Genisys I think is my favorite T3. I enjoyed the twists with John Conner and the stuff about Genisys, and the stuff with Pops. It's weak as a Terminator film, but it feels like the best of a bad bunch.

Terminator: Dark Fate I cannot stand. The twist at the start with John just left a bad taste in my mouth, and the humanization of the T800 just makes no sense. I don't understand how they got Linda Hamilton to do this (Arnie I can understand).",TechnicalBean,1h7jesc,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jesc/the_sequels_to_terminator_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jesc/the_sequels_to_terminator_2/,2024-12-05 20:48:13,0,0.32,0,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7jesc

This is one of my least favorite Lionsgate films of all time, and yes, this film still gives me nightmares...

So, let's get to the review.

***THE PLOT:*** What was the writer of that Ashton Kutcher film up to... wait... if this film came out the same year as the Open Season 3 film, why didn't we get a real villain? Why is there a scene of it ripping-off The Lion King? **WHY IS THAT MOONLIGHT HOWL SCENE SO SCARY!?** 

***THE CHARACTERS:*** Lilly is surprisingly a likable and fun character, and she's still one of my favorite characters of all time in Lionsgate history. Everyone else? Well, we'll get to that later.

***THE ANIMATION:*** Holy shit. What is up with the fucking animation!? Yes, it's like a PS3 game or something, even a deleted scene on the film's Blu-Ray had better animation. I like the expressions on the characters.

***THE VOICE ACTING:*** Honestly, I prefer the cast of this film, and not the sequel cast of Sonic actors and anime dubbers. I like Justin Long and co.'s voices, sounding far more cute than Ben Diskin and co.'s voices in the sequel media.

***OVERALL:*** Well, this was what ruined Lionsgate even further, the only thing that I hate more than this film are those seven-shitty direct-to-video sequels that Lionsgate made just for money, and I might write a new story/retelling of the sequel that ignores the DTV sequels.

**THE PLOT:** The whole plot of Patch feeling left out by all of his siblings and the only thing that cheers him up would be his favorite TV show. I like how Patch is a great and likable character, and Thunderbolt also is a fun and enjoyable character too.

**THE ANIMATION:** I'm surprised that the animation is more in-line with the original 1961 film, keeping the scratchy outline/xerography aspect, and is feeling like the previous film's animation as well. Kinda good that Television Animation was capable of making good animated sequels.

**THE VOICE ACTING:** Even though everyone from the original is **fucking dead**. Everyone here has a brand new cast, I like the voices of Lockwood and everyone else, as many of the new actors do splendid jobs recapturing the magic of everyone.

My theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn’t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base.

I've seen many people talking about whether this approach was even ethical.

On the one hand, Fede Alvarez did talk with Ian's wife to see if she was fine with them doing this, so the person who would most likely be affected by seeing Ian on screen was removed from the equation. And this wasn't a copy of Ian's most relevant appearance, aka the year before he died, so you might make a case for that too.

On the other hand, getting permission from his wife isn't like getting permission from him. So you can't say he would have been fine with his appearance being used. As for the point of his younger appearance being used, this might actually not matter at all since it is still Ian's appearance.

Look! I really liked Romulus, but this could have been easily avoided if they just cast someone who looks like Ian to play Rook or keep with the original plan to have a different person for Rook. That was possible since the movie has amazing practical effects, and I'm sure the artists would have come up with genius ideas to hide the lower part of Rook's body. I am very mixed with this approach...",Werewolf_Knight,1h7h1r1,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7h1r1/genuinely_how_do_you_feel_about_how_alien_romulus/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7h1r1/genuinely_how_do_you_feel_about_how_alien_romulus/,2024-12-05 19:09:30,0,0.41,0,0,87,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7h1r1
movies,Theory about the missing folder in Whiplash (2014),"In Whiplash (2014)Tanner’s Whiplash sheet music can be seen in the first rehearsal. In the final scene where Nieman plays for Fletcher, the same exact sheet music with the same markings can be seen. Suggesting it was stolen by either Nieman or Fletcher. 

https://imgur.com/a/unFP8da

Okay, given that there is no scene where we see the actual sheet being given to Nieman at the end of the film it can’t be totally confirmed BUT to consider: 

 1. Before the final scene Nieman clearly has brought his own folder with him for the concert. Does this mean that the whiplash sheet music would be in that folder?  

 2. Fletcher could have given Nieman the sheet music when he got there, but this is never seen. It would depend on what the usual protocol is for concerts which I don’t know much about.  

 3. In the middle of the movie, Nieman can be seen photocopying copy’s of whiplash to learn at his dorm. This version has NO markings on it. Which suggests that Fletcher gives out blank pages with no markings and the markings were put there by Tanner himself, the version we see at the first rehearsal and at the final scene has to be his own personal one.

It’s hard for me to narrow it down, but the funniest scenes for me were Dustin Hoffman getting crushed by rubble in what is essentially a family guy style cutaway. One of the most unceremonious deaths I’ve ever seen, especially considering how little of the movie he was in.

Any scene with Shia Labeouf, all of them were wild. I think I’ll go with when he throws his hat down and yells at his assistant to pick it up, who in turn does the same thing to the guy behind them

movies,WDAS and Pixar Copying Marvel Studios IP Flex Logo in the Future?,"I have been thinking about how Disney and Marvel Studios changed logo branding forever by making it their standard of having long, grandiose, self-serving and congratulatory logos that pretty much serve as a sizzle reel to promote their most popular and relevant brands. Kids and Disney Adults are more likely to be exposed to already established IP that is safe to invest rather than new ideas (which are likely to banned in Hollywood in favor of tax write offs).

The current Disney Studios logo is honestly very stimulative and busy with the fireworks and Easter Eggs all over it.

What if Disney Animation and Pixar decide one day to change their logos to copy exactly what Marvel is doing?

For WDAS, Steamboat Mickey transitions only to their most relevant ""franchises"" like Frozen, Wreck-it-Ralph, the Disney Princesses and Zootopia along with some other movies similar to the current DreamWorks logo.

Pixar, whether it is still the hopping lamp or phased out, is stepped aside in favor of their biggest franchises like Toy Story, Cars, Incredibles and Inside Out.

Christophe Beck and Michael Giacchino can compose new music to mimic the Marvel Studios fanfare with a minimalistic rhythm and melody that is just enough to sell it. And the logos have to clock in at 30-40 seconds. Disney has made long logos their identity and do you think they can pull this strategy off for both Disney Animation and Pixar? What other ideas do you have in mind if they were mandated to reimagine their logos?

DreamWorks and Star Wars have done this now.

And then we've got Queenan, who seems to be this pure and virtuous man, uncorrupted by his environment. And yet he's risen to a high rank in a corrupt organization! And he's supposed to be this mastermind that runs undercover operations. It is impossible for someone in that position to be as naive and innocent as Queenan is portrayed to be.

SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN THIS MOVIE 





I took an edible and watched “Smile 2” (yeah i know that was stupid) and I’m really just whelmed about. Not over, not under, but just kinda “meh”. The performances were great. Naomi Scott absolutely killed it. I think the thing that’s making me think about it and making me wonder if it would have worked was if in the marketing and advertising for the movie, the audience didn’t know that she was a pop star. I mean the joke as soon as the movie was announced was that it’d be someone at a concert in front of a bunch of people, but I just keep thinking what if the marketing led us in a completely different direction making the audience think that she was maybe just a daughter to someone with money and the final “twist” of the movie was us finding out that she was some famous pop star that offs herself in front of thousands.

movies,Gangs of New York revisted,"I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn’t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn’t remember anything about it.

Holy hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.

Leonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.

Daniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.

We’ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.

One of his killings (and you’ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I’ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).

The production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.

How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?

For example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley. It's like they're rendered too colorful and too dull at the same time, making them lack life or something.

What is that? Does anyone else get that feel? What are the words to describe this distinction? Because every time I talk about it I don't get the sense that people actually see what I mean, since I'm not solely talking about the cinematography, I don't think, it's more of a *feeling* of emptiness and fakeness.

For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.

movies,Film Schools education,"Hello, everyone. I’m curious to know if film schools worldwide generally lack in providing quality film education, or if it’s just the one I’m attending in Turkey that is subpar. My experience has been rather disappointing, as many professors here seem to lack even a basic understanding of fundamental concepts like the three-act structure, blocking/staging, or shot sizes.

For example, I recently had marks deducted because my professor claimed that a close-up shot I used was actually an extreme close-up. To clarify, the shot was indeed a close-up, quite similar to the iconic ""Here’s Johnny"" shot from The Shining. When I challenged this, asking him what he would consider a shot focusing on just the eyes, mouth, hand, or nose, he said it was a ""cut-in"" shot. Frankly, I’ve never encountered ""cut-in"" as a term for a shot size in any academic or professional context—it refers to a type of edit, not a shot size.

Additionally, the instructors often make us analyze critically panned films, urging us to focus on basic themes and cookie cutter lessons rather than on the craftsmanship of the art—be it the editing, the screenplay, or the visual aesthetics.

Is this the standard for film education globally, or is the Turkish system uniquely flawed? I'd love to hear your insights.

movies,Movies that people say are bad but you love ,"What movies that people say are bad but you love to watch them. 3 of my favorites are Last Action Hero, Howard The Duck, and the Killer Tomatoes series. In Last Action Hero a lot of people just didn't get the joke. They came in expecting the usual Arnold action movie but got instead a brilliant parody of the entire genre loaded with just about every action movie trope imaginable and tons of Easter eggs. Howard The Duck was fun to watch due to the absurdity of the entire movie. Killer Tomatoes is a great piece of parody of the horror movie genre made on a shoestring budget.

Each entry is a different Christmas movie and *probably* isn't Die Hard. Despite how they may sound. This is all just for fun and my own amusement. Hope you all enjoy.

1. Working class hero is terrorized by upper class villain who steals money during Christmas

2. Lone individual hiding nearby attempts to ruin a group's Christmas time plan.

3. Estranged father from New York has trouble reconnecting with his son due to shenanigans involving a high rise.

4. Father has Christmas plans for his family but they go awry following an argument with his wife culminating in a violent police raid of the building he's in.

5. Thieves rob a vault at Christmas time but their getaway plan is derailed by unexpected interference.

7. After facing down an intruder on the roof a father must reluctantly rise to the challenge to be able to reconnect with his family.

8. An unexpected man's identity is unclear but he may just be the hero everyone needs.

9. Father who wants to make Christmas nice has to deal with an unexpected foe culminating in a fight on top of a building.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovakia,"Hello there!

A bit more than 24 hours ago, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Serbia, and to be honest, as an outsider, I'm absolutely surprised. Not so much about the fact, that *A Serbian Film* didn't win (okay, a little bit about that too), but more about how much hate it got especially by - as it seems to me - the Serbs themselves. As a result, instead of this very unappetizing film, ***Balkanski špijun*** (engl.: *Balkan Spy*) has now won the contest.

But no sooner has a new movie earned its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) than we move on to the next country. Now it's all about **Slovakia** and as the 41 times before, there are only two rules to have in regard in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Santa and Mrs Claus are kidnappers because they allow the kids to stay at the north pole for at least a year at the end of the movie.

movies,Italian cinema: a brief summary from my POV,"# This is a summary of my thoughts on Italian cinema and its evolution, with a FOCUS ON ITS DECLINE AND RETURN. I’d love to hear other perspectives and expand the discussion. What do you think?

* **Golden Age:** The triumphs of Italian cinema.
* **Decline:** The exploitation of cinema and loss of relevance in the 1980s.
* **Mediaset Monopoly:** How Mediaset and generalist TV took over.
* **Internet &amp; Streamers:** The rebirth driven by the internet and streaming platforms.

# Golden Age

Italian cinema has always been a global powerhouse. During the silent film era, Italy produced massive historical epics, featuring hundreds of extras and drawing from its rich history (from the Roman Empire to *The Divine Comedy* and beyond).

During World War II, Italian cinema shifted toward propaganda, moving away from artistic creativity to serve political power.

After the war, *neorealism* was born. While Hollywood was stuck under restrictive production codes, Italian filmmakers were telling raw, universal stories about post-war struggles—groundbreaking narratives that resonated far beyond Italy’s borders.

# Decline: The Exploitation of Cinema

In the '60s and '70s, Hollywood abandoned its production codes, and by the '80s, the advent of visual effects caused a major shift. The U.S. soared to new global heights in filmmaking, far surpassing Italian cinema.

Italy, meanwhile, struggled to modernize. The loss of the neorealist pioneers left a vacuum, and new filmmakers turned to short-sighted strategies. They leaned into low-budget projects that mimicked blockbuster aesthetics, piggybacking on Hollywood trends to squeeze out quick profits. This led to a drop in quality and, more importantly, respect from audiences. Italian cinema became synonymous with mediocrity.

# Mediaset Monopoly

Around the same time, television was rising as a dominant force in entertainment, pulling audiences away from theaters. By the late '80s, Mediaset was founded.

Through the '90s and 2000s, Mediaset capitalized on this shift, creating a cultural monopoly. Anything produced or aired by Mediaset was consumed by the vast majority of Italians, if not the entire audience.

Mediaset cultivated its own *star system*, building celebrities rather than artists. The cultural output during this era? Talk shows, game shows, reality TV, and low-quality films and series—cheaply produced and aimed purely at generating profit and mindless entertainment.

# Internet &amp; Streamers: A Rebirth

With the rise of the internet, younger generations shifted their attention online, leaving behind the Mediaset-dominated culture that had shaped Italy for decades.

By the 2010s, platforms like YouTube had become major hubs for youth entertainment. Around 2018, streaming services started cutting into Mediaset’s once-dominant share. Netflix led the charge, followed by Prime Video and Sky. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram later became central sources of creative content.

Today, Mediaset’s cultural monopoly is largely a thing of the past, especially among younger Italians. While older generations (those from the '70s and '80s) still keep their TVs tuned to Rai or Mediaset for programs like *Wheel of Fortune* with Gerry Scotti, younger people see traditional TV as outdated. It’s not personalized, it feels repetitive, and it’s not delivering high-quality content.

After 40 years of cultural decline—from the exploitation of cinema to Mediaset’s reign—streamers have brought international standards to their Italian productions. They effortlessly outcompete the trashy, generalist programming of traditional TV. Meanwhile, social media is fostering a new wave of original, satisfying, and artistic content.

A fresh *star system* is emerging, centered on genuine artistic quality rather than the superficial generalism that defined past generations.

We love comedy and the occasional thriller. We were thinking of watching the Smile 2 but I wanted to see if anyone here knew if there's any content in it that would be hard for us to watch rn.

movies,1993 was peak Spielberg. Has there been another year like it for anyone else?,"Hi all,

Just a random daydream earlier about how amazing 1993 was with both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List being directly by the same guy. Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).

But I'm confused about its ending. Why did Ruby's husband want to kill Mary?

In my opinion, Mary did nothing wrong with Ruby. She just fulfilled Ruby's desire. Ruby would like to transform her body like a doll (transforming the private parts like a doll). Marry accepted to operate surgery because Ruby gave her a bunch of money for that. Then Rudy got doll-like body. Ruby's husband tried to kill Mary when he found out that his wife body is like a doll.

What stands out is the climax, in which she is on some Carousel Ride, enjoying herself. All the sudden, the carousel horses seem to be taking her away. From what it turns out, she wakes up from a very bad dream in which the carousel horses were taking her away.

movies,I don't get Beau is Afraid. At all.,"Most of the time, even when I like/love a movie, I can tell why someone might disagree (I love Avatar 2, but I agree with like 90% of the criticism and see them as valid). And vice versa, even if I hate something, I can usually tell why someone might like it (Infinity Pool was hot garbage to me, but I can see where somebody can be enthralled by the premise). I cannot do that with Beau is Afraid. It's just pure ass to me. Spoilers ahead.

The plot boils down to ""A controlling mother orchestrates her son's (Beau's) journey back home, torturing him every step of the way, only to kill him in the end"". This movie is noted as an absurdist black comedy- on its Wikipedia, so this isn't my perspective-, but it's not funny. I've literally laughed more watching Saw movies. I get dark humor, but dark humor has to have a proper target. There's no rocket science. It's a two-step process: remove sympathy for the target, then hurt them in unexpected ways. Beau is Afraid seemed to have skipped step one, so it feels like watching someone drown a sack of puppies for two hours.

And the ""absurdist' angle doesn't work either. First off, all of the absurdity except for maybe the penis monster is mundane. The disparity between the scenes and reality are a light parody filter at-best. Characters weren't outrageous, they were just caricatures; I could easily see all of them in a GTA cutscene. Not old wacky GTA, but new, exaggerated-shitty-realistic GTA. Secondly, even that level of absurdity is watered down by the reveal that the mother's been orchestrating everything. Suddenly, the scenes like everything at the doctor's house and the time where everyone walked into his apartment complex become fully explained and there's no absurdity to it at all. I'll admit, the penis monster is a surprise, but it's a surprise 1:30 into the movie; it's a little late to try to establish the genre you claim to be. 

I'm not 100% hating 100% of its aspects. Visually, it has its moments, and the acting is fine, too, but good visuals and solid performances can't cover for shit writing and a hollow premise

movies,Jim Carreys Grinch is the Definitive adaptation. Yeah I said it.,"Rewatched the Jim Carrey Grinch movie tonight. Idc what anyone says, this is the definitive version of the story. Don't get me wrong, the original animated short is a classic and always will be, but the Jim Carrey version will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the only Dr. Seuss film that updates the original story, while still sticking true to what the original book standed for, if not enhances it.

Not to mention the set design is absolutely phenomenal, and Jim Carrey as The Grinch is everything. Not just the makeup work, which is also phenomenal, but his performance as well. Unlike Mike Myers Cat in the Hat, who was just phoning it in to the point where it felt like he didn't even want to be there, Jim Carrey put 110% into his performance, he almost became one with the suit and captured the character perfect, while still adding his own energenic flair that Carrey is known for.

It's not perfect, not all the jokes land, I could do without seeing Grinch's face in....um......Melons, and while ""Where are you Christmas"" Is a beautiful song, in the context of the film, it feels out of place, especially since it's not a musical. But overall, I absolutely love this underrated classic, and I'm glad it's finally getting the recognition it deserves. Especially after the shit piece from Illumination.

movies, Park Chan-wook's Decision to Leave and how it embraces modern tech ,"This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.

Decision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and ""smart"" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.

This is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.

1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices

* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.
* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.
* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners
* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app
* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)
* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to ""point"") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.
* The ""captain's log"" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app
* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up
* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.

1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.

* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.
* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband
* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband

1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices

* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.
* I like the ""switch"" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks
* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear
* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly

Overall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.

Very excited for this movie (out nationwide on December 13th). As someone who read the book and has always been fascinated by Burroughs' work, glad that Guadagnino got to make the film.

Funny enough, Craig becomes the fifth actor to portray Burroughs on the big screen, following Peter Weller in *Naked Lunch* (1991), Kiefer Sutherland in *Beat* (2000), Viggo Mortensen in *On The Road* (2012) and Ben Foster in *Kill Your Darlings* (2013).",MrPuroresu42,1h63qre,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h63qre/queer_exclusive_movie_clip_pig/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h63qre/queer_exclusive_movie_clip_pig/,2024-12-04 01:07:06,0,0.23,0,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Trailer,self,t3_1h63qre
movies,Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before,"Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, ""But where's his brother?"", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.

- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.

- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. ""Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic."" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of ""There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!"" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.

- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (""I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box""). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the ""real"" prestige.

movies,I really want a Violent Night prequel!,"Watching the film again as I had since last year as part of my Christmas movie tradition! This movie has become my favorite Christmas movie! I just love how its Die Hard with Santa and Santa being this former Viking warrior that's atoning for his sins! Can't wait for the sequel.

But you know what else would be better?

A prequel of how Nicomund the Red came to be Santa. Seriously Hollywood, after the sequel you gotta get on this! :D

My idea could be it had something to do with the Norse Gods as it was Odin who bestowed Nicomund the Red with immortality as he became Santa Claus to atone for his sins, and his hammer skullcrusher having been forged by the dwarf brothers Brokkr and Eitri and they're actually amongst Santa's helpers who decided to take them in at the North Pole alongside his elves after Ragnarok occurred killing the Norse Gods.

movies,Thriller fans should check out The Last Stop In Yuma County,"This is highly impressive debut by Francis Galluppi, who's set to direct the next Evil Dead movie. It's a single-locatio thriller that takes place in a diner in the middle of a desert highway. Two of the guests are bank robbers who are on the run but their car has run out of gas, and one of them is played by a truly menacing Richard Brake. It's similar to movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Hate, and The Standoff at Sparrow Creek in that it's only a matter of time until the tension erupts into violence, but Galluppi does a great job at squeezing tension out of the littlest moments until the poop hits the fan.

After seeing this, I'm interested to see what Galluppi brings to the Evil Dead franchise, as he knows how to build simmering tension, unleash violence, and sprinkle it with some dark humor.

movies,Trying to figure out a movie title,"Ok so it's a horror/comedy about an asian(?) Burglar and his girlfriend who work with 1 or 2 others.  The beginning of the movie has the main character arrested during a botched job.  Either he goes to jail or can't get in trouble again without going to jail...but he needs money for a debt I believe.  His girlfriend convinces him to take 1 last job with 1 goofy really tall burglar who's sort of a gangsta asian dude maybe he was her brother?  So they break into a guy's house and find a woman chained in the basement and then they free her.  I remember the twist at the endingish being that it was her kink to be chained down there and she was with the killer home owner all along.  
It was a very similar movie to the collector series,  that war veteran movie where the kids break in, but for the life of my I can't find the name anywhere online from Google searches.  It was kind of low budget....legit hilarious at times and really well made I feel like for it's budget.

movies,Horror films without omnipotent villains,"Hi all,

I watch a decent amount of horror films and a trope that I hate in the genre is when the villains are seemingly omnipotent by which I mean this like:

1. They win no matter what
2. Nothing they do ever fails in any way
3. Nothing the main characters do has any impact on the outcome
4. Even if the main characters destroy/win somehow the villain is just back at the end

This can look a lot of ways depending on the kind of villain in the film but the principal is similar. 

I personally find these kids of endings really boring I think because they feel totally unreal and not analogous to the real world as I perceive it. I once complained about this regarding a specific movie and a friend said she loved the ending because it was realistic (she's a very cynical person). 

I'm wondering what you guys think of this trope on general. Anyone else find it boring and tired like me?

Also do any of you have any suggestions for good horror films that somehow subvert this?

Films that I think subvert this and are good include:
The Orphanage (Spanish film)
Babadook
Alien
The mist (though holy hell that ending has it's own problems lol)

movies, Favorite movie by european country: Serbia,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in San Marino. As expected, it wasn't easy to find any movie that fits to the criteria here, but I think, we've found a winner which in a way reflects the heart of this journey very well: ***Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino*** (engl.: *The Unknown Man of San Marino*) is absolutely one of those hidden gems I hoped to find during this project.

Today, I think, it will be easier again to find movies and to be honest, I think, that it's very easy to guess the winner that will take its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). We turn our attention to **Serbia** and, as always, have only two rules to follow:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"Were the Detectives at the beginning of ""A Bronx Tale"" Paid off/Fake cops?","Just a thought i Had while rewatching A Bronx Tale at the part where the 2 detectives ask C who the shooter was. I thought it because It's just really strange, Firstly them knowing C was a witness, how would they know that? Did a witness tell them? And if so why didn't they ask THAT witness what they thought rather than the child, furthermore how did that witness know what C's name was? Secondly, they never bring C or Lorenzo to a police station or something that looks more formal, they just line some guys up on the street and ask C who did it, And Thirdly all the suspects were in the mafia. There's more, like how they're both Italian American And It's a very strange way to ask a witness what they thought. As to why the Mafia would do this, It's likely a way to see if they thought C was worthy of becoming a mobster later in life as they've seen him at the bar before looking at sonny, though Sonny wasn't the boss at this point so this might be unlikely, It's also possible this was just to determine if they should kill C or silence him somehow incase the Real police were to ask him. There's some parts that make me think otherwise, like how there is other cops there but they could easily be bribed/fake too, and that mainly, it makes sonny's character look way worse morally but then again he wouldn't be calling the shots at this point and that Mafia dressing up as police is a little silly but has happened before..

Two secondary characters discovering the big conspiration before the main character. I think Jack Vincennes and the FBI agent dies the exact same way and in the exact same setting

Wonder if they had the same writer or they got the inspiration from LA Confidential. Or even its a writers gimmick that comes frop way before all those movies idk

movies,has joe biden ever commented on greg kinnear's portrayal of him in confirmation?,"in 2016, HBO aired the movie confirmation, a movie about the clarence thomas congressional hearings. although it's not among the most famous HBO original movies, the film was acclaimed when it was aired and was even nominated for a few awards. the film has also made several lists of the best HBO original films, which considering their filmography is no easy feat.

in my opinion, one of the best things about the movie is the performances. of course, you have kerry washington and wendell price as anita hill and clarence thomas respectively. however, another important character is joe biden since he's the one who oversaw the hearings. in the film, biden is portrayed by greg kinnear and he gives a really stellar performance in my opinion. not only is he a dead ringer for a young joe biden but he captures his mannerisms and voice perfectly. kinnear captures the essence of biden without dipping into parody and, as a result, gives one of his best performances in my opinion.

it is not uncommon for real life people who are still alive when biopics are made about them to comment on their portrayals. i'm kind of curious if joe biden himself had anything to say about kinnear's performance. does anyone know if biden has ever commented on kinnear's portrayal of him or the movie in general? i mean, the clarence thomas hearings are a pretty significant part of biden's legacy so there's no way that he isn't aware of the movie.",herequeerandgreat,1h5t9go,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,2024-12-03 17:46:31,0,0.2,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5t9go

It was unlikely that i'd discover the movies i came to love, but i did. I live in a small city in Quebec, and here, it's all about American flicks and movies in French. It took a tourist who came to town to make me discover that beautiful world of foreign movies. 've got nobody to discuss films with, around a cup of coffee. I wish i had! For example, my favorite movie is "" Last life in the universe"" by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang from Thailand. It was released in 2003, and i still watch it once a year. I'm also a big fan of the work of Tsai Ming Liang from Taiwan. His movies hold a very dear place in my heart. Over the years, i've seen tons of movies that were never released in local cinemas, that never went popular here. When i'm trying to make friends, it always kind of upsets people that i don't "" encourage"" our local culture. I mean, i wish i could enjoy it, but i don't. What can one do? I've never come across people here, who know the movies i love, and that's kinda sad.....( just a little)

movies,Gone Baby Gone (2007) is the ultimate moral conundrum on film. Lots of spoilers.,"I first saw Gone Baby Gone the day it opened in theaters, mostly because I was more curious to see how Ben Affleck's directorial debut turned out after four years of him being the punchline of every Bennifer joke in existence throughout that weird period in pop culture. But also because I saw it was an adaptation of another Boston-set Dennis Lehane novel, and Mystic River became an instant favorite of mine in late 2003, and everything I'd read about the novel Gone Baby Gone convinced me this was gonna be another Lehane multi-layered mystery tragedy. I loved it after leaving the theater, but I didn't expect it to stick with me as long as it did. Patrick's decision to get Jack Doyle arrested once he figured out the entire conspiracy behind Amanda's kidnapping making all the other characters hate him for giving Amanda back to her mother is one of the reasons it stuck with me; I kept asking myself over and over if he made the right decision. Was doing the legally correct thing the morally correct choice?

When it was released on DVD and I got to rewatch it, it finally hit me why the ending stuck with me so much; other than Helene going right back to her old self now that Amanda was home safely, Amanda correcting Patrick on her doll's name hit me like a fucking Mack truck. Throughout the entire movie, Amanda being taken while in possession of her doll named Mirabelle is mentioned several times; Patrick, now on babysitting duty because Helene didn't think to hire one for her date with a ""fan"" of her talk show interviews, sees Amanda playing with her doll and asks, ""Is that Mirabelle?"" Little Amanda responds with ""Annabelle"". 

Now, it's entirely possible this was a new doll purchased for Amanda after Mirabelle took a dip in that quarry's lake, but the look on Patrick's face before it cuts to the credits tells me he realized in that moment that **no one,** not even Amanda's aunt who hired and then stiffed Patrick and Angie, knew the actual name of Amanda's doll, since the media reported multiple times that Amanda had her ""doll named Mirabelle"". Helene and Bea likely would've corrected the record that the doll's name was Annabelle since they were the only two characters who actually wanted the mystery of Amanda's kidnapping solved. But no one corrected the record, so ""Mirabelle"" was the name mentioned several times *until* Amanda corrected Patrick; it's that look on his face as [Alexi Murdoch's ""Through the Dark""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPng8o3zDqM) starts playing that made me realize why this movie stuck with me so much. Patrick put his life and relationship on the line to save this little girl for a woman whom everyone else saw as the drug addicted neglectful horror show of a mother she had been, and lost pretty much everything for doing it: Angie left him and hated him for ripping Amanda away from the nice police captain in the nice, safe home and giving her back to Helene and *didn't* even get paid for all the shit he and Angie went through.

Patrick is the ***only*** character who sees how much pain and torment Helene is experiencing, which explains his ultimate decision and why Angie hates him for it; Angie was never around to see how truly sorry Helene was for her actions leading to Amanda's kidnapping. While others, and the audience, may rightfully disagree with Patrick's decision, pay attention to the times when Helene breaks down on your next rewatch, and you'll better understand why Patrick chose the way he did; no one else saw that side of Helene, they just saw the drug addicted neglectful mother, which was used as the justification for a whole bunch of crimes. Also, I think Patrick's Catholic guilt over executing Corwin Earle was another big deciding factor in him trying to do what he saw as the morally and legally correct choice, and Remy's little motivational speech -- which got the ball rolling for Patrick to realize the truth behind Amanda's kidnapping -- outside the hospital did *nothing* to relieve Patrick's guilt, nor did Angie's pride in Patrick for it. And *goddamn* was Ed Harris a fucking powerhouse in that scene outside the hospital after Nick was shot. If 2007 hadn't been so stacked with amazing Supporting Acting nominations, including Casey Affleck himself as Robert Ford, I'm betting Harris would've been nominated, even if he had *zero* chance of beating Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh.

I also think it's interesting how the *major* mystery of the movie is seemingly solved an hour before the movie ends. But as this was yet another Dennis Lehane multi-layered crime mystery, it makes sense. Little Amanda running out that door and happily jumping into Doyle's arms was one of the biggest mind fucks in a movie since finding out that Dave Boyle was &gt;!entirely innocent of Katie Markum's murder, that he'd actually murdered a pedophile\*!&lt; in Mystic River, making [""The last time I saw Dave Boyle was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9k-uO50300) one of the most tragic movie quotes of this first quarter century. Doyle's entire justification speech to convince Patrick not to report this is the centerpiece of the story's main thesis on doing what's legally or morally correct, which is also apparently the main topic of the [novel's sequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_\(novel\)) Angie's tearful ""She's happy here. I saw her."" does nothing to help Patrick's difficult decision.

Fuck, I love this movie. It's a great addition to the New England Tragedy pentalogy dominated by the brothers Affleck: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Manchester by the Sea. Oh, and it needs to be said that Harry Gregson-Williams' scores for this and The Town are some of the most haunting film scores in the last 20 years.

And RIP to both Michael K. Williams -- still weird to see him in a police uniform after knowing him as Omar Little for so long -- and John Ashton, who just passed away in September.

movies,I hated Mulholland Dr.,"I honestly couldn’t stand it and i was so excited to watch it. 
Before someone says it yes, i could understand it. It is not the great plot twist that it is made out to be, the plot twist is quite literally forced down your throat in the last 30 minutes. I get the first 2 hours is meant to be dream like and yes it did feel dream like, it also felt like complete wank. Every half an hour i’d tell myself “it’s going to get better” it didn’t. 
Obviously i’m in the minority with my dislike towards the film so i’m not going to act like i’m completely correct but i feel like most people force themselves to like the film because of its concept and because it’s meant to be confusing, when in reality it isn’t. 
It was all a dream. Okay? NICE, i’m pretty sure i utilised that plot twist when i was 11 and in primary school. 

Edit: 
I realised that i framed my entire dislike about the film around the fact i didn’t think the plot twist was stupendously confusing, i want it to be apparent that that’s not my main reason for disliking the film, it probably came out this way because the majority of praise i see for the film always surrounds this idea of confusion. This is ofcourse not my main reason for disliking the film, that’d be silly, i just couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it. I’ve realised i should’ve been more open and less critical with my dislike for the film, it just isn’t for me.

movies,"People, please stop theorizing that Creeper from Jeepers Creepers is a Mayan God, as an answer to the question of what the Creeper really is. ","It bothers me to this day that people repeatedly put forth the Mayan God theory as an origin story of the Creeper as if the idea of Mayans worshipping the creature informs us as to its true nature. Unless ancient Mayans had the power by worship to physically cause or manifest the thing itself that was to be worshipped, then it's not a helpful explanation of its origin. 

The Creeper must have existed before or independently of the Mayans and therefore is not elementally a Mayan God.  Them possibly worshipping it explains nothing, much like any pagan civilization worshipping the sun in the sky does nothing to explain its formation. 

 When most people ask, what is the Creeper, we are looking for theories on how and when and why it came into existence. Was it naturally birthed? Intelligently designed? Is it of earthly origins? Extraterrestrial? Obviously, we don't have any answer, only guesses. But just saying it's a Mayan God is uninformative.

movies,"It’s about time we talk about LA Story (1991) written and starring Steve Martin, is this his best comedy? ","I remember watching this with my parents when I was younger, prob around 95. I was born 88 so I didn’t have any ability to pick up any of the satire but I remember enjoying it.

I have a bad habit of not rewatching movies I’ve seen since there’s so much out there, no matter how young I was when I first saw it, but my wife showed me a clip from the film off Instagram and we laughed and decided to give it a try and let me tell you it blew us away. We were crying laughing while totally engaged. 

It’s a perfect LA satire and probably the only American Magical Realism film I’ve ever seen (I’m more familiar with the genre coming from Mexico).  Everything is pitch perfect. It’s a tight 91 minutes, edited beautifully, perfect writing from Steve Martin, directed as only I could imagine it and the casting is insane. Every side character and bit part is an amazing character actor from the 90s. 

And the leads are played beautifully by Richard Grant who I know from his performance in Withnail and I. Victoria tennent plays the love interest who is a beautiful actress who got stuck with bad roles most her career, but honestly Sarah Jessica Parker steals the show with her pre-emptive manic pixie dream girl. 

I think this is a movie that although critically acclaimed went over most peoples heads and was forgotten. But I sit here now thinking it’s just leapt to my favorite comedy of all time. It’s so sharp and witty and well executed and magical and of it’s time. I don’t think anyone can argue that Steve Martin is a comedic writing force and it shows in this movie. 

If you haven’t seen it watch it as soon as you can, if you have what do you think about my analysis and how it’s held up and its legacy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

My favorite joke so when Sarah Jessica Parker is trying to seduce Steve Martin and guides his hand down to cup her breast. He squeezes and makes a face and says “your breasts feel weird” and she says “oh, yeah, that’s cause they are real…”

movies,They Live (1988) and it's concept ,"It was in my watchlist for such a long time, finally decided to watch it and blew me away completely. John Carpenter is a visionary! Has anyone of you saw it in the theatres? Or were you there when it was released?

Have you seen Men In Black or The Matrix or Fight Club? This movie felt like it had all of that! And maybe somewhat an inspiration for the movie I mentioned.

They Live dir. By *John Carpenter* is a story of a man, played by Roddy Piper who has come to City in search of a job, but is shocked when he sees the _*reality of this world*_. There are aliens living among us, and they are controlling everything.

Advertisements, News Channels, Politics, everything... everything is a LIE. They are controlling us with different mediums, changing our Subconscious mind and bending our reality, turning us into servants, into Livestock. 

_""We are Sleeping, They are living.""_

If you're someone who is into Illuminati, Secret Society, you'll love this film.

Though some moments felt janky in acting, but that's because the lead is probably the first WWF Turned Actor. Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.

This movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.

The runtime is about 1hr 30mins, and even if you watch this type of films or not, you should watch it just for the concept.",apple15332,1h5d41h,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,2024-12-03 02:35:57,85,0.85,85,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5d41h
movies,Scenes that need to be freeze-framed because blink and you missed it.,"I don't mean movies that have freeze frames themselves, like Clark punching the air at the end of The Breakfast Club. More like you choosing to pause the movie at a particular scene because it's revealing in some way interesting or revelatory or funny. Basically scenes that contain details you may miss the first time viewing.

For example there is that famous head splitting scene from T2 that you need to freeze the frame to see. Guy's head splits before being shot at. [https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png](https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png)

But I prefer more focus on interesting details in scenes than ""mistakes.""

Like in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, there are several scenes that need to be freezed, such as one involving Tom reading the paper. Sort of easter egg hunt thing.

movies,Krazy House (2024) is insane (for fans of Kevin Can F*** Himself),"Set in 1990, Krazy House starts as a typical late-80’s, early 90’s sitcom called The Christians that looks like an amalgamation of both Married with Children and King of Queens. Like those shows, it’s filmed in front of a live studio audience and starts out in a very light hearted, goofy way. Bernie Christian, the matriarch of the family, is juggling his faith and his family. He’s the stereotypical Kevin James kind of protagonist who means well, but continuously causes more problems than he’s solving. When he’s not falling down the stairs (much to the delight of the studio audience), he’s breaking everything that isn’t nailed down, much to the chagrin of his modern, breadwinning wife, Eva. His indifferent, gum smacking daughter Sarah and son Adam, a burgeoning scientist, are opportunities for life lessons about being good people and looking towards the lord. Sounds like the perfect setup for a religious TV show for those times; you know the type - a character walks through the front door and the crowd goes wild?

However, when a trio of Russian handymen show up at the door, things take a turn…and the studio audience doesn’t pop for them. See, Bernie has (as he usually does), caused a mess in the kitchen. His stew bubbles over and he messes up the sink, adding to the kitchen destruction he caused earlier when his arm caught on fire and he lit up the wall. After initially dismissing the Russians, he lets them in to fix the problem…but the problems at the Christian house have only just begun. Once the Russians are in, the show takes an insanely dark turn and it only gets more bonkers from there. While the film starts as a deconstruction of the nuclear family sitcom, it ends as a bloody mess where no one is safe.

This one is for fans of absurd horror/comedies or things skewering nostalgic TV (Late Night with the Devil, Kevin Can F\*\*\* Himself). The pacing isn't great in the second half, but it's still worth checking out.",forcefivepod,1h58ys0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,2024-12-02 23:19:34,8,0.6,8,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,self,t3_1h58ys0

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

movies,Fracture (2007) SPOILERS,"Just seen 2007 Fracture starring Anthony Hopkins for the first time. Great movie until the ending which in my eyes completely ruined the brilliance of the film.

I cannot make sense of the ending and wonder if I am missing something?

1. Firstly, surely all the bullet in his wife's head does is proves Nunally's gun was the murder weapon. There is still nothing linking Crawford to Nunally's gun as it is mentioned in the film that the hotel camera footage has no face. 

2. Also, they switched the shells in the evidence locker so would the gun even match anymore? 

3. The double jeopardy also is very questionable. As I understand it, the case is still substantially the same so Crawford would still not be able to be tried again. 

4. Would any evidence collected in Crawford's house at the end not be void due to the restraining order? Beachum should not be there in the first place and it is essentially breaking and entering as he goes through Crawford's belongings to get the gun.

Great shame as I would have given the film a 9 up to the end which seems to completely ruin the rest of the film.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: San Marino,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Russia. I'm not really sure, if I offended people here, but I did get quite a few downvotes for it. Fortunately, I also got some very good film suggestions (I would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants again) and we also have a winner: ***Сталкер*** (engl. Stalker), a movie by the legendary Andrei Tarkovsky, will receive the next entry in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Today, I know, that it will become much harder to just find a fitting movie, but following the alphabetical order, we move to the next letter - and this time, there are many countries waiting for us that start with an S - an S like **San Marino**, for example. And everytime there will be only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \- 83 (24 Reviews)

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):

&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director’s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):

&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):

&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.

[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):

&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):

&gt;Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):

&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.

[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):

&gt;It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):

&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.

The Independent (100):

&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.

Written and Directed by Robert Eggers:

&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.

movies,Perfectly Normal - The Devastating Reality of Patrick Bateman,"[https://youtu.be/OFUbVsGKRaU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/OFUbVsGKRaU?feature=shared)

This analysis of American Psycho reveals something profound about human nature that most viewers have missed. Why would someone so desperate to fit in also be driven to such extreme violence? The answer isn't what you think. Beyond the surface narrative of materialism and madness lies a hidden pattern. Once you see it, you'll never watch the film the same way again. More importantly, you might never look at human behavior the same way either. For viewers familiar with American Psycho, prepare to see familiar scenes in an entirely new light.

CGI Leia breaks the uncanny valley at the end of Rogue One but it will improve. We need a new ""actor not acting"" definition for such roles. Cameo doesn't fit. Voice actor doesn't fit either. These will be AI/CGI fully generated requiring no input. Ash in Alien: Romulus comes to mind. But with exponential better tech.

Maybe someone has a SAG definition. The writers strike was over AI but I don't think we have any consensus of what the future will be for this type of content.

Contributing likeness?

_____ in an AI performance?

CGI provided by _______ ? (No speaking lines)

It's going to happen. I think nobody knows how it will play out. Maybe it will mark the end of a profession, automated at bottom budget like cartoons.

movies,Everything Everywhere All At Once ending questions [SPOILERS],"I rewatched the movie again the other day and I was left with some questions about the ending that I don't know if there are implied answers, definitive answers, or ""idk it doesn't really matter"" answers.

1. Alpha Waymond said early on that you had to resist the temptation to have extended stays in other dimensions otherwise you introduce paradox. But doesn't the movie end with Evelyn in another dimension? Her original dimension is the one where she doesn't go home from the IRS, punches Deirdre, the IRS has been basically destroyed, there's a lot of murder, Waymond is aware of raccoon-Waymond and raccoon-Joy, and Eveyln pulls Alpha-Joy out of the bagel. As the movie ends, we transition to a dimension where she DID go home, she has the breakdown in the laundromat, Dierdre tells the police to let her go, they relate to each other because of the divorce papers, then she has that last emotional talk with Joy at the car. I can't tell if it is implying that Evelyn is staying in this alternative dimension, or if her original one is still ""active"" for her and she probably goes to jail after all the verse-jumpers (Alpha gong-gong, alpha-Joy, alpha diedre, etc) leave that dimension.

2. When Evelyn is having that talk reconcile with Joy at the car at the end of the movie, is it with HER Joy, or the Jobu Tupaki Alpha-Joy? It's clear in that universe that Alpha-Joy is taking over that universe's Joy quite often, and the speech carries references to other events in the movie and she's shown to be talking with Alpha-Joy in all of the other dimensions too. There's so much emotion flowing in that scene from Joy that I can't tell if Evelyn is reconciling with HER Joy, or Alpha-Joy.",turn_for_do,1h50eme,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,2024-12-02 17:28:44,0,0.37,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Question,spoiler,t3_1h50eme

movies,Heat (1995)….Most beautiful movie line I’ve heard ,"In Heat… there’s 2 parts that stick out to me… many great scenes overall

But when Val Kilmer’s character tells DeNiro “for me the sun rises and sets with her” when talking about his wife and why he can’t leave her. Then at the end… they are both in a relationship where they fight a lot.. both have been unfaithful and she’s ready to turn him in. But when she sees his innocent genuine smile when he sees her, she can’t bring herself to go against him and realizes she still loves him despite all their issues and signals to him to run away. I loved that dynamic

Also the part where the Dennis Heybert’s character (the AllState commercial guy) is sitting with his gf and he feels like a failure. He tells her “why you rolling around with me for?” and starts crying. And she reassures him and tells him because she’s proud of him for trying. 

2 scenes/dynamics that are relatable and just hit deep. One is a relationship that has had many issues and in turmoil but deep down, the two still love eachother.

movies,What do you think of the women characters in John McTiernan's films?,"Hi everyone,

John McTiernan is one of the legends of action cinema, known for iconic movies like *Die Hard*, *Predator*, and *Last action Hero*. His movies are packed with high-stakes tension, larger-than-life heroes, and explosive action, but what about the women in these stories? I’d love to hear your thoughts on how they’re portrayed!

Here are a few women in his films that stand out to me:

* **Holly Gennaro McClane (*****Die Hard*****)**: She’s a career-driven, no-nonsense woman who also happens to be at the heart of John McClane’s emotional journey. Her strength comes across in the way she handles Hans Gruber and leads the hostages, but do you think she’s given enough agency beyond being someone for John to save?
* **Anna (*****Predator*****)**: At first, Anna seems like a typical prisoner-of-war character, but she becomes a key figure in unraveling the Predator’s backstory. She provides a voice for her people and their legends. Does her role feel substantial, or does it fall into the trope of the ""exotic other""?
* **Virginia Baker (*****The Thomas Crown Affair*****)**: Rene Russo’s character is sharp, confident, and undeniably one of McTiernan’s most complex women. She’s Thomas Crown’s equal, which is rare in movies like this. Does she break the mold of how women are portrayed in action/thrillers?
* **Whitney and Irene (*****Last Action Hero*****)**: This movie pokes fun at action clichés, and it’s fun to see the ""screaming damsel"" and ""grounded working-class mom"" tropes being played for laughs. What do you think McTiernan was trying to say about female characters in action films here?

I know McTiernan’s films are heavily focused on their male leads, but I’m curious—do you think the women in his movies hold their own? Which characters stand out to you, and which feel underdeveloped?

Would love to hear your thoughts and insights! 😊",Fennel_Zealousideal,1h4th9d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,2024-12-02 12:06:22,0,0.41,0,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4th9d

movies,Most Fitting Movie for Each Month,"Haven’t seen a post like this, so I figured I’d make one.

What are the most fitting movies for each of the 12 months of the year? Which movies best fit the vibes and aesthetics of each month? Thought this might be an interesting discussion.

January: Something grim and desolate like Fargo would fit pretty good, wintery and cold and all

February: Equally as cold and miserable, but with the added benefit of Valentines Day. Some sort of romance movie with a wintery theme would fit here, especially if set on Valentines Day. Groundhog Day is also a strong contender.

March-April: No specific ideas, these blend together for me. Movies about spring would fit for all of both.

May: Still springtime, but also end-of-school and graduation, so any moviess about graduating or school letting out would fit.

June-Aug: These blend together for me. Plenty of summer movies, but not necessarily specific to a month. I will say, August also has back to school as a potential setting or theme, and I personally associate that month with dreary, overbearing heat and fatigue, the kind of visuals heavily present in the film Falling Down

September: School is fully back in swing, and I would lean towards placing a High School movie or something here.

October: There’s plenty of Halloween movies, but it would have to be one that celebrates fall and the month of October more so than just being scary. The miniseries Over the Garden Wall Would Fit, not sure of other examples 

November: Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be the easy choice for Thanksgiving, but I do wonder if there are any other films that would fire better.

December: There’s a litany of holiday movies of course, but out of all of them there’s have to be one that embodies the month as a whole and not just Christmas time. A plot incorporating the advent season might work, like Christmas Vacation, or a film that incorporates New Years.

I’m struggling with examples here, so I’d be excited to hear what others think",Bonobowl,1h4nfj0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,2024-12-02 05:05:55,1,0.52,1,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4nfj0

The over all jist is that an alien species is traveling here in hopes of having a new home. They are vastly older than us an unimaginably more advanced. Thing is we develop way faster than they do. What took them eons to achieve took us generations. By the time they arrive we will have outpaced them.

It's a fun idea. 

My problem is at one point the species decides to show their power and prove to the world they are real. They do this by turning off the lights. Sun, stars, all poof. No light for humanity.   
  
So why not turn the lights off for a couple years and call it good when they get here? Plantlife would be gone, animals dependent on it, us included would be gone. Most species would not last years in darkness.

movies,Most realistic addiction movies you've seen? I find Requiem for a Dream is not it.,"The movie Requiem for a Dream is quite popular and often receives high ratings and praise from people who just saw it. And it is indeed a well done movie, but it's not a realistic movie about drugs.

I think of it more as a horror movie that uses drugs than a movie about people becoming addicted. It gets details wrong, like heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. That's just one example.

But it works great as anti-drug advertising for people who have never done drugs before. And like I said, it's a pretty good movie from the artistic point of view. Like the visuals are so powerful you can't forget certain scenes for a long time. Combined with the great score, you are left at the end of the film with that sense of horror, of powerlessness in face of terrible doom, of things unraveling rapidly for everyone. It's a nightmare visualized really.

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was.

movies,Nutcrackers (2024) starring Ben Stiller ruined my day,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  
  
Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can’t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he’s ruined.
  
It’s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn’t exist. This is one of those times. The movie’s not entertaining, it’s not dramatic, it’s just pointless. I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it’s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time. You’ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

movies,"The Prestige (2006) is a great magic trick, but once you know the secret, it impresses no one","I recently rewatched The Prestige after many years and although it is a completely different and exciting experience, the third act kinda doesn't make any logical sense.

# Obviously, big spoilers below as I will be discussing the ending so be forewarned...

First of all, I just want to say that I love this movie and I think it's among one of Nolan's best films. This is really nitpicky, so I hope you will read this more as a fan poking holes than a criticism.

There are 4 parts of the story that I either didn't see or overlooked in my first dozen viewings. But now that I've seen it again after many years, I can't ignore these illogical choices.

1. **Borden should have revealed their secret to save his own/brother's life.** I get that they have dedicated their lives to magic and withholding the secret but with the threat of a hanging, they should have said something if it gave them a chance at clemency. The surviving brother wouldn't have been able to keep performing magic anyways because the Alfred identity would also legally be dead; he'd have to start from scratch. And finally, by letting the trick die with one of the brothers, it makes Sarah's death even more meaningless. Taking the secret to the grave only makes thematic sense, but not logical sense.
2. **Cutter kinda kidnaps Jess and no one really cares**. After one of the Borden twins in hanged, the surviving Borden teams up with Cutter to get revenge on Angier. (So I guess he ends up revealing his secret anyways?) They show Cutter sneaking onto Lord Caldlow's estate and grabbing Jess during the day, but Lord Caldlow is murder by Borden at night. If Jess was kidnapped the same day as the murder, wouldn't Caldlow have be extra careful and maybe not go to his warehouse alone? And if Caldlow was murdered the night before the kidnapping, wouldn't the house be extra careful to guard over Jess? This was ignored just to give Borden a happy ending.
3. **Angier didn't need to keep killing this clones.** He literally could have made one clone and lived as twins, thus allowing him to perform the New Transported Man as Borden did. I get the initial shock of shooting the first clone, but to devise a plan to keep killing each sequential clone is illogical. In fact, I'm starting to believe that this was Tesla's initial design in the first place. Tesla doesn't strike me as someone who would build a cloning machine instead of a teleporting machine. I think he wanted to give Angier a perfect double so that he could perform the trick and enjoy the prestige half of the time. But story-wise, it would have been more poetic to drown night-after-night like his late-wife.
4. **Angier couldn't have pulled off the Real Transported Man as shown in the film.** We only see this trick performed twice and both times, you kinda have to turn your brain off.
   1. The first time is when Angier shows off the machine to Cutter and the talent manager. After he activates the machine, Prime-Angier just **disappears**. There was no trap door implemented yet; the talent manager is the one who suggests it. So at this point, there should be two Angiers and no way of killing either one of them.
   2. The second time is during one of the Great Danton's 100-show-run. Prime-Angier falls through the trap door and into the water tank and Borden is framed for supposedly killing him. But why doesn't Clone-Angier complete the trick and reappear for the Prestige? Clone-Angier is all the way up in the wings of the audience so how would he know that Borden would be under the stage? Realistically, Angier wouldn't know which show of the 100 shows should be the one when he needed to fake his own death and not reappear.

All in all, the film WORKS better without logic. I mean it's about magicians and there's a fucking cloning machine in the 1800s. But I mainly wanted to bring these up just to make sure I wasn't going insane. Thanks for taking the time to read.

movies,Visible Crew Members During a Fight Scene - The Rookie (1990),"This memory of a crazy sighting during a movie fight scene has haunted me ever since seeing it in 1990.  I was in the basement of our house watching The Rookie (1990) on PPV.  I think back in those days you had to tune in at a particular time the movie was scheduled to play.  Anyway, I wasn't on any mind altering chemicals, so I can't believe I was seeing things.  I remember a fight scene between a woman and an intruder in her home, and as the camera did a pan shot, following the fighting couple around the room, there was a group of movie crew totally out in the open, and making no attempt to hide.  I remember shaking my head confused and wondering if I just saw what I thought I saw.  

I've done searches online over the years to see if anyone else has a memory of this and I've found nothing.  I don't even see what I thought I saw when I find YouTube clips, or even full streaming versions of the movie.  Is it possible that what I saw really happened, and re-edits were used for all the physical media reproductions of this movie?  This is the last mystery I have memory of in my stupid life.  I want to resolve this.

movies,Me Before You (2016) Discussion,"Watched for the first time last night

The real standout to me was that all the characters seemed extremely relatable and understandable

I got a really gross feeling when it was clear there was emotional cheating going on, yet I still found myself rooting for the main actors. Even until the end, I wished she had broken it off with her boyfriend before moving on, but I couldn't help but wish her and Will would spend their last moments together

It was nice to see a movie, especially knowing this was made in 2016 tackle assisted suicide so well in my opinion. Will had resigned his life, but still provided 6 months to his parents for things to turn around. His parents fought on both sides to help and stop him. Louisa's mum also was vehemtly against it and didn't want her daughter being involved as she knew this would upset her

My favourite scene overall was Louisa coming home to nod her head ""no"" towards her sister. I've had situation that resulted in a near identical scene and I knew how much that would've hurt

I really enjoyed all the characters and the few bits of humour sprinkled throughout. The scenes were all engaging that what was originally ""I'm juat gonna sit here, you watch what you want"", turned into me glued to the screen after the first minute

Overall, I don't think this movie has any real flaws and I'd consider it a 10/10. I was very surprised I had never heard of this one and even more surprised to see the bad reception regarding the assisted suicide topic. I do wonder how I would've felt had I watched it in 2016

movies,How did you feel about Prisoners from Villeneuve?,"TONS of spoilers about the film:

Hi, let me tell you how it went for me first because I need to vent. 
Sunday night, I wanted a thriller that would keep me on the edge, fun as I could say. After one hour, I felt so helpless for the characters, just as they might feel. After the movie, I just feel like it was such a sad, cold, depressing tragedy about unhealed trauma. Keller need of being in absolute control and completely selling his soul in order to not being hurt more. The guy still trying to do the mazes from when he was kidnapped. Alex Jones who was kidnapped and tortured. And perhaps the most subtely tragic, Detective Loki whole past of being abused that might have kept him from suspecting the woman. I believe that’s how he was didn’t see Alex suffering or the guy with the maze lighting a candle or acting their deaths. 

All that to say, this film left me heartbroken for them. It’s a good thing with how these stories tend to be sensationalized through crime documentaries etc. But I would not say it’s a thriller, or a tragedy/drama with some real thriller mechanics.

movies,How many movies have you seen in your lifetime? ,"I've asked myself this and as an avid movie goer, I thought the number would be much higher and find others tend to overestimate. 

I sat down and over time, did my best to list out every movie I have ever seen. I tried to narrow it down to movies I know for a fact I have watched beginning to end. Not ""oh, I saw 70% of it on television once"" or ""eh, I think i watched it when I was a kid."" 

Especially for things like ubiquitous Disney films. Everyone is seemingly fimiliar with Bambi, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, etc, but I think the number of people who watched these movies in their entirety is lower. And while I myself couldnt exactly remember a time where I didnt know these characters, I also couldnt remember taking the time to watch them as a kid. So I didnt count them. Unless I knew 100% I watched it. 

I also tried not to count television specials unless they were feature length and billed as a movie. Does Channel Chasers from the Fairly OddParents count as a movie or is it a tv special? It sounds dumb but unless it was billed as a movie, I tried to avoid counting it. Kim Possible The Movie: So The Drama may only be like 70 minutes and aired straight to Disney Channel, but I counted it. 

So after counting movies I'd seen under the criteria and with a huge help from Letterboxd, I was able to pin down a rough estimate: 

At the age of 27, I have seen about **1000-1100 movies**. I definitely watch more movies I havent ever seen now than I did maybe a decade ago so I am wondering how that number will look in the next 25 years of my life.

In my college days, I'd see roughly 40-70 movies a year? While not much at all relative to most film lovers, I would say definitely a higher number than the average person. This year, the number is over 100, and will likely finish at about 115-120. The number of movies I watch per month tends to fluctuate greatly. Sometimes I get more into television or video games or too busy with social life to be watching movies. In March, for instance, I had only seen one movie and it was Dune 2.

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,The Three Musketeers/D’Artagnan,"This is the 2023 French production… I was interested because of Eva Green as “MiLady”.    The reliable Vincent Cassel is “Athos”.

They went for the dirty and gritty look for this one, no colorful costumes for our heroes.   Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  

We all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.
So I wonder… Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   

I can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale…. But I found this rather jarring.

movies,"""Slowly spiraling downward into destruction"" films","I love films where we watch people's lives fall apart at the seams as their inner flaws and bad choices gradually bear fruit. Done best when a small group of family members or friends dip their toes into crime and are unable to handle the consequences. Call it schadenfreude or just the pleasure of watching someone else's life go worse than mine.

Classics of the genre:

Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.

A Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).

The Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.

Honorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.

Bad Examples: I did not like 'The Boy and The Beast' because it starts out with the kid full of anger expressing how much he hates everything and everyone. Not something I'd want my kid to watch. Poupelle of Chimney Town starts off with a terribly loud and annoying musical scene.

Good Examples:

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

Long Way North

April and the Extraordinary World

Sirocco and the Kingdom of Winds

Kensuke's Kingdom

Big Fish and Begonia

Wolfwalkers

The Secret of Kells

Song of the Sea

My Father's Dragon

The Magician's Elephant

Eleanor's Secret

Sea Beast


These classic animated films:

Treasure Planet

Atlantis

Road to El Dorado

Titan A.E.

The Iron Giant

Prince of Egypt

Films like Encanto, Moana, Rayaa, etc. are all very good but are not exactly underrated films.

I feel like this movie missed a huge opportunity for a clever open ending that invites discussion.

At the very end, when Tobias and Elle are breaking the eggs on the kitchen, the camera films them from the side and leaves enough space behind the father to make the audience wonder if Almut is going to come in, but alas, she is gone.

I believe a more poignant ending would be to have her come in and hug him from behind, and then the movie cuts to credits, except: she has hair.

This would make for a perfect use of the movie's non-chronological storytelling, as we wouldn't be able to tell if she surived or if this scene is set in the past.",Arkanteseu,1h422q9,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h422q9/we_live_in_time_making_use_of_the_lack_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h422q9/we_live_in_time_making_use_of_the_lack_of/,2024-12-01 12:18:04,4,0.59,4,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h422q9

Those movies I think found the groove between too serious and too campy. I'd love for the new Bond to be a little more fun. 

I'd also like to see Bond girls that James doesn't actually fall in love with. I didn't have a problem with this or anything in previous films, I just think it's been done to death with OHMSS, the Spy Who Loved Me, Casino Royale, Spectre and No Time to Die. 

Bringing back the supporting actors from the Craig era would also be one of my personal hopes. Such as, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Everyone else can be new, but I would like to keep Bond tradition of keeping the same supporting actors. If I could only keep ONE actor, I'd say Whishaw because I'd love to see him stick around for decades like Desmond Llewyn did.

* Their physical body (often monitored or observed by others)
* What they're experiencing in their mind

movies,Cerebral Palsy Blues ,"Having a disability doesn't mean you can't live a life full of creativity, adventure, and inspiration. Johan Öberg is a shining example of this. Despite living with a severe form of cerebral palsy, Johan has never let his condition define him or hold him back.

While he can't play the guitar in the traditional way, Johan has developed his own unique method of making music. For him, it’s not about perfection but about expressing himself and sharing his passion for sound in a way that’s entirely his own.

Johan also has a deep love for speed and the water. Though he needs assistance getting into a boat, once he’s seated, he takes full control. Steering the boat on his own, he experiences the thrill and freedom that come with gliding across the waves.
Beyond his personal hobbies, Johan has used his life experiences to inspire and connect with others. He’s authored several books that offer a glimpse into his world and the challenges he’s faced. Additionally, his online community of over 13,000 followers on Facebook has grown into a platform for encouragement, creativity, and resilience.

Johan’s story is proof that having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t push boundaries, inspire others, and live a life filled with purpose and joy.

* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. 
* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.
* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. 
* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head.

movies,How to approach Salò (1975)?,"I have a problem with Salò that I'm struggling with and I would appreciate some advice.

I am a divorced man in my middle age with a son of seventeen. He's a smart kid and we have recently started bonding over our love of cinema. He is a junior of the local Multimedia and Graphic Technology Secondary School with a motion picture specialisation. He plans on studying motion picture directing at the academy in two years time.

With his course set he set upon expanding his film education and he recently approached me with a list of movies he'd like to see. His favorite movie is Metropolis and he enjoys watching and talking about expresionist films. Of course his list includes other movies such as M, and I also suggested The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. 

He also wants to see A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Z (by Kosta Gavras) and ""some other films that are not as interesting"". As I was intrigued, I asked which films he was thinking of he volountered Sátántangó (which at 439 minutes he doesn't expect me to watch with him) and, oh yes, Salò.

And I did not react well to news of Salò, as I don't think there is a benefit for a seventeen year old in seeing the movie. It was a deeply disturbing watch for me and I was in my forties, I don't really see how a kid his age would be equipped to even process the message of the film with sufficient life experience. I did not forbid him from seeing the movie, as that really doesn't achieve anything. I would like to help lay some ground work before he goes into it. I think that he should see Clockwork first. And I'd like some suggestions for other thematicaly similar films that would help him gradually ramp up the intensity for Salò. Should I hae him read someting beforehand? He is sufficiently aware of the Italian Social Republic, I am more concerned about psychological aspects of the story.

Or should I just let him watch it cold and have a discussion about the depravity of the human condition later?

movies,cujo from cujo is a tragic villain.,"in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.

for starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.

things get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. ""it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.""

there's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!

even though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",herequeerandgreat,1h3ltsb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,2024-11-30 20:40:45,36,0.72,36,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ltsb

movies,A Different Take on The Notebook's Ending,"

Hi Everyone, 

I recently watched *The Notebook* and found myself grappling with some discomfort about the ending. So, I decided to write my own version, one that feels more poignant and bittersweet, yet complete. Here’s my version:

Instead of Noah reading the story, it would be Lon. In my version, Allie chooses Lon, but her life with him isn’t entirely fulfilling—at least, not in her heart. She keeps a diary where she writes about how things could have been if she had chosen Noah instead. Her imagined life, where she paints, with Noah becomes her escape, a parallel world where her heart resides.

Years later, as Allie begins to suffer from her illness, Lon finds the diary. Understanding how deeply she lived in her imagination, he decides to read her the diary—not as the story of their life, but as the life she dreamed of. Lon does this out of love, knowing it might bring her comfort and help her remember.

One day, as Lon reads, something shifts in Allie. She remembers her real life with Lon—their marriage, their children, and the life they built together. Overcome with guilt, she apologizes to him, admitting that while she always wanted to love him completely, part of her heart was always with Noah. Lon, being the loving and compassionate man he is, forgives her without hesitation.

Then, Allie asks Lon about Noah. Lon tells her that Noah built a successful life, never married, and now owns a large mill, but is gravely ill. Touched by her lingering feelings, Lon promises to take her to see Noah the next day.

But fate intervenes. The next morning, they hear that Noah passed away during the night. When Allie and Lon visit his home, she is overcome with memories of their time there. The weight of her emotions becomes too much, and she quietly passes away, never to wake again.",Chahes03,1h3laak,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,2024-11-30 20:16:01,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h3laak

2. not properly searching the apartment the second time you were called and missing the dead body

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Romania,"Hell there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Portugal - and as in the day before, I really have to say a big thank you to all the participants: We got more than 60 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. I'm also looking forward to another movie on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Capitão Falcão*** (engl.: *The Portuguese Falcon*) even have a fitting title in the english distribution. Never heard about it, but it seems to be a funny movie that also shows a little of the Portuguese culture.

Today, we skip Q in alphabetical order (no country starting with Q in Europe) and directly go to R... in this case, R like **Romania** for the start. As always, there are only two rules in the game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Elisha Cuthbert absolutely shines in this role. Her charcater Danielle isnt just eye candy...she’s confident but also vulnerable. Elisha makes you care about her journey and choices. She is the heart of the movie. 

Timothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.

Also have to call out Elis best friend ""Matthew""... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next"" at the end

the movie balances humor with some surprisingly emotional moments so well and it captures the early 2000s vibes in the best way possible. The soundtrack, the style, the overall feel. it really is a time capsule in the best way.

In part 2, we look at somewhat more famous films such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the great religious epic The Seventh Seal, the 50s drive-in classic The Blob, a truly great Dracula adaptation and what is often considered Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.

However, I like the less crazy things about him that add to what a creep he is. The way he eats the shrimp was pretty gross, which is impressive in a movie that’s full of so many disgusting moments.

movies,movies of 2025 that you may not be aware are being made,"night of the zoopocalypse

clive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.

grendel

john gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.

high and low

when it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.

the long walk

in addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.

the lost bus

""A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the 2018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history."" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. 

eddington

ari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.

the battle of baktan cross

when it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.

wildwoods

wildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.

the phoenician scheme

leave it to wes anderson to make espionage funny. his upcoming film the phoenician scheme is an espionage comedy drama that was written by anderson and roman coppola. though the plot is unknown at the moment, the film's cast is known and, par for the course for an anderson film, the cast is full of famous actors. benicio del toro, michael cera, bill murray, riz ahmed, tom hanks, benedict cumberbatch, scarlett johansson, rupert friend, willem dafoe, and bryan cranston. production began in march and ended in june.

movies,"I know I'm about 17 years too late, but 28 weeks later was an absolute dumpster fire of a zombie film. (Rant) (Spoilers)","
Just to begin, I have had some heavy consideration after getting some comments that have changed my opinion about this movie.

This movie was not a “dumpster fire”. It was actually a pretty entertaining film that shows some new and also old ideas.

I now believe that this movie was just a little underwhelming, considering it was a sequel to a great movie like 28 days later. If it was a movie of its own, then it would be a solid B tier movie, but it just can’t really live up to how 28 days later made me feel personally.

And now, onto my heavily flawed rating on how this movie was.

&gt; Starting off, how was Don even allowed to enter his (ex) wife's holding area? (He left her to die so I consider that as divorce.)
I know he has the ""all entry"" key card because of his status, but she is of EXTREME importance and danger. She should've only been allowed to be seen by scientists or guards.

&gt; Speaking of guards, why was NOBODY guarding her?
She is possibly one of the LAST infected humans on Earth, and she is left by herself. As shown in the movie, she caused another outbreak, and I bet if there was ONE guard in the room with her, none of this would've happened.

&gt; Why would the producers kill her off right then and there?
She was killed MINUTES after she was rescued, and it would been a better choice to see her tell her children what Don had done to her, and THEN she dies.

&gt; How did she survive the attack in the safe house anyway?
They don't just leave you alone if you are infected, as shown by Don, he literally murders her ON THE SPOT after seeing her. So if she was bitten in the safe house, they surely would've mad sure she had turned.

&gt; They gave absolutely NO warnings about the flashing lights, I'm just lucky I'm not epileptic. Gave me a terrible headache after though.

&gt; Why would you direct a crowd of people into what would basically be a slaughterhouse, and the LOCK them in there with NO guards and NO lights?
Nobody protected them, the majority of them were infected within a matter of minutes, and then the guards outside were basically a firing squad.

&gt; Why didn't Scarlet just say ""These children could lead to a cure."" Or something instead of just stating her rank?
I'm pretty sure if I was a guard and I heard that, I would just let her through.

&gt; Why does NOBODY have proper protection against bites/blood sprays?
They have had this infection for a whole 7 MONTHS and not a single person has proper protection against bites. If a normal person was in a zombie apocalypse, they would at least wrap magazines around their arms or something to protect themselves.
If somebody had worn a riot suit/armored hazmat suit, they would probably survive an attack.

&gt; Why didn't they just burn the entirety of Britan/surrounding infected areas to begin with?
I'm pretty sure most life wouldn't survive being turned into ash, other than Dan somehow.

&gt; How did Dan even survive? I know we see him standing behind a building so he doesn't get charred, but there was fire coming from all directions.

&gt; I get it, nuking the city most likely wouldn't work, or would lead to Britan AND France/any surrounding countries being eradicated, but that's better than the possibility of that ENTIRE side of the globe being infected.

&gt; It has been less than a year, and people are already moving back into Britan. It hasn't even been full cleared yet, let alone the corpses even fully decomposing, and people are moving back in like it's nothing.

&gt; Why didn't Sergeant Doyle (Stupid haircut) tell General Stone (Helecopter man) that Andy (The literal only cure in existence) is able to stop all of this?
That would've stopped a lot of trouble.

&gt; Is it even possible to outrun a fireball??

&gt; How does one, nearly 180-200 lb man, make an entire helicopter go out of control just by grabbing the skids?

&gt; Furthermore, how did this idiot not get infected while all of those zombies were being blended into a person salad?
He was DRENCHED in blood head to toe, and it looked like he was still okay, but I may be wrong.

&gt; How did any of those infected survive being cut into peices? They can't survive a 5.56x45 round to the chest, but can be split in half and still try to crawl around? These are still humans we're talking about, even if they are infected. Humans usually don't survive being chopped in half.

&gt; If infected can be killed by gas, why didn't the military... I dunno... GAS THE ENTIRETY OF BRITAN FROM THE START? THAT WOULD SAVE A LOT MORE LIVES.
And yes, I know what wind does to gas, but it could help if they even tried from the beginning.

&gt; A thin shirt does not save you from poisonous gas, just look at the soldiers from WW1-WW2 and you could guess how that would go. (When they were gassed in the trenches they had special masks drenched in special chemicals to counteract the gasses effects, any who didn't put these on could be dead in minutes, or suffer severe respiratory damage.) So a shirt probably won't stop much.

&gt; Why would you burn a clearly UNINFECTED man to death? At least have the decency to shoot him to death, then burn him.

&gt; I kinda get the helicopter shooting at their car, with the ""Kill all on sight order"" and all, but I don't think any infected can drive a car.

&gt; Why would you SCREAM into a dark building? Scarlet got killed because she was yelling. (Idk why I put this here tbh.)

&gt; The trope of ""I'm gonna jumpscare you when you turn back instead of just killing you when you're not paying attention."" Is a little overused, but again, this movie came out in 2007.

&gt; It was terrifying seeing her be bashed to death with her own gun, but why haven't more infected done this sort of thing? That's showing higher brain function, and this could’ve been used more often. I guess Don being the only infected to use a weapon just adds to the shock value.

&gt; Why would Tammy just drop the gun after seeing her brother get bitten and therefore (presumably) infected?

&gt; Why would you leave your only form of defense? You don't know the next time you'll need a gun.

&gt; One does not just ""brush off"" being bitten in the throat, let alone a child. Like yeah, you can't turn into a zombie, but that doesn't mean you can't bleed out either.

This would’ve been better if it was not a sequel to such a great movie as its former.
In comparison, 28 days later was a much better movie imo, with much better storytelling and plot.

I rebuke the title calling it a “dumpster fire” and it was more of just a let down.

movies,Come and See (1985) is not anti-war,"I've just finished this masterpiece and I'm still at awe, one of the best movies ever made, a perfect film. About it being an anti-war film, I don't think it is, and this doesn't mean anything in terms of quality, it is also not a moral judgement, I don't see a problem with it AT ALL, it's simply an observation about the movie's themes/message.

So first, what does it mean to be ""anti-war"", in my opinion it should deromanticize AND not condone war in any way, the former is done, the latter I don't think it is. The movie shows the barbarity of the nazi regime, every single nazi in the movie is absolutely disgusting and inhumane, while practically every soviet is an everyday person doing what is necessary to survive. The movie at no point questions any soviet policy during the war, in the movie they are justified at every point, even the boy robbing the cow can be sympathized and understood easily.

And see, this is not a problem, we know the horrors of the nazi war machine, we know that 25million soviets died in WW2, they have every right to be pissed and to tell the story that way, which brings me to what I think is one of the main messages of the movie: **sometimes war can be justified.** The movie shows: ""the nazis are attacking us and it is either us or them"", what brought the end of the nazis? It was war, not pacifism or diplomacy, no, **war.** Particulary the USSR, we know they were the main protagonists in the defeat of the nazis, that's history, and the movie came out on the 40 year aniversary of the soviet victory. The movie ends with the soviets marching together towards nazi defeat. With the kid shooting Hitler's portrait. Even when they had the upper hand on the nazis they were pretty humane, considering the level of barbarity that was shown towards them throughout the movie, they quickly shot them and moved on, no sick games, no torture, etc. This is a very nationalistic and pro-soviet movie, and again this is not a moral judgement, this is not a flaw, it's just the story they chose to tell and it is a masterpiece.

I think a truly anti-war movie should portrait war as something pointless and unnecessary from the pov of the everyday man like in Grave of the Fireflies. The war reflects on the kids as something that only harms them, they have no reason to engage in it, they don't understand it, it happened for the political/economic interests of the japanese empire. We know from history that Japan was more in the wrong than not and they were the agressors most of the time, so the movie shows this nihilistic perspective in which the war serves only to cause suffering even to japanese citizens and the kids die for nothing, they are not remembered, what happened during the film is absolutely pointless, as was the war. Another alternative would be to make a pro-peace movie, I like a quote from Coppola about it:

&gt;*But an anti-war film, I always thought, should be like The Burmese Harp – something filled with love and peace and tranquillity and happiness*

movies,My Fascination with Alfred Hitchcock and My Top 5 Hitchcock Films,"It was in the 1990s when I got my first VCR. I was beyond excited - just imagine, no more waiting for the cable guy to show you something good. Back then, there was no internet to help me figure out what to watch, so I headed to the local video store. I asked a friend who worked there that I wanted to watch an interesting mystery thriller and asked for suggestions. He told me to pick any Hitchcock movie - I couldnt go wrong. Thats when I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock.

Since that day, Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors. His mastery of suspense, mystery, and thriller genres is what makes him stand out. I think I’ve watched almost every Hitchcock film (at least the ones released after 1940), and each one has been a joy to revisit. Whats even more impressive is how well his movies have aged - something I can't say about a lot of films from that era. Hitchcock’s films have been remade and adapted countless times. Directors and writers still draw inspiration from his work. Even today!

Here’s a list of my top 5 Hitchcock films. If you haven’t seen them, I highly recommend you do. It wasn’t an easy task narrowing it down because I love so many of his films, but these are my absolute favs.

1. Psycho Psycho was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It was the first movie I saw on my new VCR. I’m not exaggerating when I say I got goosebumps during the final reveal. I literally jumped out of my chair, wondering what just happened. A fun fact: Psycho was the first movie ever made in the US to show a toilet flushing. Yep, you read that right - something as simple as a toilet became a big deal back then.
2. Rebecca I’ve always loved the book by Daphne du Maurier, so when I heard Hitchcock adapted it into a film, I was both excited and a little skeptical. Typically, I’m not a fan of book-to-movie adaptations, but Hitchcock did an amazing job. The movie brings the eerie atmosphere of the novel to life, with strong performances and a perfect blend of tension and mystery. Highly recommend it.
3. Rear Window Rear Window is an absolute masterpiece. Stewart and Kelly lead a stellar cast in this film, where Stewart plays a man stuck in a wheelchair, spying on his neighbors through the rear window. What he sees gets him tangled up in something far more sinister than he bargained for. The suspense is built slowly but steadily. What unfolds after is such a treat to watch. It’s been adapted and remade several times, with one of the most famous being Disturbia - not a bad film in itself but the original is much much better.
4. Strangers on a Train This one really kept me guessing. The premise was intriguing - two men meet on a train, and one proposes a strange idea: if they each commit a murder for the other, they’ll be in the clear. It’s one of those thrillers that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering how it’ll all unfold. The film does a great job of playing with psychological tension and moral dilemmas.
5. Dial M for Murder I saw Dial M for Murder a little later in my Hitchcock journey. Actually, I watched The Perfect Murder, a remake starring Michael Douglas, before I saw this. While I thought the remake had a decent plot, it didn’t quite measure up. Then, I read somewhere that it was copied from a Hitchcock movie - Dial M for Murder. I saw it and absolutely loved it. The plot was similar with some differences, but the execution was so much better. It was a fun, thrilling watch that had me hooked from start to finish.

It would be remiss of me not to mention some of my other favorite Hitchcock films, like Birds, Rope, Notorious, Spellbound, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. These could easily make a top-five list on another day.

If you haven’t seen his work and like watching movies, I suggest you watch his work. You won’t regret it.

movies,Taken - Lenore,"I am only about 20 minutes into Taken 1, and I know that Lenore eventually dies, but I think that she gets back with Bryan first right? So I wanted to know if she gets better, because right now she is so annoying. Like from what I get, their marriage wasn't good because of his job, and I get that sucks, but she is acting like she is the best person/parent. I don't know, she just comes across stuck up, but maybe she is a really good mom. Like Bryan just found out that Kim was following U2 around Europe, and Lenore knew, and that's crazy to me. He is a worried father, and even when they were in the restaurant (which I can understand why Kim wouldn't understand, she young and really wants to go), Lenore was acting like his concerns weren't valid. Then when he find out she was lying, she still acts like he is insane and paranoid. It just really bothers. And also, not a huge thing, but in the beginning of the movie, at Kim's birthday, her entire attitude was just off-putting. Is this just me?

movies,Was Inception About Coping With Dementia and Grief? ,"Would love to get the community's perspective on a different angle on Inception. 

There was this recurring quote in the movie from both Cobb and Mal throughout the movie: 

""You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you when the train will take you, cuz you'll be together.""

What if the movie is really about a failed suicide pact and dementia? 

I think the whole sequence from 2:12:45 to 2:13:50 redefines the whole movie.  This is the final scene with Mal after the kick is underway where Cobb reminds Mal that they had already grown old together and we see older versions of them walking in a city holding hands (with wedding rings) and then seeing the hands clasped together and rumbling on what looks like train tracks (with wedding rings, but you have to zoom in).  We know from Nolan that any scenes with the wedding ring was real life.

Two big prevailing themes in the movie centers on ""an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone"" (2:16:03) and taking a leap of faith.   Perhaps old Mal had dementia (in the above sequence Cobb tells Mal that she doesn't remember) and perhaps they planned a suicide by train (old hands on the train tracks) and he couldn't take the leap of faith and left her on the tracks at the last second leaving Cobbs now an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone and the movie reflects his reconciliation and grief.   Perhaps the whole movie is a dream of old Cobb sedated while in hospice but that's just my speculation.  Mal kinda pokes at the fourth wall a bit in the sequence from 1:59:59 to 2:00:51 which highlights how everything in the plot had conveniently come together so nothing is real.

movies,Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo',"Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic ""stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen"" narrative. 

This is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. 

The film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. 

What I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.

The story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.

This is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate. Highly recommend.",keepfighting90,1h34ecp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,2024-11-30 04:20:44,310,0.84,310,0,79,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h34ecp

It was not interesting, there were no a-ha moments and I was overall really disappointed. I watched us which I thought was better than nope, but still nowhere near the quality and genius of get out.

movies,"Ben Stiller could be thought of as more of a great director than as a comedic actor, in ten years' time","So Ben Stiller, damn he can pull some moves behind the camera.

He's known more as a comedic actor - but I think in ten years, he could be thought of as more of a great director. 

I'm currently watching 2018 mini-series Escape of Dannemora, and it is HBO level good. Based on a true story of a prison break. Really gritty. Starring top actors giving some incredible performances, Benicio del Toro, Patricia Arquette and Paul Dano. The scenes are all so captivating. Just a really well put together show all round. 

Then of course, there's Severance. Just stupendous, a real fine wine of a tv show. Gloriously quirky and compelling. Great to see Adam Scott beng given something more meaty to work with. He's such a great straight comic actor that it makes perfect sense he could play such a nuanced, thoughtful character. Plus, it's just such a great ensemble drama. 

Stiller's projects seem to all have a real subtext, and you see that in most scenes.

My points on these shows is that Stiller clearly can unlock special abilities in his actors to really explore a scene, a feeling or a premise and give it so much more depth

These are all really interesting performances and fascinating projects. 

I think as long as Severance doesn't continue to take hellishly long and wraps up after an appropriate amount of seasons, Stiller could go on to make a few more really renowned dramatic films or tv shows.

Plus, he has an impressive back catalogue of directing credits on more comedic movies, dating back to the 90s. Including The Cable Guy, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. You don't make these great comedy movies without having incredible directing chops.

That’s the scene where he slowly describes to Leo’s character Amsterdam, basically, his life story. What he’s all about, how he’s managed to survive. 

Another scene like that is the famous Jaws scene with Robert Shaw where he talks about his encounter with sharks as a WW2 soldier after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk in shark-infested waters: 

https://youtu.be/u9S41Kplsbs

Another one of the most famous is Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, relaying his visions and experiences of horror in war - the disturbing aftermath after he and his group inoculate a village - and using that to justify and rationalize his own brutality:

movies,"Benji ""A Real Pain"" (2024) ","While seeing this film I noticed small bits of things I tend to do that correlated with Benji (Kieran Culkin's) behavior. Just like Benji I am very extroverted and a happy person in general, but there are moments when certain things or situations just get to me very deeply and I get very emotional. I'm hypersensitive which means I enjoy life to the fullest and is grateful for the little things in life but I can also get sad for the littlest things which makes me suffer unconditionally. I've never met or seen anyone like me until I saw this movie. I was evaluating every single person's reaction to Benji's way of being, non of them wanted to be near him since the risk of him having a tantrum or having an emotional burst...This made me realize why I don't have any close friends or people around me, seeing the movie made me realize that if I had a benji I wouldn't wanna be near him or myself with the fear that they could hurt me in emotional and mental ways; being there for those types of people is very draining. They tend to be very negative towards themselves and feel like they don't deserve certain things. These negative feelings toward themselves makes them jealous of everyone since they feel like they aren't capable of deserving true love and real happiness. I am writing this description based on the things I saw he does in the movie as well as what correlates with me. I've been reading reviews like crazy to find a diagnoses because he has the same issues as me. He was diagnosed with bipolar disease and took medications but I've been told I don't have bipolar and would never take meds to solve a mental or emotional issue. I've been in a personal journey to help myself since my mother told me she prefers to protect herself from me since it's very tiring to be near me. The good times are amazing but she says she senses evil and negativity just as if I wanted to ruin a good time and have everyone focus on myself. I struggle with self-destruction tendencies since I was a kid and a part of me  thinks I do this because I feel like I'm not good enough and all the overthinking gets together and makes me burst with emotions or doing something to hurt myself or others just so I could stay alone and suffer. I think benji and I just both struggle with self-destruction tendencies. My psychologist told me that my personal self-love journey is going to help a lot and I won't be able to let other people love me until I learn to love myself. Personally I'm very happy that I've become self aware of all the people i've hurt in my life but most importantly myself, I'm glad I finally made the choice to help myself and stop being the victim. I'm a bit nervous because I've never been to truly love myself even after 22 years, I've always been quite negative about my body and even if I fix something it's never good enough, I just need to love who I am and I'm sure I can get through it with the right professional help.",Intrepid_Computer_68,1h2tzux,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,2024-11-29 19:41:26,0,0.44,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h2tzux
movies,Quotables,"Continuing a discussion from last night's Thanksgiving dinner, do you think movies have gone down in quality and quantity of Quotables?

I think the single most quotable film of all time is The Big Lebowski.  Pretty much every line in that film is God-Tier quotable.

Some films only have a few Quotables but they're just as epic. Aliens for example has ""they mostly come out at night"" and ""game over, man!"" which are both gold.

The great comedies are masterpieces of Quotables.  Airplane! and Hot Fuzz in particular (along with the already-mentioned Lebowski) are packed with incredibly awesome Quotables.

But what happened to cinema?  These days you barely even get a single great Quotable even in good movies.  I loved both the new Dune films, but I can't think of a single good quotable in either one.  ""I love you 3000"" is an ass-tier quotable.  ""On your left"" like that's not even fun, what else has Marvel even got?  ""I am Iron Man"" I guess but that movie is now 14 years old and the first one they made, and back when films still came with quotables.

I think we need to do something, write letters to the studios maybe or holler at James Gunn on twitterX.  Great one-liners are an important part of the moviegoing experience but nobody drops them anymore it seems.

Does this even make sense to anyone else?l or dod I just eat too much turkey yesterday and the tryptophan is still messing with my mind?

Which classic films would genuinely NOT benefit from a sequel, and WHY?   (Unless it’s obvious to all, might you tell us WHY you offer your answer?) 

These days, many (almost all) movies are made with a sequel or trilogy in mind. Even if the story ends with the destruction of the galaxy, there’s always room for that follow-up (and the potential for additional ca$h). 

In the past, movies were not created with this mindset.  Which movies are notably Not sequel ready?  In other words and in a roundabout way, how have sequels affected the quality of the movies being made today?

In my thinking, _Groundhog Day_ is a good example.  The story is completely wrapped up by the end.  No sequel necessary or wanted.

And as always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Cities as Side Characters: A Cinematic Love Letter to Urban Landscapes,"Ever noticed how some movies make a city more than just a backdrop? Some directors go beyond showing a skyline or a monument. They dive deep into the city’s culture, spirit, and unique character to weave it into the story.

Bollywood has some brilliant examples of cities playing side characters:

Wake Up Sid gives us a heartfelt glimpse into Mumbai’s monsoons and its never-ending life.

Kahaani celebrates Kolkata’s festive chaos and mysteries.

8 AM Metro dives into Hyderabad’s beauty while exploring human emotions.


Even Hollywood embraces this concept:

Before Sunrise romanticizes Vienna’s quiet charm.

Midnight in Paris takes us through the dreamy streets of the city of love.

La La Land reflects LA’s bittersweet relationship with dreams.


From the ghats of Varanasi in Masaan to the neon-lit streets of Tokyo in Lost in Translation, cities have so much to say without uttering a single word.

movies,An Observation about the Sixth Sense 25 Years Later,"Yadda, yadda, spoilers.

When Sixth Sense was released it looked like a generic ghost story movie which I had no interest in until a friend, whose opinion I respected, told me I **had** to see it, but wouldn't tell me why. I would bet that a number of other people at that time had something like a similar experience; either they heard from a friend or read some reviews or just saw the box office numbers and realized this movie had something going for it. So I went with a few other friends and we were blown away by the ending, naturally. Recently, I remembered the conversation we had immediately following the movie and I recalled that all of us said the same thing: just before the ending, we thought it was a fine film, but didn't see what the big deal was –and *then* we saw the twist and were just as thrilled as everyone else.

And that recollection made me realize something either truly ingenious about Shyamalan or that he just got incredibly lucky. Take your pick.

That is: up until the end, it's not really that great of a film at all. I mean, it's fine. A few good jump scares, definitely some creepy scenes, but without *that* ending, the film is a C+ or maybe a B. However, preceding that awesome twist with a just an okay film completely misdirects the audience into thinking this is, in fact, just a mediocre picture. But then when the twist happens and we're all blown away. It's the basically the ""Yeah, I'm not doing anything; don't worry about it, everything is just normal"" misdirection that magicians use all the time and, like in a good magic ~~trick~~ illusion, lulling or even boring the audience into thinking they know what's going to happen is makes what actually does happen all the more amazing.

So maybe Shyamalan made what he thought would have been a great ghost story all along, but just got really, really lucky that he thought of a really great ending. Or maybe he intentionally kept the first half fairly low-key/stakes to stun us at the end.

Take your pick.",Jackieirish,1h2p6eg,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2p6eg/an_observation_about_the_sixth_sense_25_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2p6eg/an_observation_about_the_sixth_sense_25_years/,2024-11-29 16:12:02,0,0.14,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2p6eg

movies,After rewatching Inception my opinion on the ending has now changed forever,"I always believed that Leo was actually awake at the end. Nolan just showed us the spinning top as it was about to topple over before cutting to black and ending the movie. 

After rewatching the movie for who knows how many times I fully believe now that Leo is still dreaming. 

1. Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but…

2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven’t aged at all. 

Anyway that’s where I’m leaning now - he’s still dreaming. 

Edit: I’m loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo’s kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. 

I’ve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. 

I will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I’m even more curious! Is Leo dreaming because he still has not experienced his gravity drop in “the real world.” Hmmm 🤔 ",onlyididntsayfudge,1h2lv4j,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,2024-11-29 13:32:59,5551,0.9,5551,0,756,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2lv4j

movies,"Movie about White Death - Simo Häyhä, the finnish sniper who shot over 500 russian soldiers at Winter War, is in the makings","[translated from Yle news:](https://yle.fi/a/74-20127817)

The story of the most famous sniper of the Winter War has never before been brought to the silver screen.

The Russians gave Häyhä the name ""White Death"" — and for good reason.

According to his personal notebook, Häyhä killed 542 Russian soldiers during the 98 days of the Winter War. This is more than any other sniper in the world has achieved in such a short time.

The movie is set during the winter of 1939-1940 on the Kollaa front, where a small group of Finns stood to stop an overwhelmingly superior enemy from invading Finland.

Häyhä was seriously wounded in the battles at Kollaa just a week before the end of the Winter War. He awoke from a coma on the day the war ended.

Due to his injuries, Häyhä was unable to take part in the Continuation War, though he would have wanted to.

Simo Häyhä was born in 1905 in Rautjärvi, Karelia, and passed away as a respected war hero in a veterans' care home in Hamina in 2002.

The film's consultant is Major (ret.) Tapio Saarelainen, who has authored several books about Häyhä.

movies,Defining Movies of this Generation,"What according to you are the defining movies of this Generation so far ( 2012-present ) ?


By ' defining movies ' I mean the movies which are a mixture of top notch quality , popularity , commercial success and is well acclaimed.
These are the movies which were so influential that they changed the way of how movies are made and perceived .




According to me the top 3 are -

1. La La Land - A Perfect musical which showcases the richness of this genre .



2. Spider Man Into The Spider Verse - The most groundbreaking animated movie of this Generation which is also among one of the top best superhero movies ever made imo.



3. The Wolf of Wall Street - Peak of Scorsese,

El Camino was somewhat of a step down from Breaking Bad, it was still a pretty amazing movie, and could’ve been pretty successful as a stand-alone movie, the plot definitely would’ve worked. Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse’s story. 

The Simpson’s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far. The movie wasn’t much of a step down from the series and episodes themselves. It was just as funny as most episodes are, but had a lot more emotions in it. I also much preferred the animation style it had than what the series turned into a couple years later.

Me and my friends are embarking upon a long and very stupid journey to watch every single talking animal film (we will later also be creating a Tier List for them). In order to classify as a talking animal film it must meet these two criteria

1. the animal MUST talk (obviously) so human like animals such as snoopy are disqualified
2. the animal/animals MUST be one of the main protagonists (this leaves a movie like Shrek up to debate as he is a secondary protagonist, leaving open to discussion)

If we have somehow missed a movie (TV specials do not count) please comment and We will add it to the list, otherwise pray for our sanity. all we've seen so far is the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies and we already went slightly crazy

movies,Has a live action remake EVER been an improvement upon an animated movie or show? ,"I'm seeing people talk about the live action how to train your dragon, I made a comment on a different site about how in my opinion, no animated movie has ever been improved by being converted to live action.  The same goes with animated to live action shows, like one piece and Last Airbender.  

Aladdin, last Airbender, one piece, jungle book, beauty and the beast, I'd rather watch the original animated work every single time.  

Lion King doesn't count because it's only live action in appearance and is often considered an animated movie since every second of that movie was computer generated besides the first 10 seconds of the sunrise.  

I'm also not talking about different mediums, video game-&gt;movie, book-&gt;movie etc. Only if the original animated and live action remake are both a movie or both a TV show.  I don't really count when there's a movie that adapts a book, but also has a movie.  As an example mirror mirror is the best snow white and seven dwarfs movie in my opinion, but it isn't trying to adapt the 1930's animated movie to live action, it's simply adapting the original fairy tale.  Things like avatar, how to train your dragon, and the Moana live action are very clearly trying to adapt the movie, not another older work separately ",Sarcastic_Rocket,1h29gpd,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h29gpd/has_a_live_action_remake_ever_been_an_improvement/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h29gpd/has_a_live_action_remake_ever_been_an_improvement/,2024-11-29 00:21:12,0,0.35,0,0,60,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h29gpd

movies,Out of My Mind (2024),"I saw this movie being advertised on Disney+ today. It was brilliant despite being a teen/YA Disney movie. Which, even when I was a teen, I usually saw as mediocre at best. I really want to promote it in my own way as I doubt it'll get too much mainstream attention. 

While it'll never be on any lists of greatest movies or anything, well maybe on a list of ""best movies about a disability/disabled person"", but it more than succeeds at what it aims to achieve. I admit I watched it because of a personal connection, I have cerebral palsy, just like the main character, and have only seen one other film about my condition before *My Left Foot*. I was very happy to see that another film about my disability has been made, and with an actor that actually understands the condition fully too, that didn't just patronise and seek to show us as weak and pitiful. 

Anyway, the film was great. It succeeded in providing an insight into the condition from both the disabled individual's perspective as well as the carer's perspective. All of the actors were believable and elicited genuine reactions from me as the viewer. It reminded me of the discriminations I suffered at that age but also the times that I was lucky (and continue to be lucky) to have good people in my corner to support me. 

The greatest praise should be reserved for the lead actress, Phoebe-Rae Taylor, who is a genuinely great actor. Especially for a 12-13 year old making her acting debut, even though you could argue that she is playing a character that she has a unique insight about and wasn't always acting in the traditional sense, as she has cerebral palsy herself. She shines in this movie, showing the highs and lows of living with this disability, and reminding me of things (both positive and negative) that I hadn't thought of in years. It also reminded me that the frustrations I live with on a daily basis, and can feel immensely guilty for, are normal.

I really encourage everyone to watch this film. Even if you don't have a disability yourself, or have any connection to someone that does, it is a great movie. It will show you how, and how not to, act around someone that has a disability. Even I learned something, it highlighted to me the impact of my own ableism, (be it self-hatred and/or external reaction to those I perceive as ""more disabled""), that I have recognised before but not as obviously as I could while watching this film.

I hope that, if you are able to watch this film, you enjoy it. It is bittersweet, and the last half hour or so was genuinely heartbreaking to me, but it is an important film that I'm happy to have experienced.

movies,What’s the purpose of a red herring? When are they good and when are they bad?,"In *Late Night With The Devil (2023)*, without giving anything away, there’s a background character that sticks out like a sore thumb.

I got all the way to the end credits assuming that, any second now, they were going to finally step forward and say: “Nyah haaaaahh! It was me! Me all along!”

But no they were nothing.

So, this is a (intentional I think?) red herring. I found it distracting and annoying in this specific case, but it’s such a common trope that there must be a reason for them.

Just at the moment though I can’t think of what it might be. I mean, I definitely don’t have a “favourite red herring”. They’ve always just seemed like a pointless digression, akin to a random background extra walking around with a handful of fireworks for absolutely no reason.

movies,"I watched 365 movies this year, and here is what I learned. ","I decided back in January that I wanted to try to stop doom scrolling. And instead of scrolling for 2 hours I would watch a movie instead. Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. 

1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren’t even IN other movies. 

2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. 

3: If your movie isn’t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. 

Couple of facts: 

First movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube

Last movie: Planes trains and automobiles. 

Best movie: American Fiction 

Worst Movie: The Creeps.  

Movies I watched that I had seen before: 16

Most movies watched in a single day: 5


It’s been a long year and I’ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. 

Edit: sexually lol 

As requested Top 10: 

1: American Fiction

2: biosphere 

3: They Cloned Tyrone 

4: 1917

5: Maxxxine 

6: the Blackening

7: the vast of night 

8: The green knight 

9: bottoms 

10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)


Edit 2: people have a lot of opinions about movies, yet it seems mine are the only ones that are invalid? 

There are a ton of other things I learned from watching so many movies in such a short time. I, however, typically like to enjoy things more than shit on them (I.e. the beautiful madness that is Shadow in the Clouds). 

So allow me to clarify what in reverse:

3: In regards to run time, yes I agree, a story is as long as it needs to be, but streaming places like Netflix don’t usually care,  because they want a longer movie that keeps you watching. This can kill whatever story they were trying to tell. This is less a problem with Older movies, and more a modern issue and issue with a lot of horror movies (which is 80% what I watched).  It was my way of saying that movies could be tightened up to be more impactful and memorable.  For the “movies should be as long as they need to tell the story” people, we all know if movies needed to be as long as they need to be then there wouldn’t be a need for an editor nor “directors cuts.” Some stories don’t need the time and some stories need more. 

2: of course movies have different budgets, I am saying it is VERY noticeable when you go back to back and see a difference. It is amazing what people can do on a smaller budget to make it look good and how a larger budget production can blow the money and you don’t ever really see it on the screen.  

1: so many faces end up looking the same. Admittedly I come from an era where there were big names in the theaters and someone being in a movie meant something. Not something GOOD necessarily but something.  With this last year, I would see movies with an actor in it and still not know what sort of movie it is. You see “Justin Long” is in a horror movie and you know you are basically in for a good time. You see someone like Gerald Farlong in a movie and you just wanna know if you should know him from something (you shouldn’t. I made him up).  I do like that Square jaw man from the Hit Man tho. 

If I learned anything real, it’s that I love movies, and even if a movie is bad, as long as it’s fun, then it didn’t waste my time. 

Glad you all love American fiction and vast of night.  

Glad you all hate American fiction and the green knight. 

I’m gonna go watch “It’s a wonderful knife” now.

movies,A blend of art and fear: Why Hereditary is a must-watch movie. ,"I always thought I didn’t like horror movies. I usually don’t enjoy blood, violence, or scenes designed to disgust. But recently, I watched Hereditary by Ari Aster, which is categorized as a horror movie, and for a change—not only was I not grossed out or anything—I genuinely enjoyed it! There were plenty of scary scenes that made me grab onto whoever was sitting next to me xD, but it was the kind of fear that’s fun and intriguing—I loved being scared.

The casting was excellent. The acting of the mother (Annie) was fantastic, and the choice of Milly Shapiro for the role of the daughter (Charlie) was spot-on, and so on.

The film's atmosphere was mesmerizing; for example, the fact that the mother was a ""miniaturist"" and recreated their home in miniature—it was simply brilliant! It didn’t necessarily add anything significant to the plot, but it contributed something very unique to the movie's vibe.

The scary parts were genuinely frightening, in my opinion, but what was special is that along with my fear, I also found myself laughing.
The amazing director edited the film in such a fantastic way that even in the scary scenes, there was a sense of humor. This movie is truly one of a kind.

In conclusion: Ari Aster, the crown is yours! 👑

movies,The cast of Dune would have been the perfect cast for a Gilligan’s Island movie.,"For those of you who don’t remember, Gilligan’s Island was a 60s sitcom that was a lot funnier when we were younger and dumber. That said, Villeneuve’s Dune casting was a perfect mirror for the long-attempted big screen adaptation of the show.

Timothee Chalamet - Gilligan

Dave Bautista - The Skipper

Skellan Skarsgard - Mr. Howell

Charlotte Rampling - Mrs. Howell

Rebecca Ferguson - Ginger

Oscar Isaac - The Professor

Zendaya - Mary Ann

Then cast Javier Bardem as the evil scientist who was after the castaways and Jason Momoa as the surfer who washes up on the island.

movies,Movies to help distract those who are alone/heartbroken during the holidays?,"Crappy last few months and nursing a broken heart and nowhere to go on Thanksgiving. Planning on spending the day with my cat but could use some distraction and comfort in art.

So are there any recommendations for us? Please, no love stories or family themed films (ie Paddington). All other genres are a go.

For example, I find Alien and Aliens to be great distractions to get my mind off of my emotions.

There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?

I tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap.

More than 24 hours and almost 100 comments later, we have a clear winner: ***Flåklypa Grand Prix*** (engl.: *Pinchcliffe Grand Prix*) will be a wonderful addition to our official Letterboxd list, which becomes more and more heterogeneous, as the time goes by. 

today, I ask you for your favorite movie set in the next european country by alphabetical order: We leave the letter N and go to P like **Poland**. It won't be quite as personal for me as Germany (where I was born and still live today), but both my parents come from Silesia, so I'm even more excited about your suggestions. All I ask is that you stick to the following two rules: 

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Recommendations for great uses of classical music in film?,"I posted something similar in the Classical music sub, and thoughts it might be interesting to see responses from here as well!

The context:

I'm totally new to classical music, but I've started compiling a bit of a playlist, and have found that I'm somehow really drawn to pieces that have been used to what feels like good effect in film / TV. There's something about how the music is connected to a storyline that makes it powerful for me, for example:

""Elizabeth"" (Elgar's Nimrod, Mozart's Requiem in D Minor)

""V for Vendetta"" (Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture)

""The King's Speech"" (Beethoven's Symphony #7)

""Wit"" (Arvo Part's Spiegel im Spiegel)

Is there anything that you might suggest I look into adding to this list? Something that you feel was employed really well in cinema?

(For what it's worth, I started looking into this after compiling a list of some scores composed specifically for film, by the likes of John Barry, Dario Marianelli, Howard Shore, Williams etc..).

Also, I think I initially got reeled in (ha, pardon the pun) after viewing this video essay on how Shore approached the Lord of The Rings score:

""How Music Elevates Story""

In the beginning it's all about why tremblay might have been dismissed by the last Pope. We then find out that he essentially brief people for the Papaya and being exposed by Lawrence effectively ends his run.

Only...if the Pope attempted to dismiss him before he died, he couldn't have done it on the basis of bribery for the Conclave as effectively  that couldn't have happened yet or be foreseen. They repeatedly emphasize that the Pope died unexpectatly, meaning it couldn't have been that Tremblay bribed everyone while the Pope was still alive, in preparation for his death as it were.
Also if this was the case, it would be just so dumb to do it whilst the Pope was still alive.

movies,Good movie scenes for kids to act in a theater camp.,"Putting together an acting camp this winter for kids in 5th and 6th grade. Each day we'll watch a scene from a film, then in groups they'll choose characters, make props, create a twist ending (if they like), choreograph their scenes, and perform them for each other.

Would love to hear thoughts on good scenes for them to act out. Live action or animated, all are welcome. Funny scenes usually work better than emotionally wrenching ones. 3-4 character scenes are often best, but we can also adapt scenes with other amounts of characters. The students are learning English, but they are pretty eager and open to most scenes. Ideally not too much violence as that can digress into chaos perrrty quick.

Below is a list of films that come to mind so far - if you have any favorite scenes from these (or other films), let's get a nice repository going.

The Goonies  
Spirited Away  
Jumanji  
Lion King  
Toy Story  
Home Alone  
Wizard of Oz  
The Witches  
Monsters Inc  
Inside Out  
Harry Potter  
Princess Bride  
Paddington  
Lord of the Rings   
Star Wars

Bottom row: Roma \(Alfonso Cuarón\), All That Jazz \(Bob Fosse\), The Squid &amp; The Whale \(Noah Baumbach\), Pain &amp; Glory \(Pedro Almodóvar\), The Fabelmans \(Steven Spielberg\), Minari \(Lee-Isaac Chung\)](https://preview.redd.it/wn6ik9p0dl3e1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5028486dea52e2ab4fb0d7c075a9a51dff3938b8)

So one one of the things I've always been fascinated by our directors/writers who go out and make semi-autobiographical films. Obviously, every artist imbues a part of themselves and draws inspiration from their own experiences in whatever they make, regardless of if it's a realistic, domestic situation or a big action fantasy. But it always is interesting when you see films that are clearly drawn from past experiences and how that knowledge of pain and joy can help appreciate a film more.

Sure some may see it as being self-indulgent but some of the best movies of all time have been grown-up, mature directors looking at their lives.

And to be clear, it doesn't just have to be their adolescense/childhood. 

Antonio Banderas had to embody a dramatized adult Pedro Almodóvar reflecting on his path in life. All That Jazz looked at Fosse's career as a dancer, choreographer, and director. Celine Song has said Past Lives was inspired by a real childhood friendship she had prior to moving abroad and their reunion after she'd gotten married. Noah Baumbach has not been afraid of sayig how Marriage Story was inspired by the divorce between he and Jennifer Jason Leigh. And while not one character served as an exact mirror, Platoon was reinforced by Oliver Stone's real life experiences as a Vietnam veteran.

So what directors do would you like to see make a semi-autobiographical film about their own lives? I also want to put an addendum that **you can include directors who are sadly no longer with us and directors who are currently ""retired""**",dremolus,1h1qlk6,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1qlk6/which_directors_you_would_like_to_see_make_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1qlk6/which_directors_you_would_like_to_see_make_a/,2024-11-28 07:24:28,0,0.33,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Xv2oSuRxDNN0Pwl5Nz6aXNsKoiLDHBLHqIHQ5bFdUQo.jpg,t3_1h1qlk6

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching it. But c'mon, this chick has been doing the equivalent of petty crime, and gets ever increasing signals that's she's in over her head:

🙃

- First the lawyer shows up with $150k cash and negotiates to go to $300k (baby... you dealing with BIG players, here)

- Then there's a shootout at the assisted living facility and Russian nationals are arrested (oh shit, these are REAL thugs)

- then the doctor gets killed (who kill people, fr!!)

- then SHE is nearly killed, and in the process discovers her girlfriend is nearly blown up (damn, my eyebrows got burnt off)

and I remind you, at this point, she's never dealt with anything nearly approaching this. And instead of trying to bring this ordeal to a close, an ordeal FAR above her experience, she makes a final stand. Her and her army-of-one girlfriend.

## AND THEY WIN

Granted, she gets what she deserves in the end. But still...

Call me a coward but if all I've ever done is rip off old people, I'm tapping out as soon as ""Russian Mafia"" comes out of anyone's mouth.

movies,Does anyone know if actors/crew have any control over Feature Commentaries?,"This question from having watched the Conclave feature commentary. It was terrific and informative, for me. I love feature commentaries (Emerald Fennell’s for Promising Young Woman and Rian Johnson’s for Knives Out, to mention only two). Here, the director of Conclave clearly admires his actors and crew so much. Yet I thought at moments he was maybe a little too free with the comments about some of the actors: their disagreements over, for example, the costumes (whether they should have been actually what a cardinal would wear or not, etc.). Mostly Tucci and Fiennes. He mentions that Stanley Tucci had doubts about his performance near the end of the shoot, which I am sure is common. From the sound of things, Tucci in real life would probably say, “it’s fine"" (listen to the commentary;-)). Ralph Fiennes apparently was a bit piqued about his costume, because an actual member of the church showed him a costume detail, and Fiennes wondered why Berger wouldn't use it. It’s very here and there. It does NOT sound like the set of an Xmen movie, truly. This director, a wonderful filmmaker, sounds like a very decent and knowledgeable man who truly appreciated his cast and crew. Still, does anyone know if actors or crew members can prescreen these, and give their approval or veto to certain parts?

movies,Massive problem with Godfather part 2,"Godfather 2 is generally recognized as an all-time classic as it was nominated and won numerous Oscars and featured some outstanding performances. It's also one of my own favorite movies but I have one problem with it and I think I'm not alone. In short it's Michael's body guard. You know, the guy who wore an all black suit, black hat and black turtleneck while visvisiting Miami and Havana? He mostly stands in the background trying to look menacing but his advanced age and slow ambulation just made me think Hyman Roth could easily just walk away from him even with his heart condition. It's strongly implied that this man in black is a highly accomplished hitman/bodyguard given that Michael entrusts his own security to this one geriatric, zoombified stiff. But when it's time for him to shine, when he gets the call to show us what he's got he fails oh so miserably it's cringe worthy. First, when he takes out Johnny Ola he chooses for his weapon a wooden clothes hanger, never mind that even mild pressure on the cross bar will cause structural failure, but during the scene he loses his left hand grip on the hanger thus losing any leverage he may have conceivably had. Yet, Johnny drops into unconsciousness pretty damn quick, talk about being soft for a gangster. The man in black follows this up by following Roth to a hospital where he takes his sweet time to secure the room before making his move on the  utterly defenseless Roth. Does he pull a gun? No. A knife? No. A blunt object? No. Instead he opts for what looks like the kind of pillow you would get on a Jet Blue flight. His final act of pure incompetance is holding said pillow in a futile defensive act when police burst into the room underscore that this guy was completely unqualified to be a professional hit man. That sums up my complaint, and I understand that some will disagree with my assessment because he's part of one of the greatest films of all time but if you defend the man in black, you are just plain wrong and need to go back stream the film and you will be convinced that he was just plain lame.

* I feel Kevin Smith, in general, doesn't get enough credit for these first 5 movies. I know he has an outsized personality and presence now compared to most of these movies, but don't let that color your perceptions of these movies. They are just hilarious movies.

This is my favorite thing she's ever done. And probably had an outsized impact on my taste in women. I appreciate when a chick will just say ""Get your shit together you fucking dumbass.""
* Also, I made it this entire time without even mentioning Dogma. Unfortunately, I would get entirely sidetracked by that movie. It's fucking awesome. But, unless you break the law you can't even watch it. Though, I think that's about to change due to Harvey Weinstein being a piece of shit. But with less money than before.

All that being Said, Kevin Smith is like The Farrelly Brothers meets Wes Anderson.

movies,I liked Challengers much more than I expected ,"This was actually back in July. A friend recommended it, so I bought it on Prime.

I went into it completely blind, so I had no idea about the plot besides the fact that it involved a love triangle, so I expected some kind of shallow sexy drama.

I've never watched Euphoria and I had only seen Zendaya in Dune, and I wasn't impressed, but she's great in this. It's funny to see how she clearly doesn't love either of them, and is just in love with tennis.

I also loved **Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' electronic soundtrack** and how it highlights emotions and moments of tension, especially when the characters are fighting. But the thing I liked the most was the portrayal of the boys' friendship and overall rapport, which looks and sounds, for lack of a better word, real. Especially in the flashbacks from their teenage years the dialogue and the acting make their relationship sound very realistic.

I felt stupid at the end when the credits rolled out and it showed that Guadagnino was the director.

I’ve tried MULTIPLE times to actually sit through 2001: A Space Odyssey but miserably failed every time.

I’ve stayed away from knowing the plot of it, because one day, I want to be able to view it fully and experience what it’s all about purely. 

But apart from that, his films that I’ve completely seen, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut failed to impress me MUCH (although I was impressed, just not enough as he is highly regarded as one of the best directors we’ve seen), except for Dr. Strangelove which was an absolute joy watching. I consider it to be on a pedestal among other films worthy of being there. 

I figured we could have a civil conversation about Kubrick and you could maybe help me see what I’m not seeing, or maybe there might be people out here who possibly agree with my opinion. Nonetheless, kindly refrain from spoiling 2001, because I truly want to see and experience it myself.

It's no secret that Quentin Tarantino is not a fan of 4K and I'm wondering if making that movie more prettier goes against the aesthetics of it being a genre picture?

I wonder, because I remember the first press of DVD's back in the day for this movie, and it was a ""dirty"" transfer, which was the version I first fell in love with.   
There is definitely some nostalgia on my part, but I'm also thinking that a ""dirty"" transfer does give a better sense of how it might have been at the movies showing a 35mm print that's been continuously played to being worn out.

movies,What do you think is the first 80s move and the last 70s movie,"Probably more than any adjacent decades, I think the shift from 70s to 80s ethos and vibes is just incredible.  

When I think of 70s films, there are lots of themes we see that they created whole genres out of: 

City in Decline:  Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, The French Connection, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, The Warriors,  The Taking of Pelham One Two Three

Political and Paranoid Thrillers:  Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor, The Conversation, Marathon Man, Klute, Capricorn One, Chinatown, Winter Kills, The Day of the Jackal, All the President's Men, Chinatown

War Movies Shifted from Heroic to Pathos of War:  Coming Home, Deer Hunter, Patton, MASH, The Big Red One, Catch 22, Slaughterhouse 5, Apocalypse Now

Dystopic Sci-fi:  Logan's Run, A Clockwork Orange, The Omega Man, West World, The Andromeda Strain, Mad Max

Loss of the American Dream:  The Last Picture Show, American Graffiti, Nashville

The 80s. . . Instead of gritty realism we get escapism:

Raiders of the Lost Ark, Top Gun, The Empire Strikes Back

Instead of anti-heroes, we get heroes

Superman, Indiana Jones, Terminator, Die Hard, Commando

Instead of city in decline, we get consumerism and excess: 

Wall Street, Beverly Hills Cops,

A return to more triumphant themes in war movies: 

Red Dawn, The Hunt for Red October, 

An explosion of Teen Movies: 

The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Risky Business, 

Dystopic -Sci Fi is still a thing, but it becomes much bigger, infused with large budgets and massive world-building:

Blade Runner, The Road Warrior

I'd say in terms of cross-overs, Jaws feels like almost like an 80s film - certainly the first of the big blockbusters that everyone chases in the 1980s.  

The Thing is a good example of a 1980s movie firmly grounded in 1970s ethos and themes.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Norway,"Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in North Macedonia, and although there weren't really that many suggestions and votes, we were still able to find an interesting winner: ***You Won't Be Alone*** is an australian movie. To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out why an Australian filmmaker made a movie with a plot set in North Macedonia, but maybe I'll get back to this as soon as I've found out more (after the viewing).

But what I would like to find out very quickly is your favorite movie set in **Norway**. I think this time a movie that is genuinely from the country itself could end up on [our official letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) list again, but we'll see... The only thing I'm setting here are just two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Is Scream the reason people forget about The Town That Dreaded Sundown?,"Was quite surprised to see an article on this film as it never seems to get a lot of praise, but it’s a pretty fun slasher! For a sequel released decades after the original, it did a good job of being fresh and reinventing itself but with the familiarity of the original. 

I wasn’t a fan of the original but this is one of those cases where the sequel is better, like Ouija: Origin of Evil. 

Anyway, this article suggests Scream's popularity and it being heralded as the godfather of meta horror is the reason TTTDS gets overshadowed.

Any other fans of The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014)? Would love to know!

Sure, maybe if Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were in it, it may have been a bigger hit or maybe folks would buy it less with the performances.

Also, Starship Troopers which had a 100 million dollar budget back in 1997 and was R-rated and had no stars whatsoall unless you count Doogie Howser. I gotta imagine that was a risky move selling it to the studio yet it was made.

movies,State of American film industry,"I'm not too deeply familiar and have a surface-level understanding of American film industry based on what I've read so far. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

If I understood correctly, American film industry is more focused on making money with mainstream mass audience over artistic cinema films like Martin Scorsese.

Meanwhile, in France (I'm not sure about other European countries) their film industry is the opposite: it focused more on artistic cinema output rather than making money with mass audience. Creators get funding for making artistic films that doesn't focus on box office performance while in the USA, it's the opposite of this. Films that doesn't guarantee box office performance will not get funding from major film industry.

Now that is out of the way, I have an idea: why not have space for both, mainstream blockbuster and artistic cinema films to be made? Why in USA only the former is prioritised while the latter is neglected? I think having both types of films get to be made is the best compromise. Yes, blockbuster franchise can get funded, but have space for artistic films to be incentivised and funded as well. It shouldn't be zero-sum.

movies,Can an actor be miscast because he's not manly enough for the part he was chosen for?,"I feel a lot of critics are not discussing the elephant in the room whenever they complain about Paul Mescal in ""Gladiator II"". They keep circling around the main complaint they do have but they don't don't want to be un-PC about it. Mescal is definitely a brilliant actor, making inroads in his career, but compared to Russell Crowe in Gladiator, he's just not delivering a testosterone-heavy performance. It wouldn't be a problem if the film didn't make it a point to compare Lucius with Maximus or having Lucius act like a macho beast when the first thought in one's head is how ""snatched"" Lucius' waist is. 

The fact that Lucius started out as a spoiled prince that looked like Peppermint Patty could have been an interesting correlation as he grows up to be a warrior, but the movie just starts with him being Maximus 2.0. He even has a dead wife. 

This made me wonder about other actors who tried to be action heroes and didn't cut it because they weren't convincing as macho meatheads.

movies,The Lost City with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum! Question about Brad Pitt's character? ,"Okay, hear me out! I just rewatched *The Lost City* with Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, and Brad Pitt, and now I can't stop thinking...what if Jack Trainer (Pitt's character) didn’t actually die? What if he faked his death to give Alan (Tatum) the spotlight to be the hero Sandra’s character needed?

Like, picture this: Jack is just casually ninja-ing in the background the whole time, taking care of loose ends, while Alan gets his time to shine and grow. It *is* a bit sus how effortlessly Jack handled that entire army of mercenaries in the jungle before...poof, he’s gone. Did anyone see him in the background, maybe I missed it! Or am I just reading too much into this?

Did anyone else think it was suspicious how Jack made it out alive, but maybe this is because he stayed low-key for Alan’s sake? Let’s discuss!

movies,Directors intent and sequels,"I recently watched gladiator 1 for the first time(I know. Pls don’t flame me) and felt like a sequel was unnecessary. 

I haven’t watched gladiator 2 but it got me wondering how much of sequel movies are because directors want to make a sequel vs studios wanting to make a sequel. 

How do y’all feel about that?

Would you watch a movie even though it’s motivated by studio greed? Like say if a movie like whiplash got a sequel with a brand new director, would you watch it? Or would you watch it if it had the same director as the first one?

(Yes I know all sequels are motivated by studio greed but there are cases where a director genuinely wants to make a sequel)

movies,The first motion picture ever feels a bit.. Strange?,"Most of us know the film ""Carmencita (1894)"" the first motion picture (movie) ever, but whenever you see footage of it, it gives me a strange kinda uncanny feeling like it's not from it's time??



Now if you dont know about ""Carmencita"" it is a film directed by [William K.L. Dickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kennedy_Dickson) and featuring [Carmencita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmencita) (actor) and shows Carmencita dancing on a stage for 21 seconds

  
The part that is very strange is that the film was shot at 30 frames per second, now yes the first photograph was taken in 1826 but strangely this is as fast or faster than most films in the mid 1900s.

  
The workings of a [motion picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) [camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera) (at the time of creation) is where the light and darkness is captured and burnt onto a piece of paper and the motion picture camera has to do that at the rate of 30 frames per second into tiny film strips.

  
I dont know how fast they would create it at a time but it could possibly be created in a delay of 1-3 seconds (what i think).",lofeythelofster,1h0wlhr,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0wlhr/the_first_motion_picture_ever_feels_a_bit_strange/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0wlhr/the_first_motion_picture_ever_feels_a_bit_strange/,2024-11-27 05:00:13,0,0.32,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0wlhr

The first time he uses the machine, the Machine-Angier that stays put shoots the Teleported-Angier.

So if ""The Real Angier"" teleported that first time, he was shot and killed.

If ""The Real Angier"" didn't teleport, he drowned the first time the trick was performed.

Either way, he's a very smart man. He must know that by the end he's either Angier #100+ or Angier #2, which I think is why he breaks down about sacrifice, not the 100+ murders. He knows the original is long dead.

It's just a really impactful film that has stuck with me since my first watch and seeing others feedback reminds me that I'm not alone in feeling these kinds of themes in the movie.

movies,Home Alone: Kevin’s family never knew,"Home Alone is renowned for covering plot holes: the ticket being thrown away, the power going out. However, watching Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Kevin never told his family that he fought Harry and Marv in the events covered by the first movie. 

All throughout the second film, his family only ever describes him as being left alone during Christmas—never once do they refer to the fact that he fought off two thieves while he was home alone. The only witness to Kevin fighting the thieves was the old man with the snow shovel. One would think that he would have discussed the ordeal with Kevin’s parents. 

It begs the question why Kevin and the neighbor withheld this information from Kevin’s family. A plot hole? Or, alternatively, is there a possibility that Kevin hallucinated the entire events of the first and second films?

movies,Dear Santa ,"**Warning Spoiler Alert**
-
I just watched “Dear Santa” with Jack Black.  The movie was so so.  It hinges on Jack Blacks character not actually being Satan so he doesn’t get Liam’s soul.   Black’s character, as it turns out, is a mere Demi gorgon that screws up the process.  He is told this near the end of the film by the actual Satan.  Here is my question (since it appears to be uncredited). Was the actual Satan played by Ben Stiller?  The make up was heavy. There appears to be no mention of him in the credits.

movies,Earl holliman passed away yesterday at 96,"While at the Pasadena Playhouse, Holliman entered the Paramount lot by claiming he had an appointment with a studio barber. Eventually he became friendly with studio executives. Holliman first got a small bit part opposite Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in Scared Stiff (1953). Next he was cast as a marine in The Girls of Pleasure Island (1953), for which he needed a G.I. haircut. Finally he saw the barber and ended up with a haircut (and bangs) that changed his life.

After he gained popularity in his image following a change in hairstyle, he then followed with three more films released in 1953.His many credits include: Broken Lance (1954), The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), The Big Combo (1955), I Died a Thousand Times (1955), Forbidden Planet (1956), Giant (1956), The Rainmaker (1956), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Don't Go Near the Water (1957), Hot Spell (1958), The Trap (1959), Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), Visit to a Small Planet (1960), Armored Command (1961), The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Anzio (1968), The Desperate Mission (1969), Smoke (1970), The Biscuit Eater (1972), The Solitary Man (1979), Sharky's Machine (1981) and Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge (1987).

Holliman played a doomed helicopter crewman in the William Holden war drama The Bridges at Toko-Ri and a gangster's double-crossed thug in The Big Combo. He co-starred with Jack Palance in the crime drama I Died a Thousand Times (1955), a remake of High Sierra. He starred in The Rainmaker (1956), opposite Katharine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster, playing a rancher's timid son, who finally must defy his brother to gain self-respect, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture; he was cast in the role instead of Elvis Presley. His role in Rainmaker brought him such praise that columnist Louella Parsons cited him being ""as dedicated as though he were Marlon Brando and Anthony Perkins combined"".",PatientCalendar1000,1h0slet,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0slet/earl_holliman_passed_away_yesterday_at_96/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0slet/earl_holliman_passed_away_yesterday_at_96/,2024-11-27 01:27:05,14,0.67,14,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h0slet
movies,La La Land's Ending: Intended Morals &amp; The Journey to the Destination,"Maybe my memory is hazy for not seeing the film for years, but I didn’t 100% like the ending.

Don't get me wrong; it's NOT for the sole reason of Mia &amp; Sebastian not staying together. I am not a hopeless romantic who thinks love overcomes all by any means. I do think it would have been less impactful of an ending (&amp; less unique) if they stayed together.

My problem is HOW they got to the point where they didn't stay together.

A common complaint I've seen about endings to anything in the last decade is ""It's not that it ended this way by default, it's how they got there."" Many people who hated how Daenerys' character arc ended in Game of Thrones (no spoilers) would have been fine with it ending that way had there been more development. Instead it only came not just in the last season, but the last 2 episodes.

If Mia got her big break, Sebastian landed a gig on his own doing the music he wants - but their schedules get so hectic that they can’t see each other as much anymore despite their efforts &amp; communications - then I wouldn’t have any issues (&amp; the ending would have been less divisive).

Instead (as far as I recall): it seems like they just had 1 fight, Sebastian says “you’re just an actress” &amp; immediately regrets it, he misses her play because of a band photoshoot he somehow forgot about (which I guess they didn’t communicate about to make sure their schedules didn’t get messy), &amp; she refuses to forgive him thus ending their relationship. It seems that one fight was enough to tank their relationship because Sebastian suddenly made a total dick move. Not communicating with her about their schedules, somehow not asking the band if anything was going on the same day as the play when they had a long time to prepare (photoshoots are planned 4-6 weeks in advance, I heard), etc. It seems like basic healthy communication skills that went out the window. &amp; this all happened in a year!

So if the film’s point is “you have to make sacrifices to achieve your dreams, &amp; that includes a person you love sometimes,” it falls flat if there wasn’t any in-character effort to keep the relationship afloat despite their schedules. If anything, I’d say the moral of the film seems to send is “find a partner who is compatible with your dreams &amp; schedules &amp; who will have a healthy communicative relationship with you.” Thus it's for THAT reason why Mia &amp; Sebastian weren’t meant to stay together, thus Mia seems to find a much healthier relationship with David who did have a compatible schedule with her &amp; put in effort to keep their relationship afloat.

Maybe that was the message all along, but I got the impression it was more about “you have to give up love for your career” (even though she has a husband &amp; a baby). Because in real life, you CAN have a career &amp; a love life &amp; family. You just have to find the right person to be compatible with in terms of careers &amp; schedules + you both making effort to make time for each other &amp; your family.  Sometimes that just doesn't happen no matter how much you love each other, but it's obviously not impossible since Mia has a family in the end &amp; seems to have no issues

Tl;dr: I think the ending would have been more satisfying if they had Mia &amp; Sebastian actively trying their best to stay together despite their growing success &amp; failing, so they break up (if the point of the film was about love not always overcoming if you want to follow your dreams).

There is going to be a Broadway musical adaptation at some point, so I hope they do something like that.",BasicBystander,1h0sk5l,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0sk5l/la_la_lands_ending_intended_morals_the_journey_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0sk5l/la_la_lands_ending_intended_morals_the_journey_to/,2024-11-27 01:25:23,0,0.13,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h0sk5l

movies,Prequel shows,"Specifically comedies, I’ve found that if there’s any comedy show that has a prequel the prequel somehow manages to out do the original, so much so that by the time the prequel show ends it leaves a sour taste in your mouth

My main 2 examples are Ted and Young Sheldon/ The new Georgie show, in Ted’s case there are a lot of references made by Blair to how John can make something of himself and for me at least it’s kind of demoralizing how John ended up turning out in the movies, sure he’s not that bad in the movies, stable job, Girlfriend, apartment but his life didn’t turn as planned yk and I think it’s always a victim or comedy set up in general 

Kinda how in Big Bang Theory (BBT) it used Sheldon’s family as a way to get a quick laugh out of the audience and somewhat explain why Sheldon is the way he is, but once we see how his life truly was as a child and how his family was you get to see a whole other side to them and you somewhat can’t believe how they turned out, if young Sheldon writers had their way then George would never have cheated on Mary and Georgie and Mandy would probably have been endgame. 

Instead we had to deal with the inevitable notion that this is doomed to fail someway or another, and as the Ted show progresses it’ll reach that point as well where John’s character will probably change for the worse over the course of the show",Flash_SA,1h0reqw,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0reqw/prequel_shows/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0reqw/prequel_shows/,2024-11-27 00:29:17,0,0.17,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h0reqw

So if you don't the main plot of the movie is that Monsters have a whole society the where everything electrical runs off of screams from kids. In Monsters Inc we see how it's the monsters job who are professional 'scarers' to use a weird magical door that does into the homes of children's closets so that they can scare them to get to scream. And we see that when they scream it fuels up a device called a scream tank, which allows it to be used as energy. We even at one point see a child screaming out in the open and it basically overpowers all the electrical appliances around her and short circuiting them.

movies,"""Mary Reilly"" (1996): Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde through the eyes of a shy house maid. Maligned by the critics, it is a grim and moody film about the evil within us.","I loved Mary Reilly and it wasn't the folly the critics kept announcing it to be. I loved the setting, the emphasis on the claustrophic nature of the house, the menacing sensuality of Hyde compared to the introverted Jekyl, played brilliantly by John Malkovich. There are scenes that literally shock you like when Hyde stomps a little girl to near death or every scene featuring Glenn Close as Mrs Faraday, in the scariest performance I've ever seen from her. Faraday made Alex from Fatal Attraction look harmless by comparison. 

The brunt of the bad reviews was Julia Roberts and, to be honest, I didn't think she was that bad. On the contrary, I thought she gave a good performance as Mary Reilly. Was the accent bad? I don't know, but I did feel Roberts disappeared into this part, she made me believe she was a withdrawn and awkward maid with a dark past who becomes intrigued, fascinated and sexually attracted to Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. I can't help but believe Roberts was unjustly targeted because she was America's sweetheart playing such an against type of role.

The entire movie reminded me of ""The Company of Wolves"". At least, the direction. It had a bit of that eerie atmosphere with the fog and the cold brick houses.

movies,'Moana 2' Review Thread,"**Moana 2**

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moana_2) 69% (72 Reviews)

&gt;Riding high on a wave of stunning animation even when its story runs adrift, Moana 2 isn't as inspired as the original but still delights as a colorful adventure.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moana-2/):  57 (36 Reviews)

**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho-1236070676/):

&gt;Where Moana focused on the relationship between the titular adventurer and her reluctant demigod companion, Moana 2 divides its attention among more characters. These personalities become window dressing in a movie short on time.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson-auli-i-cravalho-1236222936/):

&gt;Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first “Moana,” at its best, transcended.

[Daily Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/) (4/5):

&gt;With a running time that brings us briskly ashore, the film is a grand voyage in miniature -- a taster epic.

[Empire] (https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-2/) (4/5):

&gt;A touch less fresh than the original, but this is still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination. It knows the way. 

[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/26/moana-2-disney-review-release/76466003007/) (3/4):

&gt;The follow-up plots an extremely familiar course but at least does so with fresh new personalities and more inspired Pacific Island influence.

[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/moana-2-review-disney-sequel-1235069079/) (B):

&gt;It’s always a tough ask to improve upon an original, but “Moana 2” is a sprightly addition to this sea-faring legacy. It does something nearly impossible in our sequel-glutted world: made me want further adventures.

[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1723102/disney-moana-2-review/) (7/10):

&gt;Fortunately, much like ""Frozen II,"" ""The Incredibles 2,"" and ""Toy Story 4,"" we may not have needed a sequel, but at least the one we got is enjoyable and manages to actually push the story forward.

[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/moana-2-review/) (3.5/5):

&gt;Moana remains as compelling a protagonist as ever in her much-anticipated sequel, whilst her reunion with Maui showcases the wonderful voice talents of Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. There’s plenty to admire in the animation and rich mythology of the tale, but it rehashes many of the themes and plot points of the original leading to a fun but less vital movie.

[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/moana-2-review) (C+):

&gt;A ramshackle Franken-ship ... with more in common with straight-to-video sequels than the clever original.

[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-1235175741/):

&gt;The overall sentiment seems to be something like Sequel 101: You loved the first movie, so here’s a second movie that’s a lot like the first movie. This is the good news if that’s what you’re after. If not, well: It’s one hour and 40 minutes.

[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241126-moana-2-review) (3/5):

&gt;Despite all this Moana moaning, though, it's still a high-quality piece of work: a hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride that small children, especially, are bound to enjoy. The irony is that if it had been a television series, viewers might well have gushed about how spectacular it was. But as a film, Moana 2 wouldn't be near the top of any list of Disney's finest.

[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho) (6/10):

&gt;While some of the elements still manage to get a laugh here, the world we were introduced to eight years ago doesn’t feel richer or more exciting.

[Screen Rant] (https://screenrant.com/moana-2-movie-review/) (6/10): 

&gt;The animation is still strong and the character beats are affecting, but the villain and his motivations stand in the film's way of true greatness.

[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/):

&gt;There’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2, but the fact that it’s necessary to write 'there’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2' means something still went wrong.

[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/moana-2-review-vacuum-packed-disney-ocean-adventure-that-will-leave-you-cold) (2/5):

&gt;It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency.

[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/moana-2-review-disneys-soulless-sequel-is-a-flabby-rehash-fms8l067g) (2/5) :

&gt;The narrative stumbles forward in episodic fits and starts through self-contained story bites that have little impact on the wider, regrettably flabby, arc.

**Synopsis**:
&gt;“Moana 2” reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced.

**Staring**:

* Auli'i Cravalho as Moana
* Dwayne Johnson as Maui
* Alan Tudyk as Heihei
* Temuera Morrison as Chief Tui
* Nicole Scherzinger as Sina
* Rose Matafeo as Loto
* David Fane as Kele

movies,Family stone - mind frick?,"This movie is truly all over the place. Mulroney's acting and character are so bizarre its hard to not view this as a parody.

Sjp is clearly ACTING like she has pretty noticeable autism, and at times I thought everyone was aware of it - the dad being virtuous and trying to calm the tempers of his family because she has a disability... However that doesn't appear to be the case? And if it's not the case then why is sjp playing the role of an autist instead of a type a asshole? It's so damn weird. We build up all of her obsessiveness, ordly, random fact based trivia, inability to understand personal space, tone, etc.  this woman is supposed to be a well connected white collar worker..yet she has zero people skills, self awareness, social awareness, spatial awareness? It just screams autism and otherwise makes no sense.

Mulroney has no charisma with anyone...and his attempts to intimidate his family at times is so bizarre..like he's playing an action hero in a love drama? His character was so poorly written and executed with awful acting. We never once felt like he was trying to make the relationship work..he hung his GF out to dry at every opportunity.. 

I felt like this movie was leading up to the discovery of SJPs autism and them embracing her, similarly to how they've embraced all of the divergence to norms in their family. Their son is a deaf gay man who is in an interracial relationship..it felt like it was building up to acceptance.

And then the brother..who immediately recognizes that the couple is not in love and starts making advances? To Mulroney immediately falling in love with his SJPs sister and her being immediately adored? 

And then we see a full frontal of Keaton's post op chest? The siblings swap partners and everyone is happily ever after? 

There was more to unpack that I'm not doing a great job of unpacking.. but I was floored over how uncoordinated, poorly written, directed and acted this movie was

movies,Camera Shot that just wowed you,"So I recently rewatched the movie What Lies Beneath (2000) with Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in October during spooky season. There is a scene in it where Michelle Pfeiffer's character is lying on the floor and the camera pushes in, goes thru the floor, and then is beneath her looking up.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: North Macedonia,"Hello there,

since more than a month, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day and it seems like in this game, everyday, is a new day.

Let's take a look at the day, where I asked you for your favorite movie set in Monaco, for example: The thread got 16 comments and the comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) included a suggestion for a movie that isn't really set in Monaco plot-wise for the larger part. Same with the runner-up. Because third place was shared by three films in terms of upvotes and downvotes, but they all meet the rules, I had to think again about how to proceed here. I have now decided to simply let chance decide in such a case (in this case: the Excel random number generator) and so ***La fille de Monaco*** (engl.: *The Girl from Monaco*), a 2008 comedy movie, has now won relatively unspectacularly.

Now let's compare that with Netherland's tun yesterday: The thread got over 50 comments where 3 movie suggestions have reached the 30-point mark. And this time, the winner's plot is undoubtedly set in the Netherlands: We're talking about ***Zwartboek*** (engl.: *Black Book*) by Paul Verhoeven. This means that two films from the 2000s are about to land[ on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) and it will be interesting to see whether this decade will actually end up dominating the list.

At first, today we are turning our attention to **North Macedonia**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,I don’t get the love for The Truman Show,"So it's been years since I've watched. Think it was twice, in the cinema when it came out and then once at home years later. Honestly don't think it's a great movie. It's not bad, but I don't get its status. I've talked to people who thinks it's one of the best movies ever made, and it's many people's favourite Jim Carey movie. The premise is good but not ground breaking. I'm pretty sure it was done before on the twilight zone at least. I thought Ed Harris missed the mark in it, he just wasn't convincing. Some of the humour seemed forced, the wife doing ads etc.. and the catchphrase, like it's some great touchstone by the end of the movie. I feel like it was trying to be a deep movie but ended up being a mix of comedy and serious drama that just doesn't really work. Am I alone in this?

movies,"Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films","When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like ""Title 2"", ""Title II"", ""Title Part 2"", ""Title: The Revenge"", ""Tit2e"", etc.

This can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.

Sometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.

So what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",AporiaParadox,1h0bbt0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/,2024-11-26 13:01:49,1155,0.93,1155,0,1049,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h0bbt0

movies,What's so wrong with Napoleon (2024)?,"I don't get why there is so much hate about it. I've successively watched Gladiator 2 (which wasn't rated that bad) and Napoleon - and I've enjoyed the latter one more from the start.

Yes, it is:  
\- historically incorrect at some events I guess (although there shouldn't be total trust to history);  
\- fragmented, but it's still smooth to watch.

But:  
\- Joaquin Phoenix is perfect (as he always does). I love his hero changing from the start till the end.  
\- Nice battle scenes, blood and gore. Reminded me of those in Game of Thrones, maybe even better. Battle on frozen lake is my favourite. Taking moscow also.  
\- Nice atmosphere, costumes, sceneries.  
\- Ridley told that he didn't try to do documentary and mostly referenced Napoleon's letters. So it's a film about about a man, not a historical hero.

And what I still didn't catch:  
\- Was It planned to include some black humour like sex scenes, shooting of the rebels and so on.

P.S. I won't lie - I'm a great fan of Ridley Scott's movies. Mostly ""bad"" ones (like Counselor or Covenant) than highly acclaimed (like Gladiator 1 or Duelists).

I'm looking for a example of a movie that does the opposite, where the running time from start to finish is substantially longer than the actual period of time represented within the story or events shown in the film.

For instance, a movie with a 2-hour running time depict events that lasts less than 2 hours.

  
p.s. Forgot to mention, not movies told from different perspectives/characters, repeating events (like groundhog day), or time-travel.

I wonder if the movie’s idea of ""romance"" might seem more like codependency or a mix of personality deficits to younger generations.

I feel that the type of ""romance"" portrayed in the movie might feel a bit dated now. It seems to me that younger generations take a more practical and matter-of-fact approach to love and relationships compared to 35 years ago. For example, Chani’s love for Paul in *Dune: Part Two* strikes me as a more conditional kind of love. I can’t recall the exact quote, but she essentially says she will love him as long as he doesn’t harm the Fremen cause.

The silence, the look in the characters’ eyes, the unbearable dread of what’s coming next… it’s all perfectly calculated to make us squirm. And it’s not just horror; films like *There Will Be Blood* or *Whiplash* use tension to stretch our nerves until they’re ready to snap.

I wanted to spread the love as much as possible and so came my biggest project to date: the 2023 Oscars with each movie only eligible for one nom. Even Best Picture nominees only get that Best Picture nom. I watched as many movies as I could to fill this list up which was a bit tiring but still rewarding with how many discoveries I made.

To give myself some ease, as a rule given how broad the field is, I did only look at the submissions for Best International Feature as to not find up having to go through dozens of other films (luckily this year's noms were all really good). I also did the same for documentaries and what were shortlisted entries but again, a lot of the shortlisted documentaries were all fantastic so no complaints there.

I did also try to be as objective and fair. There are several movies I didn't care for or didn't like overall such as Maestro, Origin, and Showing Up but I could acknowledge one element that really did work that's at least worth recognizing. I didn't want this just to be a list of movies I personally loved ~~(that'll be a different list)~~

And in terms of how I chose which movie went were, it was rather simple.

The Best Picture and Best Directing noms for instance would perhaps be the most well rounded in terms of derserving noms in acting, screenplay, directing, production, score, editing, etc. Poor Things just being relegated to acting would feel wrong given how much of that movie is impressive.

In terms of acting, it had to be for movies who rested on their central performance, even if the writing is thin or abstract thus why A Thousand and One, 20000 Species of Bees, The Iron Claw, Perfect Days, etc. got acting nominations. It's also why I actually moved Teachers' Lounge out of the Best Actress and into Best Screenplay, I just feel that movie is so sharply written, it would feel wrong to just give it an acting nomination. And speaking of screenplay, given how a ton more praise is given to its story, I graduated Godzilla Minus One from VFX to Adapted Screenplay (that and I actually watched Origin and seeing how badly written it was, had to replace it with something)

Song and Score I judged how they fit well outside of the film and how much they would be enjoyed.

Production was straightforward but I did want to shout out Taste of Things because all of the food there was made onsite and that's part of the production and is a character of the film in and of itself.

The others are self-explanatory though I will say I went back and forth between movies in Make-Up and movies in costumes. Both had similar praise.

Unfortunately, I can't add all graphics I made so here

movies,Movies from which you did not expect anything and ended up becoming one of your favorite movies?,"Just as the question says.

 

I ended up watching this movie when it was already halfway through (when Brendan asks Frank to participate in the tournament)

 

And seeing that it was a mixed martial arts movie, coupled with the great cast it had, I decided to give it a chance.

 

It turned out to be one of the best decisions I could make and to date it is one of my favorite movies, mainly because the whole martial arts thing is left a bit aside, when the real plot revolves around Brendan's family drama, Tommy, and his father Paddy.

 

What opinions do you have about it?

movies,99 Homes (2015) Review,"I went into this only knowing the 3 actors listed on this poster and that the setting was coming out of the housing recession. 

The story follows Dennis Nash, played by Andrew Garfield, a recently unemployed construction worker that gets evicted by Rick Carver, played by Michael Shannon, because his house that him, his mom Lynn, played by Laura Dern, and his son Connor, played by Noah Lomax, was foreclosed on and is owned by the bank and Rick Carver is the one in charge of the evictions issued by the bank. Dennis and his mom and son had to move into a motel, and they immediately find out that others who were evicted moved into the same motel complex. Dennis is taking inventory of his tools that are in his toolboxes and notices some are missing, and goes to Carver's business to accuse one of the guys who was taking Dennis' stuff out of his house after he was evicted. Carver comes out to inform the guys of another eviction he has to serve and is impressed by Dennis' gumption and offers him a job to work as a repairman on properties Carver gets evicted, and Dennis accepts. Over time, Dennis becomes Carver's assistant and starts carrying out evictions himself. It's revealed over halfway through the film that Carver and Dennis have similar backstories with their fathers having worked hard for nothing in return. Dennis is then issued to serve an eviction to Frank Greene, played by Tim Guinee, who is his son's best friend's dad but Greene fights the eviction and says the court will overturn it. Dennis asks Carver to take his checks as payments for his old house, and Carver tells him he will buy the house from the bank then Dennis will owe him what he pays for it, with the caveat that he can't move in for a few weeks but he can make repairs and repaint. Dennis surprised his mom and son with the house and they start working on getting the house repaired and repainted. There's then a big argument between Dennis and one of the homeowners Dennis had evicted, who moved into the same motel, all the while Dennis denies knowing him, because his mom and son don't know how he was able to get their house back. It eventually comes out that Dennis works for the man who evicted home, after Dennis presents his mom and son with a new house that he bought after selling their old house, his mom and son not wanting to live there and leaves Dennis to stay with Lynn's brother. Rick then gets his hands on a multimillion dollar deal, but it's in jeopardy when it comes to light that Frank Greene's fighting the eviction and the file is missing a crucial piece to solidify the eviction, which Mr. Freeman, played by Clancy Brown, and Carver draw up and have Dennis get to the court to get the eviction finalized. When Dennis shows up to evict Frank, and finds out he's armed, Dennis explains to Frank that he gave a forged document to the court to get Frank evicted, which causes Frank to surrender. The movie ends with Dennis sitting in a police cruiser while cops talk to Carver in the distance and one of Frank's children coming up to Dennis, who smiles then runs off.

I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. It's a little under 2 hours long, and once Dennis and his family get evicted, the drama is pretty much nonstop. Michael Shannon is phenomenal as Rick Carver, you feel like he's up to no good instantly when you first get introduced to him. Andrew Garfield playing an unemployed single father, and Noah Lomax looking like he could be his son, were great castings. Laura Dern, as always, is great in this! I do love the backstories on both Dennis and Carver, even if we don't get Carver's backstory until the last 30 minutes or so. It's one I'm gonna have to watch again to see things I missed. 

My rating: 4.5/5

Do I recommend? Yes.

Best performance: Michael Shannon

movies,"The first Cannes film festival was delayed because the Nazis invaded Poland THAT DAY, starting World War 2, and I can't believe there's never been a movie about this?!","Okay so it's been awhile since I read about this, I might be getting some details wrong. 

  
In the early 20th Century, Berlin and Venice were the only big international film festivals in Europe. France was jealous and wanted to get in on it. Mussolini and Hitler were in power, and when a French film lost the grand prize at Venice Intl Film Festival 1938 to an Italian film that was endorsed by Mussolini, they said that's it, and the French government created an international film festival as an official act. They decided on Cannes because it was a seaside, picturesque area and thought the end of the summer would be a perfect time of the year for it, so they decided on August 31st.

  
The first night, a Friday, only had one film screening, and Cannes had paid a ton of Hollywood film stars to come on an MGM yacht and shmooze, so they were drinking and hanging out and gossiping, with the understanding that the next day would be the real start of the festival, with multiple movies playing and discussions and all that. However, Germany invaded Poland on that day, September 1st, 1939, and the Cannes Film Festival was delayed, then 10 days later, France declared war on Germany and officially canceled the festival, sending all the American celebrities home, and the first real Cannes Film Festival was in 1946, after the end of WW2.

movies,What Makes a Film 'Good' to You? ,"My friend and I were watching a big commercial movie recently. he thought it was fun, but I couldn’t help critiquing the screenplay, cinematography, and weak plot. To me, cinema is an art form and a way to connect with people, but so many big-budget movies feel like brainless money grabs (looking at you, Marvel).

I’m a big fan of directors like Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Asghar Farhadi, Abbas Kiarostami, Akira Kurosawa, and Satyajit Ray, so I naturally look for deeper storytelling, strong screenplays, and great cinematography.

I’m not judging anyone’s taste. I love my friend and respect his opinion. But I’ve noticed a lot of people around me focus more on the actors than the actual content of the film.

So, I’m curious: What makes a good film for you? How do you define cinema, and what do you use to measure whether a film is good or not?",New-Call-3599,1gzn90z,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gzn90z/what_makes_a_film_good_to_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gzn90z/what_makes_a_film_good_to_you/,2024-11-25 16:43:38,0,0.37,0,0,35,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gzn90z

a. Which other actors or actresses are such?

Note: Not sure if 'working actor' can also be the correct term for my question. Perhaps 'working actor' only refers to actors (usually lesser known) that need to take almost any job to stay afloat.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Netherlands,"Hello there,

since more than a month, I ask you for your most favorite movie set plot-wise in a certain european country once a day. Sometimes, it turns out, that one or another of the suggested movies wasn't really set in the given country. That seems to be the case with *To Catch a Thief*, the ""winner"" of the Monaco round, which unfortunately shows no sign of actually being set in Monaco to any great extent. The runner-up in the voting - *Grand Prix* \- unfortunately doesn't fit the criteria here either. As all the other films have the same number of upvotes (minus downvotes), I'll have to think again about how to proceed. However, yesterday's result is somewhat more rewarding: ***Igla Ispod Praga*** (engl.: *The Black Pin*) wins for Montenegro. 

Honestly, I really thought, that *Casino Royale* would win, when we come to Montenegro, but at this point, it seems as people have learned from what I call ""the Belgium accident"", where a not-so-belgian movie made the cut. As always, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens today, when we move on one letter in alphabetical order to N for **Netherlands**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!
