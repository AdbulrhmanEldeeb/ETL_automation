Python,How we made Celery tasks bulletproof,"Hey folks, 

I just published a deep dive into how we handle task resilience at GitGuardian, where our Celery tasks scan GitHub PRs for secrets. Wanted to share some key learnings that might help others dealing with similar challenges.


**Key takeaways:**

1. Don‚Äôt just blindly retry tasks. Each type of failure (transient, resource limits, race conditions, code bugs ) needs its own handling strategy.
2. Crucial patterns we implemented:
   - Ensure tasks are idempotent (may not be straightforward, 
   - Used `autoretry_for` with specific exceptions + backoff
   - Implemented `acks_late` for process interruption protection
   - Created separate queues for resource-heavy tasks

**Watch out for:**

1. Never set task_retry_on_worker_lost=True (can cause infinite retries)
2. With Redis, ensure tasks complete within visibility_timeout
3. Different behavior between prefork vs thread/gevent models for OOM handling

Python,pytest-fixture-forms - A new plugin to simplify testing parameter variations,"Hey Python testing enthusiasts! I'm excited to share a pytest plugin I've been working on that makes testing different parameter variations much cleaner and more maintainable.

# What my project does

If you've ever found yourself writing lots of parametrized tests for different API inputs, credentials, or configuration combinations, you know it can get messy quickly. This plugin lets you organize these variations as fixture methods in a class, making your tests more structured and easier to maintain.

Here's a quick example:

    class UserCredentials(FixtureForms):
        @pytest.fixture
        def valid_user(self):
            return {""username"": ""john_doe"", ""password"": ""secure123""}
    
        @pytest.fixture
        def invalid_password(self):
            return {""username"": ""john_doe"", ""password"": ""wrong""}
    
    def test_login(user_credentials):
        response = login_service.authenticate(**user_credentials.value)
        if user_credentials.form == ""valid_user"":
            assert response.status_code == 200
        else:
            assert response.status_code == 401

Key Features:

* Auto-generates fixtures from class methods
* Integrates with pytest's parametrization
* Handles nested dependencies elegantly
* Zero configuration needed

# Target Audience

anyone want to write and maintain tests for combinations of parameter. it should be stable but hey! its a new project so expect rough edges.

# Comparison¬†

there is no currently plugin in pytest that let you dynamically generate fixtures and test nodes in similar way to how pytest-fixture-forms does. this plugin is also being actively used inside a real product(actually this plugin was written as inside an internal tool testing code and later migrated by me to become a standalone pytest plugin).

# Source

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Eliav2/pytest-fixture-forms) or install with `pip install pytest-fixture-forms`.

Python,Python binary which runs everwhere,"I wanted to share some insights about an interesting project called¬†[python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone)¬†that I've been exploring.

# What is python-build-standalone?

The¬†**python-build-standalone**¬†project produces fully usable Python installations that include most extension modules from the standard library. The key feature here is that it minimizes runtime dependencies.

# Why Use It?

1. **Portability**: The distributions are designed to work on any system for the targeted architecture, making it easier to deploy Python applications in diverse environments.
2. **Customizability**: Users can include build artifacts and rich metadata, which allows for downstream repackaging. This means you can create a custom Python distribution tailored to specific needs‚Äîgreat for embedding Python in larger binaries.
3. **Sister Project - PyOxy**: For those interested in enhancing their Python interpreter with Rust code, there's a related project called PyOxy that builds on these standalone distributions to create single-file executables.

# Getting Started

If you‚Äôre interested in trying out python-build-standalone, you can find the documentation¬†[here](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/). The documentation provides detailed instructions on how to build your own standalone Python distributions and includes examples of how to customize your builds.

# Use Cases

This tool is particularly beneficial for:

* Developers who need to distribute applications without requiring users to install Python or additional libraries.
* Projects that aim for a minimal footprint on user systems.
* Scenarios where embedding Python within other applications is necessary.

Happy coding!

Python,ML Trading Bot that uses Ranked Ensemble Learning,"I created a ML Trading Bot - trained it for a little over 3 years with 24 years of data and started it live on November 20, 2024. It's been going over a little more than 2 weeks, but it's been doing great so far - not indicative of how it will perform but it's had a great debut if you can say that.

GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/yeonholee50/AmpyFin](https://github.com/yeonholee50/AmpyFin)

Bot Website: [https://ampyfin-website.onrender.com/](https://ampyfin-website.onrender.com/)

**What My Project Does**

In essence, the trading bot ranks the strategies and gives them weights based on their overall performance while giving slight bias to recent performance (this is so it is reactive to current market trends and adjusts accordingly). These weights determine how much influence they have on the trading strategy. That's the oversimplified explanation of how the bot works. A more descriptive explanation is done on the website as well as README

**Target Audience**

Reason why I'm posting here is because I'm currently looking for contributors who have some expertise in Python (maybe want to contribute or just interested) on the trading strategies side. The more trading and diverse strategies there are, the better the bot will perform. This project is aimed towards developers interested in contributing or just anyone interested in the project. Currently there is 60 strategies, but the aim is to get much more: at least 100. If you have any questions on how it works or just interested in contributing, please don't hesitate to dm or comment.

**Comparison**

Most trading bots either use one strategy or multiple combination of strategies. The one's that use ML are too complex to understand or use libraries with jargons that are too coated. I specifically used ranked ensemble learning because it's something I've used in the past (for a facial feature measurement application for a medical company), but also because it's quite simple to understand and effective at the same time.",Inevitable-Air-1712,1h7qtzs,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h7qtzs/ml_trading_bot_that_uses_ranked_ensemble_learning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h7qtzs/ml_trading_bot_that_uses_ranked_ensemble_learning/,2024-12-06 02:26:49,3,0.54,3,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1h7qtzs

# # Target Audience

anyone trying to understand code behaviour (specifically Leetcode problems)

\# Comparison

Unlike standard IDEs or debuggers, this tool focuses on simplifying the debugging process for LeetCode-style coding challenges. It provides a clear, visual breakdown of what‚Äôs happening under the hood, making it easier to spot issues and understand how each line affects the program‚Äôs state.

Python,HandiRokuRemote (Open Source) - Control your Roku with only your hand gestures,"###What My Project Does
This is a Python application that lets you control your Roku device with nothing but hand gestures! Using Mediapipe's Hand Landmark Detector, it tracks your hand, identifies gestures, and sends commands to your Roku via its External Control Protocol.

Check out the [demo gif](https://imgur.com/zVbX1T6)

Features:

*Real-time hand tracking: Gestures like ""thumbs up"" control volume or navigation.

*Cross-device support: Works with any Roku device on the same network.

*Easy setup: Plug in a camera, and you‚Äôre ready to go.

###Target Audience
The target audience is anyone who's ever lost their TV remote, but probably more likely fellow tinkerers and anyone interested in computer-vision.

###Comparison
As far as I can tell, there is no comparison. I've looked around and haven't found anything that does what this does. I guess the only comparison is a regular remote (but you lost that earlier, remember?)
