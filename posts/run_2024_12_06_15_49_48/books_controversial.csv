*There has been a wellspring of replies to this post and I am overwhelmed by the positive and life-affirming reactions. Thank you everyone, for the wonderful, thought-provoking and oftentimes personal replies. I've been reading every one!*  
  
Whether it's related to guilt over my participation in recent Black Friday sales, the need to make space for a proper kids' playroom, or a long-simmering reckoning against too many material possessions--I am considering significantly downsizing my book collection.

Literature (writing and reading) is largely my main hobby in life, but I am starting to look at my bookshelves and wonder, ""Do I really need that book?"" I recently began purchasing the odd ""fine press"" edition of favourite books (its own form of excess, I know, but hear me out) and it got me thinking about the worth I place on my \~1,000 books. Do I want to keep books that weren't life-changing, 5-star reads, just so I can hoard like some literary goblin who gets to point and say to guests, ""See, I read lots!""?

Has anyone else gone through a sort of reckoning like this? Did you sell them to recoup some of the costs over the years/decades, or just donate them? How did you go about downsizing--clear everything that wasn't an absolute favourite? Hold the ones that were 4 stars that others might enjoy? Hold onto classics just because they are classics? Hold onto rare or expensive or sentimental?

books,just finished ‚Äúlonesome dove‚Äù and i am crying ,"i am so sorry for this rant but i have to get this off of my chest üò≠üò≠

wow wow wow wow. i am completely in awe of this book. this is an understatement.

first off, i don‚Äôt really read western type of books. i mostly stick to classics, literary fiction, short stories, YA (every once in a while), etc. the only ‚Äúwestern‚Äù author i read was cormac mccarthy. i LOVED ‚Äúno country for old men‚Äù and ‚Äúthe road‚Äù (to be honest , those are the only books i read from mccarthy lol). and i also tend to read shorter books because of my attention span üò©

but every once in a while, i like to challenge myself. in the beginning of this year, i decided to try ‚Äúwar and peace‚Äù and was blown away by it.

i decided to finish this year off with a long book but i wasn‚Äôt sure which one. then i saw a bunch of people on my goodreads and reddit feed praising ‚Äúlonesome dove.‚Äù i got curious. i figured that if i didn‚Äôt like it, i could always dnf.

let me just say‚Äîi never thought of dnfing this book. from the first sentence i was HOOKED!! the writing style was so vivid and raw without being tedious. mcmurtry‚Äôs writing style was honest and interesting. every single character had their own way of speaking and mannerisms it was incredible. all the characters were fleshed out; they came across like actual people from that time period. 

i loved all of the characters (except jake spoon). my favorite ones were gus, newt and lorena. i think that with these characters, mcmurtry‚Äôs writing style was the most powerful. i loved how he treated lorena with grace‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt treat her like many of the men treated her (and other prostitutes). and on that note, he also treated minorities (like the native americans and black people) with respect‚Äîmeaning, not rudely or even ‚Äúspecial.‚Äù as a black woman reading this, i had to brace myself. i thought mcmurtry would paint the native americans, prostitutes and black people as either evil, mary sues who could do no wrong, or just victims. but he didn‚Äôt do that. he was realistic. just like the white men in the story, these minority groups had the potential for being good, neutral or bad. they were all humans. he was realistic. i hope this makes sense.

mcmurtry was so skillful that i felt like i was physically in the story with his characters, traveling with them, roping horses, etc. it was so good that i was thinking about learning how to ride a horse and channel my inner cowboy ü§† 

what i loved the most about this story was the narrative style. it wasn‚Äôt choppy. it was the perfect blend between dialogue and description. that was my biggest concern when i thought about reading this book. i was scared that this big book would have either just dialogue or tedious descriptions. but it was a perfect combination of both. i know this is minor to most people but this issue had led me to dnf so many books during my (short) lifetime.

i also liked how mcmurtry approached this time period. i‚Äôm not crazy about historical fiction (i tend to get bored), but he did a fantastic job. it made me curious to actually learn more about this time period.

mcmurtry captured leaving and staying in places so well. as someone who moved around, so much of his characters‚Äô journey resonated with me. there was a sense of excitement for a new place and yet a loneliness in that that resonated with me. i might have cried during the last chapter.

and im so sad that now this journey is over. i was dragging my feet a little towards the last few chapters because i quite literally didn‚Äôt want to finish the book. but now it‚Äôs done. while i have left this beautiful story, i suspect that the story will not leave me.

and this quote below perfectly describes the book and my feelings about finishing it:

""It's funny, leaving a place, ain't it?"" he said. ""You never do know when you'll get back.""

books,God emperor of dune is so interesting ,"I loved this book. I loved leto‚Äôs ramblings and I loved moneo. And I loved the way the golden path is explained. 

But this book had a few major issues for me. 

The biggest is the dialogue. Half the time I had no idea wtf anyone was talking about. The other half, the dialogue felt so robotic. And the emotion is so unreadable. Also, I‚Äôve never seen anyone use as many exclamation points as frank herbert. Especially when they‚Äôre not needed or when they don‚Äôt fit the scene and emotion. A character doesn‚Äôt cry but exclaims. A character can be trying to say something quietly but there‚Äôs an exclamation mark. It sends so many mixed signals that it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs happening. I swear there‚Äôs at least one exclamation point in every paragraph. 

The second is that everyone except Leto is very flat.  Hwi noree and Duncan and moneo and siona could have been so interesting but they are barely explored. And these characters barely show emotion besides anger. The only exception is Hwi. But she is written to be crying in response to almost anything that Leto says. No matter what he says. Leto could say ‚Äúman, it sucks to be a dictator‚Äù and she just starts bawling for no reason. 

One last thing: Hwi and Duncan had zero chemistry. Idk why their love was even included. Especially because it makes no sense in the context of the plot and had no impact on the plot. Presumably Duncan met Hwi once ‚Äúoff screen.‚Äù And the next time we see them, they just have sex. Like wtf. That came out of nowhere. And it‚Äôs not like their love has any impact on the plot because their relationship is ignored by Leto. Siona doesn‚Äôt give a shit. And moneo acts like it‚Äôs blasphemy but doesn‚Äôt do anything to stop them other than just saying stop. 

Also I would have liked to see leto‚Äôs ‚Äòpeace‚Äô explored a bit more. How did his atrocities compare to his father. Paul‚Äôs ascension to the throne caused the death of 61 billion. How much did leto‚Äôs stagnation of progress do? The stagnation of medicine, of ecological developments, of new helpful technology, etc.

Edit: also the homophobic rants were also pretty irritating to read",Feisty-Treacle3451,1h7vko7,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h7vko7/god_emperor_of_dune_is_so_interesting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h7vko7/god_emperor_of_dune_is_so_interesting/,2024-12-06 06:56:08,46,0.84,46,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h7vko7
books,"Weekly Recommendation Thread: December 06, 2024","Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!

**How to get the best recommendations**

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.
