I’m interested in learning how to use code and hardware to collect data from satellites. I’ve seen books like 

Thomas Ager
The Essentials of SAR: A Conceptual View of Synthetic Aperture Radar and Its Remarkable Capabilities 

Joel Lawhead
Learning Geospatial Analysis with Python

I’m looking for books or resources that can guide me through the process, from the basics to more advanced techniques.
Does anyone know of any good books or resources that cover topics like:

Integrating hardware (like sensors) with code to gather data from satellites
Using programming languages (such as Python or R or even JS) for data collection and analysis

Practical examples or case studies involving satellite data collection

I’m also curious about where to start if you’re a beginner in this field. Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!
