artificial,"the top five ais have already been estimated to earn above-genius-level iq scores. things are about to get very, very interesting.","


iq estimates for ais have not yet been formally standardized, but based on their scores on various benchmarks and tests, researchers have approximated their ""intelligence,"" or iq-equivalent.

on november 29, 2024 i asked some of the top ais to estimate the iqs of the top five ais. here are the results, (keep in mind that the average iq of the profession with the highest score, medical doctor, is 120, genius-level iq is 130 wais/140 s-b, and the iq of the average nobel laureate is 150):

gpt-4o
1. gpt-4o: 130–150
2. gemini 1: 130–145
3. claude 2: 120–135
4. llama 2: 110–125
5. palm 2: 115–130

co-pilot
1. gpt-4 turbo (0409): 150-160
2. claude 3 opus: 145-155
3. gpt-4 omni (0807): 150-160
4. claude 3.5 sonnet: 140-150
5. gemini pro 1.5: 135-145

claude:
1. claude 3.5 sonnet: 160-180
2. gpt-4: 150-170
3. gemini ultra: 140-160
4. claude opus: 145-165
5. llama 3: 130-150

llama3:
1. palm 2: 160-180
2. llama (meta): 150-170
3. bard: 140-160
4. chatgpt: 130-150
5. ernie (baidu): 120-140

gemini advanced:
gpt-4: 145-160+
gpt-3.5: 110-130
bard: 100-120
claude: 110-130
llama: 90-110

you may have noticed that the results vary, and some models tend to rank themselves highest. obviously, more objective measures are needed. but the above scores suggest that ai agents are already more than intelligent enough to assist, or in some cases replace, top human personnel in virtually every job, field and profession where iq makes a difference. that's why in 2025 enterprise ai agent use is expected to go through the roof.

so hold on to your hats because during these next few years our world is poised to advance across every sector in ways we can hardly imagine!
