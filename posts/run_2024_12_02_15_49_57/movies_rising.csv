movies,Nutcrackers (2024) starring Ben Stiller ruined my day,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  
  
Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can’t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he’s ruined.
  
It’s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn’t exist. This is one of those times. The movie’s not entertaining, it’s not dramatic, it’s just pointless. I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it’s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time. You’ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

movies,In Bruges. Wow.,"So I watched In Bruges and this is really a reddit movie, in a positive way, because it's one of these movies that you can find quoted around here, mainly in big threads, without loads of context, 'cause everyone and their mum but the reader knows where the damn quote originates from.

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

It's darkly comedic and sometimes tragic and it manages both emotions with ease. 

All in all: a fantastic piece of cinema and my personal introduction to the great mind of Martin McDonagh.",Phyliinx,1h4mh25,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4mh25/in_bruges_wow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4mh25/in_bruges_wow/,2024-12-02 04:12:22,490,0.87,490,0,145,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4mh25

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",PresentRevenue1347,1h4lwrm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,2024-12-02 03:41:52,119,0.77,119,0,77,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4lwrm

Call it schadenfreude or just the pleasure of watching someone else's life go worse than mine.

Classics of the genre:

Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.

A Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).

The Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.

Honorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.
