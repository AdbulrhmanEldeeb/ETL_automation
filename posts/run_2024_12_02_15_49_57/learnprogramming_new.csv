learnprogramming,🏎✏ Dotrace game in Js,"After 4 months of development, I'm delighted to present my DotRace game!

This strategic racing game is inspired by the classic game of racing with a pencil on a small sheet of paper (moving points with inertia)... yes, I drew trajectories for a good part of my childhood!

It can be played online at this address: [http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/](http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/)

Some technical information:

* Choice of game mode :
   * Time Attack: Beat the AI
   * Race: Single race
   * Championship: Several races in a row
* Choice of tracks :
   * Pre-integrated tracks (well-known F1 circuits, spirals, bizarre shapes, etc.)
   * Random track generator with choice (min, max) of total track length, width and length of road sections, angles...
* Player configuration :
   * Up to 4 human players (on the same screen)
   * Opponents with configurable AI level
   * 8 players in tracks
   * Button assistance options (best choice)
* Screen configuration :
   * Quick glance to see the entire track
   * Full screen mode
   * Camera follows player
   * Speed-dependent widening of the view (to “see further”)
* Sound configuration :
   * Choice of 3 sound themes:
      * Sound of marker pen on a sheet of paper
      * Sound of my car (A-Class 250, yes, I'm a 50-year-old)
      * The sound of a spaceship
   * Choice of sound volume for opponents
   * Speed of movement...
* Main path-finding algorithm
   * The main principle of my algorithm is that it doesn't know the arrival points, it just tries to go as far as possible in as few moves as possible. A nice recursive function calculates all possible paths and determines the best one.
   * The “AI level” (variable from 2 to 8 for each player) corresponds to the depth of this recursive search for the best path.
   * The position of opponents is not taken into account when calculating the path, which can lead to accidents and run-offs when the width of the track is reduced and several players covet the same point.
* About 4,000 lines of javascript typed with my old fingers...

My question concerns the possibility of simply running the same code in an android apk? for free?

I am also interested in your suggestions for improving my game.

Thank you.

learnprogramming, Beginner Project: The God Protocol – Looking for Feedback and Advice,"Hi everyone!

I’m new to programming (just about a month in) and have been experimenting with an idea I’m calling *The God Protocol*. This project started as a way for me to learn and explore data compression and encoding, but it’s turning into something I feel might be worth sharing for feedback.

The basic idea is to compress and encode data in a way that speeds up how AI systems, humans, and machines share and process information. While I’m new to all this, I’ve done some testing and wanted to share what I’ve observed so far:

# What I’ve Found So Far:

* **Faster Processing:**
   * Compared to traditional formats, the protocol handles large datasets much faster.
   * Example:
      * RDF/XML: 2.97 seconds for 78 KB.
      * Standard JSON: 0.52 seconds for 8 MB.
      * My approach: 0.31 seconds, and combining it with binary encoding brought it down to 0.003 seconds.
* **Works with Any File Format:**
   * The encoded data seems flexible—it works across binary, CSV, JSON, etc., while staying compact and fast.
* **Scales Well:**
   * Even as datasets grow, the framework holds up with low processing times and flexibility.
* **AI-Centric Design:**
   * The setup seems to help AI systems, allowing for smaller, faster models without extra processing overhead.

# Why I’m Sharing This:

I’m still very new to programming, so I’m sure there are things I’m missing. I wanted to ask this community for thoughts and advice because I’m not sure if this is practical or if there are blind spots I’m overlooking. Specifically:

1. Does this seem like a useful or valuable approach to improving how we handle data?
2. Are there areas I should research further to improve my understanding?
3. How might this compare to tools like Protobuf, MessagePack, or Avro?

# Note:

I’m not revealing the exact methods just yet since I want to refine my understanding first. But I’m happy to share more general details if that helps clarify anything!

Thanks in advance for your time and feedback. I’m still learning and want to grow from this experience, so any advice is greatly appreciated!",SHIR0___0,1h4r19h,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r19h/beginner_project_the_god_protocol_looking_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r19h/beginner_project_the_god_protocol_looking_for/,2024-12-02 09:14:17,1,0.67,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Code Review,,t3_1h4r19h

learnprogramming,Can someone explain the output of this code for me? (C Language),"I'm studying Computer Programming. There is a code in a question in one of my exams. The solution say that the correct answer is ""The last letter of the output is ""I"""".

I got ""T"" as the last letter. I got confused so I tried run the code with AI and it also say that the last letter is ""I"" so I got even more confused.  The code is:

    int i = 2;
    char text[] = ""ALGORITHM"";
    while (i &lt; 8) {
        printf(""%c"", text[i]);
        i += 2;
    }

* When `i = 2`, `text[2]` is 'G'.
* When `i = 4`, `text[4]` is 'R'.
* When `i = 6`, `text[6]` is 'I'.
* When `i = 8`, the loop condition `i &lt; 8` fails, so the loop stops.

So, the output of this code will be:

    GRI

\[The output is from AI\]

So, from what my little brain understands, the text\[2\] which is the third letter in ""ALGORITHM"" is ""G"".  
text\[4\] which is the fifth letter is ""R"". Understandable.

But the text\[6\] which ""should be"" the seventh letter which is ""T"" but it appears to be ""I""

I've been stunned by this for a couple of hours now, someone please explain this to me please.

learnprogramming,"Having trouble sticking to any one thing, advice? (ADHD may be relevant)","note: I wrote this somewhat out of order so excuse if I've repeated myself.

Background: I'm in my early twenties and this year got diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, recently I was able to get on medication, which has been a good help, and it's why I'm choosing now to try to tackle this.

I'm not a CS student, nor do I want to be. I'm not pursuing a career in CS or anything related to it. I just have a significant interest in programming, and see it as a hobby and creative outlet.

I got my first computer at 12 and I've been using Linux since I was about 13. So I'm pretty competent at using Bash, writing shell scripts for friends to solve little tasks, and writing ebuilds for my Gentoo install.

In high-school I took an intro to programming class, where I learned some basic Python and Java. The most complicated of things that I made were some terminal based games, and a couple of basic GUI games with some Java game engine.

But outside of the classroom environment, I've really struggled with adding some depth to my knowledge with self-learning. I've basically forgot all the Python and Java I learned after I finished the class, and the only thing I'm able to retain is a fair bit of Bash since I use it daily in the shell.

I've had a lot of fun in the past messing with different languages and started a handful of projects.

* Didn't love C
* Stuck with Haskell for awhile before I started to feel like I was wasting my time as a hobbyist
* Stuck with Scheme and Racket, for SICP and HtDP2, but again felt like I was wasting time
* Stuck with Go probably the longest out of anything since high-school, never really had a reason to stop, but I broke my streak of using it, and never started back up
* Thought C++ was cool
* More recently wrote some simple Rust, thought it was very productive, but kinda funky feeling? Starting to get a little embarrassed at how many attempts at learning and stopping I've made, and this isn't even all of them, so I'll cut it short here

I'd say at the moment, maybe it's just recency bias, but I'm most interested in C++ and Rust. There's something I particularly like about compiled languages, that I can't really explain, just makes my brain happy I guess. I have a preference for languages with a good book to read. And I have enough experience I feel, that I don't need to restart with a beginner to programming book like, one that might teach you to use Python to program a magic 8 ball or something.

I'm very much rambling at this point that I don't think I've stayed on topic, and instead just dumped a mishmash of details about myself here, so a tl;dr is in order...

***tl;dr:*** I have ADHD, recently got on medication. Despite taking a high-school programming class, I've forgotten everything except some Bash. I don't want a CS career or education, just a hobby that might be useful at times. Any advice on how to stay focused on a project/language long enough for the snowball to keep rolling? And where might be a good place to pick back up, as someone with a little experience?

learnprogramming,How to become faster at coding and completing tasks at work? ,"Hey everyone,  

I’ve read a lot of posts about people feeling slow at work, but most focus on productivity or focus issues. That’s not my case—I work my full 8 hours non-stop, sometimes even skipping lunch to get more done. On some occasions, I even work overtime when I get at home (without my team knowing) just to speed things up.  

The problem is that my lead thinks I’m slow. He’s generally a chill and cool person, and he doesn’t put a lot of pressure on me, but he often seems disappointed with my progress. I frequently hear comments like, *“Oh, you’re still working on that? Don’t you think it’s taking too long?”*  

I’ve reflected on this, and I admit that compared to the other member on the team, I am slower. But here’s the frustrating part: I’m genuinely putting in the effort. I work nonstop, put in overtime, and still struggle to keep up. It’s not that I don’t know what I’m doing—I do. I make progress, sure sometimes i get stuck but most of the time I'm not stuck i am progressing but still slow

Honestly, this is starting to get to me. I’m not offended by the comments, but I’m frustrated with myself because I feel like I’m failing to meet expectations, no matter how hard I try.  

It’s worth mentioning that this is my first job. I’m five months in, and before this, I use to work as a freelancer for years. This is my first experience in a company setting.  

Have any of you faced similar challenges? Is there some things that we can do to become more fast at coding? I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

learnprogramming,Need Help Confirming Address Space Size Calculations for Logical and Physical Addresses,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on a problem involving address space sizes, and I want to confirm if my understanding and calculations are correct. Here’s the problem:

We’re given:
1. A logical address space of **256 pages**.
2. A page size of **4 KiB (2¹² bytes)**.
3. Physical memory consisting of **64 frames**.

I’ve attempted the solution as follows:

### Logical Address:
The number of pages in the logical address space is 256, so to represent 256 pages, we need:  

**Bits for Page Number** = log₂(256) = 8 bits.  

The page size is 4 KiB = 2¹² bytes.  
To represent the byte offset within a page, we need:  

**Bits for Page Offset** = log₂(2¹²) = 12 bits.  

**Total Logical Address Bits** = Bits for Page Number + Bits for Page Offset = 8 + 12 = **20 bits**.  

### Physical Address:
The number of frames in physical memory is 64.  
To represent 64 frames, we need:  

**Bits for Frame Number** = log₂(64) = 6 bits.  

The frame size is the same as the page size (4 KiB = 2¹² bytes).  
To represent the byte offset within a frame, we need:  

**Bits for Frame Offset** = log₂(2¹²) = 12 bits.  

**Total Physical Address Bits** = Bits for Frame Number + Bits for Frame Offset = 6 + 12 = **18 bits**.  


Can someone confirm if these calculations are correct, or let me know if I’ve misunderstood any part of the problem? I’d also appreciate any insights into alternative ways to think about address space size calculations if there’s a simpler approach.  

Thanks in advance for your help! 😊",Fre5h_J4,1h4g97u,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4g97u/need_help_confirming_address_space_size/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4g97u/need_help_confirming_address_space_size/,2024-12-01 23:03:01,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h4g97u
learnprogramming,How do I access files a game dev sent me?,"For context, I am a newbie game dev using Ren'Py, an assisted program for making visual novels.

The developer of an awesome game sent me the code so I (a newbie) can learn and study. The files come in three forms: Windows Media Player, RPYC File, and BAK File.

I can access BAK Files just fine, but only a few of the files have that option, most just have the first two. RPYC is gibberish (it's what Ren'Py uses to run) and Windows Media Player just... can't. It isn't a video. I downloaded a better video player and it doesn't work (it's a file. I want the code.)

I'm at a loss. Is there a way to decode a file like the RPYC? Do I have to somehow open the Windows Media Player file on notepad (works for BAK)? Should I reach out to the dev and, if so, what do I say? Any advice welcome.

learnprogramming,How to write Pseudocode in an efficient way?,"I have to learn pseudocode for some exams and I really feel like it's harder than simply writing programming-code. Since we can't use a specific language, I always end up writing everything way more verbosely, because it feels like pseudocode is meant to still be very exact and also easy to understand for non-programmers.

I like programming for the clear structure and rules. So I basically want the same for pseudocode.

I mainly program in Java und Kotlin, but also know some Python. Python seems quite well-suited for pseudocode. So I might want to basically write Python with some Kotlin, where Python is less expressive (e.g. fun instead of def for functions).

Do you have tipps and rules for efficient and readable pseudocode, that doesn't take an eternity to think about or write down?

**Examples with Python + Kotlin for Pseudocode**

Write a function that takes two numbers from the user and prints out the sum of those.

    fun add():
      set x = input
      set y = input
    
      print(x + y)

  
Write a function that takes a list of sales figures, adds them together and prints out the total sales in $.

    fun total_sales(sales_figues):

learnprogramming,How to Efficiently Convert a 250MB CSV File with 1 Million Rows to XLSX in AWS S3,"# Problem:

I'm working on a project where I need to **convert large CSV files (250MB, with 1 million+ rows)** to **XLSX format** and save them back to **AWS S3**. The CSV is stored in an S3 bucket, and I’m trying to do the conversion directly from S3 without downloading the file locally due to its large size.

However, I’m facing performance issues, as processing and converting these large files takes a lot of time. My current approach is based on **Node.js**, using libraries like `xlsx`, `fast-csv`, and **AWS SDK** for reading and writing to S3.

# What I’ve Tried:

1. **Streaming the CSV file**: I’ve tried using `fast-csv` to stream the file and process it in chunks. However, I still face memory and performance bottlenecks when writing the data to XLSX, especially with large files.
2. **Worker Threads**: I’ve attempted to parallelize processing by using **worker threads** to handle chunks of the CSV data. This doesn’t seem to improve the performance significantly.
3. **Buffering Issues**: I am encountering issues related to **buffers**, **memory consumption**, and **XLSX formatting**, as writing each row to the workbook one by one leads to significant delays, particularly with over a million rows.
4. // Example of my approach to processing CSV and converting to XLSX
5. const { S3Client, GetObjectCommand, PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
6. const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker\_threads');
7. const fastcsv = require('fast-csv');
8. const xlsx = require('xlsx');
9. const { PassThrough } = require('stream');
10. const s3 = new S3Client({ region: 'us-east-1' });
11. const bucketName = 'my-bucket';
12. const inputFileKey = 'path/to/my-csv.csv';
13. const outputFileKey = 'output\_data.xlsx';
14. function processCSVInChunks() {
15.   // Reading CSV from S3, then converting and writing to XLSX

Joe has organized a party for M guests and has planned a party game. In the game, Joe gives everyone a string S and explains to them the rules to play the game. The rules to play the game are as follows The string S needs to be distributed among the M guests, and each guest must get at least one character.

Out of all the stored smallest lexicographical distributions, the largest lexicographical string must be found for distributing ""good"" and the number of guests are 3. Here are all possible ways in which you can distribute the string among 3 guests: ((o, o, dg), (oo, d, g), (o, do, g), (o, d, go), (o, d, og), (o, gd, o), (o, od, g)\] Now, the lexicographically smallest strings among all these distributions are

learnprogramming,Need Help with Banker’s Algorithm: Minimal Resources for a Safe State,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a problem involving the Banker’s Algorithm, and I’m stuck on determining the smallest value of x for which the system is in a safe state. Here’s the problem setup:

**Problem Description:**

The system has 4 processes and 5 allocatable resources. The current allocation, maximum needs, and available resources are as follows:

|Process|Allocation|Max|Available|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P0|1 0 2 1 1|1 2 1 3| 0 0 x 1 2|
|P1|2 0 1 1 0|2 2 1 0||
|P2|1 1 0 1 0|2 1 3 1 0||
|P3|1 1 1 1 0|1 2 2 2 1||

**Objective:**

What is the smallest value of x such that this is a safe state?

**Hints provided:**

1. Compute the ""needs matrix"" (Need=Max−Allocation).
2. Identify the process that can complete first if x is sufficiently large.

I’ve calculated the needs matrix and tried different values for x, but I’m not entirely sure how to proceed with finding the exact smallest x that ensures the system remains in a safe state. I’d appreciate if someone could guide me through the steps or point me to resources that explain this process in detail.

Thanks in advance for your help!

**What I’ve Tried So Far:**

* Calculated the needs matrix:
   * Need\[i\]\[j\]=Max\[i\]\[j\]-Allocation\[i\]\[j\],
      * where i represents the process number, j represents the resource type. The Max matrix indicates the maximum demand of each resource for each process. The Allocation matrix indicates the resources currently allocated to each process.
   * For each process Pᵢ and each resource Rⱼ, subtract the allocated resources from the maximum demand:  
      * Need ᵢⱼ=Max ᵢⱼ−Allocation ᵢⱼ 

# 

|Process|Allocation (A)|Max (M)|Need (M - A)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P0|\[1,0,2,1,1\]|\[1,1,2,1,3\]|\[0,1,0,0,2\]|
|P1​|\[2,0,1,1,0\]|\[2,2,2,1,0\]|\[0,2,1,0,0\]|
|P2​|\[1,1,0,1,0\]|\[2,1,3,1,0\]|\[1,0,3,0,0\]|
|P3​|\[1,1,1,1,0\]|\[1,1,2,2,1\]|\[0,0,1,1,1\]|

Now, given the availability vector, we know that R₁=0, R₂=0, R₄=1, R₆=2 are fixed, but we want to determine R₃.

A process can execute if its resource requirements (from the Needs Matrix) are less than or equal to the resources currently available. For each process Pᵢ, we check if:  

Need\[i\]\[j\] ≤ Available \[j\] ∀j   

Where:

− Need\[i\]\[j\] is the need of process Pᵢ for resource Rⱼ.

− Available \[j\] is the current availability of resource Rⱼ.

If Need(P₀)=\[0,1,0,0,2\], then:

\- For R₁: 0 ≤ 0 (satisfied)

\- For R₂: 1 ≤ 0 (not satisfied, so P₀ cannot run yet),

\- For R₃: 0 ≤ x (always satisfied because 0 ≤ x for any x ),

\- For R₄: 0 ≤ 1 (satisfied),

\- For R₅: 2 ≤ 2 (satisfied).

Since all conditions are not satisfied, do we state that P₀ cannot run? Do we repeat this calculation process for the other P's? But I am not sure how we get to the point of determining the smallest x.

learnprogramming,Coding  a native application to find lyrics in music files,"Hi everyone!

Yes, I read the FAQ, yes I've researched the topic for a while and still haven't reached a conclusive answer. Maybe my search terms are wrong, maybe I am not good at this. Anyhow...

I'm starting a personal project to build a native application (for Linux, ideally) that can determine if a song has lyrics. I find music helpful to focus, but lyrics can be distracting.

Currently my solution is just listening to bits and pieces of the songs and sorting them efficiently, but manually using a bash script.

I'm hoping to create a program that can analyze audio files and identify whether or not they contain significant amounts of vocal content (lyrics). Ideally, the program would analyse the whole library and write a commentary in the metadata of each track.

However, I'm stuck on the technical side. I'm not sure what technologies would be best suited for this task. Does anyone have experience with developing programs that analyze audio for vocal content? Are there established libraries or frameworks I should be looking into? Is this even feasible?  
I'm particularly interested in:

Possible technologies: e.g., libraries for audio analysis

Existing solutions: if any already exist and I just haven't stumbled upon them. Proprietary and even expensive programs might be worth it, but it has to be processed locally.

Potential challenges: things I might not have considered

learnprogramming,Seeking advice on handling images and optimize costs in my ASP.NET App,"I apologize for asking you guys to ""solve"" my problem.  
I'll try to provide some context first.

I recently created a rudimentary application with 2 components:

1. A frontend application that has 2 pages and that fetches car entities from firebase. - 1 overview page that displays said cars through pagination. - 1 page to display one particular car entity and all its details.
2. A .NET desktop application to upload car data + images to firebase.

A problem is that the load time for the images is extremely big, the overview page takes 7-8+ seconds to load.  
Each entity has \~10 images and the overview page initially loads 6 entities, so that's 60 images. Small edit -&gt; I did use compression for the images fetched on the overview, it did not improve load times in a noticeable way.

I'm using a free tier version of hosting for the frontend application and as well for firestore and firebase storage so I can't complain about speed but few other concerns did pop in my head aaaand long story short and after a bit of research I'm now currently trying to steer towards a full stack .net application instead that I will probably host on Azure.

Now, below are my plans, concerns and questions where I do need some feedback. :&lt;

One of the most concerning things is optimizing the bandwidth for all the data transfers regarding images, I would like to carefully approach this.  
Some safety guards against malicious users spamming requests are also welcomed, I'm not sure if this will even be a real problem.  
Ultimately, decent loading times are also important.

I'll try to somehow arrange my plans based on the topic.

A. Due to the simplicity of the application my current plan revolves around creating a [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC Web App and using a Linux container to host it in Azure as an app service.

B. The total amount of data that I will have is really small, around 50-100 car entities at max.  
For storing the images I'll most probably go with azure blob storage but for storing the car entity details I'm not sure. I would only need two tables. One holding the car details and the other having all the references to the images blob storage images, both with few records.  
Is using the storage provided by App Service a viable alternative?

C. My application doesn't target users from different regions/countries. However, I've read Azure CDN can optimize bandwidth usage and load times.  
Is a CDN necessary for this application?

D. How can I protect myself against malicious users?  
Sorry if this is a extremely stupid question but are there any built-in safeguards for someone spamming million requests to fetch images from the blob storage?  
How to handle this kind of issue?

E. I assume caching is essential for this, it will help optimizing data transfer and costs.  
Any tips for implementing caching effectively for this?

F. COSTS... after all, is going full Azure a good idea for this?  
While I don't want to cut corners unnecessarily I would prefer to approach this in a smart way.  
Unfortunately, my lack of experience is showing.

How would you approach this? Are the technologies/cloud provider I chose suitable for my context?

I will HIGHLY appreciate any kind of input about this.

learnprogramming,My Programming Learning Journey: Struggling with Syntax and Cognitive Load After Two Years of Consistent Effort,"I've been seriously learning programming for over two years now, with a particularly intense period of daily coding and study since summer 2023. My ""uptime"" has been close to about 98% — I'm committed, but something fundamental feels broken in how I learn

Every time I start something new, it feels like pure torture. Whether it's a new stack or technology, the process drains the life out of me. Learning seems like a constant battle where every single step is either a snag or a stumbling block

My Learning Process:

\- I break down tutorial videos into tiny 7-minute segments

\- Take extremely detailed notes (down to the dot)

\- Rewatch these segments multiple times

\- Spend literally 30 minutes of real life analyzing just one minute of video

\- Despite all this effort, I retain maybe 1/20 of the information



The most frustrating part? Others seem to breeze through content by binge-watching, while I'm meticulously dissecting every moment and still feeling lost



Current Focus: Frontend development, currently wrestling with advanced Redux (RTK)



Biggest Challenge: Syntax retention. I understand logic most of the time, but remembering syntax feels impossible. Even after breaking concepts down into minute, simple parts, the connections remain fuzzy.



I've tried everything:

\- Detailed note-taking

\- Repeated viewing

\- Breaking down concepts

\- Intensive study sessions



But documentation feels like a foreign language. YouTube tutorials often show workarounds different from docs, making everything more confusing. I can spend 14 days, 5 hours daily on a 50-minute video and still only grasp a vague understanding.



Emotional Toll:

It feels like I'm constantly hitting my head against a wall. Each new technology seems like an entirely different world, and the learning curve appears almost vertical.



I'm not looking for sympathy, but insight. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you break through this seemingly impenetrable wall of learning?

learnprogramming,Creating a game in console before creating a UI,"I'm very early into learning C++ but I have a grasp on the basic concepts. Whilst not programming, I'm drafting out an idea on a very long term project I'm thinking about making.

learnprogramming,system() returning different value with gcc,"I'm writing an interepreter, and I have an end-to-end test program in C++ which calls the interpreter executable. To get things off the ground, I'm just calling it with `system()`. Something like this.

    const int ReturnValue = system(Command.c_str());
    assert(ExpectedReturnValue == ReturnValue);

On Windows, this seems to be working fine. But my CI runs in Gitlab on some sort of Linux image with gcc. Over there, it works fine when my interpreter returns 0, but when it returns 1, the `system()` command returns 256. I know the interpret is running fine, because I see it printing out the correct value before it exits:

    std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""Returning "" &lt;&lt; Retval &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return Retval;

My understanding of [the man page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html) is that the return value of system should be the return value of the last command it executes...

learnprogramming,Correcting aspect ratio in a shader (HLSL)?,"Hi. I wanted to write a shader to correct aspect ratio in a game i'm playing, and i'm running into some problems. Now, i'm not really familiar with graphics programming and shaders at all beyond some very handwavy idea of how they work, but i thought the task was trivial enough to trial and error my way through it. Apparently not!

So, the code for the shader looks like this:

    sampler s0;
    // Variables that set the width and height of the current game resolution from sfall
    float w;
    float h;
    float2 rcpres; // pixel size
    
    static const float2 gameRes = float2(640.0, 480.0);
    static const float2 windowRes = float2(1920.0, 1080.0);
    static const float2 scaledRes = float2(gameRes.x * windowRes.y/gameRes.y, windowRes.y);
    static const float2 border = ( (windowRes - scaledRes)/windowRes ) / 2.0;
    static const float2 ratio = windowRes/scaledRes;
    
    float4 test(float2 uv : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0
    {
      float2 uv1 = uv * ratio;
      float4 col = tex2D(s0, uv1);
      return col;
    }
    
    technique TestShader
    {
      Pass P0 { PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 test(); }
    }

And the result i'm getting is [this.](https://i.ibb.co/857cd1y/2024-11-30-134838.png) It looks like i'm losing quite a lot of horizontal resolution, with some of the text letters pretty much merging together. And i'm not sure why, i mean, the resolution i'm scaling to is still over 2x the internal resolution. 

I thought that a pixel shader is executed for every pixel of a rendered surface, which, in this case, would be the entire window. I take in coordinates of the pixel, i do some transformations on them, and then i use those coordinates to sample from the base image that the game is outputting. But then i don't see how would i end up skipping over so many of the pixels in the base image.

Can someone explain this to me, or point me to some relatively simple overview for dummies? Cause i definitely don't feel like taking an entire course just for this.

The only thing I've found would be something like this, but I think I did it **without an exception** back then:

	•	Capture voicemails using Twilio.
	•	Convert voicemails into text for further analysis.
	•	Prioritize voicemails based on urgency, emotional tone (from audio and text), and content.
	•	Summarize the text and distribute the voicemails to relevant departments.
	•	Encrypt sensitive data and mask any PII in both the text and audio.

I also plan to use a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for displaying the results.

	1.	What libraries or models should I use for emotion detection and urgency ranking?

learnprogramming,Making a stopwatch - x16,"So im working on a board and trying to make a reaction speed test. 

Board im working with has a RTC (Real time clock) From that i can use seconds,hours,minutes.

On the other hand, the board has a free running clock-16-bit 1Mhz. 

My approach currently is that im counting clock cycles. That is done by comparing the value of the current clock (free) and the value of the clock when first called. 
If it is equal then a cycle has completed, CountCycle++ . If it is less than then an overflow occured and clock wrapped back to 0 so CountCycle++.

then i convert CountCycle to  ms by dividing the number of clock cycles by 45 (Rough math was fried at this point). 

Was debugging the code and the answers (in ms) were not realistic at all. Is the math wrong? Or is my way of counting cycles wrong? Personally i feel it is the latter and i am skipping clock cycles while checking if the button is pressed. If so what suggestions do you have.

I'm making a module that allows a bigger project to retrieve information from a source. So there's a common function called by the bigger project that returns a String used by that project. 

  
The thing is that there is ONE case, in which the function should return a list of strings instead of just a string. The project expects that list in that case. It expects a string in any other. Before they were data introduced manually and now I want to automate it.

  
I know I can return different types from the function, and I can make it so the function returns the list only in the case I need. 

  
My question is more like, is that good practice if I note it down? I feel like I'm overthinking it but something tells me it was better to ask.

learnprogramming,Need Help Choosing a Framework for Modern-Looking Windows Desktop Apps,"Hi everyone!

I need help choosing the right framework for my needs. I’m a new solo developer (previously a hobbyist but recently started doing this full-time). Some of my clients need desktop apps for Windows. My clients are non-technical, but they occasionally want to tweak the code, so having a Python backend is ideal.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* Apps that look native and modern.
* A simple way to turn Figma designs into functional UI components (I use Figma for design).



So far, I’ve explored:

1. **PyQT and Qt Designer**: Couldn’t find a good integration with Figma.
2. **Qt Design Studio**: Has a Figma Bridge and recently began supporting Python for the backend, which feels like a dream come true, but it’s locked behind a pricey enterprise license ($2k+/year).
3. **Tkinter**: While there are some libraries and GitHub repos for Figma integration, the generated UI doesn’t look good.
4. **Reflex (formerly Pynecone)**: Couldn’t get the Figma integration to work.

After that, I started considering non-Python options but got overwhelmed:

* **WPF and WinUI**: I’m unfamiliar with XAML, and it doesn’t seem to integrate well with Figma (I might be wrong, but I couldn’t get it to work). I found some repos that support a Python backend, but I didn’t dive deeper.
* **Electron/Tauri**: I have no experience with web-based technologies, but if this is the state-of-the-art for Windows apps, I’m willing to learn.

Since I have some game dev experience, I even tested **Unity** for creating UIs and Windows desktop apps. Unity has some great Figma bridges, and it sort of worked, but using it for desktop apps feels overkill.

At this point, I’m completely lost. I’d prefer a solution with a Python backend, but I’m open to other options if needed. What frameworks would you recommend for creating Windows desktop apps?",External_Leek_2720,1h2qg0u,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2qg0u/need_help_choosing_a_framework_for_modernlooking/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2qg0u/need_help_choosing_a_framework_for_modernlooking/,2024-11-29 17:07:59,2,0.76,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h2qg0u

I just write a query to insert the column and gave to server guy , my manager started asking me why is the code not working ( for another feature where we use active_at column was tested perfectly) so i said the only reason the error could have occured is either column was never added or else it got removed, in db when server guy checks the table existed there so when i debugged i found that issue was one api was trying to insert active_at in a different table where active_at was not present so i removed the part of active_at insertion.

I read that ORMs like prisma or drizzle can go through the DB (inspection) and create sort of interfaces of tables. Is it reliable? Can they update them when there is a change in DB. Since it is just me working on this project, manually running the inspecton after new migrations won't be a problem.

Each node in the tree is supposed to be the sum of its 2 children. If there is a node that has a value which is NOT the sum of its children, you have to return the index of that node and the proper value that it should be.

Seems straightforward. But I noticed one strange line in the description:

  
""**If the incorrect value occurs on the leaf level, then the** ***right*** **child will always be the incorrect one.**""

This is the part I'm confused about. It says that the incorrect value can occur on the leaf level. But how? A node's value should be the sum of its children. Since the leaf has no children, the leaf should not even be counted right? Its value does not mean anything.

learnprogramming,Told by tutor that my style is awful,"Hello everyone, i‘m writing this as I feel extremely discouraged and sad and feeling like I‘ll never amount to anything.

I‘m a programming student in the first semester at an university in germany. We get quite a lot of programming homework, which I always gladly do and submit. The homework is graded by a tutor in the 5th semester. I recently noticed that he doesn’t seem to be the best, but I thought maybe it’s just me. Well.

Today I received feedback for the latest homework, and he pretty much wrote that my programming style is shitty. Maybe I‘m too sensitive but, that made me cry because I really put a lot of effort into it and I felt like I was doing really well. I dont even know what a programming style is? Or what defines it?

Also i feel like he just removed points unnecessarily for things that arent even true. Example program not working when its working on every pc/laptop for me.

Altogether I feel really really discouraged, and awful, like maybe I should just give up programming. I really like it and its fun to me and I want to do it but I feel like I‘m not wanted because my code and style is so so bad. Before joining uni I‘ve never had any experience with programming/coding at all. Like yes, my code might be messy, i don’t know, but its working and its my own solution so.. i honestly dunno how to go on from here. I feel absolutely useless and awful.

Looking at the code of my colleagues, they seem to have different solutions. Yes mine is longer, but isnt that the fun about programming, that theres different solutions? I know the complexity goes up, but if I cant come up with another solution, what exactly is so wrong about it? Right now I feel like there’s only ONE solution and thats the best, optional solution and that makes me want to not even start the next assignment.",r1ppedGuts,1h2gql6,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2gql6/told_by_tutor_that_my_style_is_awful/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2gql6/told_by_tutor_that_my_style_is_awful/,2024-11-29 07:47:43,32,0.67,32,0,93,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h2gql6
learnprogramming,I feel I know a lot and nothing at the same time. ,"I was interesting in programming for years but never started learning seriously before until from a month ago.
I had this book about programming in C, I learned form it then downloaded this app called SoloLearn because some of the book content was outdated.

the problem is I learned introduction to C and C intermediate then I solved some easier 'problems' then I started feeling confused about how to progress from here. 

so then I just jumped into C++ and finished introduction to C++ and intermediate C++.

and I'm in the same stat of confusion. 
I feel I learned a lot of many different concepts and functions... but how to use them to make an actual program... I'm totally clueless. 
I'm unclear on how to use what I learned and making it something that I can really use instead of just knowledge. I'm also clueless how to progress from here. I don't mind learning another language but I feel it will lead to same problem and i might be more counter productive as I will just  learn another language syntax without fully grasp what I know.
so.... is there any solution to my problem?!",SirArcher0,1h2frm2,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2frm2/i_feel_i_know_a_lot_and_nothing_at_the_same_time/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2frm2/i_feel_i_know_a_lot_and_nothing_at_the_same_time/,2024-11-29 06:39:51,23,0.89,23,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Tutorial,,t3_1h2frm2

learnprogramming,Creating a functional elevator program C++,"Hi, I am a first year college student taking an engineering course where I am expected to program an elevator. I have written code for an elevator that memorizes button presses and moves the lift to the corresponding floors. You are able to press a button any time, and no matter what you will get to the floor (if the lift is moving or not). However, I need to implement up/down buttons for each floor, and have the lift memorize the order it needs to follow. For example, if the lift is on floor 2, and an up button is pressed on the ground floor (0), but a down button is pressed on floor 1, the lift should go to floor 1, then ground. Another example: If the lift is on floor 4, a down button is pressed on floor 6, but an up button is pressed on floor 2, if the lift has already been on its way up, the lift should go to floor 6, then 2. I have tried everything I can think of to implement these properties over the past several weeks, but have had no luck. The following is my simple code. If someone could help me out it would be much appreciated (oh, the lift at the moment is a servo, but will be changed to a stepper motor soon):

learnprogramming,What kid of programming would be good to learn for an Analog IC design engineer? I am 30 years old  and considering  career change.,"Hi there, thank you for your attention. I am very grateful.
Would you please read my case and perhaps help me with your advice.

I am an analog and mixed signal IC designer, working in a company which is in top 100 range of S&amp;P 500. I have been doing this about a decade, have a decent pay and decent career growth. Recently I was even asked to consider to move into management position in the near future. I live outside the USA, in a small, third world country. I always loved physics that is why i choose this profession. But theree are 2 issues  that bother me. 
My country of residency is small, and there are no other IC design companies out there. I am also not planning to relocate ( I did once and came back) so I kind of put all my eggs into one bucket, and if anything will happen with the company or with myself and I loose the job... good luck finding a job which payes even 20% of what I now earn. This thought is ghosting me, and even affecting me mentally in recent months.
 Secondly, to be honest, I am sick and tired with my profession. It's almost impossible to keep with the schedules and deadlines, and the profession is black magic to me, although my colleagues  say that I am one of the best amongst them, I still think that is a very hard and unpredictable profession, very vague, and kid of uncertain, you can present bad result as good result, so much lying involved, also it's very hard to convince management that it was all that was possible to do. Anyway, I really hate it at this point, no drive is left, almost feeling burned out.
I am seriously considering to learn programming, change the carrier path, as there are a lot more software companies out there and also I might go into freelance. I leaned come C++ at university, very basic stuff, I wrote some assembler code there also, I also thought myself python, 3 years ago, but never used that outside coding challenge websites, and now I don't remember anything. 
At this point I just want to understand what to learn?
Embedded? (I know some Verilog too, in university I was doing basic staff on xilinx FPGA) with C? Or maybe C++?
Web? Game development? ML ? AI? 
I personally hate front end, but other than that all programming smees good to me. Maybe to learn some new technology? Rust or Go? It's so huge field, and being 30 years old I really want to pick the right path to not have this disappointment in career as I have now. 
I am willing to put many hours and sweat, into learning programming,  I am also willing to change my job and earn much less as a programmer at the beginning, with the hope that it will change along the way. I don't know, but I fill that the programming is the better option for myself and it would solve my current problems. 
My goal is not to earn a lot of money or climbe the carrer ladder, but to have peace of mind, security, opportunity, well defined tasks and measurebele results, and most importantly to put food on the family table, and provide for my children.

Over the years I have seen many individuals that ditched this profession and learned to code and now are happier and more financially stable. Interestingly, back then, they were not getting rises or promotions at our profession and kid of felling behind. Not to boast but it was not a case with myself, but it become now more of a curse for me than a blessing, as I eagerly look on their success and criticise my lack of confidence buck then, when I knew that I shoud have changed the carrier as well and went into programming.

learnprogramming,The right tools for building automated document extraction,"Hi,

hope this is the right subreddit, since this is not a concrete coding/programming problem but more a general question about the right (AI-)tools to use. If there is a place that is more suited for this kind of question, please let me know :)

I am currently trying to automate orders by extracting relevant data out of pdf files so that they can be used for other software systems. When searching through the web there seem to be a lot of AI startups and other companies that provide some kind of solution to this stuff, so I am wondering how well the general state of the art is here.

Currently i am playing around with python pdf readers and Chat GPT with object responses and the results are quite impressing for the first few tries, however I'm not sure if going with an LLM is the best choice in this case. There are other AI-based tools that promise to extract key value pairs for example. I can imagine that it is also possible to train your own Machine Learning models for such a task.

What i basicially want to know is, if there are any best practices i might oversee. When searching through the web there are quite a lot of enterprises offering something like AI order/document automation. I wonder if they all use LLMs as well or if there are better / more accurate tools for this kind of job. I'm just wondering if anyone here knows which tools are able to get reliable results (no matter if SaaS like AWS Textract or Azure Document Intelligence or more coding based stuff).

The OpenAI route seems promising since it does not require any finetuning so far and the keys can differ from document to document so the LLM often is smart enough to map those keys into a standarized data structure. Also i imagine that an LLM can easily deal with multiple languages.

Do you think I'm on the right track or are there other major things i should have a look into?

learnprogramming,Dealing with large data through message broker for a search engine,"Hi guys so I've built a search engine where user's can setup a list of entry point urls to crawl and save in an sqlite database, the communication between the express server, database, search engine and web crawler is all through rabbitmq, the way I handled transporting the whole database to the search engine for processing and ranking is through data segmentation, basically creating segments with header which contains the total number of segments to be expected and the sequence number for requeuing then the payload which is the segmented data from the database, so my problem here is as the database grows the number of segments increases and as more segments increases then more data to be queued to the message broker, but the message broker is so slow, currently the total size of the database sits at approximately 26MB and the maximum segment size or MSS is at 100008 bytes including the header which is 8 bytes

**The search engine filters out web pages with 0 ratings which is not relevant to the user's query**

as you can see it takes at least 700ms for listening to incoming segments from the database, dont mind the ranking I'll try to figure that out myself, so since listening to incoming segments does not seem to be a good idea for scaling, Im thinking about just removing the message broker between the database and search engine and let the engine instead have direct access to the database, but I'm curious does anyone have a good idea using on how to handle large data like this? I couldnt't think of anything else

##### What I did

* changed storing segment data from using byte slice to bytes.Buffer because its more efficient
* increased the segment size, I can still increase it up to the default message size defined in rabbitmq, and it does reduce the time but I feel like there should be another way since this only reduces the time as a temporary fix and would still need to increase message size in rabbitmq as the database grows.

Here's is the Segment listener code:

    			dbChannel.Nack(newSegment.DeliveryTag, true, true)
    			fmt.Printf(""Expected Sequence number %d, got %d\n"",

I’m currently working on my Bachelor’s thesis and I want to calculate the match between Spotify profiles to study its influence on relationship satisfaction. The idea is to have two people authenticate via the Spotify API, and then I analyze their listening data (Top Songs, Artists, Genres, etc.) to create a ""match score.""

My questions are:

1. **Metrics**: What metrics are best for calculating similarity between two users? I’ve been thinking about using Jaccard Index (for genres or artists) and Cosine Similarity (for audio features). Has anyone worked on a similar project?
2. **Automation**: Is there a way to replicate the Spotify Blend logic or use similar functions via the API? I would like to automate this match calculation.
3. **Playlist Creation**: How can I automatically create a playlist with the best matching songs from both users? I’m currently using Python and the Spotipy library.
4. **Scaling**: My goal is to provide this feature to multiple participants in an online experiment. Are there any best practices for integrating Spotify data into web apps (e.g., with Flask or Django)?

I’d appreciate any tips or resources that could help me implement this. Also, if anyone knows how I could contact Spotify directly to learn more about their algorithms (e.g., behind the Blend feature), that would be really helpful.

learnprogramming,How should I continue my journey?,"Hello :)

A little bit of background: I was always interested in computers, but I never really got into coding except for doing a project with an Arduino in school many years ago. I recently started the CS50 Course for Python and it's been fun. I don't really have any precise goals of what to do later, but as a media designer (both video and audio projects) I think it would be helpful to have some knowledge in programming.

Now to my question: As I don't really know where to go, Im a little lost. I will definitely finish this course and it feels like a stepping stone for me, as it really interests me. But I don't know where to go then and also which questions I should ask myself (future goals, etc.).

I also thought of buying a raspberry pi and do some smaller projects with that, because I could continue to learn python and feel more comfortable with a Linux environment.. But right now this seems so far away compared to the things I learn in the cs50 course..

  
I hope to get some thoughts from you to help me feel a little less lost. Im excited to here from you!

","\[EDIT\] I'm concerned about generating my own API keys for authenticating users in my own project, not using an API if another service.

Hello there! Recently I've started reading on REST API and how to implement one, and currently I'm looking at the use of API keys for authentication. I'm confused on how the URL path should be constructed for different users, and whether the API key should be placed in the URL or within the HTTP header. 

From my understanding, API keys are like your email/password when logging into a website, but they are usually encrypted in the database and used for verifying if a certain request like GET/POST can be called. From the guides I've read online, these API keys are stored as parameters in the URL, for example: `http:/localhost:3000/users/?api_key=some_long_api_key`.  But with this approach, what's stopping someone from copying the API key who isn't authorized and using it in making requests?

The other option was to embed the API key in the body of the request, but I'm still wondering if this still suffers from the issue of someone who isn't authorized from making their own request body using it.

The other approach I'm thinking about is where before the request is made, the client retrieves the API key for the currently logged in user and then sends a request using that API key, ensuring that it is hidden from the url, but then again what's to stop someone from viewing the body of the request and getting the API key, unless encryption is required while sending it.

The above approach is what I'm planning to do, although I don't know if it the correct way to do it. For instance, my though process about doing this is as follows:

1. A new user registers with an email and password,
2. An API key is generated for the user,
3. When a request is sent, like posting some form data, the API key is retrieved for the current user and encrypted, then placed in the body of the request,
4. On the server, it first validates the API key and then continues with the request.

Also, for generating an API key, is generating a UUID good enough? Along with that, is it okay to send the user's email in the body of the request to identify which user is making the request? Is it possible that two user's can have the same API key, which would require sending their details to the server to know which valid user is making the request?  I've never worked with API's before so I am curious to how this is solved from a security standpoint...

I’m currently working on a personal project to automate an inventory calculation process that I usually do manually in Excel. The goal is to calculate **Runrate** and **Days of Cover (DOC)***Building a Python Script to Automate Inventory Runrate and DOC Calculations – Need Help!*  
Hi everyone! I’m currently working on a personal project to automate an inventory calculation process that I usually do manually in Excel. The goal is to calculate **Runrate** and **Days of Cover (DOC)** for inventory across multiple cities using Python. I want the script to process recent sales and stock data files, pivot the data, calculate the metrics, and save the final output in Excel.

Here’s how I handle this process manually:

1. **Sales Data Pivot:** I start with sales data (item\_id, item\_name, City, quantity\_sold), pivot it by item\_id and item\_name as rows, and City as columns, using quantity\_sold as values. Then, I calculate the Runrate: **Runrate = Total Quantity Sold / Number of Days.**
2. **Stock Data Pivot:** I do the same with stock data (item\_id, item\_name, City, backend\_inventory, frontend\_inventory), combining backend and frontend inventory to get the **Total Inventory** for each city: **Total Inventory = backend\_inventory + frontend\_inventory.**
3. **Combine and Calculate DOC:** Finally, I use a VLOOKUP to pull Runrate from the sales pivot and combine it with the stock pivot to calculate DOC: **DOC = Total Inventory / Runrate.**

Here’s what I’ve built so far in Python:

* The script pulls the latest sales and stock data files from a folder (based on timestamps).
* It creates pivot tables for sales and stock data.
* Then, it attempts to merge the two pivots and output the results in Excel.

 

However, I’m running into issues with the final output. The current output looks like this:

||
||
|**Dehradun\_x**|**Delhi\_x**|**Goa\_x**|**Dehradun\_y**|**Delhi\_y**|**Goa\_y**|
|319|1081|21|0.0833|0.7894|0.2755|

It seems like \_x is inventory and \_y is the Runrate, but the **DOC** isn’t being calculated, and columns like item\_id and item\_name are missing.

Here’s the output format I want:

||
||
|**Item\_id**|**Item\_name**|**Dehradun\_inv**|**Dehradun\_runrate**|**Dehradun\_DOC**|**Delhi\_inv**|**Delhi\_runrate**|**Delhi\_DOC**|

**Where I Need Help:**

* Fixing the final output to include item\_id and item\_name in a cleaner format.
* Calculating and adding the **DOC** column for each city.
* Structuring the final Excel output with separate sheets for pivots and the final table.

I’d love any advice or suggestions to improve this script or fix the issues I’m facing. Thanks in advance! 😊 for inventory across multiple cities using Python. I want the script to process recent sales and stock data files, pivot the data, calculate the metrics, and save the final output in Excel.

Here’s how I handle this process manually:

1. **Sales Data Pivot:** I start with sales data (item\_id, item\_name, City, quantity\_sold), pivot it by item\_id and item\_name as rows, and City as columns, using quantity\_sold as values. Then, I calculate the Runrate: **Runrate = Total Quantity Sold / Number of Days.**
2. **Stock Data Pivot:** I do the same with stock data (item\_id, item\_name, City, backend\_inventory, frontend\_inventory), combining backend and frontend inventory to get the **Total Inventory** for each city: **Total Inventory = backend\_inventory + frontend\_inventory.**
3. **Combine and Calculate DOC:** Finally, I use a VLOOKUP to pull Runrate from the sales pivot and combine it with the stock pivot to calculate DOC: **DOC = Total Inventory / Runrate.**

Here’s what I’ve built so far in Python:

* The script pulls the latest sales and stock data files from a folder (based on timestamps).
* It creates pivot tables for sales and stock data.
* Then, it attempts to merge the two pivots and output the results in Excel.

 

However, I’m running into issues with the final output. The current output looks like this:

||
||
|**Dehradun\_x**|**Delhi\_x**|**Goa\_x**|**Dehradun\_y**|**Delhi\_y**|**Goa\_y**|
|319|1081|21|0.0833|0.7894|0.2755|

It seems like \_x is inventory and \_y is the Runrate, but the **DOC** isn’t being calculated, and columns like item\_id and item\_name are missing.

Here’s the output format I want:

||
||
|**Item\_id**|**Item\_name**|**Dehradun\_inv**|**Dehradun\_runrate**|**Dehradun\_DOC**|**Delhi\_inv**|**Delhi\_runrate**|**Delhi\_DOC**|
|123|abc|38|0.0833|456|108|0.7894|136.8124|
|345|bcd|69|2.5417|27.1475|30|0.4583|65.4545|

learnprogramming,Looking for how to program a vector drawing application,"I'm looking for tutorials or textbooks describing how to develop a vector drawing application. Googling for information has been mostly useless, as I find tutorials for illustration and CAD software, but not info on how to design the applications. Enough apps exist that somewhere, there's got to be info on how to build one. 

I've got some books on computational geometry already, so I don't (at this time) need suggestions for that side of things. I'm really looking for something to help walk me through the basics of building the drawing app while avoiding some common pitfalls. I'm thinking the basic outline would go something like:

1. Create a shape
2. Draw a shape
3. Add handles to the shape
4. Modify and/or move the shape using the handles
5. Show a property dialog for the shape
6. Add snaps to the shapes.
7. Make too many shapes and eventually the app slows down. Sidetrack into quadtrees (or some other sort of tree) to deal with that.
8. Add zoom and pan. Sidetrack into the limits of your drawing space', possibly covering ways to deal with that. (I sometimes hit those limits in AutoCAD during my day job. I'm guessing it deals with the limits of floating point numbers, but I'm not positive.)

Bonus points if the textbook or tutorial has exercises to work through. 

My end goal is to make an app to draw periodic, non-periodic, and aperiodic tesselations, and then paint or texture them. I've been hobby-programming since the 1980's; I'm mostly self-taught (though I did take a couple CS classes as electives in college), so I may know a lot about a few specialized topics that interest me, but also may be ignorant of topics that every CS graduate knows.

learnprogramming,Looking for API/Database to Identify Companies Behind IP Addresses (Not ISPs),"We’re building a tool that needs to identify specific companies behind IP addresses, but we’re running into a common issue: most services, like IPinfo, only return the ISP (e.g., Ziggo, Telenet) instead of the actual business using the IP address.

The Challenge:

For larger organizations, it's easier to identify the company behind the IP, but when it comes to smaller businesses using common ISPs or shared/dynamic IPs, we only get the ISP information. We're specifically after the company data, not just the internet service provider.

What We Need:

We need an API or a database that can accurately identify the company behind an IP address, even when that company is using a dynamic IP provided by an ISP.

Self-hosted or independent solutions are preferred. We're not interested in using another service like Leadfeeder. Instead, we want control over the data and how it integrates into our tool.

We want to find a solution that offers the best balance between price and quality.


What We’ve Tried:

We’ve used IPinfo.io, which aggregates data from sources like WHOIS records, but it often returns only the ISP for smaller businesses. We even tried the IP-to-company data API.

Reverse DNS lookups similarly lead back to the ISP instead of the company.


Our Goal:

We want to find an API or data source that provides the actual business behind an IP, not the ISP.

Alternatively, we’re open to building our own database if there's a reliable method to aggregate and map business information to IP addresses.


Questions:

1. Does anyone know of an API or data provider that can reliably return company-level data behind IP addresses?


2. Has anyone had success in creating a custom database to map businesses to IPs? If so, how did you gather and maintain this data?


3. Are there any other data sources or techniques we should be looking at to solve this problem?

Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

learnprogramming,JetBrains Student Licence,"Hello everyone!

I have a problem and I hope someomw will help me.

I got a student licence for JetBrain IDEs in March this year. It was working perfectly fine, until I completely deleted Windows (where I used these IDEs) and installed Ubuntu on my computer. Since then, I don’t have any licence in my account whatsoever, it just randomly got deleted and when I want to renew it from my account webpage it prompts me to another webpage, which promps me again to the first one, like a loop. I basically only have the option to pay for the subscription. When I try to start over and fill a form, it’s not accepted since I’m using an email address that already is registred, which prompts me to a webpage where I already tried to renew the licence, without success.

The registred email address is the one from my faculty. I haven’t gotten a reminder that my subscription will expire whatsoever. I am pretty sure my subscription shouldn’t have expired in the first place since I got it less than a year ago.

I thought of deleting the account altogether and setting it up with the email address I already used once again, but I am not sure if I will lose the right to a student licence.

I already messaged the JetBrains team, waiting for the answer.

Any advice would be really helpful. ",kjmkty,1h12x2b,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h12x2b/jetbrains_student_licence/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h12x2b/jetbrains_student_licence/,2024-11-27 12:14:31,3,0.81,3,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h12x2b

learnprogramming,suggestions for resolving an ambiguity in a system,"I have a huge dataset containing information about painters, divers, drivers, electricians, chefs, gardeners, and many more, including the different types of work they can do and other related conditions. Based on this data, there are corresponding prices for each type of worker, such as painters, drivers, electricians, etc.

I am using a Large Language Model (LLM) to calculate the charge for a worker based on the user's input, which specifies details such as the type of work they've done, its complexity, timing, and other relevant factors. The LLM will use these input parameters to return the total charge for that particular worker.

For example, if a user enters ""a diver dives at 100m,"" the LLM will calculate the total charge for that diver, as the system recognizes that the diver has performed a diving task at a depth of 100m.

However, if the user provides ambiguous input, such as the word ""diver"" alone, it becomes impossible to calculate and return the charge for that diver because there is insufficient information. I want my system to clarify this ambiguity with the user in a friendly way to ensure accurate charge calculation.

Can you suggest how I can implement this clarification step in a user-friendly manner, so that the ambiguity is resolved and the user does not get frustrated? I would love detailed step wise response.

Note: As I mentioned earlier, the dataset is huge and includes many different types of workers, meaning various different types of ambiguities can arise. The solution should work for all these cases.

**Update**:  
Challenges I am facing:

1. Handling large datasets: The dataset is enormous, and sending this entire data with every request to the LLM is impractical. LLMs have token limits and such an approach would be cost-prohibitive. I need a cost-effective and efficient solution.
2. Interactive communication flow: This requires a back-and-forth interaction between the server and the user. The user provides input, and the server (assisted by the LLM) responds, addressing ambiguities in the input.

Example of user-system interaction for clarity:  
User: ""operator""  
System: ""I found multiple entries with 'operator'. Options are:  
JCB operator, Excavator operator, Crane operator, Truck operator.""  
User: ""Crane operator""  
System: ""Work location can affect charges. Select a location: Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune.""  
User: ""Hyderabad""  
System: ""The charge for a Crane operator in Hyderabad is 100 Rs (for example).""  


This flow includes only location, but there can be different parameters for different workers. I want to achieve this type of interactive flow, possibly enhancing it for a better user experience. Suggestions needed:  
How can I achieve this solution?  
What technologies or approaches would best suit this use case?

When I make it just normal method, it tries to process the 2 requests concurrently. This results in a lot of errors, since that will run 2 instances of my script, which will double the amount of threads that are allowed by scraperapi.

learnprogramming,Which book do you consider best to learn discrete mathematics in the best possible way? second year CS student! ,"**Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications Kenneth H. Rosen vs Discrete Mathematics with Applications by Susanna S. Epp** 

I'm between these two, I'm thinking of studying discrete mathematics and then algorithms, I did some research on both and I've seen that people describe them as ""a dry read without much motivation to learn on your own if you don't have a teacher to help you"". 

My circumstances are these, I have to learn these topics\* for my discrete mathematics class, but the materials they give at my school are of very poor quality.

Any recommendations would be very helpful. I mean, about the books above, I don't know which one is the easiest to digest, or if there is a better one, more well-known one that people use to learn this. It's not that I'm looking for something easy, but more than anything, something that can guarantee me to learn in the best way, but without being terribly complex.

As a result, I'm considering pursuing a developer role for the time being.

The job market is tough right now, and it seems like everyone wants years of experience, even for junior positions. On top of that, I'm not sure what to put on my CV since I haven’t worked on any major projects that would stand out.

Currently, I’m taking two cybersecurity-related courses and also starting to explore TryHackMe, but I’m unsure if I’ll be able to find a cyber-related first job without more experience. I’m considering working on projects or solving LeetCode problems to gain more experience, but I’m not sure if that’s the best route.

If anyone has advice on how to move forward, I’d really appreciate it. Specifically, I’m looking for guidance on:

I decided to create the cards through the map() method in order to keep the same styles for both of them, but I’m finding some inconsistencies: the first card is fine and it's been displayed as I wrote it, while the second card is visibly off, and I don’t understand why since they're both created by the same method with the same attributes. The iteration works, both cards are correctly populated, but somewhere in my code there's something wrong, and I can't find what, why or even where (and it is driving me crazy).

I feel joy being able to solve a small decrementing problem. You know when you have that ""aha!"" moment in coding when you suddenly understand what something does in a program. I had one about recursion and my joy was overflowing, I was really happy.

But to get to the real part, university is difficult. It's a whole different beast from school where you constantly guided from destination to destination. In university, you're on your own. No one is here to mess sround, everyone is as good and most are far better than you. It's stressful.

We just a programming assessment and I, as a non-programmer was quite sad that I was able to score only a 60%. This feeling was further amplified when I saw almost all my peers sad cause they got an 80 or a 90. Everybody is pushing for 3.8 and 3.9 gpa while even though I'm doing my best, pulling all nighters, rigorous note making, working on algorithms and pseudo code, trying new things, applying for clubs where I may improve, but I'm not having any luck. 

I had my maths test today, and my roommate who was always on valorant did better than me (according to him) on the test I studied continuously for almost two days (revision and problem solving). It's really disheartening seeing people get ahead of you with minimal hardwork when you've been working you ass off. I applied for my college cs society, but got rejected. Even though I learned html and actually gave them a project I was really proud of. I made it to the interview round but got rejected.

I am getting better at coding but their is so much to learn and I feel like I've no time left. People hear know how to build apps, make interactive website and I'm stuck learning file handling.

I attend all my classes, always study after I come back, practice coding but still feel left behind.

Anyways back to the main question,

How to actually get better at coding?

What should I learn? 

How to go from learning how to code, to making a project in that language?

How to know which projects to make?

What the hell is a tech stack?

How to learn a language?

How to get better at algorithms?

How to get even started with leetcode?

How to make github contributions? 

What to do and what not to do? 

Do I even have enough time? 

I wanna learn web development, but where do I start? 

Do I use books or lectures?

Can I take my grades up if I mess up my first semester a little bit? 

How to actually improve as a coder?

How to make a good portfolia, a good resume?

I'm sorry if this feels like a rant but I'm really seeking advice cause my head is all over the place.",sassysusguy,1h0g6rq,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h0g6rq/how_to_actually_get_better_at_coding_in_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h0g6rq/how_to_actually_get_better_at_coding_in_a/,2024-11-26 16:39:15,5,0.86,5,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h0g6rq

the stack diagram picture showed the addresses 8000, 8004, 8008, 8012, 8016 then jumped to (showing a line of dots a space between 8016 and 9k) 9000. all having the integers stored in them in order: 84, 42, 56, 10, 28, 8004. 

multiple questions asked but one that really threw me off, it simply stated *eval; chat said that 8004 is actually the address 8004 not necessarily a number passed like the others. so it is taking the value held at 8004 which would be 42. 

i wish i could give a picture. but the declaration for *eval was just that. a declaration. int *eval; and then the stack shown

how the fuck was i meant to know that it was actually pointing to another address? am I missing some critical thinking skills with this one? i already don’t understand this all too well with the brackets and all, this seemed so simple im bummed i got it wrong  T_T",greatestlatestell,1h05e4b,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h05e4b/was_this_a_fair_question_on_an_exam/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h05e4b/was_this_a_fair_question_on_an_exam/,2024-11-26 06:22:44,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Code Review,,t3_1h05e4b

Prompt:

Write a Flowgorithm program that performs the following tasks:

* Utilizing nested loops
   * Outside loop keeps the program running until told to stop
   * Inside loop asks for input of a number, positive or negative
      * input number count should be unlimited
      * Input of a zero (0) terminates inside loop
* When the inside loop is terminated, display the largest and smallest number of all the numbers entered in the inside loop as well as their total.  No values carry over from one set of numbers to the next. Example:  If input is:      1   3   -12   5   50    0                  Largest is       50                  Smallest is     -12                  Total is           47
* The outside loop will then ask if a new set of numbers is to be input

 

# Remember the following:

* declare necessary variables &amp; constants
* use clear prompts for your input
* use integers for the input numbers
* clearly label the largest and smallest number on output
* use comment box for your name, lab name and date at the top of the flowgorithm
* use other comments where appropriate
* the zero to stop the inner loop is not to be considered the lowest number, it just stops the inner loop
* consider a ""priming read"" to set initial values of large and small

learnprogramming,Windows daily user wants to start programming (stack question),"Hello,

First of all, I would like to apologize for speaking such a non-technical language, but I have only been learning programming for a few days. I kindly ask this cool community for your understanding and help. Because no one who asks is wrong :)

I know that most apps are based on an OS such as Linux because software is ultimately built for this system. I am starting to learn to program, the presence of AI very quickly increased my learning curve of each language, but I am still very much a beginner, I do not even know how to use git well enough, please be understanding. I am just gaining awareness of the basics of all languages.

There is a problem, however, when I transfer project files from vscode to my vps with ubuntu, they simply do not work (which is normal). Sometimes the dependencies require .exe extensions and so on, you surely know what I mean. I also tried to play around with the windows vscode stack remotessh extension directly to my vps but there is also a problem with permissions (I want everything to be done on the Linux vps - debugging, dependencies also to be on linux and not Windows, but when Windows is the main machine, I guess you just don't have a Windows shell and Linux is different.

Therefore, I would like to ask for advice on what to do? How do you program? My stack is windows vscode + cline / windows vscode + cline + remotessh with vps Linux. I am so used to Windows that I am unable to give it up.

What are my options? Is my lack of basics causing these problems? For example, from what I know, remotessh does not allow commits to be made on the remote machine (vps), but only the local one (windows), and these dependencies. I would like the mscode and cline gui to be on the Windows side, and everything to be done on vpsie.

I read a bit about this before creating the topic and someone who got a lot of pluses here added a comment ""regardless of whether you have Windows or Linux"", vscode is already mature enough to create universal applications"", maybe I understood it in the wrong context, but maybe I'm just making a mistake?

What do I have to choose?

1. I made a mistake and can I achieve what I want to achieve in mscode on Windows? My local Windows only as a gui in vscode, writing code on it using cline and connecting to a vps with Linux.

2. Use WSL1 / WSL2 / Virtualbox / Wmvare Pro for personal use on Windows to emulate Linux? But then, will this compatibility with Linux work fully when I'm on this virtual system? Only then another problem appears, the graphical environment on such virtualbox works tragically, and I would absolutely need a graphical environment on this Linux on which I will be working, so that everything works quickly.

3. I have two monitors, I could buy a computer on which I will install Linux (what distribution do you recommend, I know Ubuntu and Debian best, but literally the basics of the console version without GUI), this Linux will have a GUI for programming. I am going to have Windows on one monitor on my main computer, and Linux on the other. If this is the right way, what would you recommend for a budget? I don't think I want anything like a Rapsberry Pi, because there is Arm there, I want a stack like it is on normal servers, maybe not in terms of performance, but compatibility, something inexpensive. Sorry for speaking in such non-technical language but I have only been learning for a few days.

4. Is it possible to install both full Windows 11 and full Linux (in the context of the shell, kernel or anything there) on the same computer? So that they work at the same time? For example, Windows on the first, Linux is the second.

5. Does Dualbot still work with W11 in combination with Linux? I once saw a video on YT where someone gives a guide on how to do it. But even if it works, I will only be able to run one system :(

6. Do you have any other ideas for me?

I apologize for writing so much, but I am extremely determined, I wander and it really annoys me that I have no one who could explain the basics to me.",mehambre,1gzyltl,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzyltl/windows_daily_user_wants_to_start_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzyltl/windows_daily_user_wants_to_start_programming/,2024-11-26 00:25:53,0,0.42,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gzyltl

learnprogramming,My Struggle as a Self-Taught Developer,"I've always wanted to be a programmer—well, not really. Back then, I didn’t even know what ""programmer"" meant. I just wanted to create things, like the technology I saw on TV. I thought it would be impossible, something only geniuses or scientists could do. Fast forward, here I am, chasing that dream!

It all started when I was 13. The first time I accessed the internet on a laptop, I began searching for what I could do with this magical thing called “Google” That’s when I stumbled upon a fascinating concept: programming. I didn’t understand much, but it sounded exciting.

During summer holidays, I began searching how computers work. It amazed me how simple technology could be—especially for achieving my childhood dream. As a kid, I was glued to documentaries about robots in Silicon Valley and China. While most kids my age were watching cartoons or Barbie, I was fascinated by machines (I loved Barbie too! I'm not a nerd, okay?🙂)

In the summer of 2019, I discovered HTML5 through a YouTube channel and created my very first webpage. It was just a basic “this is my first page” header, but it felt like magic. I was so proud and told everyone about it, but no one really got it—all they saw was a browser tab with some text.

Still, I pressed on. I experimented with CSS, building colorful layouts, navbars, footers, and grids. Then I dove into JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and MySQL. I was learning, exploring, and dreaming big.

Then came the pandemic. In my final year of high school, COVID turned everything upside down. After graduating in 2020, I went to nursing school—not because I wanted to, but because studying computer science wasn’t an option in my city. Plus, the CS curriculum in my country was so outdated, I knew I’d have to teach myself anyway.

Working as a nurse during COVID was overwhelming. My plan was to learn programming in the evenings after work, but after 8-to-6 shifts in pure chaos, I barely had any energy left. Still, I pushed through. I completed my residency program, got licensed, and finally quit nursing to focus on programming.

Now, I’ve been teaching myself for a while. I’ve built projects, learned different tools, and tried to improve step by step. But the journey hasn’t been easy.

Being self-taught often feels lonely. You doubt yourself. You feel like you’re constantly catching up. And with the job market so competitive, it’s easy to lose hope. I planned to land a job or internship as a developer by the end of the year, but that hasn’t happened yet—I haven’t even applied. And the pressure is mounting—I’m turning 22 this week, and I need a job.

But I’m not giving up. Software development is what I want, and I haven’t given it my all yet. This is just the beginning of my journey, not the end.

Technology has always been my passion, and I want to be part of shaping the future. Whether it’s building tools that help people, solving unique problems, I know my story is far from over.

If you’ve been through this or are going through something similar, I’d love to hear your story or any advice you might have.",Human-Reporter-3657,1gzwey1,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzwey1/my_struggle_as_a_selftaught_developer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzwey1/my_struggle_as_a_selftaught_developer/,2024-11-25 22:48:15,84,0.95,84,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gzwey1

How do I get back to it?,"(I’m from Türkiye, and moved to the United States as PR 3 years ago at 25 years old) Studied Software Programming in high school, learned Excel - SQL - C# pretty well. I was pretty damn creative at it, especially on database. After completing my internship at a local hospital with IT department, I switched directions, and pursued BA at a known local college. I now regret that it happened but I was feeling crazy pressure from my teachers in high school. That’s the biggest reason that I left programming career. After nearly 10 years of not practicing coding, I nearly forgot about it all.

I want to get back to programming/coding working remotely from anywhere I want. I thought of starting learning Phyton to pursue maybe AI related fields. My mind is also telling me Cybersecurity is a good option. The question is where do I hold from first? What would you recommend the best for me? I know that degree doesn’t mean everything in coding but do you think that I can land a good position without any degree except for my high school programming degree with just learning stuff from online, giving a year or so to it?

I’m open to any recommendation. I’ve been reading about codeacademy, tree house, codeschool… I’m confused where to start. Any info I missed, ask me, I’ll provide.

learnprogramming,I finally understand recursion!,"Im fairly new to programming and this finally clicked in my head. 

For instance in python:

```

def tri_recursion(k):
    if(k&gt;0):

        print(result)

    return result

tri_recursion(4)

```
The code outputs:
1
3
6
10

It finally made sense to me that each iteration gets ""put on hold"" after running the line that has the recursed function so it keeps looping until k = 0, which then returns 0. After that, it has to finish out each iteration of the function sorta ""in reverse order"" but really its just the most recent so that the preceding recursed functions actually have a returned value to work with to finish the instructions.

I'm currently working on an llm project in which one of the selected technologies is the chromaDB vector database.

I'm working on a function that takes a pdf document as input, and adds its content and embeddings to the database. I did my research on google. Knowing that I want to make very specific queries on a pdf file and the way a vector database works, I think it would be better to store one pdf document per collection, and divide it into several documents, either one page of the pdf per document, or a certain number of characters per document.

This is combined with a database search function that accepts text as input, and an embeddings search function. These functions return a choice of 1 or more results, reinforcing my idea of storing several documents per collection.

learnprogramming,How to make two Docker Apps appear as different origins ?,"Hi everyone,

First, I'm not sure if my post belongs in this sub, so feel free to recommend one that's more appropriate! :)

I'm a student in software and web development, which means I'm not completely new to programming, but I still have some gaps in my knowledge. So here’s the speech : imagine I have two instances of the same app (each running in its own Docker container). When I launch them, by default, they are connected to my private network, defined by the IP 192.168.1.1. And if I understand how this works correctly, from an external server, both apps access the internet with 192.168.1.1 as their ID.

Now, what I’d like to do is make the external server believe that my apps aren't from the same origin (for example, app1 is from 192.168.2.1 and app2 is from 192.168.2.2). I assume this is how a VPN works, right? Do you have any suggestions?

While discussing this with a colleague, I learned that I could use Kubernetes (though I’m not familiar with it), or a VPS (not convinced by this one). I also found that I could run a VPN/proxy on each Docker container, but I’m not sure if that solution is feasible.

learnprogramming,(C# || Python/Windows) Is there a way I can create an in-memory file that has a path other processes can access?,"I feel like this might be a situation where OS features like pipes could come into play but I'm not knowledgable enough about that stuff, and would appreciate any advice or clarification.

I'm writing a program that deals with image data, reading files into arrays of pixels in memory. The library I'm using knows how to decode JPEGs and PNGs, but not some more niche cutting-edge formats like JPEG XL. So currently when I need to deal with those I create a subprocess, call ImageMagick or djxl (JPEG XL -&gt; JPEG decoder program) to create a temporary .JPEG/.PNG file on the disk, read that, then delete it.

Which works fine, but this isn't optimal: the program could leave temp files on the disk if it's killed before cleaning up (e.g. power failure), it could write millions of temp files for large runs creating unnecessary wear and tear on an SSD, it could spin up a sleeping HDD on a laptop causing battery drain, etc. The temp files are never over 3 MB so it'd be nice to create them in memory instead.

But I'm not sure how I'd go about doing that short of creating a ramdisk. The programs I call in the subprocess want file paths to read from and write to.

So is this a situation where you can create a pipe and use the pipe like a file path, and have the C#/Python program read from it?

learnprogramming,Should I pursue an associate's in IT/Programming FIRST and then a bachelor's in Computer Science? Or just go directly for the Bachelor's in CS? Should I go to Community College for first 2 years or all four at University?,"I posted here about a year ago, and you guys have helped inspire me to go to school. I start in January. But it's time to make some crucial choices.

PSA: I barely have a clue what I'm talking about. That's why I need your advice. My advisors have been over the phone and very unhelpful. I have to schedule 2 weeks ahead just for a phone call. All I know for sure is that I want to end up with at least a bachelor's in computer science. Okay I could be terribly wrong about all of this or be making a big brain maneuver.

The CC is Gateway. The Uni is NKU.

I have to decide between going to the local community college for my first 2 years or local university for the full 4 years. The CC is going to be mostly online, whereas the Uni is more in-person but with the option to go online. I am thinking I could get an AS in IT/Programming first and then do 2 more years at Uni for a BS in Computer Science. Is that how that works? Maybe just have to take a few extra classes? Has anyone done this? Do the credits overlap, or would it take 6 years?

My academic advisors have me down as an AAS. As of right now I am basically getting my Gen Ed.'s out of the way at community college for the first 2 years, then going to NKU for the last 2 years. An AAS degree doesn't sound as exciting as having an IT degree AND CS degree. The latter would give me more experience and make me more attractive to employers, right?

TL;DR Questions:

Community college or university?

Bachelor's of Computer Science precursor: AAS to ""get Gen Ed's out of the way"" or IT/Programming 2yr?

Online College or In-person?

Have any of you done this? I will take any advice I can get. I really want to make the best choices and I'm tired of feeling lost and confused about it all.

learnprogramming,Problems with managing the list of files in a modal with manual loading and Drag and Drop,"I have a modal to which I can upload files manually using a button or using Drag and Drop.



The  first bug occurs when dealing with the list of documents, when adding one or more documents that are not previously there, the `start` button appears that starts the upload of the file and `delete` which removes the file from the list and the Upload all and Delete all buttons also appear. The errors are that when deleting 2 documents from the list, whether it is duplicate or not, the **upload all** and **delete all** buttons disappear and the original documents have a progress bar that should only appear when the document is uploaded. I attach image links:

[before deleting](https://i.sstatic.net/pIC8tmfg.png) | [after deleting two documents](https://i.sstatic.net/f2AnpE6t.png)

The second bug is more complicated, to simplify the explanation I will call the ""*instrucciones sectigo*"" document **A** and the ""*idea cleaner parones*"" document I will call **B**. The use case is the following, I upload **A** and **B**, I upload **A** again and **B** and marks them as duplicates, disabling the 'start' button, I delete the duplicate of A and upload A and B again. If I now click the ""**Delete all**"" button, They delete all the documents from the list except the original **A** *(I know that rarely a user is going to cause this bug since, as I said, it is very complicated, but I find it very curious why this happens).*

learnprogramming,Java order of operations question," I'm hoping somebody can help me understand this code a little better, it's from an online tutorial I am following:

The answer is 6 but I'm strugging to understand why.

The variabled *BEFORE* hitting ""LINE 5"" are as follows:

***result = 5***

***a = 1***

***b = 0***

Then we hit LINE 5. My way of thinking is ok lets work out what's between the brackets

***(0 / 1) = 0***

then work out the first part and since the variable 'a'  was decremented it should now be 0

***result += 0 + 0;***

result should equal 5 but it's actually 6. Where am I wrong in my understanding?

  


                  int result = 5;
                  int a = 1;
                  int b = --a;

learnprogramming,How to strip a matrix efficiently ,"Apologies for the weak title, I couldn't see how to summarise it better. 

I have a binary matrix. Call a 1 in the matrix isolated if it is the only 1 in either its row or column or both. I want to remove all isolated 1s and I also want to reduce the rows so there  is only one copy of each row.  Identical copies off a row should be zeroed out as should isolated 1s 

The identity matrix would be reduced to the all zeros matrix. More interestingly, the all ones matrix would also be reduced to the all zeros matrix. First all duplicate rows are zeroed and then all  remaining 1s are isolated.

The difficulty, in terms of computational complexity, is that zeroing a row can cause a 1 to become isolated and zeroing a 1 can cause two rows to become identical. Running the whole process until there are no isolated ones and no duplicate rows could be slow. 

Is there an efficient way to do this?

learnprogramming,[Python] Decision tree prediction using recursion,"Hello world! I'm currently taking a class on machine learning and am very stuck on a strange problem

As part of a larger assignment we have been instructed to partially implement a decision tree that can separate the data from a dataset into groups. (Mainly using numpy)

To implement the predict function we have been given these instructions:

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: NDArray
        NumPy feature matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
    node: ""DecisionTreeBranchNode"" or ""DecisionTreeLeafNode""
        Node used to process the data. If the node is a leaf node,
        the data is classified with the value of the leaf node.
        If the node is a branch node, the data is split into left
        and right subsets, and classified by recursively calling
        _predict() on the left and right subsets.
    
    Returns
    -------
    y: NDArray
        NumPy class label vector (predicted), shape (n_samples,)
    
    Notes
    -----
    The prediction follows the following logic:
        if the node is a leaf node
            return y vector with all values equal to leaf node value
        else (the node is a branch node)
            split the dataset into left and right parts using node question
            predict classes for left and right datasets (using left and right branches)
            ""stitch"" predictions for left and right datasets into single y vector
            return y vector (length matching number of rows in X)

Based on those instructions i wrote this function:

    def _predict(
        self, 
        X: NDArray, 
        node: Union[""DecisionTreeBranchNode"", ""DecisionTreeLeafNode""]
    ) -&gt; NDArray:
    
      if type(node) == DecisionTreeLeafNode:
          y = np.zeros(len(X), dtype=np.int32)
          y[:] = node.y_value
          return y
      else:
          left_mask = X[:, node.feature_index] &lt;= node.feature_value
          left = X[left_mask]
          right = X[~left_mask]
          left_pred = self._predict(left, node.left)
          right_pred = self._predict(right, node.right)
          y = np.concatenate((left_pred, right_pred))
          return y

Which can reliably predict how many items from the dataset will end up in each group, but the order is completely wrong. 

Example:

    Decision tree:
      f0 &lt;= -0.368_____________________
     /                                 \
    0                       _______f1 &lt;= -0.229
                           /                   \
                     f0 &lt;= 0.732                1
                    /           \
                   2             3
    
    Data:
    [[-1.   0. ]
     [ 1.   1. ]
     [ 0.5 -1. ]
     [ 1.5 -1. ]]
    
    Expected result:
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
    
    Actual result:
    [0, 2, 3, 1]

I understand why the order is wrong, since np.concatenate() just mashes the two vectors into one without regard for the contents, but i cannot find a way to keep the order of the items while using the recursive method described in the instructions.

So my question is; Is this a strange way to implement a decision tree prediction function, or am i just horribly misunderstanding the instructions? And if so what am i supposed to do?

learnprogramming,Building a website with database search,"Hey all,

For learning purposes, I want to build a website/web app that does the following:

1. The first/home page let's the user input a UK car reg and submit it. If the car reg is valid, it will display info about the car (basic stuff for now) but will also store the car reg and info into a database table (say cars). If the same car is searched again, it will pull the info from the table.

2. On a different page, let the user search through the cars table. They can search by car reg, make, model etc.

I want a modern looking UI and to be relatively snappy.

I can write a python script to pull the car info but that's about it.

I'm looking to avoid no-code as I want to learn the tools myself. I have no particular time limit on this.

learnprogramming,"Looking for best DS+Algos Course to prep for Summer Internship 2025, Beginner Friendly","Hi! I'm seeking advice on preparing for summer internship 2025 coding interviews (SWE, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or anything coding-related). I've started to leetcode and know that data structures and algorithms are key for interviews. I’m looking for an online course to take over winter break—something not too heavy but effective since I’ve already taken an intro to DS and algos course.

**My background:**

* **Experience:** 2+ years in market research with a focus on data analysis (non coding)
* **Education:** Undergrad in econ, currently finishing my first semester of my CS master’s program. I also did a data science bootcamp focusing on python a few years ago.
* **Courses so far:** Intro to DS and algorithms, Intro to Java. Next semester I'll be taking the DS + Algos course beyond intro level.
* **On the side:** brushing up on Python as I heard it's easier for coding interviews

learnprogramming,[HELP] Python Developer Struggling with JupyterLab Extension Setup - Can't Get Past Installation Stage,"Hi learnprogramming  community! I'm primarily a Python/data analysis developer trying to create my first JupyterLab extension. I'm stuck at a really frustrating stage and could use some guidance.

**What I'm Trying to Build:**
A JupyterLab extension that shows tooltips of Python function content when hovering over markdown links in Jupyter notebooks. For example, if I have a function:
```python
def my_function():
    """"""
    My docstring
    """"""
    return ""Hello""
```
And a markdown link `[Click here](#my_function)`, hovering over it should show the function content.

**My Current Setup:**
- JupyterLab 4.2.6
- Python 3.10
- Using virtual environment
- Project structured following JupyterLab extension template
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Warren8824/jupyter-hover-tooltip.git

**The Problem:**
Even though I'm just trying to get the basic extension recognized before implementing Python functionality:

1. The extension builds without errors:
```bash
   npm run build  # Succeeds
   pip install -e .  # Succeeds
   jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite  # Succeeds
```

2. Server logs show it's loading:
```
   jupyter_hover_tooltip | extension was successfully loaded
```

3. But the extension is invisible in:
   - `jupyter labextension list` output
   - JupyterLab's Extension Manager UI

**Key Files in Place:**
- setup.py with proper Python packaging
- package.json with JupyterLab extension metadata
- __init__.py with proper extension registration
- webpack.config.js for building JavaScript components

**What's Confusing Me:**
1. I understand Python packaging but this hybrid Python/JavaScript setup is new to me
2. Everything seems to build correctly but JupyterLab won't recognize the extension
3. I had it working once before but can't reproduce that success
4. Can't even get to testing the actual Python functionality because I'm stuck at setup

**Questions:**
1. Is this a Python packaging issue or a JupyterLab configuration problem?
2. Are there specific Python-side debugging steps I should take?
3. How can I verify if my Python package is correctly registering with JupyterLab?

I've spent over a day just trying to get past this setup stage. As someone who usually works with pure Python, I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about how Python packages interact with JupyterLab's extension system.

All code is in the GitHub repo. Any help, especially from Python developers who have experience with JupyterLab extensions, would be greatly appreciated!

**Environment Details:**
```

learnprogramming,Where to start? ,"Hey there,

I really need some advice and honestly don't know where else to turn. I've been learning programming at school for about 2 years now, mainly C++, and I'm really struggling. Not with the concepts exactly, but with finding any enjoyment in it. We're working with SFML now, and I just can't get excited about it.

I watch YouTube tutorials and try to code along, which helps me understand things, but it still feels like a chore. What actually gets me excited is thinking about making games in Unity, but my teacher says that's just wasting time and wants us to focus on algorithm exercises instead.

Something that really frustrates me is when I ask other programmers how they got good, and they just say ""just start coding"" or ""I just enjoy it."" That doesn't help me at all. The weird thing is, I managed to teach myself graphic design pretty well, but programming just isn't clicking the same way.

But recently something changed. I watched this video about AI  from the YT Channel ""TylerMommsenl"" like the Fruit ninja one and for the first time in ages, I felt really excited about programming. Like I want to start to learn that. I love working with AI and prompt engineering, and I think actually programming AI would be amazing. Especially in a world where the ki can now programme everything for you. I always think to myself ‘just learn python’ and ask the ki if she can rewrite the python code in c++. Or make your own ki for your own problems. The problem is, I still don't know where to start. I know I probably need to learn Python, but I'm worried about getting worse at C++ if I try to learn both.

I've actually just uninstalled all my games to really focus on this. I know that might sound extreme, but I really want to make this work after so manye tries. Programming has been my dream since I was a kid, and I don't want to give up on it.

I guess what I'm really asking is - has anyone else felt this way? How did you find what excited you in programming? And if anyone here works with AI, how did you get started? I'd really appreciate any advice.

Thanks for reading this far. I know it's a bit of a mess, but I really want to figure this out.",SUZ0Y,1gyw2tv,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gyw2tv/where_to_start/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gyw2tv/where_to_start/,2024-11-24 17:16:44,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gyw2tv
learnprogramming,Programming makes me feel overwhelmed,"I started studying CS this year at university, but it's not the first time I coded.  
I was in ""high school"" that has a branch of computer science. Last year my interest in programming grew thanks to Java, I really liked the problem solving part of it, I think I was one of the few who really had fun in tests while the others were struggling and panicking.

But somehow after finishing last year, I didn't stick with Java I went on and tried to learn new things such as basics of Web Dev, Python along with Pygame, I remember I did a bit of C but I gave up the second I saw pointers...

We also learned SQL and PHP, I considered them to be less fun than Java (even if they're two separate things), I had no issue with the latters but still, I was still in that gray area of not knowing what to focus on.  
  
Although programming is a very interesting, and the fact that you can do a lot of different things with it is truly fascinating.  
  
The issue is that now at University, **I'm unable to do anything, and it feels so overwhelming that, it lowered my self-esteem**.     
When the teacher gives us exercise to do (in Java), I feel ashamed that I'm unable to solve most of them, while others do them with ease. Not only that, watching people online coding and being able to do very cool projects like [this guy](https://youtu.be/GXlckaGr0Eo?t=3333), or coding blazingly fast like [Prime](https://youtu.be/88Oy0h3zxW0?t=1592), truly makes me question if I'm suited for this kind of carrier.

I know most of y'all are thinking ""Just learn prgramming then !"". Believe me I tried, but I'm having a heard time trying to make/complete projects. Either they're too easy to make me feel bored or to hard to make me quit. I can't find a middle ground.

learnprogramming,Any resources from where I can mean DSA? Hands on project based resources ,"I really need some advice. I'm trying to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), but I’m struggling to figure out where to start coding on my own.

I can understand the theory behind DSA concepts and even follow along with examples. When it's time to actually write code, though, I freeze up. I don't know how to begin solving the problem. I've tried watching YouTube videos and reading books, but I feel like these approaches aren't working for me. I can follow their solutions, but when I'm on my own, I’m lost. I’ve got beginner-level knowledge of C++, Java, and Python, so I understand the syntax and basics, but I don’t know how to bridge the gap to solving complex problems.

It’s frustrating because it seems like everyone else knows what they’re doing, and I feel stuck. I need something that forces me to write code and learn by doing, step by step.

I’m not naturally good at coding, but I’m willing to work on it. Logical problem-solving is an area I know I need to improve, and I’m ready to put the time into it.

Does anyone know any resources or platforms that focus on project-based or interactive learning for DSA? Something where I can practice building projects or solving problems without having to rely on videos all the time. 

I’d appreciate any advice, tips, or resources that have worked for you when learning to code.

learnprogramming,Chat GPT is actually great for learning (sometimes),"I've seen a post recently that says that chat gpt isn't good for learning programming.

HOWEVER, I believe it can 2x your learning speed and is a life hack if used correctly.

That being said, If you're still a total beginner,  then you should stay away from chat GPT.

Why? If you don't have solid understanding of the language, programming patterns and best practices before asking chat gpt for anything, you will not be able to notice when it starts hallucinating.

I think chat gpt excels in explaining simple concepts but don't ever expect that it to solve all your problems, and always take the answers with a grain of salt. It can help you speed up your process if you give it specific instructions but you must actually use your brain to analyze it.

It can give you different ideas to code something, teach you what a specific syntax means, or help you make your code cleaner and make more sense. I found that using chat GPT this way has accelerated my learning.

Don't rely on it for explaining complex concepts because it will definitely start hallucinating.

I'm not an expert yet or anything but that's what I found so far.

learnprogramming,Is single player game development a front-end project or back-end?,"I have this non-programmer friend who was asking me about a project I had made. 

The project was a top-down car racing game made in Javascript. It has a control panel to control the car, and there is a physics engine which simulates intertia as you accelerate, decelerate, etc.

He then asked me ""Was this a front-end project or back-end?""

To which, I didn't know what to say. I've always associated the terms ""front-end"", ""back-end"" mostly with website development.

So what is the right thing to say here? This is a simple single player game. Should I have just said ""It's both""? What is even the front-end part here? Just programming the buttons to move the car? And the physics engine is the ""back-end"" part? It feels weird to seperate the project like that.

learnprogramming,Learning GTK GUIs in C ,"Hi everyone!

I’ve recently started learning GTK GUI programming in C, and I’m really enjoying the process! To put my learning into practice, I’ve built a small Pomodoro timer app in which you can set a timer (e.g., 20 minutes), and when it reaches 0, it automatically locks your Windows session for 10 minutes. It’s a fun little productivity tool I made to combine coding with personal habit-building.

I’d love to share this project with others who are learning programming, especially if you’re curious about GUI development or working with GTK in C. If anyone’s interested, I can share my screen over Discord or another platform to walk through the code and explain how it works.

Let me know if this sounds interesting—I’d be happy to connect!",Asasuma,1gyevrc,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gyevrc/learning_gtk_guis_in_c/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gyevrc/learning_gtk_guis_in_c/,2024-11-24 00:59:50,4,0.84,4,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gyevrc

learnprogramming,Are there real situations where a producer-consumer pattern is useful?,"Was taught about the [producer-consumer problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) in an operating systems class when talking about parallel programming. It makes sense conceptually and it worked as a demonstration for how complicated synchronization can be, but I can't think of a situation where it's a useful solution to a problem, and the professor didn't have a concrete example.

Any examples I can find are either entirely abstract (producers are putting some abstract item in an array, consumers are removing them) or a toy model of a real-world situation (producers are customers making orders, consumers are cooks fulfilling those orders) and they always feel constructed just to demonstrate that it's a pattern that exists.

I can imagine that a queue of database queries may express this pattern, but the producers here aren't in software and I don't think a real database management system would work like this. When I asked the professor, he said it could *possibly* show up when simulating partial differential equations, but also cast some serious doubt on if that's a good place to use it.

Do producer-consumer problems entirely in software exist in practice? Is there a problem I might encounter that wasn't constructed to show off this pattern where a producer-consumer pattern would be useful? Does any real software that sees use somewhere express this pattern?


Edit: Looks like I just didn't get that this is applicable everywhere there's a queue accessed by multiple processes. Fully admit I just don't have any actual experience writing large programs and have never encountered a need for it, which I should remedy. As for the prof's response, I think that was just a bad time to ask and he didn't have an answer prepared.

Hi everyone, I am working on a project where I need to calculate the thread count from an image of fabric threads. The first image I have is a zoomed-in image of the fabric threads. After preprocessing the image, I apply the Hough Line Transform, and the second image shows the output with multiple lines being detected for a single thread. The third image represents the desired output, where the lines are correctly marked on both horizontal (red lines) and vertical threads (yellow lines). I want to achieve this output for all threads in the image, but currently, the result isn’t as expected. The fifth image was obtained after applying an edge detection filter to the first image, and the last image shows the desired final output. The fourth image shows the output obtained from the fifth image. Here’s the issue I’m facing: I’m getting multiple lines for a single thread, and in some cases, no lines are detected for certain threads at all.

learnprogramming,SQLAlchemy + Pydantic assigning default value if no value is inputted,"I am working on the messaging component of a project where users can message sellers of a product through the site. In my database (SQLite using SQLAlchemy, I have a column called convo\_id which I am planning to use to group related messages - like text chains). Sometimes the convo\_id will not be passed (if it is the first message), and other times it will be if the message is in reply to another. Obviously, the generated convo\_ids need to be unique; otherwise, messages will be grouped together incorrectly.

I have this pydantic model for creating (sending) a message:

    class MessageBase(BaseModel):
        sender_id: str
        receiver_id: str
        product_id: int
        message: str
        is_read: Optional[bool] = False
        parent_id: Optional[int] = None
        convo_id: Optional[str] = None
        
        # If no convo_id is provided, generate one
        @field_validator('convo_id')
        @classmethod
        def generate_convo_id(cls, convoID: Optional[str]) -&gt; str:
            # Used if no convo_id is provided (i.e. first message)
            if convoID is None:
                convoID = str(uuid.uuid4())
            return convoID

I ran the FastAPI function on FastAPI docs with some test values. In the return model of the FastAPI function, it shows all the attributes of Message, and there is a correctly generted convo\_id. However, in the database the column for convo\_id shows NULL. And sure enough, when I changed that column to be nullable=False and tried to repeat with a new message and an empty convo\_id, I got an error. But when I retrieved the message from the database (before I added nullable=False - so the column showed NULL), the convo\_id was returned and it matched the generated convo\_id that the FastAPI response model showed. So it seems that the convo\_id is in the database, but it is showing NULL? I'm a bit confused on what is going on. I do believe I fixed the problem by simply doing 

`convo_id: Optional[str] = str(uuid.uuid4())`

and deleting the field\_validator. I feel rather dumb for not doing that originally, but at least it's working. But I'm still confused at to what was going on with the original code.

learnprogramming,Tackling a problem that involves understanding NP-Completeness through Reduction,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on a problem called the ""Stone Block Problem,"" which involves proving its NP-completeness. While I understand the general framework of NP-completeness proofs, I’m unclear on how we’re expected to approach solving this specific task and would appreciate some guidance.

We are given a list of stone blocks, each defined by their dimensions (length, height, and width), and a target size dd, which represents the side of a cube we want to construct. The goal is to decide whether it’s possible to use a subset of the given blocks to construct a d×d×d cube without any internal holes. The blocks can be rotated in any orientation.

The problem description emphasizes using the ""Subset Sum"" problem as the starting point for the reduction. From what I understand, this means we must map the properties of ""Subset Sum"" (positive integers and their sums) onto the dimensions of the blocks and their arrangement in the cube.

Here are the aspects I’m struggling with:

1. **Interpreting the Problem Requirements**:
   * How are we supposed to relate the subset of blocks to the d×d×d cube?
   * Should we assume a specific strategy for laying out the blocks in the cube, or is the reduction meant to abstract away these details?
2. **Reduction Mapping**:
   * What exactly are we expected to transform in the ""Subset Sum"" problem to fit this scenario? For instance, how do the sums translate into the spatial constraints of the cube?
   * Are we expected to outline an algorithm for how the blocks can be placed, or just describe the conceptual equivalence?
3. **Expectations on Proof Details**:
   * While we don’t need a full correctness proof for the reduction, how deep should we go when explaining why this reduction works?
   * Should we focus more on demonstrating the feasibility of the reduction or on how it ensures that the cube construction problem inherits the complexity of ""Subset Sum""?
4. **Cube Validity Check**:
   * Since the problem involves verifying if a valid cube can be constructed, is this validation step something we need to design explicitly, or can we rely on the properties of the reduction to argue its existence?

Any clarification on how to approach these questions or solve the problem effectively would be incredibly helpful. If anyone has experience with similar problems, I’d greatly appreciate your input!

learnprogramming,How to deal with this mindset that struggles with me?,"After I learn something, I think to myself, ""Okay, I understand this."" However, when I'm faced with a test or a real-world application, I find that I struggle to utilize the knowledge and even have trouble recalling it. As a result, I resort to repetitive study, but this approach is both difficult to sustain and feels like rote memorization.  
  
I wonder if my learning mindset is flawed. I'm not just struggling with programming ; I often feel frustrated if I can't perfectly memorize information.   
  
If I can't readily recall knowledge, I tend to doubt my understanding.  
Is my approach incorrect, or do I simply need to practice more? I'm quite confused.

I'm 22yo and I've been a Python RPA developer for about 5 months now, so obviously I'm a beginner. I've been struggling with my first big plateau, which is making me question a lot of things like: should i continue to learn python or should i switch to another programming language? If I'm a bad programmer, what makes someone a good one? My generation apparently lacks low-level computer knowledge, what can I do to make it different for my career?

The question I came here to ask is if you had already faced a phase like this in your programming career and what did you do overcome it ?

How can i improve web scraping and RPA in Python to a mastery level?

How can i be a better programmer not just to be better at my job, but to improve overall as a programmer?

learnprogramming,Question about working as a programmer. ,"First of all I will say I am not even a junior programmer. I am a guy who know the basics of coding and have made some small games/projects. 

This year I decided I want to get into programming so I got into a university. 

Lucky thing happens so that the company I work for (bakery factory) wanted a custom inventory management system. They told me they would hire a senior programmer and I am to take the role of the junior programmer. 

I meet the senior programmer and I explain to him that ""hey I don't even consider myself a junior"" and he says don't worry we all been there. 

To see my knowledge he puts me down to read a few codes of python and I do understand what's happening and he says you good to go. 

Here is me thinking ""hey I do know all the basic stuff but how am I ready to code?"" 

1 week goes off just doing 8 hours meeting, planning, keeping notes of the companies needs and problems. 

Second week is prototyping which we did in Chatgtp..... 

And all I had to do was basically piece together functions and fix smalls bugs..... 

So I do end up asking him like when we will actually code and he tells me this. 

""we don't code from scratch, it's 2025""

Later he told me all I need to know is to understand the code chatgtp gives me, make sure to put custom comments so we know what everything does, make sure the code given by chat gtp is bug free make sure it doesn't mess up our source code, keep a log in a parer sheet/word file/txt so we know what I did and what order to locate possible bugs. 

When I asked why I don't just write the code myself he said

"" everything is on the Internet if not chatgtp you will end up searching something online to understand how to do it and most likely get the code from someone who knows or already solved that issue , so you just skip that and get it from chatgtp. If there is something we need more custom and from scratch I will be doing that as senior and guess what! , I will be using an ai code assistant to save time. ""

I do understand that we don't ask an ai for the whole program and I do see that we do actually make it step by step and very carefully and that there is actually a human touch to all that but... 

Is that all we gonna do as programmers? Read existing code and puzzle functions together? And then fix bugs?

What should I do, be self-taught with videos first, I also need a link or something from a reliable course that can be used to cover that content, let's say it's introductory, from scratch, but it's complete, whether from Udemy or any other recommended platform.
    
    Also ask: Does it have very complex mathematics? , I observed that some commands clearly have to do with this, but I want to know if it is at a very advanced level.
    
    In short, would it be a good investment considering that I am studying a separate career or is it very demanding to learn and practice it, in how much time? I also read that you could have a profile that says Jr Data Analyst, but I don't know if it is very profitable, if it is a freelancer type job, I heard that it is very useful once learned, to apply on Linkedin, so I am still thinking before giving this step and I wanted to consult it.

I'm ""reverse engineering"" **my game** that is made with unreal engine 4. I'm injecting my DLL into the game process and hooking some functions. However, some of those functions are UE4 functions that I'd like to call manually but they take in some UE4 objects that I don't have access to.

So I'm here looking for a way to statically link the UE4 core lib (the one that has the containers e.g FString, TArray). I know that I might be able to achieve that by building UE4 myself, but that would just take a REALLY long time and I'd like to keep that as the last resort.

It is written in python for aws lambda and api gateway, little fuzzy on that exact side as I am still sifting through everything.  
Something that we are not doing is contract testing and would like to start doing this. One of the requirements is to ensure the server is responding back to the client with what the openapi spec is saying it needs to be returning to the client.

I have found a few tools that almost accomplish this, prism that creates a mock server from an openapi spec and schemathesis which uses an openapi spec against a ""real"" api server to ensure validation is returned correctly. Though a lot of the tools I have found seem to be tailored for code-driven development.

Is there a good way of attempting this contract that I have not been able to find? From my research it seems like it should not be needed since the spec says what the client should send/receive and what the server should receive/send.

Ideally everything would be automated, so we wouldnt need to create direct tests persay, just does the contract match each other. With prism and schemathesis, we could just run a local automation it would utilize each other to do the testing.

Everyone was like proud and happy for me, and I was confident too. I got really decent grades and have a few projects and some scholarships under my belt. I then practiced leetcode and read some stuff like everyone says. Then the day came and I failed so hard to the point where I just didn't know how to feel. The questions were not hard, it was some greedy problems for string, but I fumbled like horribly. My hands and voice were shaky, my code didn't even work for some edge cases and I couldn't explain some complexities questions. Seeing the dude being visibly annoyed made me feel even worse.

I'd always been confident in my abilities but now I just feel like a fraud. All those grades and confidence went down the drain, and I didn't even have the balls to tell my family and friends how I did.

learnprogramming,Need guidance choosing programming language,"Hi all,

I’m looking to build an app that can pull in large amounts of data from a backend, process it (potentially with something like Python), and display both the raw and processed data in the app interface. My main goal is to have the data updated in **real-time** and be displayed efficiently, with **low latency**, so the app feels smooth and responsive.

# Key Requirements:

* **Real-Time Data:** The app should be able to handle incoming data and display it live, without delays or lags.
* **Backend Processing:** I’m currently thinking about using **Python** (perhaps with libraries like **Pandas** or **NumPy**) to process the data on the backend.
* **Cross-Platform &amp; Easy Installation:** The app needs to be downloadable and installable on **Windows** (and ideally macOS/Linux as well), like a normal desktop app, without needing any complex setup.
* **Nice UI:** I want the app to look polished and professional, so I’m hoping to find a way to design an attractive and user-friendly interface.
* **Learning Opportunity:** I have a basic understanding of programming, but I’m eager to learn more. The difficulty of the language or framework is not a big concern for me; I’m willing to put in the effort to learn what’s needed to make this work.

# My Questions:

1. What programming languages, frameworks, or tools would be best for building a cross-platform desktop app that can process and display large data in real-time?
2. How can I ensure the app is efficient and responsive, even when dealing with heavy data processing?
3. What would be the best way to package and distribute the app so that users can easily install it on their computers?
4. Any tips on making the app’s user interface sleek and professional?
5. If I eventually want to commercialize such an app, are there any important considerations or potential pitfalls I should be aware of?

There are so many applications and files I've downloaded with prompts via my terminal and surely there's a space limit on the ""pre saved"" applications? Are they like compressed files waiting to be unzipped by the command?

The bootcamp concluded three months ago, and since then, I’ve been actively building MERN projects to strengthen my skills, particularly in areas where I felt less confident during the course. To my surprise, I’ve genuinely enjoyed both the learning process and applying what I’ve learned.

Over the past few months, I’ve been applying for junior developer roles (front-end, back-end, and full-stack), but I haven’t had much success. A lot of the job listings I’ve come across mention skills like C#, .NET, Docker, CI/CD, AWS, and Azure as desirable. I recognize that my current capabilities might not align with some of these requirements, or perhaps other candidates are simply a better fit.

I can login and logout and log back in FINE. However, if I do the following: 1. Login 2. logout 3. wait \~5 mins 4. login 5. I receive 408 on my POST to .../j\_security\_check which is a Request Timeout.

I notice that when I login, i have 2 cookies - JSESSIONIDSSO and JSESSIONID. the JSESSIONIDSSO is set to ""REMOVE"" when I logout. I also noticed that the console has a warning that cookie ""JSESSIONIDSSO"" has been rejected because it is already expired. However, if I login within the 5 minutes or so, i still can.

From the login action, i see a POST (return 303) j\_security\_check where it sends JSESSIONID cookie and the response has the cookies JESSIONID and JSESSIONIDSSO

If I logout and the page refreshes, I see a GET on my current login page and I see the Response with set-cookie on JSESSIONIDSSO=REMOVE, Expires =Thu,01 jan 1970... and JSESSIONID = 123531....

I want the ""path of least resistance"" to get the login to work. If I can refresh cookie or clear cookie/cache when I logout that would be great. or if I can fix in backend that be great too. I think for now I just need to be able to 1. login. 2.logout. 3. after periods of time 4. login success.

Any ideas that could help? thanks

learnprogramming,Fighting with manager about double click implementation in React,"Our app has a component that has one intended behavior on a single click, and another intended behavior on double click. This particular implementation is not good UX and I lobbied for a different approach but got rejected. The behavior triggered by a single click is that a huge side panel slides open with more information about the component, so it's not the kind of thing that can just be canceled or undone once a second click is detected. On double click, the component is supposed to blow up into multiple sub-components. 

My approach involves \`setTimeout\` that introduces a delay of 250ms after the first click. If after 250ms, the \`event.detail\` property is equal to 1, the single click handler fires. If it's equal to 2, the double click handler fires.  

This morning during code review, my manager straight up told me this is an ""irresponsible and inaccessible"" approach specifically because it ignores the user-set double click timing (which can be customized at least on macOS). He told me my approach was too hacky and even used the word ""unprofessional."" I told him there's no way to get the user's preferred double-click timing in JavaScript and his response was, ""if there's not a way then come up with one yourself.""   

Meanwhile I am having trouble thinking of any alternative solution that doesn't literally involve time travel or mind-reading. In my view, there's not really a way to do this without a timeout because when a single click occurs, we have no way of knowing if a second click is coming unless we wait a specified amount of time and then check.   

Idk I feel stuck. This is my first real dev job and his comments have got me feeling like a complete dumbass.    I'm the only dev on my entire team besides my manager so have no one else to bounce ideas off of.

learnprogramming," How to make a partial update feature for my Unity game launcher?
","Hi everyone!

I recently made a launcher (in Visual Studio 2022) for my Unity game that downloads files from Google Drive, a version text (.txt) and a build file (zip folder(.zip)), and unzips the game folder locally on the user's PC. Once the files are unpacked, the launcher allows the user to play the game, and launches the game when the button is pressed.

However, I am running into an issue with the update process:  
When I update the game files on Google Drive, even some tiny patch, the launcher detects the changes and re-installs the entire game folder instead of only downloading and/or modifying the changed files or adding the new files. It worked first fine, my game was small, and it was a quick process, but now, my game grew in size, and waiting to re-install the game files again and again, every time I make some small patches, is annoying and not the right way. (Like War Thunder Launcher, instead of re-installing the 60 gb game, it only adds 2 gb of the new content)

I kinda formulated what I need, but the problem is, I have no idea *HOW* to make it, well, I tried Googling, finding some tutorials, books and even asking AI, but I haven't found any solutions and explanations.

For what I formulated, I need this algorithm:

1. Let the launcher compare the local files with the online files (on the Google Drive) (which it does right now, but it reinstalls the whole game).
2. The launcher downloads only the new content or updates the one that are modified (which the part I am missing)
3. And dont touch the unchanged files.

As I said, I tried doing research here and there, and even though I got something, I don't understand it. Like creating a manifest.Json file in the Unity folder, then let the launcher compare the .Json file instead of the whole game? That part confuses me.  
  
I am not an experienced person in terms of programming outside some environment (like Unity), so this is something new to me which I want to learn, but, I simply can't find the correct way to learn? Maybe there are some docs, tutorials, courses that I couldn't find? I would greatly appreciate if someone ""placed"" me on the right path, because right now, I am stuck on this problem, and its like a dark forest to me, where should I go, I don't know.

learnprogramming,Learn to use a debugger,"tl;dr Learn to use a debugger, it doesn't take long and will be useful as soon as you start using loops.

___

It is near the end of the semester, so I'm almost done with my first CS course :) I can't offer much advice, but I did realize one thing, the value of knowing how to use a debugger. 

You may see it suggested on occasion ""learn to use a debugger"" and you may think to yourself ""I'm just doing small 20 line programs, I don't need to know how to use a debugger yet"", you're probably going to be proven wrong 😂. As soon you learn how to make a loop you should then go and learn how to use a debugger.

I had a problem a little while ago, it was either loops or recursion, but what saved me from pulling out hair was recalling the few minutes I spent learning how to use the JetBrains debugger. 

It doesn't take long to get a rudimentary understanding of how they work, 1 hour tops. To sum up what it does, it just shows you the current value of your variables.

A simple program to illustrate

    import random

    for i in range(1, 11):
        ran_num = random.randint(1, 10)
        i += ran_num
        print(i)

All this does is count from 1 to 10, generate a random number (from 1 to 10), add it to i, and then print it. The debugger will show you what the value of ran_num and i are so you can see if a value is something other than what you expect it to be so you can more easily troubleshoot your code. 

PyCharm is what I normally use for Python [pic](https://i.postimg.cc/3rsLtJty/image.png) but VSCode has it too [another pic](https://i.postimg.cc/50H3mZvq/image.png)

Here's a video I think does a decent job of explaining how to use the debugger in VSCode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCcTiRGPogQ (this isn't my video, I don't know this person)

I hope this helps someone :) Good luck!",NormalSteakDinner,1gxafzr,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gxafzr/learn_to_use_a_debugger/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gxafzr/learn_to_use_a_debugger/,2024-11-22 15:30:29,127,0.94,127,0,59,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gxafzr

learnprogramming,Programs Foundation,"So recently I've been working on a personnel project, it is to automate tasks for work.

I try to use API when possible but most of it is based on simulating clicks and keystrokes.

My problem is that I tend to pour in a lot of time with foundations so to say.

I've started simple, just clicks. Than I added a image recognition. 

I got a functional code but thought it was a pain to make the initial setup before using, I had to manually take screenshots, see the where to click, where to search, etc.

So I started making tools to help me setup. I made a recording that'll register the clicks and saves images. Than I made a processing tool to crop the image and save those.

Then I made a builder to help bring it together followed by a executing function to read what was build and execute.

Finally I started making an tracker that'll see what was executed and if it was intereptued so that it can be resumed later.

From the first working code to the current version I think I've tripled the lines of codes. Over multiple modules, I think I have around 3-4k lines of code?

My issue is that for everything, a lot of my code is dedicated to catch possible errors that I think up, and while possible, a lot of them simply never become an actual problem when executing my code.

Also I am constantly re organizing my code, after going over, I see that it'll be better if I create a new class, or that this variable would be better to merge it with another. And this also is consuming a lot of my time as I need to go over every part of the code and modules seeing if something gets broken.

Not sure which way to go, if I should make more simple generic errors catchers and if something goes wrong, I start debugging.

And if I should just leave the variables/constants and in a later time I go over the whole code and do an overhaul?

I want to teach C lang or something else.
My brain usually works with programming but she is very creative.

So please suggest any book which can slowly improve her programming knowledge from the basics.

I think i should start with C lang
Or is there any animation software ( something like flash.. ) A free one to learn..

learnprogramming,Game Logic Help,"I am new to game dev and making a small game in C++ where I am trying to implement jump logic.
So far it's working fine, but I am trying to make it now so that when the player (a rectangle) jumps and hits a platform that is directly above them, they fall down to the ground rather than going through it and landing.

```
// part of a namespace
inline void applyPlatformCollisions(Rectangle&amp; rec, int&amp; peakJumpPoint, const int jumpSpeed)
{
    // peakJumpPoint refers to the y value of the maximum point they will reach while jumping. It is set to 0 if not jumping
    if (peakJumpPoint) 
    {
        for (std::size_t i = 0; i &lt; reservedPlatforms.size(); i++)
        {
            Rectangle&amp; plat = reservedPlatforms[i];

            std::cout &lt;&lt; withinXBoundaries(rec, plat) &lt;&lt; '\n';
                
            if (peakJumpPoint &lt; (plat.y + plat.height)
                &amp;&amp; withinXBoundaries(rec, plat)
                &amp;&amp; (rec.y - jumpSpeed) &lt;= (plat.y + plat.height))
            {
                peakJumpPoint = (plat.y + plat.height);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

withinXBoundaries() is made to make sure the player is directly below the platform. It works perfectly when not jumping, and when the player is jumping on the platform, it also returns 1 as it should. However, when it is jumping and not on the platform, it returns 1 and 0 and it alternates every frame.

This is the definition for the function:
```
inline bool withinXBoundaries(Rectangle&amp; plr, Rectangle&amp; rec)
{
    return (plr.x &gt;= (rec.x - plr.width))
        &amp;&amp; (plr.x &lt;= (rec.x + rec.width));
}
```

I believe documenting our journeys here could create a valuable resource for future self-taught devs. Each of our stories – the struggles, the breakthroughs, the study strategies that actually worked – could help light the path for others.

**Looking to hear from:**

* Anyone transitioning from a non-CS background
* Currently studying DSA through online platforms (Coursera/Udemy/etc.)
* Preparing for technical interviews/OAs

Share your thoughts on:

* Which resources clicked for you? (Courses, YouTube channels, books)
* How are you structuring your study routine?
* What unexpected challenges have you faced as a non-CS major?
* Any ""aha!"" moments that helped concepts finally make sense?

The tech journey can feel isolating, especially when tackling DSA without a traditional CS foundation. But maybe we can make it a bit easier for the next person by sharing our experiences here.

learnprogramming,Help! I’m drowning in info. How to organize?,"Help! I’m drowning in info. I started learning web development via the Zero To Mastery course 4 years ago but had to take a break due to several factors. I’m back at it, and I’m organizing all my notes, materials, and resources from when I gathered them 4 years ago. My goal: Organize these resources in a sustainable manner so that I can continue working with them as I start learning web development again and well into my first few jobs.

Any suggestions on how to organize these (if even only on some of the items below) would be appreciated. Specific questions I have include:
1. What items are best to organize within a single document (like Word or XLS). How would you organize these items within this document...that is grouped by what criteria and sorted how so? Would each item only appear in one list or in multiple (if it applies to multiple categories).
2. What items are best organized into different folders? What’s a folder structure you suggest for these? Would each item only appear in one folder or in multiple (if it applies to multiple categories).

Resources That Don’t Involve Talking to People:
1. Code snippets - that I’ll frequently use.
2. Articles - some are how-to’s some aren’t 
3. Step by step how-to’s that I’ve created 
4. Class notes - that I wrote
5. Class videos &amp; handouts - given by instructor/class
6. Cheat sheets for any topic/language/tool
7. Official literature on programs I use
8. Videos - How do you organize bookmarks to them or how do you save the actual videos? Which brings me to ask do you download the video so you have it (incase the person who posted the video online decides to later remove it)? 
9. Websites where you can get info like code snippets, color templates, images that can be used, etc
10. Social media influencers to follow that share how to do relevant things or give inspiration from?

Resources That Do Involve Talking to People:
1. Industry Discords and Slacks and the threads on them. Which brings me to ask, do you make note of the Community (ex: ZTM) or the thread (#python)?
2. Industry Reddits
3. Industry Whatsapps
4. Awesome individuals that I can go to for help.
5. Classmates / accountability buddies
6. Professional organizations/clubs that I belong to
7. Anywhere to get inspiration from
8. Websites to check for work and/or post availability to (like UpWork)

so instead I use ai chatbots to teach it to me, like whenever he makes his own assignment about the topic were learning, streams for example, I'll copy and paste the assignment prompt into chatgpt, but I don't ask it for answers, instead I'll ask it like ""teach me everything about streams, and every example you teach, provide a practice question about what you just taught for me to solve on my own. start from the basics, and with every example, slowly build up until i have enough of an unferstanding to do the assignment""

so basically, chatgpt teaches me the topic, starting from the basics and building up, and i solve practice problems on my own after chatgpt teaches an example, it'll ask me a prompt and I'll write the code.

is it fine for me to learn from ai like this? like I still read it and try to understand whats being taught to me. i mainly use chatgpt just to learn the syntax of it, like i was really confused over streams, and obviously I couldn't complete  the assignment without knowing the syntax for streams, so my main goal with learning from chatgpt is learning the syntax, how it works, etc.

buy milk
buy a car

learnprogramming,The Odin Project vs 100 days of Swift,"Hey guys, I am in a bit of a conundrum,

So, first things being first, I have a quite well-paid job and am not looking for a new one in the tech sector - though if I find out I love it I wouldn’t rule it out.

But I really really want to learn to create. I am annoyed of only passively consuming stuff. And programming is an amazing skill and intensely useful.

I started and quit programming a few times, I for example programmed a game of connect 4 on Python. That was by Codecademy with too much handholding though.

Last year I started The Odin Project.
I love that it is very well structured and not much handholding, they just tell you which parts you should learn, but learn you have to do yourself.
But here is the problem: they teach webdevelopment, something that doesn’t interest me in the slightest.
Everywhere I read it is important to work on projects you want to work on. That would be against TOP. (Except CLI and SQL which I really want to learn and they do teach, I would not stop doing that if possible)

Yet, whenever a newbie asks about which language to learn, everyone just says, „it’s not about the language but about concepts“
For this, TOP as I understand it is ideal.

Which is why I started it.

There are however three projects unwanted to create and at least two of them I feel are simple enough to be made even by a noob.
The third on I started to write in pseudocode, but I quickly understood that I need to understand recursion better.

Those two simple projects are IOS-Apps. (I mean, nothing against Android, but I have an iPhone now and since I want to use them myself, that’s that. Plus, Swift is pretty, Java really is not)
Which brings me to the 100 days of Swift.

Does anyone know wether it actually teaches everything i need to know? 
I don’t want to spend 100 days on it, again leaving The Odin Project just to come back to it because the 100 days of Swift only shows me how to create that one specific app by coding along instead of learning how to do it myself.
But I understand that generally it suits me better.

I apologize for the Wall of text

I have just completed the first sem of my third year, and companies will start visiting for internships in January. I want to be prepared for that, and I JUST HAVE 1 MONTH FOR IT.

learnprogramming,Any books/resources to take a computer program from idea to market?,"I am interested in doing software development for side income.  Unfortunately, I'm ""new"" to software development and computer programming.  I put ""new"" in quotes as I use to be a professional web designer (HTML/CSS/design software), and I know how to pick up a programming language (I'm a novice in R and Python, currently trying to learn Flutter).

Overall, I want to build software for my industry as I see opportunities, however I do not know best practices from taking an idea to market.  For example, how do I release software to market in a way that others don't steal it?  Are there ""stages"" in software development that most in the field recommend following, and best practices for each stage?  I just want to do things the ""right"" way, and by right, I mean in a way that a lot of vets are doing now that have been battle tested.

learnprogramming,Suggestions for Future-Proofing My Skills as a Developer,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been working as a C++ developer in an MNC in India for about a year now. This is my first job, and I’ve been focusing on gaining as much experience and knowledge as possible. While I enjoy my work, I can’t help but notice how AI is gradually automating many repetitive coding tasks, such as scripts and other routine processes that don’t require much cognitive effort.

I want to stay ahead of the curve and ensure my skills remain relevant in the future. To that end, I’ve planned to pursue an AWS certification in the next 2-3 months.

Apart from AWS, what other technologies, tools, or areas of expertise should I focus on to future-proof my career and continue growing as a developer?

learnprogramming,Feel So Lost,"I've been programming and learning for about a year. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (a little, Express.js, SQL, Python, and Java), but I still feel like I'm lacking. I don't feel confident enough, but I will not give up.

Now, coming to my main concern: I struggle to explain things clearly, but I do understand the concepts well. My biggest weakness is problem-solving. I want to do whatever it takes to improve. If anyone here is willing to teach me properly for any of the programming languages I mentioned, I’d be very grateful.

&gt;Due to logic errors, programs can also attempt to use memory that has been freed, or even free memory that has already been freed.

Some dumb questions:

a.   why is attempting to use memory that's already free a problem ?  if memory is freed, then by definition the program should be able to use it right ?

b.   why is freeing memory that's already free a problem ?  wouldn't this be a no-op ?

It's my first post here, which I had to create as I was unable to figure it out myself or find anything on the internet about my problem. I followed the[ Thonky tutorial for QR codes](https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/) as I figured out it might be an interesting project to work on in my spare time. The problem I encountered is that it looks like from what I was able to figure out myself is that my bits string is shorter than the amount of available pixels that I can fill in. The difference between these two vary and depends on the text that I'd like to turn in to QR code.  
The project itself is small, I decided to only go for error correction level = L and versions 1 to 5.

You can find the example of the generated QR code below for URL [www.x.com](http://www.x.com) in a form of 2d array:

You can clearly see the masking pattern to the left of the vertical timing pattern. I tried comparing the qr code with the one generated by qrcode library, and the main difference is the masking version used. The only difference I made is that I wanted to avoid doing some math for error encoding and used the reedsolo library.

Any ideas what could be the cause of the problem?

I have an idea to organize my life a bit and learning to program in at the same time. For some time now i've been thinking of creating a set up where i make tracking exparation date of medication i have in my drawer easier. My idea is to print QR codes and put them on the medication boxes i have.   
I would like to scan the QR and add it to a data base (most likely just excel or .txt file), where i can fill in the Name, Purpose and Expiration date.   
I would like to then run periodically a program that checks when the Expiration date is reached and sends some kind of notification (learning how to send an email would be cool). The full scope might change when i realize that something doesn't bring me the anticipated value but the most important part is to gain experience and have some fun.

My problem is - i really don't know where to start from expect for googling each stage - QR codes creation, Data Base creation, Notifications and trying to figure out my way through it.

learnprogramming,How to Reliably Collect Serial Port Data with Flask and React on a Dockerized Raspberry Pi?,"I have a Flask server and a React frontend designed to run experiments where data is collected from a serial port. Here’s the setup:

The full application is dockerized and hosted on Raspberry Pi.

# React Frontend Features:

* **Start Timer Button**: Begins data collection for an experiment. Triggers backend API endpoint, which starts storing data in a buffer array.
* **End Timer Button**: Stops data collection. Triggers the backend API endpoint which stops storing the data in the buffer and returns that to the frontend.

# Requirements:

1. Only one user at a time.
2. Only one experiment at a time.
3. Only one timer should be active on the server.
4. Delay for the data to show on frontend is accepted.

# Problems Faced:

* The serial port sometimes disconnects, leading to data loss.
* Socket connections occasionally drop, also resulting in data loss.

# Proposed Solution:

1. Use **TimescaleDB** to store the collected data.
2. Forward the stored data from TimescaleDB to the frontend.

# Question:

1. What’s the best way to address these issues and improve the overall setup?
2.

learnprogramming,Is it possible to learn multiple Code languages? (yes is the answer but what does the timeframe look like? is it realisitic),"Tl;Dr is it realistic to learn multiple coding languages?

Hi everyone, bare with me as I try express my question more clearly.   
Basically I find myself reengaging with my art practice and learning 3D. some short courses I looked at involved unreal engine and in my mind sparked the idea that at some point I may be getting involved with learning code for games. Maybe to mod existing games, or maybe to look at/study how a game was made code wise. 

In regards to blender, Add-ons are typically made with Python (i yet to understand why Python in many courses besides its ease of learning) maybe i will want to create my own. 

with jumping back into my art, perhaps i may want to make a website one day instead of being so spread out on social media, and locked to the design of website templates that want to charge me to create a more complex design.. so this calls for html, maybe javascript etc. 

so already I'm potentially looking at:  
Python, Html, Css, Java (web development),    
C++, maybe C# for unreal engine, unity (Games) 

this is already ontop of learning 3D modelling, and animation. although it's theorising future events, its a lot. I'm currently just doing one thing at a time instead of stretching myself across things to reach a level of proficiency at each thing. (3d modelling is the first step before moving into learning texturing, and then go into sculpting. then relearn animation) 

its all possible but its all a factor of TIME and MONEY. 

i guess the question is not whether its possible as multilingual folk exist, But is it realistic?

learnprogramming,Best Language For Parsing Custom Data Visually? [2D/3D],"Hello!

I've dabbled in programming most of my life but the biggest hurdle was lack of an end goal and not really knowing what to pursue or what to push myself to learn. 

  
Around a year ago, I was working with some people online and they converted hex data from a Playstation 1 game through a custom program they had written and it rendered the map within their custom program.

I've recently been going through the same game, working on reverse engineering it by marking what different memory locations do \[by poking various addresses during gameplay/freezing them and observing various results\], and then using the knowledge of different memory locations with Ghirda to reverse engineer the code used to program said game. \[Which, in it's current speedrun, is glitch free due to it being a more niche title\]

So, if I wanted to dive into a programming language, would I simply want to use Visual C++ and learn how to use C++ to parse data into custom view and figuring out how to create custom 2D/3D visual constructs of the data I'm trying to view?

Or would there be a better language to use for such a thing? \[While I am familiar with most languages, at minimum by name, most things I read online make it feel like ""You can do anything with anything, choose one"" so to me, it doesn't feel like I have the knowledge to properly narrow down my options\].

My goal here is to hopefully attain some knowledge to narrow down my options in the wide field of programming language options.

learnprogramming,Digging Into Frameworks,"Friends,

Prior to this semester of school, I read an entire book on Python. I learned the basics of Python.

This semester in school, learning the basics of languages such as Python, PHP and JS have helped me further understand basic concepts like loops, if-then logic, modularization, etc.

Since I started coding, I have tried building projects. They always end in needing a framework of some type. I wanted to build a web app and host it on my laptop, I need Flask. I wanted to build a scrapper, I need BeautifulSoup. etc.

Very quickly, the functions and methods in the frameworks become incomprehensible to me. I soon find myself copy and pasting these functions from a website to my own script just with variables relative to my program.

My final thoughts, I may find myself not completing a project because they don't have a real purpose. The web app has no real content. The scrapper isn't scraping content I care about. I think I need to go in with a purpose.

Is this normal? How do you go about learning a framework?

Thanks!

learnprogramming,"Security Headers should be added on Backend or Frontend side?
","Hi. I have seperated C# API backend from React front. On which side should Security Headers be added? Im asking because, in some blogs i see that for example ""Content Security Policy"" is applied in C# API backend, but i cant see any purpose here, cuz with CSP (how i understand) we limiting or setting rules that tell the browser what it is allowed to load(css styles, js scripts, images and etc.) from where, from which resource. For example lets take this CSP header - ""Content-Security-Policy: img-src 'self' [https://api.testApp.com](https://api.testApp.com);"" - now in our app images can be loaded ONLY from:

1. The same origin as my website(if my site is [https://mytestapp.com](https://mytestapp.com), images must also come from `https://mytestapp.com`).
2. From api : ""https://api.testApp.com""

(CSP is just example here, my question is applicable for other headers too) Now my question is, what is purpose of implementing this(CSP and other headers...) header in restful c# api backend?

Can someone write a plain english overview which type of headers should be set on front side, which headers should be set on back side?. And this answer is generated by gpt, can we agree with him? or any improvements?

&gt;Where Should the Headers Be Applied?

&gt;\&gt; Backend (API):

&gt;\--- Use security headers on the API to protect data and restrict how the API is accessed.

&gt;\--- Critical headers: CORS, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy (minimalist).

&gt;\&gt; Frontend (React App):

&gt;\--- Use headers to protect the delivery of your React app to the browser.

&gt;\--- Critical headers: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.",antikfilosov,1gwgib2,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gwgib2/security_headers_should_be_added_on_backend_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gwgib2/security_headers_should_be_added_on_backend_or/,2024-11-21 13:40:11,1,0.67,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gwgib2

I'm currently working as an Associate Software Engineer at an MNC, focusing primarily on backend development in C++ and Java (some components are in C++, and others in Java).

I’m considering expanding my skill set by starting with the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and potentially pursuing more advanced certifications in the future. Here's my reasoning:

* I already hold an Oracle Java SE 8 certification.
* With about 1 year of professional experience, I feel adding cloud expertise could enhance my profile.
* Our current projects are hosted on AWS Cloud, and I’ve noticed a growing demand for cloud-related skills in the job market.

Although I don’t have much experience with cloud technologies yet, I see this as an opportunity to learn, align with industry trends, and possibly open up better career opportunities in the future.

Do you think pursuing AWS certifications at this stage would be a good move for someone with my background and goals? Are there any other certifications or pathways you’d recommend that could complement my backend development skills?

learnprogramming,How difficult is this topic without prior knowledge?,"I've been assigned a topic to work on, and I wanted to ask how difficult it might be for someone without much prior knowledge.

The task is to integrate a solar system (Fronius Symo GEN24 Plus) and a BYD Battery-Box HVM into an energy management system (OpenEMS) to monitor and control the system.

I was given two links as preliminary resources:

* [https://community.openems.io/t/fronius-symo-gen24-plus-mit-byd-battery-box-hvm/2015](https://community.openems.io/t/fronius-symo-gen24-plus-mit-byd-battery-box-hvm/2015)
* [https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/pull/2150](https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/pull/2150)

The main objective is to analyze the issues that may arise when integrating these devices with OpenEMS and to find solutions.

I currently only have basic technical knowledge, and I am wondering whether this topic is manageable for a beginner or if I might be taking on too much.

Does anyone have experience with OpenEMS, Fronius inverters, or similar projects and can give me an idea of how much effort this might require?",SwanEquivalent4323,1gwedyy,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gwedyy/how_difficult_is_this_topic_without_prior/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gwedyy/how_difficult_is_this_topic_without_prior/,2024-11-21 11:47:12,2,1.0,2,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gwedyy

I’ve recently dipped my toe into learning to code and to keep me interested I thought I’d make a few websites for fun, family and peers etc.
Am I better off (asin will get more education out of the process) by creating my own raw website from typing my own HTML, Java script etc rather than using the likes of wix, Wordpress, square space. Having never used any of these I’m not sure if they take away the coding experience completely of making a website or they just provide a library of code to pick and paste from.
I was hoping some one who’s tried these out would know more.

learnprogramming,Studying Java and Programming Beyond Class,"I am a first-year undergraduate currently enrolled in Intro to Java. I have been doing well and find it easy due to unconventional experience with computing (Linux experience, running a server, docker, terminal, neovim, git, etc).

I would like to learn skills beyond just my cs course. I'm considering doing something like the Odin Project to learn Fullstack. I haven't fully msatered python because I never had a formal class but I assume I can pick it up easily. I couldn't take the intro to python which usually come before java but I plan to just replace that with a higher level python course. If anyone has recommendations on best way to learn python maybe during winter break or summer that would be great.

Next semester I am taking Data Structures and Discrete. I plan to work on a few web projects like personal website and a blog to complete by May.

I'm just looking for ways I can study CS beyond class. Maybe additional java work to go alongside my class. I saw MOOC but starting from the beginning would be redundant.

I have been able to do Leetcode easy and a few mediums though my understanding of DSA is low and I often use brute force methods.

Would my time best be spent on just getting started with Data Structures and Leetcode or learning full stack or another language.

My current goal is to get a first-year internship / fellowship opportunities. I'm not sure if this is going to happen because I have already sent out applications to most programs and have yet to hear back. But in the meanwhile I should keep working to get the skills to reach SWE roles etc.

learnprogramming,Pair programming for “small” projects ,"I’m wondering what other companies handle developers working in pairs or as a team on “small” projects. For example say we have a project to send a medical claims file to a vendor on a daily basis. Typically we have 1 developer work with a business analyst and they meet weekly with a 3rd party vendor.  These projects usually last a month or two before implementation. The developer will work alone and create files for testing. If the developer was on pto and we needed an emergency change we can check out the code, work with a BA, and make a small change. 

I’m being asked if we could have a back up. This would mean having 2 developers go to the meetings etc. which one would take point and what would the 2nd one do? Is it worth having a 2nd person go to all the meetings by yet not really do any coding? 


How do other companies handle this? We don’t deliver software to anyone. We just do data exports. The program would typically be scheduled or be ran by an operator.

Is there an algorithm to find the minimum number of letter-pair swaps to get from the start list to the target list?

I have read about cycle decompsition, where you iterate through the list indices to find cycles of that swap the paired letters in the fewest moves.

The way I have tried gives a solution with 14 swaps, but I don't think is optimal &amp; suspect this has to do with the duplication of some elements of the list.

Any ideas?

learnprogramming,Dynamically changing machine code list size,"Hi all,

Tricky question about a a project in machine code, effectively Assembly code without labels. We are trying to find the length of a list that will change each time. The problem is, without labels, we can't change the PC offset dynamically to step back the correct amount in the memory to start iterating through the list. I'll provide the code below:

0011 0000 0000 0000 ; Starting memory location
0000 0000 0100 0011 ; List items, also below
0000 0000 0110 1110
0000 0000 0110 1011
0000 0000 0110 1101
0000 0000 0100 1111
0000 0000 0101 1110
0000 0000 0110 0011
0000 0000 0000 0000
 
1110011111110111  ; LEA R3, #-10
0101010010100000  ; AND R2, R2, #0
 
0110001011000000  ; LDR, R1, R3, #0
0000010000000110  ; BRz, #-7
0001001001000010  ; ADD R1, R1, R2
0001000001100000  ; ADD R0, R1, #0
1111000000100001  ; OUT
0001010010100001  ; ADD R2, R2, #1
0001011011100001  ; ADD R3, R3, #1
0000101111111000  ; BRnp #-8
 
1111000000100101  ; Halt

This code should take a list and:
-Initialize index to zero
For each data value:
  -Add index to the value
  -Output the resulting sum as an ASCII character
  -Increment index
  -Repeat for the next data value until the terminating value is reached
  -Halt the program

This works, the problem is, on the line ""BRz #-7"" we need the #-7 to change dynamically based on the size of the list initally loaded in.

learnprogramming,Can't compare tuples in 'if statement',"Hi all, 

I am writing a simple game in Python using the turtle library. 

I want things to happen when a turtle I set to move randomly comes into contact with the turtle the player can manually control. 

I was hoping to compare positions and say things like: 

""if difference between x values is less than \[amount\] and difference between y values is less than \[amount\]: 

then thing will happen.""

The problem is turtle.pos() spits out a tuple (0.0, 0.0), so I can't directly compare them to find the difference. When I write this line of code: 

difference = dragon.pos() - enemy.pos()

Error

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for Sub: 'tuple' and 'tuple' on line 44 in [main.py](http://main.py)

What is the best way to unpack the tuple so it can be compared? I tried using square bracket indexing to little avail.

I think I have a pretty good understanding of them, but I had a question on constructors. My professor exposed me to two different ways to write them, and I wanted to ask which one is better to use in a professional setting.

Note that these constructors correspond to the following class Box:

    class Box
    {
    private:
        int length;
        int width;
        int height;
    public:
        Box();
    };

The two ways we could write the constructor were

Option 1:

    Box::Box()
    : length(1), width(1), height(1)
    {}

Option 2:

    Box::Box()
    {
        length = 1;
        width = 1;
        height = 1;

I wanted to write a program which will take the current date and the deadline dates from the user and return the time left till the deadline in the format of days, months and years. I only know C and that too not very well, I am sure there is an other programming language that does it better but I tried it anyways. I am a beginner so forgive if I show incompetency and poor code management.

Some obstacles that I came across are 

1. C does not support string (natively, I know there are some libraries that can enable the usage of strings but I am not knowledgeable enough)

2. The leap year was an issue as sometimes February is 28 and other times it is 29, some months have only 30 days and other have 31 days

3. I cannot simply subtract deadline date and the current date

4. I had to either convert the whole data into days rather than months and years and then convert into months and years

learnprogramming,Help optimizing a search,"I'm almost done building my icosahedron lamp from 3D prints and diffuser sheets. My plan is to run LED strips along all 30 edges of the lamp. I bought a kit that has a controller with two connectors to run 2 different strips. The connectors are just long enough that I can start the strips at adjacent vertices. I'm looking for a path to traverse all 30 edges with minimal overlap.

I have proven mathematically that you cannot do better than 35 edges traversals (including both starting and ending vertices, there are 36 nodes on this path). I also proved experimentally that such a path exists.

However, in the paths I was able to generate by hand through mostly guess and check, the median edge was always one of those that had not beed overlapped. If I can find a path which does overlap the median edge, I can place the controller on that edge and start the two strips running in opposite directions on the path, one strip taking the first 17 edges, and the other taking the last 17 edges. This seems to me to be the optimal solution.

I wrote some code to try all 5^(35) possible branches at each vertex. Of course, that may take until the heat death of the universe, so I tried optimizing it a bit. [Here's my attempt so far.](https://github.com/DimoniumAnonimo/icosahedron_traverse.git) it's not much, I've just pruned any choices that lead to more than 3 visits of a vertex or 2 visits of an edge. I ran it overnight and I think managed to check 100 Billion paths, but I have no idea what the actual sample space looks like. How efficiently I have pruned the tree, or how long it will take to search the rest. I'm not 100% sure such a path exists, but I don't see why it wouldn't. 5 edges have to be visited twice, I just want the 18th edge to be one of them.

learnprogramming,Asking for advices with proposed system architecture. Thank you. ,"So I'm in the phase where am still thinking about how I would place the things for my app, and before starting I would like to here opinions from people who maybe have more experience in this stuff. I'm not expirienced at putting complex systems together, but I hope that I will gain that expirence in future. 

The project idea is this:

Build the IoT device, which will send some small data package every second (gps) and some other data at some longer intervals (1min, 10min, 1h).
For startes I hope that we will build a around 100 of those devices, but we still want Make platform support devices expansion in future. Every device is unique frok perspective of our system.

The idea of app is to show real time gps data for every single device (user will chose which one to view) and also other real time data. Also there will be history of all real time data recorded for every single device. 

Basically like meteorological station that constantly moves. 


This is how I planned to put the app, don't mind if I made some crucial mistake, I'm still learning, please. 

1. Device will connect to some mqqt broker.
2. That broker I will connect to some queue like Kafka or Rabbit
3. Then I will build a service which will get the the real time data from Kafka and put it in some fast cache db like redis.
4. Parallely I will make service that will sample data from the redis to sql (so if I get gps data every 1s I will sample it into slq every 30s for example, for purpose of saving disk space) this data from sql will be used as a history of real time data.
5. Then I will build service for reading the real time data from redis and history data from sql
6. Im planning to use some mixed hybrid rendering of the frontend. Like maybe the static data rendered on the server, but gps tracking and things like that renderd on the client side. 

This is like the most basic concept of work. I'm still not familiar with the all technologies, but from this project I'm planning to dive deep in it.

My idea is to host everything on the Railway. Since I'm not too familiar with the AWS or other. 

I'm open to any comments and thoughts on this.
I will really appreciate it if someone can lean me in some directions for learning better practices or discovering some other usable knowledge that a was not aware of. 

Thank you.

Edit:

Also I'm wondering is there anyone who would like to mentor me sometimes, while developing this? Not like constant but maybe a nice person whom I could send email sometimes?

learnprogramming,Help With my Zig Code,"Hello!

I'm currently writing a vim clone using ncurses + zig, and it's a garbled mess so far. I'm currently with an issue of strings not highlighting as green or otherwise, and my line printing function is too messy for me to change anything. I spent the last few hours rewriting it to no avail.

If anyone has the time to take a look at src/curses.zig, I would be forever in you debt. Even if it's just to point me in the right direction. Just lost hours of sleep with this lol

learnprogramming,"""How do I resolve multiple vulnerabilities in my React project (PostCSS, nth-check, etc.)? I'm new to this and could use some help!""

","Hi everyone, I'm pretty new to working with React and managing dependencies, and I could really use some guidance on how to fix some vulnerabilities that have popped up in my project. When I run `npm audit`, I get the following vulnerabilities:

1. **nth-check &lt;2.0.1**
   * High severity: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in `nth-check`.
   * It's used by u/svgr`/webpack`, which is part of `react-scripts`.
2. **PostCSS &lt;8.4.31**
   * Moderate severity: PostCSS line return parsing error.
   * It's used by `resolve-url-loader`, which is also part of `react-scripts`.

# What I've Tried So Far:

* I ran `npm audit fix`, but the issues persist.
* I also tried `npm audit fix --force`, but it suggests installing `react-scripts@3.0.1`, which seems like a breaking change.
* I have tried looking for posts on stack overflow but im not making any progress.

# Questions:

* Is updating `react-scripts` to version 3.0.1 a safe solution, or will it cause more issues due to the breaking changes?
* Should I try to manually update the vulnerable packages like `nth-check` and `postcss`? If so, how do I go about it without breaking other dependencies?
* Am I missing something crucial when using `npm audit fix --force`? I have tried this and do understand that I shouldnt use this tool haphazardly.
* Any advice on how to handle these vulnerabilities without causing other issues in my project would be greatly appreciated!

I have tried to look for dependancy mismatches using npx expo doctor,  npx expo install --check and asking chat gpt.

1. I review the PR for ux questions.
2. They update the code
3. I do a code review.

During that first review, I don't want to tie my review comments to any specific line of code, but I still want to leave these comments in a review so that the author can respond to each comment directly and resolve them.

I'm not sure how to do this. Instead, I end up just leaving conversation comments. But this doesn't let the user respond to each comment in place. Instead, their responses are just appended to the end of the conversation.

How can I enable this review process?

learnprogramming,Options for simply reading a Tweet with VB.NET?,"I have an IRC bot made from scratch in [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) for a couple channels I run on Rizon. One of its functions is to read links whenever they're posted, and follow-up with relevant info in chat - either to save people a click, or just provide more details.

For generic links, it'll just write the page's title. But for things like social media posts, it'll write the post's title, message, author, # of likes, etc. Generally, I either use an API (like YouTube) or will just download the page's source, and use RegEx to find whatever I'm looking for.

***

With Twitter/X, originally I used the Twitter API to get a post's contents, but reading Tweets has since become a paid feature. After that, I'd open the Tweet with [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances) (an alternate frontend meant to provide better performance &amp; simplicity) then RegEx the relevant info from the page's source.

Unfortunately, Nitter's since become very unreliable ([list of Nitter instances](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances)) as it relied on a Twitter feature that no longer exists (guest accounts, I think?). It was expected to die off completely at first, but somehow there's still a working instance here and there. But it's not consistent enough to be reliable, and some of them perform browser checks to make bot use impractical.

Currently I still have the bot using Nitter which fails most of the time. It's time to try something else.

learnprogramming,Did I ruin it for myself?,"I’m fairly new to programming. I’ve been learning quite a bit for the past bit. Learncpp.com is an amazing website along with thecherno YT channel. Anyways, I wanted to fuel my passion with putting a bit of my skills to the test. I wanted to make a simple calculator. In the end I did a simple one where you could do the addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of equations containing two or more numbers. Now, what I had built could only handle one operation at a time. I.e. if you had to add five numbers then it’ll add them all up but if you need to multiply and add then it can’t. I wanted to attempt to do that (it is beyond my expertise) but as all programmers do I hit some snags and walls. I have a stupid habit of “looking up the answer” in a way to put it. I’ve been working on it for the past couple hours and just looked up “C++ calculator make”. Something like that in google. There I saw the google AI’s code and I looked at it and understood some of it. I felt stupid for doing so and it kinda made me feel like shit. I don’t like what I did and that I understood some of what the AI did. There were concepts there I looked up and were things I haven’t touched on yet but it all seemed like it was the perfect thing for what I had wanted to do.

My question is: Did I ruin it for myself?
Should I continue making it or continue on with the lessons and find another small thing to do? I just hated how I caved in like a fool. I know asking for help is good but this was beyond. I love coding and programming but idk why I did that. If y’all have any advice for not being an idiot like that then that’ll be appreciated too.

learnprogramming,[Selenium] How to Automate Forms across Websites with Different Selectors,"I'm working on a project that will grab a list of URLs from an Excel document to automatically fill out contact page forms.

I have had some success using `driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""label[contains(., ""field"")]"")` but this varies wildly from website to website as some lack a label, the text box either precedes or follows the label, or just a different in label name.

My current code to find text boxes and enter information is:

        try:
            Select_Box_Name = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//label[contains(.,'Your Name')]/following-sibling::div[1]/input"")
            Select_Box_Name.click()

            Select_Box_Name.send_keys(FullName)

            print(""Invalid"")

While I could enter a try/except statement for each edge case, this seems unoptimized and difficult to manage as I go through 200+ websites to enter this information.

I would ideally like to bundle each variation under a singular try/except statement that would output the appropriate response. Something like this (just an example, I know this is not correct syntax):

    if driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//label[contains(.,'Your Name')]/following-sibling::div[1]/input"") OR 
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//label[contains(.,'Full Name')]/following-sibling::div[1]/input"") OR

learnprogramming,[C++] Data oriented design - Preparing data for cache friendly iteration vs direct modification,"Hello, 

in Mike Actons talks [here](https://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc?t=4069&amp;si=eTm7cXjs8Mfkam9f) and [here](https://youtu.be/u8B3j8rqYMw?t=1271&amp;si=ck1PTfqrukFtrllI) as well as in [this](https://hellocplusplus.com/data-oriented-design/) blog post (search for the ""PrepareTranslations"" function) they prepare/precondition/prefetch/query needed, non-contiguous data first to then iterate them / do calculations in a cache friendly way.

My question is: in order to prepare the data in such a way, one has to access the data anyway (and _also_ copy it), so I wonder even if the data is more cache friendly _afterwards_, wouldn't it be more efficient to modify the data directly and spare the preparing step? 

As far as I understand it, obviously calculations are _then_ very efficient on the prepared data, but with the _additional_ cost of preparing them in the first place.

Can anyone tell me what I am missing here? Does one take the extra cost to gain other benefits (like clearer code etc.) or is it actually more efficient than direct modification?

learnprogramming,Very interested in C but wondering if I should start with something higher level to learn basics first?,"So I have read alot these last few days as I research how to begin teaching myself (or at least self-guided) development and computer science concepts as a ripe ol' genXer. I've read ad nauseum to worry less about what language(s) you're starting with and instead focus more on either a) finding a quality resource and/or b) figuring out WHAT you want to use the tech for and learn it's stack/tooling

So what I'm interested in is good ol' C. Why? Well there are a few reasons, some practical some not. From a practical perspective, it is used fairly heavily where I work which means that I have both people I can lean on for help when I'm stuck in the weeds and motivation to keep pushing through some weird shit with the prospect of a potential Jr role since nearly half of our development unit is retiring over the next few years. 

Additionally, in a far less practical pipe-dreamy sort of way, I also have a strong interest to deep dive into Linux. I've been using it a little on an old laptop as a daily driver and to exert total nerdism here, it's an absolute joy to work with. In fact, messing around with Linux was what sparked my interest in tech, programming and exploring options relating to computer science. 

So as a mid 40's boomer with too much free time on his hands could / should I jump straight into learning with C or should I use a friendlier, higher level scripting language to learn the basics with before dawning some armor and getting busy with C and tearing my distro to shreds?

learnprogramming,What do you think about looking for solutions when being stuck?,"So I was doing this exercise at: https://javascript.info/while-for#output-prime-numbers 

And I was stuck probably for 2 hours. I was trying to come up with a solution, and tried to do this: 

let n = prompt(""Insert a number"");
for (let i = 2; i &lt; n; i++){
if ((i % i === 0) || (i % 1 === 0)){
    i = Number(i);
    alert(`${i}`);
}
}


Of course it didn't work. This was the actual solution: 

let n = 10;

nextPrime:
for (let i = 2; i &lt;= n; i++) { // for each i...

  for (let j = 2; j &lt; i; j++) { // look for a divisor..
    if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime; // not a prime, go next i
  }

  alert( i ); // a prime
}

I felt pretty stupid and frustrated while thinking about the solution. I tried to look for ways to figure out when a number is prime, but couldn't do it. At the end I gave up and looked at the solution.
 

I analyzed the solution and took notes of it: 

"" In this solution, two loops are needed. The first loop iterates from the starting value to n, checking each number (i) to determine if it is prime. The second loop checks for a divisor, iterating through a new variable j from 2 up to i - 1 (basically, j &lt; i, iterating through all values less than i, but excluding i itself). The second loop depends on the variable i from the first loop. We then check if i is divisible by j using the condition if (i % j == 0). In other words, we check if the remainder is 0 when i is divided by j. Since prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves (without a remainder), if this condition is true, it means i is not prime, and the loop breaks, continuing to the next value of i. If the condition is false, meaning i is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, the alert will be triggered, displaying i as a prime number.""

1. Tracks entry and exit dates.
2. Calculates days spent outside the UK.
3. Shows rolling 12-month totals of absences.
4. Highlights if you’ve exceeded a limit, like staying outside a country too long.

learnprogramming,IDE/code editor recommendations that are organized and easy to navigate through.,"No idea if anyone else has had this experience. Want to learn programming and download most popular IDE ( Visual Studio Code). Apparently ""so customizable and useful"" great. Start to program and feel as though the larger any one of my program gets the harder it is to navigate through and edit parts of the code at different ends of the file, for instance, I forget where certain code blocks are and I have to skim read or try to create a geometric image in my head of where everything is stored to be able to find it.

Possible solutions:  
Get used to it. I'm pretty sure the purpose of software is to make the user experience as fluid as possible!  
Write. I like to write on paper when I program (anyone else do this?) as it organises the concepts I am trying to create well in my head so I can put it down effectively, however, I'm looking for a system of TITLING or COLOUR CODING or any other type of organisation that feels personalised and intuitive.  
Get a better IDE. Suggestions please!  
Get a VSC extension. Also open to that.

During my education we have mostly used Java however also know SQL, some C#, a little bit of python, we have also had a boot camp on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

learnprogramming,"React Native (Expo) app, modals no longer visible after updating from 51 to 52","Hi all,

I'm new to React Native iOS development and this seems unlikely to be unique to me. 
When I updated my project from Expo 51 to 52, the modals in the app (listed below) stopped working. 
I changed **nothing** else besides dependencies required to be updated in the Expo update.  

To the mods: There is no way to preview old reddit formatting. If the formatting is broken, please give me a second to fix it before removing the post...

Would greatly appreciate any insights you might have.  

### Minimal reproducible example

This is the public repo:
https://github.com/GitMazzone/workout-tracker

It's very small. The relevant files, to repro for a single modal, are:  
- `components/ExerciseSetList.tsx` to see where the `ExercisePickerModal` is used  
- `components/ExercisePickerModal.tsx` to see the modal itself  
- `app/(tabs)/workout.tsx` to see the page that renders `ExerciseSetList`  
  
Repro steps (from 100% fresh install):  
1. Run the app using `npx expo start`  
2. Click ""Add New Mesocycle""  
3. Click a template, click continue  
4. Click Auto-fill Exercises, click Create Mesocycle  
5. Click that mesocycle's card to land on the workout page  
6. Click an exercise's option menu (3 vertical dots)  
7. Click Replace Exercise  
  
Expected: Opens the `ExercisePickerModal`  
Actual: It sets this modal to visible (know this from console logging in the modal), but the modal is not visible.  Further, if you try clicking the exercise option menu again, you cannot. You can only open other exercises' menus.  

There are no errors, in console or in Simulator.

Full demo video below for clarity.

### What platform(s) does this occur on?

iOS

### Where did you reproduce the issue?

in Expo Go

### Summary

I built this app using Expo 51. I was forced to update to 52 to use Expo Go for testing on my iPhone.  
After updating, several modals do not show when opened:  
- `ExercisePickerModal`  
- `AddCustomExerciseModal`  
- Within `MesoMenu`, the Edit Modal  
  
These all live under `/components`.  
  
It seems that anything but top-level (not nested within anything) modals work after updating.  
If I try opening the menu from the buttons that lead to the buttons to open these modals, they are no longer pressable. I have to close the entire app and reopen to be able to try again.  
  
Demo video of broken modal:  
  
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d358ca8-825a-46ab-94ca-7bcbeb9651e7  
  
In the demo, I go to the `/app/(tabs)/workout` route and see the `ExerciseSetList`.  
I open the first exercise's option menu, triggering `handleMenuPress`.  
I select ""Replace Exercise"".  
If I add logs, I can see the modal's visible prop is true.  
The modal does not appear on the screen.  
  
The _only_ other thing that caused lint errors after updating from 51 --&gt; 52 was type issues on the `buttonRef`. This seems irrelevant to the modal issue, but for sake of transparency this is what I had to change in a few places:  
From this: `const buttonRef = useRef&lt;TouchableOpacity&gt;(null);`  
To this: `const buttonRef = useRef&lt;ElementRef&lt;typeof TouchableOpacity&gt;&gt;(null);`  
  
I'm new to React Native &amp; Expo, so I tried working with ClaudeAI &amp; ChatGPT, and CursorAI, and even with all the project's context and trying dozens of things, nothing is resolving this issue. I've tried:  
- Various attempts at removing animations altogether  
- Adding `requestAnimationFrame` to the modal handlers  
- Removing `presentationStyle={'pagesheet'}` and `presentationStyle` altogether  
- Various combinations of `transparent` and `presentationStyle`  
- Moving the modals &amp; their state management to the root of the Workout route so they're not nested in any view  
- Wrapping the modals in `SafeAreaView`s and providers  
  
Please let me know if I can provide any more context.  
Sorry, I know this isn't a very minimal example, but there doesn't seem to be a great way to provide a shareable sandbox online. Their own sandbox, snack.expo.dev, only offers v51 so far...

learnprogramming,Delphi Intents with Keyence scanners,"Hello,

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this and I apologize for my English, but I'm not a native speaker.

I have a Delphi (XE12 with Firemonkey for Android) app that is running on different Android devices, mostly Zebra and Honeywell.
My application has to read a barcode using the built-in scanner.
Right now I'm using Android intents, because this allows me to reuse my code for both Zebra and Honeywell devices without having to rewrite anything, just changing the action strings.

A client of mine asked me if it's possible to use some Keyence devices they already bought, so I have been searching if I can use the same intents and reuse the code I already have for Keyence devices too.
I've been searching for hours, but I haven't found anything about using intents with Keyence scanners on the web so I'm about to give up the idea of using intents and write a separate module to my application using Keyence official SDK just for Keyence devices.
Does anyone know if it's possible to use intents with Keyence devices? Or am I bound to use their SDK as the only possible way to read the scanned barcode?

learnprogramming,Not sure what to do to improve ,"Hi there, I’ve been studying JS (self learning) for a bit now and most of my learning to do with programming is heavily from projects, they are simple and purely just for me to learn as I find coding exercises and studying the concepts soul draining and enjoy actually programming and learning that way (I still study it of course to get necessary knowledge to even begin building down). 

However the problem I have is that when I’m stuck I know the necessary steps I need to take to solve the issue and in my head logically I can work it out and I don’t freeze and I’m not completely lost. however I just don’t know how to translate this into actual code. 

When I look for the answer I understand what’s happening and can follow the code (most of the time). So I am wondering Is this a lack of experience or a lack of foundational understanding? Because I always end up searching for an answer and then try to implement it myself and in the end I’m wondering have I even learnt anything truly. Not sure if I’m just being stupid here or not 😅

However, I found, very often, I want a piece of data that within my current design the component/object/node don't have access to, and some other times, a lower level effect/action object needs to know a higher global state. Or there will be more things I want to do that my current implementation \*could\* achieve, but in a very ugly way, or I simply don't know how many higher systems I should have and what are their specific responsibilities.

After that it will redirect to the page where I need to get the response form the request `getServices` (one of the latest)

I tried copying the cURL and pasting is to Postman, copying the cookies and all that. But I'm getting a 200 empty response every damn time. I just need to check the `AllowAppointments` boolean property.  
If someone could help me figure out how to replicate the conditions to get a proper response it'd help me a ton!

learnprogramming,Where can people ask for moderately big code reviews? ,"Good day to all,   
  
A part of improving as a developer I believe is to receive constructive criticisms. I understand though that asking people to review your code freely can be a burden as it consume people time. So I was wondering if there were services or sites where I can give a link to a project(github) and ask for code review. I don't think I would mind it being a paid service...

learnprogramming,How to make; if button is pressed make the motor turn three 360 spins?,"Hey, I'm working with a servo motor and I'm wondering how you'd do the programming Sequence stated above. 
It'd would be on two motors, one continuous and one which will only turn 180 and back. 
I'm only asking as I've got quite little time to get it done . 
What I'm thinking of doing is; 
""  #include 

Servo (motors name);

Int pos = 0;

Void setup() {

(Servo name).attach(2);

(Servo name).write(90);

}

Void If() {

(Button name) = True 

(Servo name).write(160);
Delay(1000);

}
Void If() {

(Button name) = False

(Servo name).write(90);
}


I'm mostly wondering if this idea is viable or what I'd need to change. It was so long since I last programmed so I've lost most of my knowledge since then.
(Also, the programming sequence is very heavily inspired by something I found online incase anyone was wondering)

Thanks in advance!

learnprogramming,A beginner confused and lost in tutorial hell {pls read},"So I recently started getting into programming originally to do game development but i had no idea what really went into it, I started learning C++ {as a complete newbie} surprisingly got pretty far in the course i was taking but quickly got lost in the numbers and math when trying to read for loops {idk numbers make my brain extremely confused when trying to understand concepts apparently},   
Went from tutorial to tutorial on Youtube and learncpp among (other things) and finally landed on a reddit post telling people to just go with python or Javascript instead to better grasp fundamentals,   
Well i then went to python after a friend moved me away from a Javascript course i was about to fully invest in on khan academy   
found a 4 hour vid on python from freecodecamp and started learning, The thing was I speedran through it...like everything made sense to me from C++ data-types, variables ""Oh so i dont type int anymore, oh i dont put a ; at the end anymore, etc etc""  things \*seemed\* simpler  
BUT this is where it started going downhill, I thought things were clicking so fast that i didnt need to fully submerge myself into memorization {Yeah I'm dumb} , I then didn't REMEMBER how to type these things   
I knew WHAT to do to make this math calculator work but I could not figure out how to type it in python without religiously staring and copy pasting from a video,   
Now at the end of the video pretty much during classes/objects {new concept to me didn't get that far in C++}   
I'm lost i genuinely cannot read this code and now its just caused extreme burnout for me mentally,

A for loop is needed? I'm accidently putting C++'s version instead of python and when i look at the video showing how to do the for loop...god it looks 10000x more complicated {like way more jumbled together if that even makes sense}   


I'm just burned out, Not mentally wanting to go back and rewatch these things over and over and over  because its...frustrating, I KNOW these concepts i just cant TYPE them out 

I spent WEEKS going from video after video with C++ to get different explanations on these concepts {tutorial hell} copy pasting-copy pasting then after copy pasting enough times it clicked but doing this all over again with python? I went to it for a easier time learning and getting started and now im more mentally exhausted and closer to just giving up,  
I dont want too but self teaching myself these things and having these stupid setbacks because of myself   
really kicks me down 

I need some sort of guidance for this...  
I'm 20 years old dropped out trying to make a career for myself failed miserably and now I'm trying to make a career out of this somehow   
Do i continue with python and just start from the very beginning again {I still think itll get jumbled up with C++}  
Do i try javascript?   
Do i just go back to C++ and just ""T r y "" to make sense of things that i got stuck on before {prob meaning more tutorial hell}  

any help is appreciated and I'm sorry for the huge harry potter book of a post",AzraelVxe,1gux8qe,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gux8qe/a_beginner_confused_and_lost_in_tutorial_hell_pls/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gux8qe/a_beginner_confused_and_lost_in_tutorial_hell_pls/,2024-11-19 13:34:34,2,1.0,2,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gux8qe

So I would like to build a full stack project.

The manager (he manages guard in the buildings) has many buildings, and in each building there are 3 shifts - morning, evening and night.  
After the ""manager"" will save the shifts for the next week, it will generate picture of shifts for each building.  
For each building, there is a Whatsapp group.

Is that possible that after he clicks PUSH, it will push the right image to the right Whatsapp group building?

learnprogramming,First self written programm for solving a real world problem.,"Hi there,

  
i am learning programing for fun at the moment. Ive read some books and have done the cs50x Course. So its fair to say, that i am a beginner in this whole world of programming.

I am at a situation where i want to write a programm by myselfe which is solving a real world problem. At least in my world.

I want to tell you my idea to hear if you think its a programm well suited for a beginner or if you think thats way to hard.

So, i am working at a cinema, where i am responsable for the inventory control. At the moment, i have to track everything by hand. I have to count how many items of x is left so i can decide to order y more of this item. I want to automate this stuff.

  
A program from the company I work for can generate an Excel file that shows me how much of product X was sold during period Y.  
I want to build a program based on this, ideally with its own user interface, that takes this Excel file, reads all the values for all products, and then calculates how much I need to reorder in order to reach a predefined target stock level.  
I would like to write this in Python, as I am most familiar with the language.

What do you think? How complex is this project? Is it achievable for a beginner, or is it still a bit too complex?",Augit579,1guub2q,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1guub2q/first_self_written_programm_for_solving_a_real/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1guub2q/first_self_written_programm_for_solving_a_real/,2024-11-19 10:39:46,1,1.0,1,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1guub2q

I just started programming and am falling in love with it. But due to the ongoing 'AI will take away the jobs of programmers' news, I am losing hope. I was looking forward to build new things and work on the new technologies. 
Is the AI hype real? Will it really replace programmers after a few years?
Should I even look at software engineering as a career?

learnprogramming,LLM APIs and programming for data science - how?,"Hello.

Since i started my physics studies I have started to use a lot of python with numpy, scipy etc and to make my code writing faster I use claudeAI or chatGPT 4.o with canvas.   
Recently I have read lots of comments that using API is faster and better, hence my questions are:  
1. Are using LLM APIs for data science based programming viable?  
2. If it's viable then what's the ""best"" API? OpenAI?  
3. How can I achieve it? Is there some guide?  
4. Some other stuff I should be aware of?

learnprogramming,Coding dreams shape brain in early dev experience,"I wonder how many of you had coding dreams when you started coding.

I remember when I started coding regularly each day, all day long, I had strange abstract dreams about it.  
My inner voice isn't that strong, I usually perceive normal day activities in only key words, not full sentences, or even just in abstract thoughts.  
I think that's why in my coding dreams I saw abstract interfaces in various shapes and inputs had to match that shape in order to be processed. It's strange and it's few years since I had those dreams.

Now my girlfriend started coding and she also has coding dreams.  
I guess when we start coding, it requires different cognitive demand, our brains have to adapt, store our experience in a way it becomes subconscious thinking in strictly logical way.

I didn't hear much of coding dreams before. I knew I experienced it but I wonder how many of you also did and what kind of dreams did you have?",Technical_Ad_6200,1gut7qa,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gut7qa/coding_dreams_shape_brain_in_early_dev_experience/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gut7qa/coding_dreams_shape_brain_in_early_dev_experience/,2024-11-19 09:18:47,2,0.67,2,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gut7qa

learnprogramming,How do I break down problems?,"Recently I just finished my first ever project, basically a simple multi client/server app, its really cool, but now i wanted to move on and accidentally came across this website that visualizes audio with letters as waves, it would change colour and move depending on how the song goes, I thought that was a really cool idea, so I want to remake it. Luckily there is a basic audio visualizer tutorial python on google, I guess it made some sense although I am not very familiar with numpy and pygame but I kinda got the gist of why they were used for. 

That got me thinking though like, I learned that audio is analyzed by grabbing all the frequencies per second and putting it into an array, converting to it to decibel, really interesting stuff, BUT if that website didn't exist I would not have any idea on how to break down audio visualizer to figure it out on my own, I didn't even know what Fast Fourier Transformation was until that website told me what it was. 

I guess my question here is, how do I exactly break problems down so that I can build what I want to build?

learnprogramming,Studying Programming is more fun than actually Programming.,"I've been studying Java for the past five months, primarily using textbooks. Once I felt comfortable with the language, I started working on projects. My first project, a server-client NIO-based application, was an eye-opener. The code was a mess—I could barely tell what called what or what did what, and making changes felt like a guessing game. Strangely, the method names I came up with actually helped a bit.

After that experience, I started studying Design Patterns. I liked the concepts, but I noticed something interesting. When I asked ChatGPT to suggest exercises for practice and compared the code it wrote to mine, the difference was striking. My code was overly bloated with patterns. While it was easy to modify, it wasn’t easy to read. Meanwhile, GPT’s code was simpler, clean, and still easy to change.

I tried over and over to write code that was as elegant as GPT's, but I kept failing. Now, whenever I try to write code on my own, I quickly get frustrated. I’ve found myself in this loop where reading about coding—like APIs, paradigms, and concepts—is far more engaging than actually writing code.

What do you think is the issue, and how can I overcome it?

learnprogramming,I Just Had My First Developer Job Interview – A Bit Overwhelming but Exciting!,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share something that feels huge for me. Today, I had my very first job interview for a developer position, and wow, it was a rollercoaster.

A little about me: I started programming games when I was 13. I’ve always been into programming—it’s been a passion of mine—but for most of my life, I didn’t really pursue it seriously. Instead, I worked in construction. But as the years went by, I realized I wasn’t happy and decided to finally go back to what I’ve loved all along.

Since then, I’ve been teaching myself everything—completely self-taught. No formal education, just a lot of late nights, trial and error, and a deep love for coding. And today, I finally got my first interview.

It was a panel interview with 5 people in a conference room. Talk about nerve-wracking! They asked me about my experience with PHP, using WordPress, building e-newsletters across different versions, and working with APIs. I got stuck on some of the questions, which made me feel a bit discouraged, but overall, I think the interview went well.

That said, I couldn’t help but feel a bit of imposter syndrome creeping in. I don’t have a degree or fancy credentials—just a lot of passion and self-taught skills. I guess I’m just here to vent and say that even though it was scary, I’m proud of myself for taking this step.

For anyone else out there in a similar boat: how do you handle the nerves or the self-doubt? And any advice for navigating interviews like this?

TLDR: my first interview went great.. I think.. I got stuck and confused by a few questions but aside from that I answered everything pretty decently.. just kinda hate feeling like I don’t belong because of my lack of formal education…",DogexOnyx,1guj5mb,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1guj5mb/i_just_had_my_first_developer_job_interview_a_bit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1guj5mb/i_just_had_my_first_developer_job_interview_a_bit/,2024-11-18 23:39:25,108,0.96,108,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1guj5mb
learnprogramming,Finding An IDE I Like,"Hey Reddit,

I code primarily in C++/ Python (have been coding for \~3-4 years now) mostly on Jetbrains but with a bit of VSC here and there.

**JetBrains (PyCharm, CLion, etc.)**

• **Pros:** I love the power JetBrains IDEs offer. The debugging tools, Git extensions, and other smaller features (like automatic code reformatting) are a game-changer for me. They save so much time.

• **Cons:**

1. It’s very language-specific. If I switch to something less mainstream, I feel like I have to move to another IDE entirely.

2. Coding over SSH is not as seamless as I’d like. I often code on a server, and JetBrains makes that workflow clunky.

4. The UI is just… cluttered. It’s not ugly, but it feels overwhelming. Sometimes I wish for a simpler, more minimalist interface.



[**Zed.dev**](http://Zed.dev)

• **Pros:** This is such a breath of fresh air. The minimalist design is stunning, and it’s a joy to use. Everything feels clean, fast, and efficient.

• **Cons:**

1. It lacks some of the “nice-to-haves” I’ve grown to rely on in JetBrains, like automated code reformatting.

2. No built-in Git client! This is probably my biggest pain point. I love having Git baked into my IDE, and Zed makes me feel like I’m missing a crucial part of my workflow.



**Neovim**

• **Pros:** The idea of coding entirely in the terminal is super appealing to me. I respect how customizable and powerful Neovim is, and the speed is unmatched.

• **Cons:** I just haven’t gotten into the habit of using it. The keyboard shortcuts still trip me up, and there’s definitely a learning curve. It feels like I need to invest a lot of time before I can be productive.



**What I’m Looking For**

I’m torn between functionality and simplicity. I love the clean aesthetic of something like Zed, but I can’t let go of the productivity boosts JetBrains gives me. I’d also love something that’s lightweight but powerful, supports multiple languages well, and makes coding over SSH seamless.

What IDEs or setups do you use, and why? Is there an IDE out there that strikes a good balance between minimalism and features? Or do I just need to suck it up and fully commit to mastering Neovim?

learnprogramming,How to Generate Optimal Furniture Layouts for an Apartment?,"Hello everyone

I’m looking to generate all possible furniture arrangements for an apartment. The input data includes the apartment’s dimensions, room layouts, furniture types, and rules for placement. The output would be a set of valid layouts.

The idea is to use specific placement rules to generate all possible configurations. There could be billions of potential layouts, so I need a way to rank or filter them using these rules and constraints.

One straightforward approach is to iterate through all possible combinations with a certain step size for moving the furniture. However, I feel this solution is far from optimal.

Could anyone suggest directions to explore? Are there any algorithms for combinatorial generation or mathematical models that could help? I’ve heard about Google’s OR-Tools but I'm not sure if it’s suitable for this task.

learnprogramming,Could someone evaluate and suggest where I should go next?,"Hi! So I studied computing at college (UK) 8 years ago, since then I've pretty much forgotten all of it (if you don't use it you lose it it seemed to be for me) and lately I've decided I want to get back into it and learn it. At some point I'd like to maybe create a web app or make an indie game (as one of many passion projects), that sorta thing.

  
I started trying to learn around a year ago that of which I began with Python, honestly I have issues with my attention and even though I began around a year ago, my progression was definitely not a 'years worthy' I don't think.. Anyway, so I started with Python and read around 80 pages of a 300 page book and admittedly didn't do too much and my code also wasn't that deep / complicated either.. the odd calculator via terminal here and there as well as other various small applications just testing / working with data types and formatting them together (i know there is a word for it haha). Again, I know it's not much but also I feel like from my experience years back at college, I seemed to have a decent grasp of things and also I could somewhat ever so slightly have an understanding if I would read certain bits of code as well (like, I could tell atleast that there we have variables being assigned, here in the code, logic is simply being used, if statements are being used here, for statements etc).. So anyway.

  
I'm a design engineer for an engineering company and I've been tasked with creating an engineering calculator, for calculating capacities with volumes etc, nice! For this, I'm using a new language, Visual Basic as I can easily produce a form with it (I was instructed to use VB anyway) and again, like before a lot of it is simple logic being used here as well as simple for statements and if statements basically.. I'm actually really happy that I've been able to do this in all honesty, this is exactly why I've wanted to learn programming, to be able to use a computer how I'd like :D but alas, this is pretty much where I am currently at now and I was wondering where should I move next? I also have a slight understanding of HTML and CSS but that could be improved but anyway, what do you think of my knowledge base currently? A big problem I have is whenever I sign up for a new course to begin learning programming I find I get so bored as I'm already listening to a lot of stuff I already know if that makes sense.. 

  
I'd love to maybe learn javascript or even possibly even React but I had a go at setting up React last night and it took me 4 hours to finally make even the slightest bit of progress I thought that maybe I need to spend a bit more time just learning more languages overall and actually get a decent understanding of working with the IDE's before I start setting up an 'environment' I don't have have close of a clue upon yet.. 

I don't really have much experience working or using classes / objects yet, that's the problem with this calculator apps I've been making is.. it's mainly all logic I work with / use in it..

  
Thanks for reading this and please tell me your opinions on where I am and how I could move forwards!

learnprogramming,"Trying to figure out what onupdate=""CASCADE"" does in SQLAlchemy","I've been working on a project where the backend is FastAPI and SQLite (using SQLAlchemy). Two of my tables are:

    # All attributes for users of the website
    class User(Base):
        __tablename__ = ""users""
    
        userID = Column(String, primary_key=True, index=True)
        email = Column(String, nullable=False)
        password_hashed = Column(String, nullable=False)
    
        products = relationship(""Product"", cascade='all,delete', backref='seller')
    
    # All attributes for products on the website
    class Product(Base):
        __tablename__ = ""products""
    
        productID = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True) 
        # Product attributes such as name, description, price, etc.
    
        userID = Column(String, ForeignKey('users.userID', ondelete='CASCADE', onupdate='CASCADE'))

(I believe ondelete='CASCADE' can be removed, I originally had that before I added cascade='all,delete' in relationship because ondelete only deleted the userID foreign key, and I needed the whole product deleted). This is my first time using SQLAlchemy and I mostly understand everything, but I'm still not sure what onupdate='CASCADE' does. Because I have a functionality where a user can update their userID and/or email:

    async def update_user(db: Session, oldUserID: str, newUserID: str, newEmail: str):
        existing_user = get_user_by_id(db, oldUserID)
        # Update email
        existing_user.email = newEmail
        # Update userID
        for product in get_user_products(db, oldUserID):
            product.userID = newUserID
        existing_user.userID = newUserID
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(existing_user)
        return existing_user

Without the for loop, the user's products are not updated to match the new userID (I checked the database). I'm a bit confused on what onupdate='CASCADE' is supposed to do because I thought it would update the foreign key when changed in the other table. I've searched for answers but I get stuff like this:

""It is applied as part of a foreign key constraint definition in the child table, ensuring that if the parent table's key is updated, all corresponding foreign keys in the child table are automatically updated.""

This seems to suggest that the userID in products should be updated, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.",Jumpy_Employment_439,1gubphr,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gubphr/trying_to_figure_out_what_onupdatecascade_does_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gubphr/trying_to_figure_out_what_onupdatecascade_does_in/,2024-11-18 18:28:56,3,1.0,3,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gubphr

learnprogramming,How can I build a software dev portfolio while on a master's degree?,"Hello everyone! I graduated a month ago in biomedical engineering and I'm pursuing a master's right now. This might seem unrelated, however where I'm from (Italy) the biomedical field is extremely oriented towards software development (especially Python), so I've come to terms with the fact that I'll probably become a software developer in disguise, it's actually very common for people with this degree to land a job in software development here.

Not that I mind though, CS and programming have always been an interest of mine so I've had plenty of experience developing projects and whatnot for fun. I was thinking of coming up with a portfolio while I deal with my masters so that I have projects to show off however I don't know where to start. I have some old tiny projects that I could put up on GitHub but they're not exactly related to my field so I don't know whether it's a good idea or not, for example a couple of years ago I made a Spotify clone in Python (Django, I'm in the process of learning FastAPI right now), for my bachelor's thesis I had to develop a web application that based on patient data would detect the most likely illnesses and suggest a treatment for each, while also providing personalized help through an LLM trained on medical data once a treatment got approved (the result was about as good as you'd expect, tons of hallucinations :D).

I was wondering if recruiters actually look at these kinds of projects even if they're not exactly related to my field. Of course I'd make sure to go back and rewrite them where the code is messy and get rid of any sort of garbage/spaghetti code.

Also, just to get this out of the way, the reason why I've used Django and I'm learning FastAPI is pure personal interest. I'm well aware that they have little to no use in this field.

learnprogramming,Error saving fields in modal (Model/View/Controller),"**EDIT: 21-11-2024. I found what is possibly the solution, the one that caused the error was the DOM element new\_status, which was not controlled by the old developers that editing a document without states (I was testing with a document without states) left its value as an empty string, which meant that all the other fields could not be updated. I am waiting for a colleague to test the entire grading system and confirm that it works correctly. If not, I will reformulate the question focused on the error that could be caused. I thank everyone who has answered and tried to help me or direct my approach. to find the error, thank you very much everyone.**

Hello, everyone! It's my first time here!

I am adding to the file preview part of my web application (which is in a modal) the option to add notes/annotations to the document, the problem is that I keep getting the error:

&gt;search:5309 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value') at saveChangess (search:5309:65) at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (search:2722:106)

This error occurs in the line: `""new_status"": document.getElementById('status_file_' + id).value,` and if I comment that line then the same error occurs in: `""notes"": document.getElementById(notes).value`

My code is based on view model, controller model, I attach the related codes:

# Home.php

Contains the field html and the save changes function script. The modal loads the document data using the values ​​returned by the `$results` function.

learnprogramming,Sharing a small win!,"Wanted to do my first todolist app. Only knew HTML,CSS, and some basic JS.

Attempt 1: Total mess, no plan, didn't touch js, used a lot of AI. I walked away defeated and contemplating quitting

Attempt 2: Did the first 2 weeks of CS50, and learned a bit more about coding and how to problem solve, CS50 is amazing btw, jumped the gun, decided to use React, didn't understand anything. Again, I walked away defeated and contemplating quitting

Then in my defeat, I did a bit more CS50 and watched this [amazing video by BigBoxSWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqqmwRXSvrw&amp;ab_channel=bigboxSWE), he talked about defining a clear goal, something that was covered in CS50 as well. So using the amazing problem solving skills I learned, Attempt 3 is up to a great start!  

I set a clear goal, which is to have a place to write the text and a button to mark it as complete. Figured out the code and finally did it, and felt that euphoria so many people talk about. I am hooked, kinda wanna stay up for hours now working on it, but I need to sleep.

I was never into coding or into computers in my school days but post pandemic around 2020 end, I picked up courses to do and one of them was harvard's cs50 (computer science introduction course). Fast forward, I have been picking coding courses and learning to code in C and Python mainly. I did complete my cs50 and cs50 python, which felt good at the time but to be honest, as I move forward to specialise in a field like AI, I find myself blank or completely demotivated.

I have to admit the fact that even though I have been coding for a long time, I haven't been consistent, Yes I have a full time job and I have a degree to complete, but I always found time for self studying.

learnprogramming,Is there a way to ping a Location using a QR code?,"So my friend is working on a Dog Tracker app. Initially, we tried having a GPS device but we couldn't make it work - mainly because we don't know how to work on it and having a device just seems harder.

His teacher just told him that he need to make the tracking part work to pass. So it got me thinking if instead of real-time tracking, why not just have a qr code scanned by a phone that shows the most recent place where the code was scanned.

Might not be able to see where your pet goes to but you could at least find out where your pet ends up in(alive hopefully).. in case somebody scans the qr code..

learnprogramming,Static analysis of algorithms (university lecture thesis I don't get),"My first lecture in algorithms apart from defining what it is,their groups of classification is also mentioning errors in algorithms and algorithms **verification**.

It is said that there is two types of **algorithms verification**:    **static verification** and **dynamic verification**.



***""Static verification, which involves analyzing the source code of the program, often using formal methods and mathematical techniques.""***

  
""Static verification ensures that the code is correctly written and that preconditions and postconditions function properly. Static verification is performed by analyzing the code without execution. In this case, we can check:

1. **Syntactic errors**: We check whether all steps are correctly written and whether functions are correctly called.
2. **Preconditions and postconditions**: We check whether the definitions of preconditions and postconditions are consistently applied. For example, we can analyze whether the condition for the water temperature is correctly implemented.
3. **Invariant properties**: We ensure that conditions that must remain constant during execution (e.g., the amount of tea must not be negative) are valid.""

","I’m currently ploughing my way through a conversion masters, I previously studied some many moons ago in Communications (film &amp; media). After graduating I fell into the 9-5 trap, and didn’t feel I could pursue my creative ambitions. 10 years on and years of non-transferable tech roles for SaaS start ups, I decided I wanted to be on the other side of the software I was supporting. 

I did have some experience with front-end and thought I’d go headfirst into CS degree. It a learning curve I didn’t quite expect, the pace is immense and I certainly should have done much more prep. 

I wanted to go into full-stack web dev upon completion, though with the rate in which I’m managing to understand OOP (Java), I’m losing a lot of hope. Databases I’ve certainly taken a liking to, and of course there’s so much more I’m learning - both practically and academically. 

But all in all, I’m struggling. I can’t even fathom how peers are applying for jobs right now. 

I hope everything slots into place. All the modules will of course give me an insight into CS, but a job worthy insight? Nope. 

I don’t want to have the same result - graduate, fall into a job out of necessity and game over.

Any recommendations for stacks I could really hone in on once I graduate? I don’t want to be churning out just easy on the eyes, I want to understand and produce scalable web application. But I don’t have all the time in the world to do this.

Here is my code:  
Types used:

    import { Props } from ""./index.types"";
    
    import ""./index.css"";
    
    const NavLink = ({ text, icon, selected, path }: Props) =&gt; {
      return (
        &lt;li

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
      );
    };
    
    export default NavLink;

The mock:

    import { Props } from ""../index.types"";
    
    const NavLink = jest.fn((props: Props) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;NavLink&lt;/div&gt;);
    
    export default NavLink;

The component where the mocked component is used:

      it(""Should render items"", () =&gt; {
        const items: ListItemData[] = [

However, after looking at the curriculum it doesn’t offer any front end languages. Only C, C++, C#, Java, and Java ee. I know i can learn html,  css, python and javascript on my own time, but it’s a little weird to me that they don’t offer those. 

The other option is a certification 
in computer programming, but yet again it’s only C languages, Java, and visual.net and you don’t even learn all of them,  you pick ONE to specialize in for 10 months. 

This brings us to our last option, the fscj full stack coding bootcamp. It teaches Javascript, python, css, html, sql, bootstrap,vue.js and some design elements. Since it teaches more front end aka what i really want to specialize in, this is the one im leaning the most towards. However people in the field seem to dislike bootcamps and say they don’t equip you with proper knowledge and make it hard to get a job. 

Coding has now crept its way into special interest territory, so normally i would be totally cool spending 4 years getting a bachelors and learning everything i need to know. However I’m 20 and have a not so great home life so my goal is to move out within 4 years. I want to figure out which course of action will help me get a job within 5 months of finishing the course/degree,  give me actual knowledge on the subject of computer programming,  and give me the tools i need to build a portfolio. I know people say a lot of what they teach in traditional college courses is outdated,  so i don’t want to spend 10k to have to spend another 5k on a bootcamp after college. 

I know this is long so thanks to anyone who reads and gives advice.

learnprogramming,Should I continue pursuing programming?," I'm not sure if I should continue pursuing this degree. I know this question gets asked a lot, but here it goes. I've always been good with computers, and people often tell me to go into CS, but  I'm pursuing it because my interests really lie in game development. I know that's a skill I can learn without taking a university course, but I find that having someone teach me and answer my questions in person makes learning so much easier.

I've enrolled in a programming fundamentals course this semester, and I've been struggling constantly. I think my teacher is great, but I just can't seem to get the hang of it. I try to ask as many questions as I can, but I'm having trouble finishing my assignments because I get stuck so often. I've been watching videos and practicing on CodingBat, but I just can't solve most of the problems there. I think I understand the concepts, but applying them is the hard part—not to mention the problem-solving aspect.

I get good grades on the multiple-choice parts of the tests, but I can't seem to solve the coding sections. It's also getting hard to invest all my time because I work a job five days a week right after my classes, so it's difficult to start side projects while ensuring I don't fall behind on my assignments.

Is it still worth pursuing coding? When everything goes right, it feels so satisfying, but when I'm stuck or confused, it feels terrible. It has really high highs and super low lows.

learnprogramming,How do sites deal with the rotation of intermediate certificates?,"I've been reading up on the certificate chain of trust and I understanding the logic of signatures and the chain of trust, but some of the finer details in implementation I'm lost on. More specifically, I'm not 100% sure on the way that certificate rotations/renewals are handled.

&amp;nbsp;



My understanding is that websites send you the entire chain of certificates (excluding the root certificate, as it gets ignored by the browser/OS) when performing the TLS handshake. Using the Subject Line and Public Key, the browser can verify up the chain of certificates until it reaches a root certificate and it checks if that root certificate is in its trust store.

&amp;nbsp;


What happens when an intermediate certificate or root certificate is rotated? Assuming the webserver uses something like `certbot renew` to periodically renew its certificates, does `certbot` renew the entire chain and store a new list of certificates on the server? 

&amp;nbsp;

Is it possible for one run of `certbot renew` to renew the intermediate certificate but then not renew the end-entity certificate? For example, let's say the end-entity certificate is scheduled to renew in 7 days and the intermediate is scheduled to renew in 10 days, and the cronjob running `certbot renew` runs every 12 hours. Then on day 10, the intermediate is renewed but the end-entity was renewed 3 days ago using the old certificate so the chain is broken until day 14?

&amp;nbsp;

The main reason I'm asking this is because I am building a small toy project where I deploy Vault to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on a Raspberry Pi cluster I have at home. To set up the certificates required for the Vault cluster, I'm using `cert-manager`. I have a K8s configuration file that sets up a self-signed certificate that auto-rotates every 75 days (expires in 90 days) and a certificate signed by the self-signed certificate that rotates every 15 days (expires in 30 days). Just to see what would happen when I rotate the self-signed certificate, I ran `cmctl renew`, but I noticed that the certificate signed by the self-signed certificate was not also renewed.",Luclid,1gteknd,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gteknd/how_do_sites_deal_with_the_rotation_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gteknd/how_do_sites_deal_with_the_rotation_of/,2024-11-17 14:21:24,1,0.57,1,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Topic,,t3_1gteknd
learnprogramming,Improving as a senior developer: Are Competitive Programming Platforms Worth It?,"Hello!



I am a full-stack developer with a strong passion for front-end development, and I have 10 years of experience.



I've never been particularly skilled at solving algorithm-based problems, and throughout my 10-year career, I've rarely needed to.



However, I feel like my programming skills have stagnated a bit, so I’m wondering if solving problems on platforms like Codingame and Leetcode would help me become a better developer, even though I’ve rarely had to deal with such problems in my job.



I’ve read many posts on Reddit about this topic, and the general consensus seems to be: solving problems on Competitive Programming platforms can help you pass interviews at big tech companies, but it won’t make you a better developer.



**I can believe that**, yet I’ve noticed a few things throughout my career **that contradict this trend**:

* Among all the developers I’ve met, those who were skilled at Competitive Programming were also very good developers.
* Among all the people I’ve met in the tech field, the smartest ones (in my opinion) were always able to quickly solve logic problems similar to those found on LeetCode and other Competitve Programming platforms.



**My question is**: as a senior developper, if I want to become a better developer, will I be wasting my time solving problems on these platforms?  

If you think it would indeed be a waste of time, what would you recommend instead?

What else should I do/learn in the meantime ? Any tips suggestions ?

learnprogramming,"In Wordpress, what does a ""author-d..."" class name indicate?","I'm trying to figure out how a Wordpress site works and I'm looking at one particular Wordpress site. 

I'm looking at one of its HTML files and I noticed there is a &lt;span&gt; tag with a really long value in its class attribute. It's something like:

    &lt;span class="" author-d-2hgu2oxweuzo21ghy1yui122olkh222""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

You get the idea. It's actually very long. And there seems to be a whitespace in the start of the class name. 

I've never seen a class name like this before. One which is so long and has dashes in it. What do the dashes  mean? And why is the class name so long? 

This HTML file has 2 CSS files linked in it. I looked at both CSS files but I could not find this class name within it.

So what could this class name be referencing? Is it possible that its refering to some external reference?

learnprogramming,Implementation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization is Not Working,"Hello Reddit, so basically I'm trying to implement Monte Carlo Counter Factual Regret Minimization, which, if you don't know is a method of finding a nash equilibrium for some extensive form game by traversing the game tree using depth first search, calculating regrets, and using regret matching to come up with a strategy.

  
Basically, I can't figure out for the life of me what's wrong with my program. I've looked at it a bunch, asked ChatGPT, etc. and still can't find the problem.

# PROBLEM

I've checked that (1,2) is valid in the move rules, but it still doesn't get visited in the 15-move solution, notice that in STATE 12 it supposed jump into 1,2 but did 4,3 instead.

    PLAN: mover(caballo,3,1,4,3); mover(caballo,4,3,2,2); mover(caballo,2,2,1,4); mover(caballo,1,4,3,3); mover(caballo,3,3,2,1); mover(caballo,2,1,1,3); mover(caballo,1,3,3,4); mover(caballo,3,4,4,2); mover(caballo,4,2,2,3); mover(caballo,2,3,1,1); mover(caballo,1,1,3,2); mover(caballo,3,2,2,4); mover(caballo,2,4,4,3); mover(caballo,4,3,3,1); (no action)

I increased the number of moves to 18, but the knight violates constraints when doing so.

I'm using not visited(X, Y) and not occupied(X, Y) to enforce valid moves, but it seems the knight is not adhering to these constraints properly.

    PLAN: mover(caballo,3,1,4,3); mover(caballo,4,3,2,2); mover(caballo,2,2,1,4); mover(caballo,1,4,3,3); mover(caballo,3,3,2,1); mover(caballo,2,1,1,3); mover(caballo,1,3,3,4); mover(caballo,3,4,4,2); mover(caballo,4,2,2,3); mover(caballo,2,3,1,1); mover(caballo,1,1,3,2); mover(caballo,3,2,2,4); mover(caballo,2,4,4,3); mover(caballo,4,3,2,2); mover(caballo,2,2,1,4); mover(caballo,1,4,3,3); mover(caballo,3,3,1,2); mover(caballo,1,2,3,1)

I'd also assume that this issue is not caused by a modification or the deletion of a library used by Discord, as Discord likely caches the packages and a modification to a package won't instantly affect a running server.

learnprogramming,Single Responsibility Principle - What counts as a Responsibility?,"Boiled down, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) means that each function should only have one task / responsibility. However, I haven't really seen any precise definitions on how broad or narrow a responsibility. For example, I have this function here (in c) that is used to convert plaintext to ciphertext using a 26 letter key:

    string cipher(string plaintext, string key)
    {
        int length = strlen(plaintext);
        string uppalpha = ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"";
        string lowalpha = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"";
    
        // for every character in the text
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)
        {
            // checking against every letter in the alphabet
            bool found_letter = false;
            int pos = 0;
            while (found_letter == false &amp;&amp; pos &lt; 26)
            {
                if (plaintext[i] == uppalpha[pos])
                {
                    plaintext[i] = toupper(key[pos]);
                    found_letter = true;
                }
                else if (plaintext[i] == lowalpha[pos])
                {
                    plaintext[i] = tolower(key[pos]);
                    found_letter = true;
                }
                else
                {
                    pos++;
                }
            }
        }
    
        return plaintext;
    }

I know my code can definitely improve, but my main concern is if this violates the SRP. Is the single responsibility converting plaintext to a cipher text?

Or are responsibilities even narrower than that; should I break it down into even smaller parts, like:

* check current letter's position in the alphabet
* change current letter to respective letter in key

etc

learnprogramming,"In C#, is there anything similar to Exceptions that can be used for non-critical warnings?","Raising exceptions is very convenient when application goes the wrong way, because they can be caught at any level in the stack trace, making for a very simple code. However, sometimes a certain function might complete it's job, but with some warnings - non-critical issues that should allow continuing code execution (unlike exceptions), yet be ""collected"" at any level in the stack trace (like exceptions), so it can later be used to alter program behavior or simply print out these warnings to the user.

This can of course be done by having an `out` parameter in every function in the stack trace to collect these warnings (for example `public bool IsBodyValid(out string warnings`), however this complicates the code with this additional parameter in every function.

Another alternative is to implement some kind of logger with a singleton pattern, so that any function can access it without a passed reference and dump warnings into it. But it is still not very convenient in many cases and can lead to confusion.

learnprogramming,Solving complex non-linear equation system,"So I've been stuck on this problem for a while now and am starting to get really frustrated. 

This is part of a larger project focusing on constrained optimization, but this is the main ""bulk"" of the project. 

Basically, I have a 3 variable function of which I take the partial derivative of with respect to each variable. I then set each of these functions equal to zero to complete the optimization. 

Here's how I defined the original function (I know its very poorly defined haha): 

I = \[460, -168, -14, 30, -31, 8, 55, 1, -2, -194, -1, 38, 4, 6, 3, 6\]

Q = \[33, 25, 26, 36, 25, 23, 23, 19, 18, 17, 16, 16, 15, 14, 14, 13\]

n = len(I)

for i in range(n):

  s = s + ((I\[i\]) / (k \* Q\[i\]))\*\*2

b = sqrt(2.0) / sqrt(s / n)

for i in range(n):

  f = f + (I\[i\] - (I\[i\]) / (k \* Q\[i\]))\*\*2

f = f / n

f = f - L \* ((187.0 / 27.0) \* n \* (e\*\*((-t \* b))) - 5e4)

  
I then create the three functions by partial differentiation:

  
f1 = sympy.diff(f, k)

f2 = sympy.diff(f, t)

f3 = sympy.diff(f, L)

  
Which I then try to solve:

  
g = lambdify(\[(k,t, L)\], \[f1,f2, f3\])



print(fsolve(g, \[5,0.5, -10\]))

Unfortunately, this strategy yields the message: ""RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar power"" and displays my guesses ( \[5,0.5, -10\] ). 

  
I had also attempted to use Sympy's solver directly by doing:

f1 = f1.rewrite(Piecewise)

ans = sympy.nsolve((f1, f2, f3), (k, t, L), (0.5, 0.1, -10), verify=False)

This was able to provide some answers, however when substituted back in using: 

f1 = f1.subs({k: ans\[0\], t: ans\[1\], L: ans\[2\]})

f2 = f2.subs({k: ans\[0\], t: ans\[1\], L: ans\[2\]})

f3 = f3.subs({k: ans\[0\], t: ans\[1\], L: ans\[2\]})

They turn out to be nowhere near 0. The ""solutions"" also seem to arbitrarily depend on the initial guesses.

learnprogramming,My internship mentor offered me a Junior Software Developer role,"I am over the moon, I have been dreaming of this for 2 years. At night I cannot sleep because I am so excited about it. 

I am almost 40, molecular biologist, worked in Academia most of my life, never touched programming until 2 years ago when it  happened by accident and I fell in love with it. I tried it all: Python, C#, SQL, Java Script, HTML, CSS. I learned about binary code and the command line, about 7 layers of internet and DNS. I became fascinated by it all. I think I spent a few thousand euros on various Udemy courses. I tried data analysis, data science, web dev, Q&amp;A... I made several projects and deployed them all on GitHub. And then almost one year ago I was left without a job. I decided to spend all my time learning to code and to switch careers. I contacted everyone, reached out, even to random strangers, asking for mentoring and help. I learned a lot from some of them, and am forever thankful. Then I saw an add for a job that I knew I wanted, but didn't have the skills for it. It was Python and AI. But I reached out and asked for an unpayed internship. They agreed. 1.5 months in, my mentor/future boss, told me that if I keep at it, I'll sign a contract once the internship is over.

Not only will I be doing something that is super fun and that gives me serious dopamine kicks on a regular basis, but I will be doing it from my home, without commuting and putting on makeup. I don't have to wake up my child at 6 to make it to work at 7. I am so happy, it is ridiculous. So I just wanted to share my happiness and brag :)

I also need the program to be able to diagnose the call. To be able to report back that the call went to the initial phone number and not have been forwarded to another number. So it would read the pathway while ringing.

Is it even possible to create this app using HTML/Java?

I recently started learning C++ and have covered the basics. Now, I’m moving on to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I’ve been following tutorials and practicing alongside, but I want to pick up a good book to go deeper.  

After some research, I found these recommendations:  
1. **CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms)** – Seems like the standard choice.  
2. **Grokking Algorithms** – Introductory but uses Python, so I might skip this.  
3. **Robert Sedgwick's Algorithms** – Heard it's great but more advanced.  

I’m thinking of starting with CLRS and then moving to Robert Sedgwick’s book later. Does this sound like a good plan? Or is there any other book you'd recommend for someone at my level?  

Thanks in advance! 😊",byteyou404,1gsmtax,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gsmtax/recommendations_for_a_dsa_book/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gsmtax/recommendations_for_a_dsa_book/,2024-11-16 13:03:08,4,0.75,4,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gsmtax

It would probably take at least a year to complete all of this, so I'm thinking if I should primarily focus learning these topics for now before I dive deeper into full-stack, or perhaps I should keep practicing programming while spending extra 1-2 hours daily to learn CS.

learnprogramming,Need help with compiler design ,"Making a compiler for oop lang with the same lang. The lang supports calling a identifier before it's defined and to solve this problem, I am collecting all the identifiers first, turning them into symbols and putting them inside a symbol table, then do another read and resolve them.

But the main problem is not this, the problem is with type inference and this forward referencing.

Let's say I have two variables A and B. A's initializer is a constructor, so it's value is an object, B initializer is method's return value from object A.
Both of these need type inference, so their initial type is unknown and here B is declared before A and is dependent on it.

So when doing the resolution, compiler will try to look up A when inferring type for B but will get unknown since A has no type currently.

learnprogramming,beginner programmer LF advice,"Hey everyone! About a month ago, I finally decided to take programming seriously. Before that, I had tried dabbling here and there—like starting CS50 or random HTML tutorials—but I never stuck with it for more than 2-3 hours before giving up and just telling myself it was “too boring” (I know, it wasn’t, I just wasn’t putting in the effort).

But this time, something just clicked, and I’ve been completely hooked. Over the past month, I’ve probably put in over 100 hours of study time. That first week, I went all in—studying 5-6 days in a row, 8-10 hours a day, taking notes, rewatching lectures, and trying to explain concepts out loud to make sure I understood them. I’ve also been using ChatGPT as a tutor to help me figure things out or correct me when I’m wrong.

Right now, I’m working through **CS50x** and just started **CS50 intro to Python**. I’m about halfway through CS50x,  and honestly, it’s been amazing , Professor Malan is insanely good at explaining things. But I’m starting to think ahead, and I’d love some advice on what other courses, books, or resources would be good for a beginner like me who’s still learning the fundamentals and is willing to put in the hours to learn and be the best.

That said, it hasn’t been all going up and easy. I’ve been diving deeply into data structures with C and learning about linked lists like single and doubly, hash tables, and trees. The concepts themselves make sense and are really interesting, but actually coding them has been a struggle with all the new syntax but thats ok i know it will take time im still pushing. 

I’ve signed up for classes to work toward my AA so I can eventually start computer science courses and change careers. Until then, I’m learning as much as I can on my own because I genuinely love and enjoy this.

If you’re self-taught (or started that way) and are doing well now, I’d love to hear what worked best for you. What courses, books, or strategies taught you the most and made the biggest difference early on? Right now, I’m learning C, and I really like it because it’s helping me understand everything under the hood. I’m excited to move on to other languages soon, but I want to make sure I’ve got a solid grasp of the fundamentals first or at least learn as much as I can before moving forward.

learnprogramming,OCR Python Project,"Im currently working on a project that summarizes Patient Bloodwork Results. 

Doc highlights the bloodwork names he wants included in the summary and then an assistant scans the document and writes a small standardized summary for the patient file in the form of: 

Lab from [date of bloodwork]; [Name 1]: [Value] ([Norm]), [Name2]: [Value] ([Norm]). 

For now I am only dealing with standardized documents from one Lab. 

The idea right now is that the assistant may scan the document, program pulls the Scan pdf from the printer (Twain?) and recognizes it as Bloodwork, realizes the Date and highlighted names as well as their respective values etc. and then simply sends the result to the users clipboard (Tesseract for OCR?) as it is not possible to interact with the patient file database through code legally. 

Regarding the documents: the results are structured in a table like manner with columns being

1. resultName 2. Value 3. Unit 4. Normrange 

-values may be a number but can also be others e.g. positive/ negative
-the columns are only seperated by white space
-units vary widely 
-norm ranges may be a with lower and upper limit or only one of the above, or positive/ negatives
-units may be usual abbreviations or just %, sometimes none 

Converting PDF pages to images is fairly easy and then so is Isolating highlighted text, ocr is working meh in terms of accuracy, but im seriously struggling with isolating the different data in columns. 

Are there any suggestions as to how i could parse the table structure which seriously lacks any lines. Note that on any following pages the columns are no longer labeled at the top. Column width can also vary. 

Ive tried a ""row analysis"" but it can be quite inaccurate, and makes it impossible to isolate the different columns especially cutting out the units. Ive also discarded the idea of isolating units and normRanges by matching bloodworkNames to a dictionary as creating this would be ridiculously tedious, not elegant and inefficient. 

Do i have the wrong approach? 

Technically all Bloodwork can be accessed on an online website however there is no API. Could pulling highlighted names and patient data then looking up those results online be a viable solution? especially in terms of efficiency and speed. No visible captchas or other hurdles though.

learnprogramming,Comprehensive Music Player as a web dev project.Too Big a Project to make in Vanilla JS ? Should I do this after I learn React ?,"So for starters I am making projects in Vanilla JS before moving to REACT to improve my understanding of JS and what advantages frameworks provide.  
So I chose music player project thinking it would be simple to implement BUT 

Just thinking about what I can do in this project has got me excited coz all i saw on the internet was people just making a media player playing only 2-3 songs which they chose in their media player.  
  
But I wanted to make one which plays from the User's chosen Directory/folder on his Hard Drive.  
  
What made me write this was that as I learned more about what do I have to do for eg to show the album cover art in my player for every mp3 files it plays. I'd have to convert the binary data in the file to a readable format which javascript can display.   
  
But that requires quite a lot of code. So when I combined all of my ideas i.e. = Music Player + Playing from User's Hard Drive + Displaying album cover + (maybe) a sidebar showing all the songs which user's directory/folder has It got me thinking that this is a LOT of code which raised the question that  
  
Is it feasible / efficient to write it in vanilla JS ? Like I'm not living in 2000s right so will it actually contribute in my learning or will it end up being just a lot of unecessary hard work ?

Lastly, I'm thinking that just JS might not be enough to implement this idea like considering that if I end up hosting my project on the internet as a basic local storage media player (Which I know the idea is Outdated)  
I might need a good Backend Such as SQL,etc to be able to handle a user's 1000 songs playlist.

So Any suggestion even not relating to JS but which might Help improve this project are Welcome !

learnprogramming,Question about the DAO pattern,"More than a question it is an argument I have made and I wanted to know if it is correct.  


I have a many-to-many relationship between the dish entity (dish name is primary key) and the restaurant entity (restaurant name is primary key). Within the database I have a relationship for the dish, a relationship for the restaurant, and a relationship to represent the associations between these two. To represent this association in the DTO Dish I put a list of references to Restaurant (i.e., the restaurants that have that dish) and in the DTO Restaurant I put a list of references to Dish (i.e., the dishes that the restaurant has). When through the DAO I do an add operation to one of the two relationships, I need to have this addition also reflected within the database and within the code. For example if I add a new dish I have to add it in the dish relation and in the relation that represents my restaurant\_dish associations and this I do via a query, however code side I also have to update it right away and not in a lazy way, right?

    class public DishDAO_JDBC() implements DishDAO {
        // ...
    
        @Override
        public void create(Dish dish, Restaurant restaurant) {
            String addDishQuery = ""INSERT INTO dish (name, ingredients) VALUES (?, ?)"";
            String updateRestaurantDishQuery = ""INSERT INTO restaurant_dish (restaurant_name, dish_name) VALUES (?, ?)"";
    
            try {
                PreparedStatement addDishStatement = connection.prepareStatement(addDishQuery);
                addDishStatement.setString(1, dish.getName());
                addDishStatement.setString(2, dish.getIngredients());
                addDishStatement.executeUpdate();
    
                PreparedStatement updateRestaurantDishStatement = connection.prepareStatement(updateRestaurantDishQuery);
                updateRestaurantDishStatement.setString(1, restaurant.getName());
                updateRestaurantDishStatement.setString(2, dish.getName());
                updateRestaurantDishStatement.executeUpdate();
    
                restaurant.getDishes().add(dish);
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    
      // ...
    }

Do I necessarily have to associate the dish with the restaurant when I create it? Or is it better to do one method to add the dish (so just add it to the dish relationship) and another to associate it with a restaurant (so update restaurant\_plate and the DTO in the code)?",_icsp_,1gs8axx,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gs8axx/question_about_the_dao_pattern/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gs8axx/question_about_the_dao_pattern/,2024-11-15 22:16:13,3,1.0,3,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gs8axx

learnprogramming,Recursive functions,"Studying and looking into recursive functions. I understand it on a basic level. And how it works with for example factorials. The stacking when calling itself. Ending up at base case which should return the “answer” for the “innermost” “instance” of itself. To the return back out. 

But for me the rest is not intuitive. When trying to create a recursive function for anything else than factorials or maybe power of, I get stuck in how to think. 

The base case is easy to understand. Or sometimes figure out. But the rest? Somehow I need a function that is incomplete and only get complete by calling itself? It’s like missing a piece of the puzzle and it’s only complete when I find the missing piece or pieces. 

Is there a good video. A way of think about recursive that will make me go ahaa. I’ve tried looking at a lot of videos and coding examples without looking at the answers.

learnprogramming,How to optimize a search algorithm for an adjacency matrix to get O(n) instead of O(n^2),"Basically here were my homework instructions:

# Vertex Finder

Given a directed graph already stored in adjacency matrix form, determining if there is a vertex with in-degree |V|-1 and out-degree 0 can be done in O (|V|) time where |V| is the number of vertices within the graph. Write a method to find the vertex in O(|V|) time. If there is no such vertex, return -1.

and here is my current code:

public int findVertex(Matrix m) {

int index = -1;

int v = m.getNumVertices();

int\[\] inDegree = new int\[v\];

int\[\] outDegree = new int\[v\];



for(int j = 0; j &lt; v; j++){

for(int i = 0; i &lt; v; i++){

if(m.getEdge(i, j) == 1){

inDegree\[i\]++;

outDegree\[j\]++;

}

}

if(outDegree\[j\] == 0 ){

index = j;

}

if(index != -1 &amp;&amp; inDegree\[index\] == v -1){

return index;

}

}

return -1;

}

}

Obviously the nested for loop is making it O(n\^2) but I cannot seem to figure out how to optimize it to just O(n).

learnprogramming,"Any general theory behind how to code a kind of ""don't break the ice"" style game? I'm struggling to come up with a solution for allowing unsupported groups of floor tiles to fall.","I'm making a personal project little ""game,"" a DnD map that has a destructible floor. The basic gist of it is that I click on a floor tile and it falls away. The simple game is totally done, where each tile stays in place until I click it. I also built a little check to see if a tile is completely on its own, it will automatically fall, which helps make it look a little more natural and stops a single floor tile from ""floating"" on its own.

The problem comes, then, when two or more tiles are ""floating"" together, like a little island, each giving the others a check pass that they're attached to *something*. Of course, this doesn't really make sense in real life, since a floating group of three floor tiles would fall just like a single floating floor tile. I'm not sure how to code something like that, though. 

I have a sneaking suspicion that checking if a single floor tile is alone and making it fall is extremely easy, but checking if two or more floor tile are ""alone"" and making them fall is much, much harder. Is there something in like graph theory or some other math subject I should learn to make this easier? I feel pretty good about learning an advanced math concept, but if there's a simpler solution I'm not thinking of, I would be happy to pursue that. 

My current nebulous plan looks something like this: 

1. At the beginning of play, check if a floor tile is attached to the wall. If so, give it a ""attachment"" value of 0. Do that for all the tiles. 
2. Then for each tile with an attachment value of 0, find all the tiles that touch it. If they aren't attachment value 0, give them attachment value 1. 
3. Then for each tile with attachment value 1, find all the tiles that touch it and if they aren't attachment value 0 or 1, give them value 2. 
4. Repeat for 3, 4, 5, … until every tile has an attachment value. 

Then during play:

1. Constantly check each tile to see if it is touching a tile with a smaller attachment value. If it is, mark it as safe and mark the ones it's touching as safe, too. Do this for all the tiles.
2. At the end of the last step each tick, make any tiles that are marked unsafe fall.

Current foreseen problems: 

* If there's a long line of the same attachment value tiles, will they mark each other safe correctly? Right now I'm fine if a group is supported by a single tile, even though that's a little unrealistic, I just want to make sure islands fall.

Also, the floor tiles I am using are not regular shapes, they're random cracked rock shapes, so checking rows and columns is off the table, although now that I'm thinking about it, that would be an easier way to do a real Don't Break the Ice game.

learnprogramming,Should I (29M) learn Computer Science fundamentals before switching careers?,"TLDR: Is it important to learn CS fundamentals or is it possible to look for work first and learn fundamentals as I have my foot in the door?

Hi, so for some context, I have been interested and learning programming casually since i was in high school because my school introduced us to HTML and CSS. I thought i was gonna take Computer Science in college but because of some bad decisions I ended up doing another course. Fast Forward years later I am now doing UX/(Mostly) UI design, and though I do enjoy it, I’ve always regretted not pursuing atleast Front-End or Game Dev.

I have some experience messing with Javascript, making some plugins for myself in Figma to simplify my tasks, messing with C# in Unity, or GDscript in Godot, Helping my sibling with Python homework for school, etc. just simple programming stuff.

Now I’ve reached a point where I really want to attempt a career shift and do probably front-end. Currently, I’m following roadmap.sh on front-end to make sure I’m learning useful topics but recently my CS graduate friend recommended I learn some CS Fundamentals. Specifically recommended the free Harvard CS50 course. I am interested but I saw it might also take a lot of time to complete. I thought for now it might be smarter if i just learn relevant technologies and learn enough to be able to develop for web so i can secure a job and learn CS while im already working within the industry.

I just wanted to get people’s input, should I prioritize cs fundementals so I understand later concepts better? Do I need it to find work? Can i get away with finding entry level jobs without learning CS first? Really appreciate any advice.

i have a little coding experience so i understand the gist of stuff but have no comprehensive understanding of how to *make* things. i would appreciate any advice you have to give me. thank you!!",tokiotrap_,1grn5ij,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1grn5ij/how_to_write_a_program_to_speedrun_little_alchemy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1grn5ij/how_to_write_a_program_to_speedrun_little_alchemy/,2024-11-15 03:25:22,0,0.5,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1grn5ij

learnprogramming,Element getting style from wrong style sheet,"I'm designing a website using react and amplify and I have run across the weirdest issue I cant solve. I stripped down the program to only have 2 buttons, Upload, and Button2. Every element has its own distinct style sheet.

The only way I can get the styling to show up on Button2 is if I put the styling in UploadStyle.css. I can not get it to use its own style sheet.

In particular, when I hear some people mention ""Prompt Engineering,"" I begin to have some doubts. I would like to ask the community: can simply modifying the prompt significantly improve AI performance?

First of all, is prompt engineering really that important? I understand that it involves optimizing the output by adjusting the input when interacting with the AI model, but I can't help but wonder—how much can changing the prompt actually affect the results? For example, are there situations where merely adjusting the details of the prompt can lead to completely different outputs? Or does the AI's performance mainly depend on its inherent capabilities and the dataset it has been trained on?",WillDazzling6804,1grle84,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1grle84/how_to_better_use_ai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1grle84/how_to_better_use_ai/,2024-11-15 01:52:24,0,0.5,0,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1grle84
learnprogramming,I don’t enjoy coding. Should I back out of my CS degree?,"I’ve been contemplating this decision for a while. I am a 5th year senior. I know switching majors in your senior year isn’t ideal. I started Uni as a Criminal Justice major but switched due to friends and family’s suggestion, and slight intrigue from beginner level CS Uni courses. To this point I have never actually enjoyed coding, or learning about CS. I’ve just studied and done my best to pass courses. I have failed 4 courses, I repeated them and passed, but they set me back a year in my academic journey. I kept Criminal Justice as a minor, and even though I met the minor requirements a while back I never stopped taking the courses as electives because I found the material and lecturers enjoyable and interesting. Now, I am entering my final semester needing 15 credits to graduate. I can either make CS my minor, and graduate with a Criminal Justice degree, or keep my degree path as is. I want to change because I fear I may not pass the upper level courses, since I am taking one now and am struggling heavily. I am in a very difficult headspace, very stressed out, and all that is on my mind is wanting to finally graduate from Uni and work. I know the CS degree opens paths to higher paying jobs, but I wouldn’t like to do most of those jobs.

I am a data engineer creating a GitHub Pages site as a side project to develop other skills. Given my background, I have the results of a lot of automated data collection being displayed on the website (NFL and NCAAM odds predictions, etc.). Most of the data gets collected through GitHub Actions, stored in my S3 bucket, and then the bucket is read from when the website is visited.

However, I have some scripts that I want to keep private, and right now the best way (aka a way that works) is to use the scripts to create the JSON locally and then add the JSON to the repo (results are completely public). I know it's not best practice, but I don’t have enough free time to integrate the way I want to display the data with reads from S3.

This leads to the main question of the post: the script will create a commit every day and thus inflate my activity history.

learnprogramming,"I know literally nothing about software development, but I want to learn and already have an idea for an application that should be relatively straightforward.","I want to create a wallpaper app for Wayland with a straightforward, user-friendly GUI that automatically generates a 16-color palette (like pywal) and a matching GTK theme (like wpgtk) whenever a new wallpaper is set. Here’s the vision in a bit more detail:

When you open the app, it displays a simple GTK window that lists images in `~/Wallpapers` underneath a 16:9 preview of the currently selected image. Double-clicking any image previews it along with a generated color palette, and clicking “Set Wallpaper” triggers a few automated actions (as well as makes the image your wallpaper, obviously):

* Generate a 16-color palette
* Generate/update the same styling files that pywal creates in `~/.cache/&lt;app name&gt;`, but without the extra, application-specific files (just essentials like sequences, colors, [colors.sh](http://colors.sh/), colors.css, colors.yml, colors.json, etc.)
* Generate/update a GTK theme in `~/.themes` using the generated color palette

I figure this would be a relatively simple thing to accomplish and a good way to get my feet wet while also working on something that I'll actually use rather regularly.

Ive quitted my programming journey many times due to this. It’s not like I’ve not been putting the time in as I’ve spent 8+ hours programming before but I can’t even achieve the simplest things.

I'm working on my first and really urgent React Native project using React Native with Expo, and I'm running into a frustrating issue. The project runs fine on the Expo Go app on my Android device, but when I try to view it in a web browser on my Windows laptop, I keep getting the following error:

Installing react and react-dom with npm install react react-dom

Clearing the Metro Bundler cache with npx expo start --clear

Reinstalling all dependencies by deleting node_modules and package-lock.json, then running npm install

Running npx expo-doctor, which didn't find any errors or problems

Despite all these efforts, the error persists. This is an urgent project, and I'm really stuck. Any personal help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

learnprogramming,Newbie on web,"Hi!   
My post got removed from r/webdev so I'm searching for other places to ask for help, sorry if this should not go on here

**This is just for contextualizing, to avoid boring you, since you are already doing me a big favour if you answer, you can skip directly to the questions.**

I've been trying to learn web development recently. I'm a junior desktop developer with C#, but I want to learn web development so that I can make pages for myself or other people.  
For example, right now I have the idea of creating my portfolio, pages for a small indie studio I want to start, and a webpage similar to a linktree but more professional for a friend who is beginning on streaming  
To make it easier, I want to get into static web pages, later I'll try to learn how to make non-static pages.

I've been trying to learn it for about two months, making pages for practice, and watching a little course on YouTube, but I feel like I'm stuck and I'm creating just bad pages.

To understand better how pages should be made and to become better I've checked some pages like landing pages, portfolios, and that, and using wappanalizer to see what they are using at the backend, and looking at pages, every single one has a lot of stuff like JS Frameworks, CSS Frameworks, Analytics, and other cool stuff. Mine only has one: Bulma.

I've started creating pages to get skills and learn, using pure HTML CSS JS, and Bulma as a CSS helper since I learned about it on another post from here. But being honest, even if I try, the pages don't look nearly good, they look like a page made by... well, a newbie.

**Questions start here**

For this I wanted to ask some questions to get better.

* IDE
   * I'm so new on this I don't even know if there is an IDE for webdev, for now I'm using vscode with live server extension, but is there a better option for doing this?
* About the components
   * As I've said before, pages use a lot of technologies, and when I do one I only have one that is Bulma for CSS, what should I learn, or how are they used? I know literally nothing so I don't even know how to install or use that.
   * What technologies should I learn and where to do that? Like the JS libraries for galleries or that kind of stuff
* Publishing
   * I don't have that much money to spend on hosting, so for now I was using github pages to deploy the pages I've been doing to learn, and I think that using that limits a lot what can I use, can I use stuff like node or react and still be able to publish it on github pages?
   * I can get the money to buy one hosting tho, but not for many, so, any recommendations on which one use? I want to it to be good, but I'm afraid to buy one and it not being useful for me and loosing that money
* Advertising
   * I've seen that people use stuff like google analytics, or a facebook alternative (I don't know much about that), but I think those are used for understanding how users interact with your page and helping it gain more position on searches, also I've seen that you can pay for ads on google searches and that. How can I do that?
* Domain
   * Any good page to acquire a domain? I think that if I get a host I can buy one from the same page, so maybe this question is useless and I should do it on the recommended host?
* Security
   * I'd like the page to be secure, right now I have them on github pages, I actually love it, it's easy to use, quick, and can easily let me share my test pages and I don't mind them being puublic, but when doing the actual pages for actual people like the page for my streamer friend, I would not like the page to be on github, making the code fully visible to anyone, I don't know if it can be insecure, I know that will be solved with a host, but is there other security measurements I should take?

Thanks a lot if you took a moment of your day to read this and even more thanks if you can help me with one.  
No need to answer one, even if you answer just one I'll be intensively grateful.

I hope I can get help with every point, have a nice day!",Limp-Anxiety3880,1gr859y,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gr859y/newbie_on_web/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gr859y/newbie_on_web/,2024-11-14 16:04:25,2,1.0,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gr859y

learnprogramming,A webpage that auto-opens on firefox ,"Hey everyone, so I would just like some guiding points on how to make a webpage auto-open itself  once a day on top of the tabs I already have open. This is just because I want to read many articles on a website, but if I leave it open as a tab (behind the million other open tabs) I absolutely forget. A calendar, notion, task organizer or similar don't work, because I just forget to open those as well. So anyways, I want to make sure I read an article once a day by it just showing up on top of my open tabs (bonus points for opening random articles). I have made a simple firefox extension before, know html, css, basics of javascript and basics of python, json, xml. I think this would be a nice project to put these skills to practice, since as a hobby I don't always use them. So if anybody could point how I could go about doing this, I'd appreciate it.
