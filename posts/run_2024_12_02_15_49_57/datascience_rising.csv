datascience,Is any of you doing actual ML work here?,"I'm really passionate and i love the mathematics of machine learning, especially the one in deep learning. I do have experience with training DL models, genetic algo hyperparameter tuning, distribution based models/clustering (KL div, EM), combining models or building them from scratch, implementing complex ones in C from zero, signal analysis, visualizations, and other things.

I work in a FAANG, but most of the work is actually data engineering and statistics. At first I was given the chance to work on a bit of ML, but that was just for me to have the motivation to learn the already existing systems, because no one in the entire department does any ML, and now I'm only getting engineering/statistics projects.

I had jobs in the past at startups where the CEO would tell me to hard code IFs instead of training a decision tree for different tasks.

They all just want ""the simplest solution"", and I fully agree with the approach, except that the simplest possible approach is not an actual solution some of the time. We may need to add in some complexity to solve different tasks, but most managers/bosses I've encountered have been terrified by any actual ML/mathematics. I agree that explainable and low risk high reward are the best approaches, but not if your ""low risk"" solution is hardcoding hundred of if statements instead of a decision tree, man.

Is it because I'm from Europe and not US? I've been told by HR that we're inferior and that ideas only come from the US and to keep my head down more instead of proposing projects before.

I'm a very tryhard and hard working person, but I just can't perform in a job where the task is to put together two SQL software pieces built 10 years ago in a rush and with zero documentation...... And my bosses refuse to understand that. Sure, I can do some of it, the job does not need to be perfect. But not if that is 100% of the job.

Are labs like OpenAI/Anthropic/Deepmind the only places on earth that do actual ML and not API calls + statistics/engineering + if statements?",SemperZero,1h4qr80,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h4qr80/is_any_of_you_doing_actual_ml_work_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h4qr80/is_any_of_you_doing_actual_ml_work_here/,2024-12-02 08:53:13,58,0.89,58,0,43,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4qr80

datascience,Daily averaged time series comparison -Linking plankton and aerosols emissions?,"Hi everyone, so we have this dataset of daily averaged pytoplankton time series over a full year; coccolithophores, chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, phaecocystis, zooplankton.  
Then we have atmospheric measurements on the same time intervals of a few aerosols species; Methanesulphonic acid, carboxylic acids, aliphatics, sulphates, ammonium, nitrates etc...  
Our goal is to establish all the possible links between plankton types and aerosols, we want to find out which planktons matter the most for a given aerosols species.

So here is my question; Which mathematical tools would you use to build a model with these (nonlinear) time series? Random Forest, cross-wavelets, transfer entropy, fractals analysis, chaos theory, Bayesian statistics? The thing that puzzle me most is that we know there is a lag between the plankton bloom and aerosols eventually forming in the atmosphere, it can take weeks for a bloom to trigger aerosols formation, so far many studies have just used lagged Pearson´s correlation, which I am not too happy with as correlation really isn´t reliable, would you know of any advanced methods to find out the optimal lag? What would be the best approach in your opinion?  
I would really appreciate any ideas, so please don´t hesitate to write down yours and I´d be happy to debate it, have a nice Sunday, cheers :)",Pleromakhos,1h4080y,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h4080y/daily_averaged_time_series_comparison_linking/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h4080y/daily_averaged_time_series_comparison_linking/,2024-12-01 10:08:42,11,0.87,11,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4080y
