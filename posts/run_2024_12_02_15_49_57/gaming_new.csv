gaming,Is a PS5 or a higher refresh rate monitor worth it? (Maybe OLED),"Let’s say for example I have a 165hz 1440p monitor, but can push well over 200fps and then some as it is. Is it truly worth investing in a monitor that can handle that and then some? Potentially OLED too?

Or would it make more sense to invest in a PS5 to have as a system to play older games that are basically dead on PC, but very much alive on Series X/PS5. I know gamepass exists, but I’m not exactly interested in that. 

Kinda curious on feedback of what everyone thinks. I’ve only experienced an OLED TV, and it was incredible, and I don’t necessarily need a console but….i really only prefer the PC for things like MMOs where it really shines. Yes COD can shine too, but older games are usually hacked and not worth messing with, and there’s still PS5 exclusives that I can’t get (though many do come over for sure).

Are there no graphically stunning “show stopper” titles in the last 6 years to compete with them? Have video game graphic advances slowed to a crawl now?","**EDIT** I thought this was clear in my post, but maybe not. I am not saying there aren't better graphics to be found into today's games. I am saying they don't look a Decade better, they don't look 6 years better. For example, Legend of Zelda OOO came out in 1998, Crysis came out in 2007, that's the same gap between the release of Wild Hunt 3 and now. Skyrim came out in 2011, and 6 years prior to that, same gap as between RDR2 and now, the most graphically amazing game just released was the King King movie tie game. There is an ocean of difference, graphically, between Ocarina of Time and Crysis, between King Kong and Skyrim. You could show your grandma a picture of the two and she'd be able to easily point to the one with better graphics. But if you showed Wild Hunt 3 or RDR2 or Battlefield One next to many or even most big budget graphically cutting edge titles of the day, your gran probably couldn't say which have better graphics. The gulf is REALLY narrow compared to the same time span in the past. And if you look up just about any listing of the most graphically impressive games, RDR2, a 6 year old game, is still near the top of basically every list.

Was recently doing an RDR2 play though and was blown away coming back to it, just how damn good it looks. I remember it looked good, but I mean it looks GOOD. And I remember thinking the same about a year ago when I picked Witcher 3 back up. 

Hell star wars battlefront 2 was released in 2017, battlefield 1 was released in 2016, and you’d be hard pressed to find games in their genres released this year that look any better. 

I’m not saying games now look bad, they just don’t look a decade better than Witcher 3. I feel like for most of my life video game graphics have been making continuous leaps. I can’t think of any other time since, hell, the N64, when you’d go damn near a decade with the top tier most graphically impressive cutting edge game not really looking much better than those from 6, 7, 9 years prior. 

Are there graphical powerhouses out there I’m just not aware of?

Control is the only one I can really think of, and control looks great, I just don’t think it looks that much better than say rdr2, maybe slightly better lighting system? But it’s hard to compare since almost all of control takes place indoors.

gaming,Games should have a seperate download option with non-4k textures and compressed Audio,"I was looking for some Games that I might want to get only to find that all of those Games are INSANELY large for the content they offer

After looking into it I found that 90% of that is just from high resolution textures and wav audio files... I'm sorry but I don't want that

As a Person that couldn't care less about Graphics I really don't want that a Game fills up so much space with some stupid images plastered onto a wall (And I say that with 8TB of storage).

Games already have multiple Download options, why not allow Me to choose between the Game with full resolution textures and wav audio, and another version that uses 2K **(2048x2048)** textures with FLAC Audio while keeping everything else the same

Sure it would be extra work, but batch scaling down textures and changing out WAV files with FLAC files isn't that difficult (Since I already did that with multiple Games. Problem is just that tons of Games don't allow it).

And I also think it would make sense from a business standpoint as I personally just don't buy some Games when I see how much storage they take up for the content they give Me.

A major reason why I don't buy Call Of Duty games anymore is because the Game size is insane for the short campaign and the repetitive multiplayer

Yes games can look great without having 4K **(4096x4096)** textures and because People will disagree on that I think we should give People both and just allow People to choose what they want to use

  
**Edit:When I say ""4K, 2K and Full HD textures"" I mean 4K=4096, 2K=2048, and Full HD=1080 or 1440. Yes I know it doesn't make complete sense but it was late when I made thi spost and I was tired.

gaming,Ubisoft gets a lot of hate but the accessibility options in their games are just next level,"I was playing ghost recon breakpoint and I was seriously pleased with how far you can go to customize everything to your liking. You can customize the controls to whatever you like. If you want to hold down a button, tap it, or just press it to do a certain action for instance.  In other games changing the controls can be more difficult than it needs to be but Ubisoft just gives you the power to do what works best for you.

I noticed Ubisoft really puts a lot of controls in the players hands when it comes to the gameplay as well.

In star wars outlaws you can change little things like turning on or off the mini puzzles when working on terminals or unlocking doors. You can change the text on the cards in the card games so it's easier to read among other things. I love this especially as you can turn off whatever you want so it doesn't hurt the flow of the game.

These are just a few options of course.

gaming,Deep Rock Galactic made me appreciate Indie games more,"Now to be honest, I'm still not that much of an Indie fan. I prefer my games to have a realistic artstyle, to have high visual fidelity, to have hollywood like moments and real time cutscenes and overall the polish only a AAA game can provide. Really, you couldn't bring me to touch an Indie game, because I got burned badly by some and after those experiences, they all looked so cheap and not worth the money.

That said, after a friend finally persuaded me to give DRG a chance and after I played it for a while, both with him and alone, I realized that indie games do can be fun and that stylized graphics can look good. I was really surprised at how fun the game is and over time, my mindset changed to:"" If this Indie game is fun, maybe others are as well."". 

And so I did try them and while most of them still aren't to my liking, I did find a few that I enjoyed (Ready or Not, Executive Assault 2, Cavern of Dreams or Eternal Evil to name a few). It also helps that Indie games become better and better and can reach AA quality levels nowadays, while also having a realistic artstyle.

That said, my tolerance still has limits. If I see any pixelart or cell shading in a game, I still instantly lose any interest, same with obvious pre made assets. And for stylized graphics, it really is a case by case situation. While I tolerate Running with Rifles for example, you can hunt me to the end of the world with Battle Bits Remastered or anything made with Synthy.

However, when you have a game like Ready or Not or SCP 5K, where you can show me ""Here, look. This game looks realistic, this game is dark and gritty and looks like a AAA title on the surface"", then you have my interest and usually a buy as well, if the end product is well made.",Nino_Chaosdrache,1h4elho,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,2024-12-01 21:51:06,0,0.18,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4elho

Even Halo 2, which had amazing vehicle combat, lost something with destructible vehicles.

I'm getting a new laptop so she is going to use my old one and try to find some new games she can play without getting sick.

What are some games that are good for people who get motion sickness? She likes RPGs, magic and fantasy, adventure games. Not much for shooters, racing, or sports games. She plays a bit of WoW, but I'd like to find some things that aren't subscription based since she refuses to pay for that. I have Game Pass, so that would be ideal, but going through Steam or GoG is fine too. Nothing super graphic intensive since she'll be playing on a 4 year old Alienware laptop with a RTX 2060.

There used to be a lot of great online game servers with different game types, and some with mods, and I used to play those quite a bit.

gaming,Buying games on PS5 Pro vs Series X?,"So, one of the main difference of this generation (PS5 Pro apart) was the PS5 controller, and a few games use the specificities of its controller.

A couple of Qs from that:
- Which games use the dual sense feature?
- Do you know any reviewer at least touching on that? Nowadays it’s never really mentioned when a game is available on both platforms for there’s anything specific for the PS controller
- For those of you having the luxury to have both consoles, where do you decide where to buy your games? I’m looking at The Plucky Squire for example, I want to buy it but no idea of the PS5 dualsense adds something to the experience or not, it’s kind of weird really developers don’t really take the time to mention it. Given Xbox tends to be better with back compat and allows for Play Anywhere (thus PC or handheld) it seems safer to buy on that platform, unless I’m missing something.

gaming,Horses no longer gallop in Red Dead Redemption 2,"
Just as the title says, my horses will no longer gallop or even stride at a decent pace.  My horses only trot at the slowest speed, just happened out of nowhere today while playing on my Xbox Series X.  Even horses I steal from NPCs will stop and just walk.  I only just got the game a couple weeks ago, too.  I have tried every possible solution I could come across:

* I fed the horse
* groomed it over and over
* patted the horse
* removed the saddle and put it back on
* rode without a saddle
* switched to different horses at stables
* reloaded the most previous save
* reloaded old saves
* changed controllers
* closed the game and removed it from Quick Resume, waited a minute to relaunch
* did a hard restart on the XSX console
* I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it

All those things and my horse(s) will not move any faster than a walking stride.  This has affected every single horse across all my saves.  I have already put plenty of progress into the game, but now I either have to go without a horse or play at a snail’s pace

gaming,When was the last time a game made your jaw drop in awe?,"I had been running an older PC that was using a 3070ti but unfortunately, the computer had actually been dropped a few feet from my desk during one of my seizures. Still worked fortunately but it had like a weird effect on the graphic card, tried everything from disconnecting it from mobo and reconnecting it making sure it was synchronized correctly. With luck it kept working but when I would try to run games, especially games with more intense graphics you could really notice it so I wouldn't buy new games. Latest game I was playing was deadlock beta but you really noticed it even at the lowest of settings and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

Finally decided it was time to get a new computer so I built myself a new one and gifted it to myself as an early Christmas present (Dec 11) and got it up last week after building it myself. Currently running an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU, 4080 Super GPU, 64gb of memory.

The first game I bought and tried playing was Warhammer 40k Spacemarine 2 and immediately upon loading the initial load video, I was just in awe and my jaw dropped as I couldn't believe it. It felt like I was actually there and even more in-depth than ever before. Reminded me why I loved gaming on a computer so much and what it felt like when it was working in sync perfectly.

Recently I started noticing, how after playing games with immersive atmosphere, gameplay and story my mood and feel of life changes.

 Like Disco Elysium making me melancholic and introspecive, or Stalker still keeping me in the hopeless harsh atmosphere, or KCD and it's funny but brutal story of Henry plaguing my thoughts.

Games being the ultimate escapism allow us to live out different lives and stories, different world and morals and I really find that amazing .",ETkach,1h24ixe,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h24ixe/the_aftertaste_of_immersive_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h24ixe/the_aftertaste_of_immersive_games/,2024-11-28 20:06:22,10,0.58,10,0,26,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h24ixe

It quickly became my favorite controller, but after just two years, it suddenly stopped working. A little digging revealed the culprit: a tiny, hidden fuse that had blown, a clear case of **planned obsolescence**.

Instead of tossing it, I grabbed my soldering iron, bypassed the fuse in about 5 minutes, and gave it new life. Fast forward to today, and this controller is STILL alive!

It has survived thousands of gaming hours, multiple moves, a few accidental drops, and more game rage moments (Yes, it’s been thrown… more than once.) \^\^

I get that casual players make up the vast majority of the player base, but they still don't really know what they're talking about when it comes to what is good and bad in a video game.

For example, a casual Smash Bros Ultimate player might think Ganondorf is overpowered because his attacks all deal a ton of damage and have high knockback. In reality though, Ganondorf has been bottom tier in every game post-Melee, including Ultimate where he is the single worst character in the game. His atrocious mobility, frame data, neutral game, and recovery all make him one of the few characters that are borderline unusable against anyone that knows what they're doing.

The casual player in that circumstance may want Ganondorf nerfed even though he's already terrible, further crippling an already weak character. Their issues with Ganondorf can be solved if they just improve at the game, but they want him kneecapped instead.

So now I want more of that experience, but I'm worried that most CRPGs would bore me as I'm not a fan of D&amp;D and the thing about BG3 that makes me love it so much is the fact that characters are likable, combat is fun, graphics are great, you get those immersive closeups during conversations, and everything is voiced.

I saw some gameplay of a few CRPGs on YT and I noticed they're usually not fully voiced, the graphics are outdated, and there are no closeups on characters during conversations, which makes the game not feel immersive to me.

gaming,What are some of the better purposes for coins and collectables in modern platformers?,"Coins and 1-Ups were a precious commodity in games like the SNES Donkey Kong Country series, but these days many find the whole lives system antiquated, and more demoralizing than it's worth.

So, in a modern context where checkpoints are plentiful and there's no Game Over screen, do you think many games have figured out a strong alternative benefit to coins?

I don't think RPG elements work in something as simple as a platformer, so I tend not to consider them.

Games like Mario Galaxy wanted to keep 1-Ups, tho the game wasn't challenging and the checkpoints were forgiving enough that they made minimal difference.

Mario Odyssey has Skins purchasable with coins which is fine, but less interesting from a mechanics perspective.

Buying Power-Ups could still be fun.

gaming,Q: Is there any game award show you have some respect for?,"We all know The Game Awards featuring Geoff ""I host everything in gaming"" Keighley is considered, at least to the majority of gamers, as the be-all end-all of gaming award shows but that's mainly because he went to so much effort to make it like movie and television award shows which equally have been garnering disdain for being propped up ""buy your own award"" venues for companies.

TGA isn't the only one out there, and some of the others have a decent reputation because of their more rigorous voting processes or blind nomination selection. **With that in mind, do you have any kind of respect towards any on this list or do you just hate all award shows regardless of ethics or dignity?**

* **The Game Awards** \- votes made by games journalists (90%) and general audiences (10%), note that it's not confirmed if that means individual journalists or the publications themselves via a series of internal voting processes
* **D.I.C.E. Awards** \- votes made by members of the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, made up of studios and publishers (similar to the Academy Awards)
* **Famitsu Awards** \- votes made by magazine readers, primarily a Japanese audience
* **Game Developers Choice Awards** \- nominations are made via an invite-only 500 member committee called the International Choice Awards Network with additional nominations made by Gamasutra journalists, then votes are made by the entirety of ICAN at the start of the Game Developers Conference
* **The Golden Joystick Awards** \- the oldest continuously running award show (1983), originally voted on by the British public but now an international public vote
* **Japan Game Awards (formerly CESA Awards)** \- winners determined by a combination of a CESA panel of juries, public votes, and sales figures
* **SXSW Gaming Awards** \- nominations submitted by the general public then narrowed down to 5 per category by the 40 member SXSW Gaming Advisory Board, votes made by the general public

**Personally I'm not a fan of award shows** as I think they demean gaming as an art and don't recognise the work of the individuals behind them in a lot of cases. It's a similar issue with how the Oscars recognise the actors and directors, then every other category just credits the work but not the people or lead in charge of that team.

But out of the main gaming awards shows, **I at least give credit to the Golden Joysticks** for being the only one voted on exclusively by the general public (and not those who can buy their award) **and the GDCA** because it's developers voting for other developers' works so it's a recognition of technical achievement as well.

Edit:

Some more thoughts: Popular vote alone is not necessarily worse, industry vote only is not necessarily better; this is why I mentioned the Golden Joysticks and GDCA in particular.

The Golden Joysticks have always split the Game of the Year into its PC, console (sometimes separate consoles), and ultimate categories. And rarely has a game won all three, even if it exists on PC and console. For example, the 2024 winners were Satisfactory (PC), Helldivers 2 (console), and Black Myth Wukong (ultimate GotY). They're also more stringent with the votes when looking for fraud, bot votes, and false votes; if you're in the UK you can vote from your phone and it's unlikely anyone would pay for an extra phone just for this event, if you're outside the UK then votes are tied to your email address and additional checks are done to make sure it isn't a throwaway. So surprisingly, it doesn't always go the way of the public making weird or joke choices, but that's only because they're not given complete freedom to enter whichever game they want as their vote.

The Game Developers Choice Awards could be seen as a circle-jerk between devs, I admit. But it seems less likely than what goes on with DICE or TGA, as it's individual developers voting and not a company or journalist. Because of this it seems like it would be harder to buy off votes of so many people without word getting out, and even if they did it would be too high a price to pay. Even if they did, there's no guarantee those paid off would vote how they say they're going to as the votes are anonymous and developers can't vote for games they've worked on.

gaming,Lets talk about damage modelling,"Persistent day dream so I'm going to write it down to get it out of my head.

In the genre of combat driving games and mech something that has never quite hit right is damage modelling.

Back on the atari ST I was playing an F1 game and tire wear was modelled and being ""back then"" your imagination filled in the blanks. For some reason that sticks with me.

F16 fighting falcon, again on the Atari ST - getting the bird back with all the warning lights flashing and a broken under carriage. Real sense of achievement.

Fast forward a bit, Mech Warrior 2. Heat management, per limb damage. Seeing mechs with arms missing etc. All good.

Wipe out! Ps1. Speed and weapons! Bounce off things and slow down or boom and respawn. Classic fun.

Rollcage, more of the same but wheels on the ground and you could knock buildings on top of people. That was extra fun.

split second, blur. All had weapons and stuff but the damage modelling was nill. Split second environmental stuff although scripted was cool.

Burnout? no weapons but good deformation

Special shout out to Soldier of fortune 2s ghoul engine and their damage model. Gory as you like with the easter egg that if you get a cross body shot just right intestines would fall out.

Another shout out to Frostbite engine and battlefield building damage.

Mech games, damage is basically red amber green done with soot.

With the crazy amount of cores we all have aren't we ready for deeper damage modelling.

There are physics voxel games (abriss?) that go to the extreme. Of course we cant build games in that engine yet with tiny voxels and individual physics but there is a half way house between full material simulation and red/amber/green.

My ""realistic"" expecation using a mech game as an example;

3 damage layers CC/CH/SK

Core function, chassis, skin.

In essence its just 2 layers of armour over a health bar.

* Core function can keep Red amber green
* Chassis - 4 states - pristine, battered, buckled &amp; failed
* Skin - this is where the visual effort needs to go.

3 types of damage (possibly 4)

Energy, kinetic, explosive (environmental)

Example base weapon damage value distribute across the 3 layer cc/ch/sk

* Energy - various sized soot marks and has to wear through skin first. 5%/10%/85%
* Kinetic - holes in skin, chassis and core. 5%/60%/35%
* Explosive - soot and holes. (possibly just scaled up from the above) 15%/60%/25%
* Environmental - basically same as kinetic but without holes. Crush damage from falling masonry or bumping into a tree. Imagine an urban setting where you get staggered in to a building and it collapses on you.

Seeing games like borderlands with crazy amounts of gun stats makes it seems straightforward to implement a damage table like the above and churn out relevant textures and model deformations.

(core damage distribution across multiple components is a complexity I haven't thought through)

Slap on the Frostbite building damage and you can create a visceral mech game. If anyone has played Pacific Drive - the car is the star. Now change that to a mech.

This approach could also be applied to combat driving games. Added bonus of damage effect on car handling. Trackside buildings and collateral damage.

Easy if lengthy to type out. AAA studios are churning out cookie cutter games and this doesn't feel to outlandish to expect and its more meaningful than just reflective puddles and shadows. Also can scale across console generations with PCs getting the largest asset stack and it gets scaled back from there.

A final thought, in death race film (remake) a driver had ""the tombstone"" as a bullet proof shield. There's a scene where its getting chewed away but autocannon fire.

I grew up with titles where coming in contact with an enemy meant taking damage, and I’ve been playing Hades where they only hurt you if you get caught in the active frames of their attacks. I’m so used to avoiding contact that even though I know I can dash through them for backstab damage, I have a hard time turning off decades of experience. I’ve found that in other games, enemies are doing things that I’m not expecting, like leaving what appear to be clearly delineated zones to look for me, chasing me through changing screens, etc. Most of the games I used to play had enemy behavior limited by hardware restrictions, but as they fall away I’m finding modern gameplay mechanics are killing me until I adapt.

gaming,I want to ramble about Vectorman,"Ahoy! One of my absolute favorite games, Vectorman, has just been added to Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about how amazing it is here and maybe convince somebody to give it a shot if they haven't already. 

For many Vectorman is seen as ""that really hard Genesis game with the DKC like graphics"", only known for it's visuals and for people not being able to get past the early stages. It is a very difficult title, one that requires practice to get far in, but it's arguably not as bad as some of the most notorious NES titles on that front. By playing cautiously and learning what makes each level tick you can slowly master it, a process that can be very satisfying.


 It helps that those visuals are such a spectacle. The 90s cgi pre rendered models are not only different from other games but genuinely impressive in their own right beyond comparison to DKC or Ballz 3D. The orb based and mechanical designs are totally distinct and every character moves with a fluidity rarely found on a 16 bit platform. Vectorman himself is possibly the most expressive character on the genesis with tons of unique movements. He comes off as effortlessly cool in much the same way as Master Chief but with even less dialogue. His different transformations happen seamlessly in gameplay. The lighting baked into every stage and how it ""reflects"" on the sprites is stunning to behold. I'd say there are 2d games on cd based consoles that are way less visually impressive. It truly is amazing what they were able to do with the hardware. The variety in locations is also great. A lot of them combine mechanical  and natural with more out there colors and background elements including different weather patterns. The only game that looks even remotely like Vectorman is it's own sequel. The electronic soundtrack is also incredible. 


The game feel, much like and partially dur to the animation, is very fluid. You run, shoot, and platform through stages with a lot of speed but the game rewards precision. You are a big target and most enemies require good aim or multiple shots to take down but you also have rapid fire even with the most basic weapon. You also have a double jump that also doubles as an attack to enemies below you which can sometimes be the key to beating certain bosses and is great for some of the very vertically focused stages. Vectorman may be a big robot but he moves with a lot of grace and momentum and the transformation power ups add variety while increasing the pace even further. There are also a few short gimmick levels where you fight the main boss Warhead in a shift of gameplay style which are confusing at first but quick if you know what you are doing. All of this gives the game a very kinetic flow and smoothness many similar titles lack.



I could continue writing this for probably hours going into a lot more detail about the story, contests (Yes multiple), cheat codes, promo material, speedrun strategies, sequel (multipleish), and more but I want to save that for a potential future project. For now though I hope you've enjoyed reading me gush about this game.",GINTegg64,1h0ul4e,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h0ul4e/i_want_to_ramble_about_vectorman/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h0ul4e/i_want_to_ramble_about_vectorman/,2024-11-27 03:09:38,15,0.69,15,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h0ul4e

I know it's not considered an all-timer but with the setting, exploration, and minute-to-minute gameplay I always find myself coming back to it every few years. I don't even play the main campaign, I just turn off the mini-map and wander around, enjoying the atmosphere and experience. A game I always wanted to get into but just couldn't enjoy is UnReal World. The conceptual design, world-building, and player agency is what sold me, (not to mention Mandalore Gaming's review) but the sum of its parts never kept me coming back for more. UnReal is a game that I'll reinstall every so often, thinking this is the time it'll stick, but I can never overcome the first few hours whatever scenario I pick.  Playing Primal again got me thinking just how amazing a combination of the gameplay of Primal and the depth of UnReal World would be a dream game for me.

It's incredible to me that the story of the game centers around a man taking the dead body of a woman to a forbidden land and doing the dirty work of a God to hopefully resurrect her. He will not accept that she's dead and fights to bring her back to life. Whereas you, as a player, goes about defeating the colossi in the forbidden land by scaling them, hanging on for dear life, and hoping not to get flung to the ground and stomped.

What I'm saying here is: Both the point of the story and the mechanic of the game itself revolve around the idea: ""Hold on, don't let go.""

The main character's position in the story is also the literal control tactic you used to beat the game.

gaming,"An argument for playing Alien: Isolation if you're interested, but scared
","Please disagree if you've played and think, ""Yeah, no. This is 10,000% full of shit. Nice try, Xenomorph.""  
  
**But at least on NORMAL difficulty, I really think this game is on your side and wants you to beat it.** Some games make you have fun via good storytelling and great dialogue. Other games make you have fun by throwing lots of action and enemies at you and putting you in a flow state. I think this game makes you have fun by TERRIFYING you, but not in a frustrating, or time-wasting way.  
  
I realized this (or convinced myself of this) like 45% of the way through my recent first playthrough. And once I realized it, I moved swiftly through the remaining 55% and I sincerely, absolutely loved it. I didn't rush the second half or anything, but the first 45% took me a very long time, and I would spend each play-session kind of procrastinating booting the game up. I felt so much dread and anxiety just looking at the main menu with the GIANT face of Jupiter staring at you lol.

You constantly see Jupiter throughout the game, always reminding you of how small or helpless you are.

But I think a big part of my dread actually came from the save system. You can't save whenever you want. You have to do it at certain checkpoints. And that whole concept just made me very tense, and I loathed the idea of losing good progress.  
  
But this idea that ***""the game is on your side""*** occurred to me when I came across a checkpoint, then struggled through a 15-minute tense chunk of the map, and then came to another save point. I thought, ""Huh. That was like a quick, self-contained section."" And then I realized that the whole game is sort of structured that way. You have 19 main missions, but I think each mission can be broken apart into lots of tiny sections. Each save point is like the beginning of a mini-chapter.  
  
When you die, it can feel devastating. But then you realize that you never really lose that much progress. They are very generous with the save points.  
  
And so I think the game makes a double-edged agreement with you. It agrees to let you save a lot, but in return you have to be ok with getting REALLY fucking scared lmao.  
  
If the game was bullshitty, I think the save points would be like 30-minutes apart. And then if the alien grabbed you from above, it would feel super frustrating and stupid and more annoying than scary.  
  
But the way it works in actuality, if you die, it only takes like a minute or two to get back to where you were. You move much faster the second (or third, or sixth...) time around because like half the battle is being lost and not knowing the map. So the game can kill you in all sorts of horrifying ways--""THE XENOMORPH CAN DO THAT!?!??!""--but because it doesn't waste your time, you're having FUN being scared, and aren't loathing having to replay large sections.  
  
This makes it even more effective because you lean in and cooperate with the experience of being scared. You aren't pulled away from the experience because you're dreading having to replay long sections.  
  
I really don't think this game wants you to give up. It is also strangely therapeutic to face all of this anxiety and fear head-on, and slooowly make relentless forward progress through it all. You can hide in a locker as long as you want, but eventually, you have to get out and press forward.  
  
I think anyone with a normal tolerance for fear can have a great time with Alien: Isolation. (But for people who actually suffer from high anxiety, it might be too much. The game is legitimately scary.) BUT IT'S ON YOUR SIDE! (But your neck will hurt because your shoulders will constantly be up by your ears.) BUT IT WANTS YOU TO BEAT IT!

Rare under Xbox released some amazing and creative games:

-Grabbed by the Ghoulies got punished by the hype of being the first ""Xbox Rare"", but on his own is a fun, little game with a lot of ideas. Is it perfect? No, not al all. But is fun, and full of the ""Rare magic"".

-Kameo, pretty much the same thing. Is not perfect at all but it got a lot of fun ideas and is overall a quality launch game.

-Viva Pinata is fu***ng awesome.

-trouble in paradise is more VP so is fu***ng awesome.

-ok, N&amp;B. This is controversial and i agree on most of the surface criticism: yes, the game is not a good Banjo Kazooie sequel, and it was the wrong game at the wrong time. But on his own is a very good game. The idea is great, and the builder is extremely well done. Proof of that, Tears of the Kingdom has clearly taken a lot of ideas from this game, im sure about that.

-Rare Replay is, at least for me, the best collection of all time

-Sea of Thieves gor a rough release but as it is now, Is one of Rare's best games, and probably their biggest success. 

Now, we got some bad stuff (Perfect Dark Zero) but it got heavly surpassed by the good stuff. Even the short Kinect era got good games.

gaming,Games that started off underrated but become overpraised as the years progressed and their fan base grew?,"So we've played titles that fell under the radar: whether because of poor marketing, heavy competition, or just the general shenanigans of the Steam algorithm, it ended-up not catching many eyes save those of a dedicated bunch, who in turn propagated its name enough to the point where it achieved cult status.

That's all well and fine, and a sign that game development never truly ends with publication. It led to titles like Among Us turning a profit for their company, which is what we all want at the end of the day.

However, have there ever been cases where you noticed a lesser-known title go from underappreciated to being over-hyped by its fans? It's not that the game itself is bad, but the sum of its parts do not equate to the image painted by enthusiasts?

For me, I would say SOMA falls under this category. Despite being made by the devs of Amnesia, it didn't catch as many eyes. Yet any praise you do hear for it no doubt speaks of an existential masterpiece that's unfortunately not QUITE accurate.

Genre-wise, for me it’s Metroidvania to no one’s surprise where the games tend to be fairly short in the modern age but completing them is so satisfying and each replay is about beating your previous time or completion percentage. I’ve played through Super Metroid and Metroid Dread fully twice but played through each pretty deep on a few runs afterward. Same with Hollow Knight.

But, I’m also of the opinion that too many options is bad. For instance why do I have 20 sliders to shape how my lips look? Now I now some people enjoy spending five hours using those sliders to make the perfect character, but for those who don’t we are left with like 10 male and 10 female presets max normally.

I wish more cc’s would provide more presets for individual features. I want to choose lips 12 to go with nose 34 to go with eyes 23 and eyebrows 56.

gaming,"If You Don’t Mind, I’d Like To Share a Story About Why Today is Special For Me","Hey all, if this sort of thing isn’t allowed then I apologise and please delete.

I’ve played games since the 90s. I remember my Dad playing RE1 and 2. They terrified me, to the point that even my younger sister would do a zombie impression which also terrified me.

a few years pass, I carry on playing games. I used to buy a gaming magazine religiously, Nintendo Official Magazine (lovingly referred to as NOM). One issue had a huge feature about how great and different this new Resident Evil 4 was. At that, before CEX and trading standards intervention, people of any age could trade in games. No age restriction, no ID needed.

for me, this felt like a conflict tailor made for me. I knew I was too scared to play a Resident Evil game on my own, but at the same time, if NOM said a game was a must play, then I did. I bought PN.03 and Geist as a 12/13 year having no idea what they were.

anyway, I buy RE4. I’m anxious at first, but quickly - and surprisingly - I’m pretty good. My Dad comes in asks me what I was playing. When I told him, he looked shocked, then proud in the way only parents can be. It was like a tiny passing of the torch. ”you’ll be a man, one day son” kinda thing.

so RE4 becomes one of my top 5 games and I play it every 5 years or so.

fast forward 20 years. I still game and whatnot. A close friends dies in a car crash which hits me hard. I turn to hard drugs, end up homeless, cut myself off from friends and family cos I didn’t want them seeing me like that.

long story short, I end up having to do a 6 month prison stint on drug-related charges.

whilst I was inside, I detoxed from drugs, became a tutor to teach people how to read and write. Since release, I found my own place to live, and got a job in a library.

I’ve been sober for 19 months, and I’ve finally saved up enough money to buy as PS4 and Resident Evil 4 Remake and I so fucking excited boys and girls.

I feel so fucking grateful that I could change my life around to get to this point.

But I'm just all sorts of confused when I look into it myself.

For example, there's Phillips which has their own Hue system, except there's like all these different things about it, like a sync box and a bridge, and light sources that include strips, bars, tubes and bulbs.  I'd probably be fine with some strips to stick to the back of my TV, but the sync box and bridge, I have no idea what I need to achieve the effect I want.

I also saw a cheaper alternative on Amazon that uses some sort of camera to watch the screen and sync the lights that way, but is it effective enough?  A camera seems like there would be problems involved in reading the screen properly.

I dunno.

gaming,Thoughts on when RPGs kills off a playable character for good or permanently removes them?,"I have been thinking about this since I played &gt;!Xenoblade 3!&lt;. Late in the game, the story sets up for &gt;!Mio!&lt;, one of the characters, to die. I didn't buy this for minute for a minute even though the build up was very good because I knew the game wasn't going to handicap me by taking away one of my six main characters for good, especially since it would render Noah unable to use the Interlink ability. Beyond that, &gt;!Xenoblade's!&lt; developers rarely take characters away from the player for good.

This got me thinking and correct me if I am wrong, but I believe RPGs having unavoidable deaths for your main characters that prevents you from using them became less common during the 5th generation of consoles. In any shape or form, an RPG having a character removed the player's control for good through circumstances a player can't avoid seemed less common.

An obvious example is Final Fantasy. It's second entry killed off numerous characters, so much so that one of its remakes makes an entire party out of them. FF4 has characters seemingly die, though only one really bites the dust, Tellah, a character who is designed to be less useful than casters you get after him. Even though the other characters who leave the party don't die, you still lose access to them.

Final Fantasy V killed off one of its main characters, Galuf, and while this has an impact on the story, in terms of gameplay it doesn't effect the player since you get a new character with identical stats. In the context of V, the game is focused on players learning skills from its job system so denying the player someone they weren't through so much work to level up and customize would be a killjoy.

VI's only unavoidable deaths are Biggs and Wedge, characters who are established as villains and are inferior to characters you get later. VII famously does kill one of your heroes in one of the series most emotional scenes, after that, the series stopped taking main characters from you, unless XV and XVI did this because I admit I am less familiar with them. If a hero did die, it typically happened in the ending, no matter what people who want to claim VIII's events are a dying dream by Squall may think.

A different series, Phantasy Star, in its fourth entry, introduces a hero named Alys as a decoy protagonist who dies early in the game, though an observant player would notice that Alys levels up and gains stat increases slower than other characters. A rule of thumb for RPGs is that a character who is designed to less useful as they level won't be sticking around forever. Persona 3 in its original version did the opposite

This is a JRPG series; for western RPGs, removing a character for good is, to my knowledge, still a rare occurrence without giving the character a way to prevent it. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic only has a mandatory character being lost for good with Trask, a character who dies at the end of the tutorial, and Kreia when she predictably betrays the party. Mass Effect in its first outing forces the player to chose between sacrificing Kaiden or Ashley. Outside of them, and if my memory is wrong, correct me, the only deaths you can't avoid are Legion and Thane in 3, and they are no longer squadmates, so while their deaths are emotional scenes, it doesn't impact gameplay.

Related to Final Fantasy V killing a character and replacing him with a statistically identical one, Tales of Symphonia has the party mentor Kratos betray the team and leaves the party for a long period, and since the developers didn't want to deprive players of him from a gameplay perspective, a new character named Zelos is introduced who plays exactly the same. The ""Tales of"" series does not like taking a character away for good or even a long period, so much so that one entry, Tales of Vesperia, sets up one hero, Raven, betraying the team and acting as a boss, the possibility of him dying is quickly glossed over.

These are examples I can think of where an RPG works around deaths taking a character away for good. Does anyone think a party member, one who isn't designed to be less useful later in the game, really should be removed for good if it serves the story? For the most part, I see it as something the player should be able to avoid and it should act as a punishment for making the wrong decisions.",Sensitive-Hotel-9871,1gz44pf,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gz44pf/thoughts_on_when_rpgs_kills_off_a_playable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gz44pf/thoughts_on_when_rpgs_kills_off_a_playable/,2024-11-24 22:59:34,163,0.79,163,0,179,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gz44pf

A few days ago, I got MDE for PC. My laptop has a 1050ti, so the game runs at 60fps on low/medium settings. I fell in love with it.

Actually, I fell so much in love with it that I thought I’d get it for my Xbox Series X to enjoy better visuals.

And... I don’t like the game.

I don’t know why, but something feels off about this game when played on a console. The responsiveness, the shooting mechanics, the overall quality—something isn’t right. Honestly, I don’t even think the graphics look as good on the console.

Is it badly optimized (well, duh, 30fps), or was it just not meant to be played on consoles, with bad ports to boot? I don’t know.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Or it's just me?

gaming,Best Game to Recapture a Gamers Heart?,"  I’ll say more below but in a nutshell they lost interest and happiness in gaming and it’s now been roughly 3 years since they played anything at all.  The last game they played was Cyberpunk 2077 and they spent over a thousand, maybe two thousand hours in it; this from when it was launched, on OC, screw the patches.  And they’d probably start up again as soon as their new PC comes in.  They also enjoyed the first The Forest, The Witcher 3, Sekiro, Darkest Dungeon, the first three Mass Effect Games, Dragon Age: Origins (and only that DA game) plus a number of shooters I can’t remember.  In the dark ages they really liked the original Baldur’s Gate and Baldur’s Gate 2, with expansions, as well as Doom 3 and Half Life 2 plus its packs.

  So, the above is just there to give you the best memory I have of their history, if that helps give ideas for some game that might whet their interest and appetite for playing.  Now, in regards the reason they stopped playing, so you’ll understand it’s more than just growing older and past the hobby.  They have a few mental health issues, including bipolar depression (think of it as really, really severe depression) and anhedonia.  Anhedonia is where you stop being able to take pleasure in anything, and in the worst cases the most basic and simplest of pleasures.  They’re currently in therapy and taking medication that seems to have put them in a much better headspace.  In addition to that they’ll be taking a few college classes next year, just light stuff at first.

  So my thought was that a hobby like gaming has previously been a real way for them to engage and get some entertainment.  I’ve debated between console and PC; I view console as more casual personally, where you’re able to launch and drop out with far greater ease which could be a real benefit.  But they’re going to need a computer no matter what and since previously they were used to computer gaming, I feel they’d miss those superior graphics and performance too much.

  Anyway, I’m looking for some help to pick out a game or games that might either ease them back into gaming, and / or securely catch and lure them.",Appellion,1gz1k17,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gz1k17/best_game_to_recapture_a_gamers_heart/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gz1k17/best_game_to_recapture_a_gamers_heart/,2024-11-24 21:07:02,0,0.41,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gz1k17

The amount of times I hear people say that they only like COD for zombies and people who just spend hours playing only zombies.

 In my opinion yea its a fun little bonus game mode but I dont get what the craze is about. Felt the same way back in WaW and BO days. To me the biggest thing is, and this is closer related to earlier COD zombies games, is the lack of progression. There is no goal you just go and go until you hit your eventual failure. Yea you spent hours and hours getting to high rounds and now youre dead and for what? This sucked even more when you didnt even gain EXP for playing zombies. These types of modes just seem more like time wasters than anything to me. 

Any time Id get online and super hyped to play some multiplayer or these days Warzone and the boys are saying they want to play zombies I just roll my eyes. Just brain dead bore fest that will always end in failure at some point with nothing to show for the time. Im competitive I like to play against REAL people. Im not a super sweat demon by any means but I am competitive and I need to feel like Im beating someone at something and making some kind of progress and have some kind of end goal or victory condition.

A feeling of which you’re numb, and playing a game or games start to feel like a chore/a slog to get through. It’s like going to a well-paying job but you don’t feel satisfied or happy to do said job, but you feel like you have to.

Hell, even getting the case of “Gaming Blues” can present like it’s burnout. But whereas burnout is just another case of “Not enjoying the game you love playing”, here, it’s a case of playing multiple games that you love, that start said feeling.

For me, there’s 3 things I experience when I have the Gaming Blues.

1. The game I’m playing starts getting really difficult for no real reason, even though I’ve already become used to that difficulty.

2. I haven’t thought to myself “Okay, i wanna go on (insert game here) after I’m done doing something” and often contemplate whether or not I have enough time in the day to play it.

3. When my friends don’t feel like playing the game I’m enjoying with them. This rings true for multiplayer games, like Stardew, or Minecraft. I’d only feel like playing that game if they’re up for it.

gaming,Seeing out of place skins in every AAA multiplayer game is driving me insane (plus BO6 and general cosmetic MTX rant),"It’s like games don’t have a set art style anymore. They all just try to copy Fortnite. I hop into Black Ops 6 and see people running around as flaming super soldiers and green dragons. It’s so jarring. Even Rainbow 6 has this problem. 

The battle passes are also insane. Why am I being bombarded with ads for a battle pass in a game that I paid $70 for that has a 1 year lifespan. I’m talking about you BO6… 

Like it’s insane and it’s also stupid because no game feels unique anymore. Gone are the days of actually having unique cosmetics that are tied to progression. It’s also just sad because I know this is gonna be the same deal with the next CoD next year and the year after. They’re all gonna look the same.

Like remember in Black Ops 1 when your player skin was determined by the perks you used and the map you were playing on? Like this was such a cool system and made sense for a Call of Duty game. You’d get soldiers that actually look like what their perks would allow them to do and they’re wearing colors that reflect the colors on the map so camouflage actually has a purpose. With this new system, this is never gonna happen again. 

I’d take paid dlcs any day over being bombarded with ads for skins in a game I already paid $70 for.

gaming,The amount of emphasis on GOTY and review scores is terrible for actual gamers,"Why do people care about GOTY as much as they do? I feel like we're constantly being programed by websites to care so much about review scores and GOTY. 

I already know what my game of the year is: It's Age of Mythology: Retold on Xbox Series X. I grew up playing AoM casually, got into ranked Halo Wars 2, and now I LOVE AoM on my controller.

Does anybody else feel that way? Probably not, but that's kind of my point. AoM isn't on the list of GOTY obviously, but I already know it's the best game I've played all year. What are the review scores of AoM? I don't know, but I'd give it a 9.5/10 personally. Why should I care if IGN gives it a 9 or a 6 or a 3? 

We shouldn't care.   
  
How many GOTY's have you even agreed with in the past? I feel like RDR2 was better than GoW 4, but I loved both games. I thought Doom Eternal was a much better video game than TLOU II, and there are a few others I heavily disagree with but mostly, when I look back at those years, I spent most of the respective year playing something else, like Rust, or Halo - games that played for years.

While playing DA the Veilguard I couldn't help but ask myself why these side quests were ignoring the high stakes the story was propping up.

And I recently played FF15 again and just feel like that whole game was designed for you to do mundane quests to get you to explore the map they made. First open world FF and its full of side quests that have no bearing on the main story. One example is literally right after Insomnia is bombed and Cid is opening up about Noctis's dad after learning he was killed, he pivots hard and asks to to gather metal scrap for a weapon upgrade. - This rips me out of any emotional investment I was feeling for the story.

Maybe it's just a burn out of gaming in general these days, but I'd like to believe there's some kind of game that we'd both enjoy.

What we've enjoyed playing over the years:

\* League of Legends (Specifically URF, a game mode that only exists every month or two out of the year, otherwise we never play League anymore since we're burnt out from over a decade of it)

\* Helldivers 2

\* Hyperjam

\* For the King

\* Valheim

\* V Rising

\* AoE2

\* WoW Classic

What we've tried and dropped out of boredom/general dislike/burnout:

\* Overwatch

\* Any other MOBA (Dota 2, HotS, Smite 1/2)

\* Deadlock

\* Any other MMO (WoW, FF14, Lost Ark, GW)

\* Most other survival games we've tried (NMS, Pax Dei, Enshrouded, Necesse, Terraria, Corepunk, Rust, Ark)

\* Diablo 4

Some additional notes: Since we're both old and have no reflexes anymore, multiplayer FPS's are usually turn-offs. We usually like games that involve some kind of strategy. We're PC-exclusive. We're not hyper competitive gamers.

My challenge is this:

In Custom difficulty mode, set the item frequency to generous amounts. Meaning you will almost always come across some food, and weaponry. However, here’s where things kick up a notch.

gaming,Have You Played Other Games Like Dead by Daylight? What Makes It Stand Out?,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to start a discussion for fans (or former fans) of *Dead by Daylight*. Have you played other similar games? What made you stick with them or quit? And if you're still playing *Dead by Daylight*, what do you think it has that other games haven’t been able to achieve?

Personally, I've tried other asymmetric games like:

* **Evil Dead: The Game**: While it had some interesting ideas, I found many of its mechanics frustrating. The balance between characters wasn’t great, and bugs were far too frequent. On top of that, the developers took a long time to fix these issues, which made it hard to enjoy the game long-term.
* **Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed**: The matchmaking system was the most frustrating part for me. It didn’t allow you to choose the role you wanted to play directly, only letting you mark a ""preferred"" role. Even then, you could end up playing 5 consecutive matches without getting your preferred role. This really ruined the experience for me and many others, as we couldn’t fully enjoy the game from the perspective we wanted.

Despite its own balance issues and bugs, *Dead by Daylight* still seems to reign supreme in this genre. Why do you think other similar games haven’t been able to match its success?

I’d love to hear if you’ve tried similar games, if you’re still playing *Dead by Daylight*, or what made you stop playing. What do you think of the competition? Do you feel any other game had the potential to surpass *Dead by Daylight* but fell short?",wolfcry62,1gwrj1x,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gwrj1x/have_you_played_other_games_like_dead_by_daylight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gwrj1x/have_you_played_other_games_like_dead_by_daylight/,2024-11-21 21:57:40,0,0.38,0,0,16,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gwrj1x
gaming,"Competitive gamers, what are your thoughts on 32"" monitors?","Is there anyone out there who mainly plays competitive PC games and also has a 32"" monitor? I currently have a 27"" and already will occasionally feel like I miss out on a slight edge from having to move my eyes around the screen too much. 

For those of you who don't know, generally a smaller monitor is considered more competitive for fps. 

I am considering an upgrade to a 32"" oled and just want to get some thoughts on it. I do play a lot of pve-centric games like elden ring or helldivers, and for those a 32"" would be great. But on the other end of the spectrum, I also play a lot of games like Overwatch, Hunt Showdown, and PUBG, and I kinda wanna try to get into Valorant soon too as well. 

I know that I could just upgrade to a 27"" oled but my mindset is, if I'm already gonna be spending a lot of money, might as well spend a little bit more if I can get something that is a lot better and ultimately ends up as a better value. And the consensus seems to be that the asus pg32ucdm is the best oled out right now, and it only comes in a 32"". 

And yes, I also know that it's not like I'm competing in tournaments or anything so it's not like it REALLY matters but I still want to have a fairly competitive experience when I do play those pvp games because I do like to sweat on occasion when I play ranked.

gaming,User reviews: A proposal.,"I recently saw a video on Fextralife where he explained that Bio Ware did something fishy with the new Dragon Age game. What they did was released a demo to several gaming journalists, and allowed them to score the demo. Any journalists that scored a 9 or higher was then given access to the full game while the rest had to sit out. This caused a majority of the reviews of the final product to be very high. Because of this it’s hard for a regular gamer like me to trust professional gaming reviews. 


The problem here is that I also don’t trust user reviews that much either. User reviews are full of trolls, fanboys, haters, people who score a game for political reasons or people who are just plain terrible at judging a game’s quality. This is why Sony doesn’t allow user reviews on the PS5. 

On Xbox and Steam however I can still see user reviews and I think they are helpful, but only if you know how to filter through the reviews properly as to not be influenced by reviews that happen to be the first ones you see. The problem is the first ones you see are there based on a “helpfulness” system and there is where I believe we need a change. 

The problem with the helpfulness system is that it allows a majority to select only the reviews they agree with as helpful ,therefore pushing those reviews to the top whether or not they’re actually helpful, while suppressing reviews they don’t agree with that could actually be helpful.  For instance almost any “souls like” game is going to have a huge fan base and the positive reviews are always going to be marked as helpful while the negative reviews will be marked as not helpful, despite many people who may not enjoy a souls like game not knowing it’s a souls like game being tricked into thinking the game is something they would enjoy based on the first few reviews they happen see.

So my proposal is this. Steam and Xbox can still have “helpfulness” as an option to select, but the default order of reviews should be “most recent“ not “most helpful”. 

Here are my reasons why:

1. It eliminates fanboys and haters from rigging what is seen first.

2. Games are constantly updated, so the first reviews you see are based on recent updates rather than what the state of the game was during the writing of the review.

3. Sometimes a game gets better or worse in the late game, so if someone wants to change their review based on their most recent experience, it will be more likely seen rather than buried in a torrent of reviews.

4. Games sometimes have major bugs that aren’t always apparent in the first few days of playing. So people who leave reviews early may not include those bugs, and when they finally discover the bugs, updating their review will put it back on top.

The biggest flaw with this system is people might be tempted to change their reviews every day just to stay on top, so to prevent this I think we could also implement a feature that only allows you to change your review once right away , after that there’s a waiting period to change it again that increases each time. For example you can change your review anytime you want the first time, you must wait 3 days to change it again, then 10 days the third time, then after that you can only change it once every 30 days, but only if you play the game at least 10 hours during those 30 days.

gaming,Can you improve in games like COD through practice or is it mostly innate?,"I've never been much of an fps player. The only competitive fps game I played was the original Halo when it came out 20+ years ago. I've also played through the Stalker series (not the new one yet) but that was single player. Other than that, nothing. I'm nearly a complete noob with these games. 

My husband doesn't play many games but when he does it's usually multiplayer fps games like COD. I tried a few rounds on his account a few weeks back and I was surprised how much I liked it despite getting my ass kicked. After, he bought the game for me so I could play on my own account.

I've improved a bit since I started playing but I still usually finish in the bottom 2. My reaction time sucks and I don't think there's any way to improve that but I also think maybe I'm not aggressive enough and that's not helping either.

gaming,Should games be sold as single use consoles to combat cheating?,"Cheating is rampant in gaming. I've got a friend that I've played games with for years that I suspect of cheating.

I think about 10% or more of Rust players are cheating, and similar numbers in games like Mortal Online 2.

Its everywhere, and even low percentages of cheaters just ruins games - ruins them completely. 1 in 10 guys in Rust cheat, and it makes roaming very difficult for anyone who isn't also cheating. 1 in 10 guys in Mortal Online cheats, and it has a profound impact on the game.

So there are a bunch of anti-cheat software companies out there, but they're often at least partially owned by authoritarian governments (such as Easy Anti-Cheat) and they're incredibly invasive and frankly don't seem to work worth a damn anyway.

So what if we went back to cartridges (I'm that old) except instead of a cartridge, you get a pair of USB slots and a video output (or perhaps even custom peripherals like a custom keyboard and mouse), and developers start shipping hardware? Something like a beefy Raspberry PI. 

Pros:

* Should be much harder to hack, and require specialized equipment. Should drastically decrease the prevalence of cheaters.
* Hardware could be customized for the game. Rather than buying a GPU, developers could ship custom hardware specific for their game.

Cons:

* Significantly higher costs
* Significantly lower graphical performance
* Break or lose your game and you have to buy a new one.

Now, before you just shrug this idea off as crazy, consider this. In the long run, this is likely to happen. As the price/performance of chips continues to improve, eventually this will be cheap enough to do. Having the game run on dedicated hardware should definitely make many hacks very difficult to pull off.

Now it won't work for every hack type. Aimbotting would probably still be possible with some kind of funky camera and mouse encasing device combo, but even if it is you've greatly increased the cost and difficulty in cheating in games. Also, if you're caught cheating, you could be hardware banned.

Say doing this causes games to have graphical performance that is 10 years behind the state of the art (So Grand Theft Auto V levels of graphics) and cost 4x as much. Isn't that worth it?

Maybe not for every game, but certainly for competitive games right? For pro FPS games, or hardcore survival games, or full loot MMORPGS, this kind of setup has to make some sense.

gaming,What game has the worst player base?,"Ever play a game where you like the game itself, but the player base kind of ruins it for you? Toxic player bases would count, but also just games where you did not at all click with the community or the mindset of players in the game. 

For me, it’s World of Warcraft. It has many problems, but generally I like the gameplay loop, world, lore, art style, etc. 

Any time I try to go back to the game, I quit after a few months because the player base just sucks ass. It seems like, and this has been the case since I very first played it like 16 years ago, that 95% of the people on WoW will do *anything possible* to *not play the game*. 

Everything is a min-max exploit fest to blast to the level cap and get the best gear, skipping as much content as possible, with the goal of repeating the same 2-3 raids nonstop trying to get the highest damage. It just makes the entire game feel pointless.

Can anyone tell me if I can go back and  earn achievements in Mafia III after I've completed the game? 

I know some are missable and some can only be gotten with a second play through. 

I'm currently on my second play through to earn the ones I didn't get the first time but when I initially played the game a few years back I wasn't a trophy hunter and didn't realise how many I'd missed so now I want ro try and get all them all. 

I like tidying up and collecting trophies after completing the game so just wondering if it's possible at all so I don't complete the game (again) without collecting as I go if it's not possible to get them afterwards.
