pcgaming,I can't remember the name of this game,"I thought it was Path of Exile but it's not since the characters are too small in that game.  I somehow got bombarded with youtubes of it a &lt;year ago showing ways to access a lot of secret areas where you find really cool item loot.  the loot looked awesome.  It has a similar style to PoE but the main character is much larger and in 3rd person from what i remember kind of like Helldivers size/pov, maybe bigger.  It looked like the items he picked up showed on the character too.

anybody know what game i'm thinking of?  I feel like the secret areas that required you to do certain things to access set it apart from a lot of rpg's i've seen.  while many have that this game seemed to have a lot of them.  i wanted to get this for the Steam sale but i can't remember the name.",Real-Tangerine-9932,1h4xs94,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4xs94/i_cant_remember_the_name_of_this_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4xs94/i_cant_remember_the_name_of_this_game/,2024-12-02 15:40:09,0,0.33,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4xs94

pcgaming,"Star Wars Jedi Survivor &amp; Fallen Order are still broken on PC, do not let the dark side tempt you with sales","In light of the all the sales now til the end of the year, here's a little reminder or notice if you're unfamiliar:

Jedi Survivor and Fallen Order infamously suffer from shader and traversal stutters. These occur on *every* PC, regardless of hardware or whether you're able to notice them. There are other bugs too, like white flashing when turning corners/the camera, flickering lights, and even basic things like menu settings not engaging. Is DLSS on or is your PC just that bad? Who knows! 

To get you caught up, here's Digital Foundry's analysis of the most recent [Jedi Survivor Patch 9 - Improved but still very poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw) by Alex Battaglia, preeminent expert on PC game performance and leader in the #StutterStruggle. 

So, while Patch 9 improved shader comp and shader stutter, **both Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor *still* to this day suffer from shader compilation and travel stutter.** **Everyone** on PC will encounter several types of stuttering, *regardless of how good the hardware.* There's also **[animation stutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw&amp;t=573)**, which affects camera movement and character animations. A triple threat stutterer!

I can also vouch that the issues occur on the current fastest CPU for gaming, the 9800x3D, which I use OC'd to 5.7Ghz and run with 48gb DDR5-8000 CL40 EXPO, Crosshair X870 Hero, and RTX 4090; all stability tested &gt;24hrs, latest drivers, no issues like this with any other games that aren't also known and common.

Oh, and [even the PS5 Pro version of Survivor is having issues right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8?si=wYfe9swwp0dpR98K). EA is aware and investigating, patch is assumed/confirmed to come soon, but it's just another example of their poor standards.

I don't think it's appropriate to continue rewarding EA's and Respawn's repeated lack of respect for paying customers by spending more money or playtime on these lackluster products. Just means they will continue to reward you with the same or lower standards next time. If as many of us as possible opt not to purchase them, even at a steep discount, they might find our collective lack of faith disturbing enough to fix these issues in the next game, if not the previous.",FractaLTacticS,1h4gog6,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,2024-12-01 23:22:05,906,0.76,906,0,339,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4gog6

pcgaming,"BOWLOUT: A wacky first-person bowling shooter by 2 indie devs | Releases on Steam January 7th, 2025","Hi PCGaming! Next year a friend and I will release our first ever game on Steam, and we would like to share it with as many people as possible!

* Release date trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9\_\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9__U)

As you'll see in the attached trailer video, in BOWLOUT you'll throw lots of bowling balls or use pins as weapons to proceed through a pin-infested bowling centre and eliminate the source of the attack. It's a relatively short game with a simple gameplay loop - perfect to blow off some steam without getting attached to a long story. There's also achievements, unlockable ball colors and controller support!

Hopefully you'll enjoy this trailer and share/wishlist the game - it helps us with the algorithm, increasing the chances of the fabled 'front page' slot! If you have any questions about the game or would like to create content/articles on it, I would gladly help! Comment here or message me directly.
