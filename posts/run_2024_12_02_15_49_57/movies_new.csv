movies,What do you think of the women characters in John McTiernan's films?,"Hi everyone,

John McTiernan is one of the legends of action cinema, known for iconic movies like *Die Hard*, *Predator*, and *Last action Hero*. His movies are packed with high-stakes tension, larger-than-life heroes, and explosive action, but what about the women in these stories? I’d love to hear your thoughts on how they’re portrayed!

Here are a few women in his films that stand out to me:

* **Holly Gennaro McClane (*****Die Hard*****)**: She’s a career-driven, no-nonsense woman who also happens to be at the heart of John McClane’s emotional journey. Her strength comes across in the way she handles Hans Gruber and leads the hostages, but do you think she’s given enough agency beyond being someone for John to save?
* **Anna (*****Predator*****)**: At first, Anna seems like a typical prisoner-of-war character, but she becomes a key figure in unraveling the Predator’s backstory. She provides a voice for her people and their legends. Does her role feel substantial, or does it fall into the trope of the ""exotic other""?
* **Virginia Baker (*****The Thomas Crown Affair*****)**: Rene Russo’s character is sharp, confident, and undeniably one of McTiernan’s most complex women. She’s Thomas Crown’s equal, which is rare in movies like this. Does she break the mold of how women are portrayed in action/thrillers?
* **Whitney and Irene (*****Last Action Hero*****)**: This movie pokes fun at action clichés, and it’s fun to see the ""screaming damsel"" and ""grounded working-class mom"" tropes being played for laughs. What do you think McTiernan was trying to say about female characters in action films here?

I know McTiernan’s films are heavily focused on their male leads, but I’m curious—do you think the women in his movies hold their own? Which characters stand out to you, and which feel underdeveloped?

Would love to hear your thoughts and insights! 😊",Fennel_Zealousideal,1h4th9d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,2024-12-02 12:06:22,0,0.44,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4th9d

movies,Most Fitting Movie for Each Month,"Haven’t seen a post like this, so I figured I’d make one.

What are the most fitting movies for each of the 12 months of the year? Which movies best fit the vibes and aesthetics of each month? Thought this might be an interesting discussion.

January: Something grim and desolate like Fargo would fit pretty good, wintery and cold and all

February: Equally as cold and miserable, but with the added benefit of Valentines Day. Some sort of romance movie with a wintery theme would fit here, especially if set on Valentines Day. Groundhog Day is also a strong contender.

March-April: No specific ideas, these blend together for me. Movies about spring would fit for all of both.

May: Still springtime, but also end-of-school and graduation, so any moviess about graduating or school letting out would fit.

June-Aug: These blend together for me. Plenty of summer movies, but not necessarily specific to a month. I will say, August also has back to school as a potential setting or theme, and I personally associate that month with dreary, overbearing heat and fatigue, the kind of visuals heavily present in the film Falling Down

September: School is fully back in swing, and I would lean towards placing a High School movie or something here.

October: There’s plenty of Halloween movies, but it would have to be one that celebrates fall and the month of October more so than just being scary. The miniseries Over the Garden Wall Would Fit, not sure of other examples 

November: Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be the easy choice for Thanksgiving, but I do wonder if there are any other films that would fire better.

December: There’s a litany of holiday movies of course, but out of all of them there’s have to be one that embodies the month as a whole and not just Christmas time. A plot incorporating the advent season might work, like Christmas Vacation, or a film that incorporates New Years.

I’m struggling with examples here, so I’d be excited to hear what others think",Bonobowl,1h4nfj0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,2024-12-02 05:05:55,0,0.5,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4nfj0
movies,3 Body Problem Problem Spoiler Warning,"Ok, so 3 body problem is a hella fun ride. Interesting story. 

The over all jist is that an alien species is traveling here in hopes of having a new home. They are vastly older than us an unimaginably more advanced. Thing is we develop way faster than they do. What took them eons to achieve took us generations. By the time they arrive we will have outpaced them.

It's a fun idea. 

My problem is at one point the species decides to show their power and prove to the world they are real. They do this by turning off the lights. Sun, stars, all poof. No light for humanity.   
  
So why not turn the lights off for a couple years and call it good when they get here? Plantlife would be gone, animals dependent on it, us included would be gone. Most species would not last years in darkness. 

They'd arrive to a thriving ecosystem ripe to be rebuilt as they choose. Not an exciting conclusion to a story but a checkmate for invading another species planet.

movies,Most realistic addiction movies you've seen? I find Requiem for a Dream is not it.,"The movie Requiem for a Dream is quite popular and often receives high ratings and praise from people who just saw it. And it is indeed a well done movie, but it's not a realistic movie about drugs.

I think of it more as a horror movie that uses drugs than a movie about people becoming addicted. It gets details wrong, like heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. That's just one example.

But it works great as anti-drug advertising for people who have never done drugs before. And like I said, it's a pretty good movie from the artistic point of view. Like the visuals are so powerful you can't forget certain scenes for a long time. Combined with the great score, you are left at the end of the film with that sense of horror, of powerlessness in face of terrible doom, of things unraveling rapidly for everyone. It's a nightmare visualized really.

So my question is whether you find the movie realistic, especially if you or someone you know has done drugs. And if not, which movie you thought accurately showed what it's like to become addicted.",adosculation,1h4mr4b,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4mr4b/most_realistic_addiction_movies_youve_seen_i_find/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4mr4b/most_realistic_addiction_movies_youve_seen_i_find/,2024-12-02 04:27:44,0,0.35,0,0,66,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4mr4b

movies,In Bruges. Wow.,"So I watched In Bruges and this is really a reddit movie, in a positive way, because it's one of these movies that you can find quoted around here, mainly in big threads, without loads of context, 'cause everyone and their mum but the reader knows where the damn quote originates from.

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

It's darkly comedic and sometimes tragic and it manages both emotions with ease.

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",PresentRevenue1347,1h4lwrm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,2024-12-02 03:41:52,119,0.77,119,0,77,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4lwrm

movies,Nutcrackers (2024) starring Ben Stiller ruined my day,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  
  
Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can’t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he’s ruined.
  
It’s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn’t exist. This is one of those times. The movie’s not entertaining, it’s not dramatic, it’s just pointless. I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it’s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time. You’ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

movies,"In Reservoir Dogs, what’s the point of most of the characters being racist? ","Been trying to watch the Tarantino movies recently and just finished Reservoir Dogs (which I thought was great). While I understand that use of the n-word and racism is common for Tarantino characters, I didn’t really understand what the point was of the majority of the characters being racist. I’m not saying that Tarantino is a racist himself or anything, I’m just not sure what value was added to the movie by the characters being racist. 

My only thought was that it could be to keep the audience from seeing the characters the “good guys” or as heroes, but I felt like the movie did a pretty good job of that in other respects. Would be happy to hear any thoughts on this. 

EDIT: while I understand that many people were indeed racist in the 90s (edited after reading comments stating the movie was set then), I more meant that the racist remarks seemed unprompted—it’s not as if they were being made to a black person, or in response to seeing or interacting with a black person.

movies,"The Prestige (2006) is a great magic trick, but once you know the secret, it impresses no one","I recently rewatched The Prestige after many years and although it is a completely different and exciting experience, the third act kinda doesn't make any logical sense.

# Obviously, big spoilers below as I will be discussing the ending so be forewarned...

First of all, I just want to say that I love this movie and I think it's among one of Nolan's best films. This is really nitpicky, so I hope you will read this more as a fan poking holes than a criticism.

There are 4 parts of the story that I either didn't see or overlooked in my first dozen viewings. But now that I've seen it again after many years, I can't ignore these illogical choices.

1. **Borden should have revealed their secret to save his own/brother's life.** I get that they have dedicated their lives to magic and withholding the secret but with the threat of a hanging, they should have said something if it gave them a chance at clemency. The surviving brother wouldn't have been able to keep performing magic anyways because the Alfred identity would also legally be dead; he'd have to start from scratch. And finally, by letting the trick die with one of the brothers, it makes Sarah's death even more meaningless. Taking the secret to the grave only makes thematic sense, but not logical sense.
2. **Cutter kinda kidnaps Jess and no one really cares**. After one of the Borden twins in hanged, the surviving Borden teams up with Cutter to get revenge on Angier. (So I guess he ends up revealing his secret anyways?) They show Cutter sneaking onto Lord Caldlow's estate and grabbing Jess during the day, but Lord Caldlow is murder by Borden at night. If Jess was kidnapped the same day as the murder, wouldn't Caldlow have be extra careful and maybe not go to his warehouse alone? And if Caldlow was murdered the night before the kidnapping, wouldn't the house be extra careful to guard over Jess? This was ignored just to give Borden a happy ending.
3. **Angier didn't need to keep killing this clones.** He literally could have made one clone and lived as twins, thus allowing him to perform the New Transported Man as Borden did. I get the initial shock of shooting the first clone, but to devise a plan to keep killing each sequential clone is illogical. In fact, I'm starting to believe that this was Tesla's initial design in the first place. Tesla doesn't strike me as someone who would build a cloning machine instead of a teleporting machine. I think he wanted to give Angier a perfect double so that he could perform the trick and enjoy the prestige half of the time. But story-wise, it would have been more poetic to drown night-after-night like his late-wife.
4. **Angier couldn't have pulled off the Real Transported Man as shown in the film.** We only see this trick performed twice and both times, you kinda have to turn your brain off.
   1. The first time is when Angier shows off the machine to Cutter and the talent manager. After he activates the machine, Prime-Angier just **disappears**. There was no trap door implemented yet; the talent manager is the one who suggests it. So at this point, there should be two Angiers and no way of killing either one of them.
   2. The second time is during one of the Great Danton's 100-show-run. Prime-Angier falls through the trap door and into the water tank and Borden is framed for supposedly killing him. But why doesn't Clone-Angier complete the trick and reappear for the Prestige? Clone-Angier is all the way up in the wings of the audience so how would he know that Borden would be under the stage? Realistically, Angier wouldn't know which show of the 100 shows should be the one when he needed to fake his own death and not reappear.

All in all, the film WORKS better without logic. I mean it's about magicians and there's a fucking cloning machine in the 1800s. But I mainly wanted to bring these up just to make sure I wasn't going insane. Thanks for taking the time to read.

Anyway, I wasn't on any mind altering chemicals, so I can't believe I was seeing things.

movies,And the Band Played On,"Today is World AIDS Day. 

This is just one of many great films that came out in the height of the AIDS epidemic.

I remember how hard it hit me. It provided a in depth picture of what was happening at that time. How people were being ostracized for simply being themselves.

There are other movies that tackled this subject, but this is the one I think about when I am jolted by the memory of what was back then.

movies,Me Before You (2016) Discussion,"Watched for the first time last night

The real standout to me was that all the characters seemed extremely relatable and understandable

I got a really gross feeling when it was clear there was emotional cheating going on, yet I still found myself rooting for the main actors. Even until the end, I wished she had broken it off with her boyfriend before moving on, but I couldn't help but wish her and Will would spend their last moments together

It was nice to see a movie, especially knowing this was made in 2016 tackle assisted suicide so well in my opinion. Will had resigned his life, but still provided 6 months to his parents for things to turn around. His parents fought on both sides to help and stop him. Louisa's mum also was vehemtly against it and didn't want her daughter being involved as she knew this would upset her

My favourite scene overall was Louisa coming home to nod her head ""no"" towards her sister. I've had situation that resulted in a near identical scene and I knew how much that would've hurt

I really enjoyed all the characters and the few bits of humour sprinkled throughout. The scenes were all engaging that what was originally ""I'm juat gonna sit here, you watch what you want"", turned into me glued to the screen after the first minute

Overall, I don't think this movie has any real flaws and I'd consider it a 10/10. I was very surprised I had never heard of this one and even more surprised to see the bad reception regarding the assisted suicide topic. I do wonder how I would've felt had I watched it in 2016

movies,Any mystery movies with identical twins that don’t use the identical twins trope?,"The identical twin trope in a mystery movie where you think it’s one person, but I was actually their identical twin all along. 

I’ve seen in this movies. Most recently when watching Killer Heat (2024). Spoilers ahead. The mystery revolves around finding out who killed a guy who happens to be an identical twin. As soon as the movie reveals early on that he’s an identical twin I said “the twins switch, and the ‘dead’ one is the alive one,” and I ended up being spot on. For a mystery movie it was really quite lame because every time I see identical twins I’m going to think they switched and it’s part of, or maybe even the entire mystery. 

This got me thinking. Are there any movies that have Identical twins, but don’t actually use the identical twins trope, or maybe use it has a red herring?

movies,How did you feel about Prisoners from Villeneuve?,"TONS of spoilers about the film:

Hi, let me tell you how it went for me first because I need to vent. 
Sunday night, I wanted a thriller that would keep me on the edge, fun as I could say. After one hour, I felt so helpless for the characters, just as they might feel. After the movie, I just feel like it was such a sad, cold, depressing tragedy about unhealed trauma. Keller need of being in absolute control and completely selling his soul in order to not being hurt more. The guy still trying to do the mazes from when he was kidnapped. Alex Jones who was kidnapped and tortured. And perhaps the most subtely tragic, Detective Loki whole past of being abused that might have kept him from suspecting the woman. I believe that’s how he was didn’t see Alex suffering or the guy with the maze lighting a candle or acting their deaths. 

All that to say, this film left me heartbroken for them. It’s a good thing with how these stories tend to be sensationalized through crime documentaries etc. But I would not say it’s a thriller, or a tragedy/drama with some real thriller mechanics.

movies,How many movies have you seen in your lifetime? ,"I've asked myself this and as an avid movie goer, I thought the number would be much higher and find others tend to overestimate. 

I sat down and over time, did my best to list out every movie I have ever seen. I tried to narrow it down to movies I know for a fact I have watched beginning to end. Not ""oh, I saw 70% of it on television once"" or ""eh, I think i watched it when I was a kid."" 

Especially for things like ubiquitous Disney films. Everyone is seemingly fimiliar with Bambi, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, etc, but I think the number of people who watched these movies in their entirety is lower. And while I myself couldnt exactly remember a time where I didnt know these characters, I also couldnt remember taking the time to watch them as a kid. So I didnt count them. Unless I knew 100% I watched it. 

I also tried not to count television specials unless they were feature length and billed as a movie. Does Channel Chasers from the Fairly OddParents count as a movie or is it a tv special? It sounds dumb but unless it was billed as a movie, I tried to avoid counting it. Kim Possible The Movie: So The Drama may only be like 70 minutes and aired straight to Disney Channel, but I counted it. 

So after counting movies I'd seen under the criteria and with a huge help from Letterboxd, I was able to pin down a rough estimate: 

At the age of 27, I have seen about **1000-1100 movies**. I definitely watch more movies I havent ever seen now than I did maybe a decade ago so I am wondering how that number will look in the next 25 years of my life.

In my college days, I'd see roughly 40-70 movies a year? While not much at all relative to most film lovers, I would say definitely a higher number than the average person. This year, the number is over 100, and will likely finish at about 115-120. The number of movies I watch per month tends to fluctuate greatly. Sometimes I get more into television or video games or too busy with social life to be watching movies. In March, for instance, I had only seen one movie and it was Dune 2. But back in September, I had managed to watch 25 movies.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Russia,"Hello there,

since more than a month, I ask you for ypur favorite movie set in a certain european country, and I know, I know, I'm very late, but I was on a trip and here in Germany, where I'm sitting, the next day has not yet started after I asked you about your movie set in Romania more than 24 hours ago, so technically, it was yesterday, that I did that. Today (and this “today” is valid no matter where you are, as long as you read it early enough), I can then also announce the winner: ***4 luni, 3 săptămâni și 2 zile*** (engl.: *4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days*) continues the trend of newer films tending to end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Once again, unfortunately I haven't seen the winning film yet - but that's exactly what makes this filmic journey so exciting for me. As far as I understand it, it's a relatively political movie - and the next country we turn to is certainly also a political subject for some people here: now we come to **Russia**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,The Three Musketeers/D’Artagnan,"This is the 2023 French production… I was interested because of Eva Green as “MiLady”.    The reliable Vincent Cassel is “Athos”.

They went for the dirty and gritty look for this one, no colorful costumes for our heroes.   Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  

We all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.
So I wonder… Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   

I can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale…. But I found this rather jarring.

Done best when a small group of family members or friends dip their toes into crime and are unable to handle the consequences. Call it schadenfreude or just the pleasure of watching someone else's life go worse than mine.

Classics of the genre:

Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.

A Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).

The Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.

Honorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.

2. The Wild Robot   - Dramwork's best in years and one of the most hard hitting movies of the decade.



3. Kill     - An Indian movie which surpasses the level of modern Hollywood Action movies with ease imo . Non Stop insane ride of high octane realistic action sequences . ( Chad Stahelski is going to remake this movie in English )



4. The Substance    - The craziest a movie can get .

Good Examples:

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

Sirocco and the Kingdom of Winds

Kensuke's Kingdom

Big Fish and Begonia

Wolfwalkers

The Secret of Kells

Song of the Sea

My Father's Dragon

I feel like this movie missed a huge opportunity for a clever open ending that invites discussion.

At the very end, when Tobias and Elle are breaking the eggs on the kitchen, the camera films them from the side and leaves enough space behind the father to make the audience wonder if Almut is going to come in, but alas, she is gone.

I believe a more poignant ending would be to have her come in and hug him from behind, and then the movie cuts to credits, except: she has hair.

I'd also like to see Bond girls that James doesn't actually fall in love with. I didn't have a problem with this or anything in previous films, I just think it's been done to death with OHMSS, the Spy Who Loved Me, Casino Royale, Spectre and No Time to Die. 

Bringing back the supporting actors from the Craig era would also be one of my personal hopes. Such as, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny.

If I could only keep ONE actor, I'd say Whishaw because I'd love to see him stick around for decades like Desmond Llewyn did.

While he can't play the guitar in the traditional way, Johan has developed his own unique method of making music. For him, it’s not about perfection but about expressing himself and sharing his passion for sound in a way that’s entirely his own.

Johan also has a deep love for speed and the water. Though he needs assistance getting into a boat, once he’s seated, he takes full control. Steering the boat on his own, he experiences the thrill and freedom that come with gliding across the waves.
Beyond his personal hobbies, Johan has used his life experiences to inspire and connect with others. He’s authored several books that offer a glimpse into his world and the challenges he’s faced. Additionally, his online community of over 13,000 followers on Facebook has grown into a platform for encouragement, creativity, and resilience.

Johan’s story is proof that having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t push boundaries, inspire others, and live a life filled with purpose and joy.

* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.
* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing.

One of the characters (possibly named Rallie, Rally, or Wally) is suspected of having stolen, burned, or sold the painting. To launder the money, he supposedly created a business producing small cars for elderly people.

movies,How to approach Salò (1975)?,"I have a problem with Salò that I'm struggling with and I would appreciate some advice.

I am a divorced man in my middle age with a son of seventeen. He's a smart kid and we have recently started bonding over our love of cinema. He is a junior of the local Multimedia and Graphic Technology Secondary School with a motion picture specialisation. He plans on studying motion picture directing at the academy in two years time.

With his course set he set upon expanding his film education and he recently approached me with a list of movies he'd like to see. His favorite movie is Metropolis and he enjoys watching and talking about expresionist films. Of course his list includes other movies such as M, and I also suggested The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. 

He also wants to see A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Z (by Kosta Gavras) and ""some other films that are not as interesting"". As I was intrigued, I asked which films he was thinking of he volountered Sátántangó (which at 439 minutes he doesn't expect me to watch with him) and, oh yes, Salò.

And I did not react well to news of Salò, as I don't think there is a benefit for a seventeen year old in seeing the movie. It was a deeply disturbing watch for me and I was in my forties, I don't really see how a kid his age would be equipped to even process the message of the film with sufficient life experience. I did not forbid him from seeing the movie, as that really doesn't achieve anything. I would like to help lay some ground work before he goes into it. I think that he should see Clockwork first. And I'd like some suggestions for other thematicaly similar films that would help him gradually ramp up the intensity for Salò. Should I hae him read someting beforehand? He is sufficiently aware of the Italian Social Republic, I am more concerned about psychological aspects of the story.

Or should I just let him watch it cold and have a discussion about the depravity of the human condition later? I also don't feel this is a movie suitable to a father/son movie night but I'm also uneasy of havng him watch it alone.",Panamaned,1h3nhor,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3nhor/how_to_approach_salò_1975/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3nhor/how_to_approach_salò_1975/,2024-11-30 21:58:13,0,0.4,0,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h3nhor

movies,cujo from cujo is a tragic villain.,"in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.

for starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.

things get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. ""it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.""

there's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!

even though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",herequeerandgreat,1h3ltsb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,2024-11-30 20:40:45,36,0.72,36,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ltsb

movies,A Different Take on The Notebook's Ending,"

Hi Everyone, 

I recently watched *The Notebook* and found myself grappling with some discomfort about the ending. So, I decided to write my own version, one that feels more poignant and bittersweet, yet complete. Here’s my version:

Instead of Noah reading the story, it would be Lon. In my version, Allie chooses Lon, but her life with him isn’t entirely fulfilling—at least, not in her heart. She keeps a diary where she writes about how things could have been if she had chosen Noah instead. Her imagined life, where she paints, with Noah becomes her escape, a parallel world where her heart resides.

Years later, as Allie begins to suffer from her illness, Lon finds the diary. Understanding how deeply she lived in her imagination, he decides to read her the diary—not as the story of their life, but as the life she dreamed of. Lon does this out of love, knowing it might bring her comfort and help her remember.

One day, as Lon reads, something shifts in Allie. She remembers her real life with Lon—their marriage, their children, and the life they built together. Overcome with guilt, she apologizes to him, admitting that while she always wanted to love him completely, part of her heart was always with Noah. Lon, being the loving and compassionate man he is, forgives her without hesitation.

Then, Allie asks Lon about Noah. Lon tells her that Noah built a successful life, never married, and now owns a large mill, but is gravely ill. Touched by her lingering feelings, Lon promises to take her to see Noah the next day.

But fate intervenes. The next morning, they hear that Noah passed away during the night. When Allie and Lon visit his home, she is overcome with memories of their time there. The weight of her emotions becomes too much, and she quietly passes away, never to wake again.",Chahes03,1h3laak,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,2024-11-30 20:16:01,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h3laak

movies,"With today’s appetite for legacy sequels and expanded universes, a Seth Gecko film would resonate with both longtime fans and a new generation eager to see Rodriguez revisit his gritty, blood-soaked roots.","It’s a real shame that Robert Rodriguez has mostly shifted to making kid-friendly movies lately. While Spy Kids and We Can Be Heroes are fun in their own way, they don’t really tap into the raw, edgy filmmaking talent that made Rodriguez stand out in the first place. He built his career on gritty, intense films like Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn, which pushed boundaries and brought something fresh to action and horror. A movie about Seth Gecko would be the perfect chance for him to return to those roots, creating a film that’s dark, thrilling, and full of that unique Rodriguez style that made his earlier work so unforgettable. It’s also undoubtedly George Clooney’s best work and he’s become so boring lately—a return to the character would be amazing . 


Title it “Gecko”, and the story follows Seth, who has spent the last 30 years living a quiet, low-profile life in a small seaside town in Mexico. His peace is shattered when Kate Fuller—channeling a Sarah Connor-like intensity—shows up at his door. She reveals that she’s planning to attack the labyrinth beneath the Titty Twister, connecting it to a series of mysterious child disappearances across the country.",Muted-Field4072,1h3ir0l,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ir0l/with_todays_appetite_for_legacy_sequels_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ir0l/with_todays_appetite_for_legacy_sequels_and/,2024-11-30 18:20:55,0,0.36,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ir0l
movies,Favorite movie by european country: Romania,"Hell there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Portugal - and as in the day before, I really have to say a big thank you to all the participants: We got more than 60 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. I'm also looking forward to another movie on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Capitão Falcão*** (engl.: *The Portuguese Falcon*) even have a fitting title in the english distribution. Never heard about it, but it seems to be a funny movie that also shows a little of the Portuguese culture.

Today, we skip Q in alphabetical order (no country starting with Q in Europe) and directly go to R... in this case, R like **Romania** for the start. As always, there are only two rules in the game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,The Girl Next Door (2004) deserves more love!,"Just finished rewatching The Girl Next Door and had to share why it’s so great:

Elisha Cuthbert absolutely shines in this role. Her charcater Danielle isnt just eye candy...she’s confident but also vulnerable. Elisha makes you care about her journey and choices. She is the heart of the movie. 

Timothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.

Also have to call out Elis best friend ""Matthew""... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next"" at the end

the movie balances humor with some surprisingly emotional moments so well and it captures the early 2000s vibes in the best way possible. The soundtrack, the style, the overall feel. it really is a time capsule in the best way.

It also serves as the great comeback of rom-com legend Maurice Chevalier and is often considered the last of the great MGM musicals.

movies,movies of 2025 that you may not be aware are being made,"night of the zoopocalypse

clive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.

grendel

john gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.

high and low

when it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.

the long walk

in addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.

the lost bus

""A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the 2018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history."" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. 

eddington

ari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.

the battle of baktan cross

when it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.

wildwoods

wildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.

the phoenician scheme

leave it to wes anderson to make espionage funny. his upcoming film the phoenician scheme is an espionage comedy drama that was written by anderson and roman coppola. though the plot is unknown at the moment, the film's cast is known and, par for the course for an anderson film, the cast is full of famous actors. benicio del toro, michael cera, bill murray, riz ahmed, tom hanks, benedict cumberbatch, scarlett johansson, rupert friend, willem dafoe, and bryan cranston. production began in march and ended in june.

First of all, it is an unneeded cashgrab prequel to a well known horror classic, that's a fact. Second, the plot was a bit ridiculous.

But man, the cinematography was absolutely amazing! It's like they accidentally hired a talented director and the movie ended up being pretty good! The meh plot was saved by the great old school direction and good performance from the main lead. The two ""birthing"" scenes were absolutely horrific, i'm surprised they went that far.

movies,"I know I'm about 17 years too late, but 28 weeks later was an absolute dumpster fire of a zombie film. (Rant) (Spoilers)","
Just to begin, I have had some heavy consideration after getting some comments that have changed my opinion about this movie.

This movie was not a “dumpster fire”. It was actually a pretty entertaining film that shows some new and also old ideas.

I now believe that this movie was just a little underwhelming, considering it was a sequel to a great movie like 28 days later. If it was a movie of its own, then it would be a solid B tier movie, but it just can’t really live up to how 28 days later made me feel personally.

And now, onto my heavily flawed rating on how this movie was.

&gt; Starting off, how was Don even allowed to enter his (ex) wife's holding area? (He left her to die so I consider that as divorce.)
I know he has the ""all entry"" key card because of his status, but she is of EXTREME importance and danger. She should've only been allowed to be seen by scientists or guards.

&gt; Speaking of guards, why was NOBODY guarding her?
She is possibly one of the LAST infected humans on Earth, and she is left by herself. As shown in the movie, she caused another outbreak, and I bet if there was ONE guard in the room with her, none of this would've happened.

&gt; Why would the producers kill her off right then and there?
She was killed MINUTES after she was rescued, and it would been a better choice to see her tell her children what Don had done to her, and THEN she dies.

&gt; How did she survive the attack in the safe house anyway?
They don't just leave you alone if you are infected, as shown by Don, he literally murders her ON THE SPOT after seeing her. So if she was bitten in the safe house, they surely would've mad sure she had turned.

&gt; They gave absolutely NO warnings about the flashing lights, I'm just lucky I'm not epileptic. Gave me a terrible headache after though.

&gt; Why would you direct a crowd of people into what would basically be a slaughterhouse, and the LOCK them in there with NO guards and NO lights?
Nobody protected them, the majority of them were infected within a matter of minutes, and then the guards outside were basically a firing squad.

&gt; Why didn't Scarlet just say ""These children could lead to a cure."" Or something instead of just stating her rank?
I'm pretty sure if I was a guard and I heard that, I would just let her through.

&gt; Why does NOBODY have proper protection against bites/blood sprays?
They have had this infection for a whole 7 MONTHS and not a single person has proper protection against bites. If a normal person was in a zombie apocalypse, they would at least wrap magazines around their arms or something to protect themselves.
If somebody had worn a riot suit/armored hazmat suit, they would probably survive an attack.

&gt; Why didn't they just burn the entirety of Britan/surrounding infected areas to begin with?
I'm pretty sure most life wouldn't survive being turned into ash, other than Dan somehow.

&gt; How did Dan even survive? I know we see him standing behind a building so he doesn't get charred, but there was fire coming from all directions.

&gt; I get it, nuking the city most likely wouldn't work, or would lead to Britan AND France/any surrounding countries being eradicated, but that's better than the possibility of that ENTIRE side of the globe being infected.

&gt; It has been less than a year, and people are already moving back into Britan. It hasn't even been full cleared yet, let alone the corpses even fully decomposing, and people are moving back in like it's nothing.

&gt; Why didn't Sergeant Doyle (Stupid haircut) tell General Stone (Helecopter man) that Andy (The literal only cure in existence) is able to stop all of this?
That would've stopped a lot of trouble.

&gt; Is it even possible to outrun a fireball??

&gt; How does one, nearly 180-200 lb man, make an entire helicopter go out of control just by grabbing the skids?

&gt; Furthermore, how did this idiot not get infected while all of those zombies were being blended into a person salad?
He was DRENCHED in blood head to toe, and it looked like he was still okay, but I may be wrong.

&gt; How did any of those infected survive being cut into peices? They can't survive a 5.56x45 round to the chest, but can be split in half and still try to crawl around? These are still humans we're talking about, even if they are infected. Humans usually don't survive being chopped in half.

&gt; If infected can be killed by gas, why didn't the military... I dunno... GAS THE ENTIRETY OF BRITAN FROM THE START? THAT WOULD SAVE A LOT MORE LIVES.
And yes, I know what wind does to gas, but it could help if they even tried from the beginning.

&gt; A thin shirt does not save you from poisonous gas, just look at the soldiers from WW1-WW2 and you could guess how that would go. (When they were gassed in the trenches they had special masks drenched in special chemicals to counteract the gasses effects, any who didn't put these on could be dead in minutes, or suffer severe respiratory damage.) So a shirt probably won't stop much.

&gt; Why would you burn a clearly UNINFECTED man to death? At least have the decency to shoot him to death, then burn him.

&gt; I kinda get the helicopter shooting at their car, with the ""Kill all on sight order"" and all, but I don't think any infected can drive a car.

&gt; Why would you SCREAM into a dark building? Scarlet got killed because she was yelling. (Idk why I put this here tbh.)

&gt; The trope of ""I'm gonna jumpscare you when you turn back instead of just killing you when you're not paying attention."" Is a little overused, but again, this movie came out in 2007.

&gt; It was terrifying seeing her be bashed to death with her own gun, but why haven't more infected done this sort of thing? That's showing higher brain function, and this could’ve been used more often. I guess Don being the only infected to use a weapon just adds to the shock value.

&gt; Why would Tammy just drop the gun after seeing her brother get bitten and therefore (presumably) infected?

&gt; Why would you leave your only form of defense? You don't know the next time you'll need a gun.

&gt; One does not just ""brush off"" being bitten in the throat, let alone a child. Like yeah, you can't turn into a zombie, but that doesn't mean you can't bleed out either.

This would’ve been better if it was not a sequel to such a great movie as its former.
In comparison, 28 days later was a much better movie imo, with much better storytelling and plot.

I rebuke the title calling it a “dumpster fire” and it was more of just a let down.

movies,Come and See (1985) is not anti-war,"I've just finished this masterpiece and I'm still at awe, one of the best movies ever made, a perfect film. About it being an anti-war film, I don't think it is, and this doesn't mean anything in terms of quality, it is also not a moral judgement, I don't see a problem with it AT ALL, it's simply an observation about the movie's themes/message.

So first, what does it mean to be ""anti-war"", in my opinion it should deromanticize AND not condone war in any way, the former is done, the latter I don't think it is. The movie shows the barbarity of the nazi regime, every single nazi in the movie is absolutely disgusting and inhumane, while practically every soviet is an everyday person doing what is necessary to survive. The movie at no point questions any soviet policy during the war, in the movie they are justified at every point, even the boy robbing the cow can be sympathized and understood easily.

And see, this is not a problem, we know the horrors of the nazi war machine, we know that 25million soviets died in WW2, they have every right to be pissed and to tell the story that way, which brings me to what I think is one of the main messages of the movie: **sometimes war can be justified.** The movie shows: ""the nazis are attacking us and it is either us or them"", what brought the end of the nazis? It was war, not pacifism or diplomacy, no, **war.** Particulary the USSR, we know they were the main protagonists in the defeat of the nazis, that's history, and the movie came out on the 40 year aniversary of the soviet victory. The movie ends with the soviets marching together towards nazi defeat. With the kid shooting Hitler's portrait. Even when they had the upper hand on the nazis they were pretty humane, considering the level of barbarity that was shown towards them throughout the movie, they quickly shot them and moved on, no sick games, no torture, etc. This is a very nationalistic and pro-soviet movie, and again this is not a moral judgement, this is not a flaw, it's just the story they chose to tell and it is a masterpiece.

I think a truly anti-war movie should portrait war as something pointless and unnecessary from the pov of the everyday man like in Grave of the Fireflies. The war reflects on the kids as something that only harms them, they have no reason to engage in it, they don't understand it, it happened for the political/economic interests of the japanese empire. We know from history that Japan was more in the wrong than not and they were the agressors most of the time, so the movie shows this nihilistic perspective in which the war serves only to cause suffering even to japanese citizens and the kids die for nothing, they are not remembered, what happened during the film is absolutely pointless, as was the war. Another alternative would be to make a pro-peace movie, I like a quote from Coppola about it:

&gt;*But an anti-war film, I always thought, should be like The Burmese Harp – something filled with love and peace and tranquillity and happiness*

movies,My Fascination with Alfred Hitchcock and My Top 5 Hitchcock Films,"It was in the 1990s when I got my first VCR. I was beyond excited - just imagine, no more waiting for the cable guy to show you something good. Back then, there was no internet to help me figure out what to watch, so I headed to the local video store. I asked a friend who worked there that I wanted to watch an interesting mystery thriller and asked for suggestions. He told me to pick any Hitchcock movie - I couldnt go wrong. Thats when I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock.

Since that day, Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors. His mastery of suspense, mystery, and thriller genres is what makes him stand out. I think I’ve watched almost every Hitchcock film (at least the ones released after 1940), and each one has been a joy to revisit. Whats even more impressive is how well his movies have aged - something I can't say about a lot of films from that era. Hitchcock’s films have been remade and adapted countless times. Directors and writers still draw inspiration from his work. Even today!

Here’s a list of my top 5 Hitchcock films. If you haven’t seen them, I highly recommend you do. It wasn’t an easy task narrowing it down because I love so many of his films, but these are my absolute favs.

1. Psycho Psycho was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It was the first movie I saw on my new VCR. I’m not exaggerating when I say I got goosebumps during the final reveal. I literally jumped out of my chair, wondering what just happened. A fun fact: Psycho was the first movie ever made in the US to show a toilet flushing. Yep, you read that right - something as simple as a toilet became a big deal back then.
2. Rebecca I’ve always loved the book by Daphne du Maurier, so when I heard Hitchcock adapted it into a film, I was both excited and a little skeptical. Typically, I’m not a fan of book-to-movie adaptations, but Hitchcock did an amazing job. The movie brings the eerie atmosphere of the novel to life, with strong performances and a perfect blend of tension and mystery. Highly recommend it.
3. Rear Window Rear Window is an absolute masterpiece. Stewart and Kelly lead a stellar cast in this film, where Stewart plays a man stuck in a wheelchair, spying on his neighbors through the rear window. What he sees gets him tangled up in something far more sinister than he bargained for. The suspense is built slowly but steadily. What unfolds after is such a treat to watch. It’s been adapted and remade several times, with one of the most famous being Disturbia - not a bad film in itself but the original is much much better.
4. Strangers on a Train This one really kept me guessing. The premise was intriguing - two men meet on a train, and one proposes a strange idea: if they each commit a murder for the other, they’ll be in the clear. It’s one of those thrillers that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering how it’ll all unfold. The film does a great job of playing with psychological tension and moral dilemmas.
5. Dial M for Murder I saw Dial M for Murder a little later in my Hitchcock journey. Actually, I watched The Perfect Murder, a remake starring Michael Douglas, before I saw this. While I thought the remake had a decent plot, it didn’t quite measure up. Then, I read somewhere that it was copied from a Hitchcock movie - Dial M for Murder. I saw it and absolutely loved it. The plot was similar with some differences, but the execution was so much better. It was a fun, thrilling watch that had me hooked from start to finish.

It would be remiss of me not to mention some of my other favorite Hitchcock films, like Birds, Rope, Notorious, Spellbound, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. These could easily make a top-five list on another day.

If you haven’t seen his work and like watching movies, I suggest you watch his work. You won’t regret it.

movies,Was Inception About Coping With Dementia and Grief? ,"Would love to get the community's perspective on a different angle on Inception. 

There was this recurring quote in the movie from both Cobb and Mal throughout the movie: 

""You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you when the train will take you, cuz you'll be together.""

What if the movie is really about a failed suicide pact and dementia? 

I think the whole sequence from 2:12:45 to 2:13:50 redefines the whole movie.  This is the final scene with Mal after the kick is underway where Cobb reminds Mal that they had already grown old together and we see older versions of them walking in a city holding hands (with wedding rings) and then seeing the hands clasped together and rumbling on what looks like train tracks (with wedding rings, but you have to zoom in).  We know from Nolan that any scenes with the wedding ring was real life.

Two big prevailing themes in the movie centers on ""an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone"" (2:16:03) and taking a leap of faith.   Perhaps old Mal had dementia (in the above sequence Cobb tells Mal that she doesn't remember) and perhaps they planned a suicide by train (old hands on the train tracks) and he couldn't take the leap of faith and left her on the tracks at the last second leaving Cobbs now an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone and the movie reflects his reconciliation and grief.   Perhaps the whole movie is a dream of old Cobb sedated while in hospice but that's just my speculation.  Mal kinda pokes at the fourth wall a bit in the sequence from 1:59:59 to 2:00:51 which highlights how everything in the plot had conveniently come together so nothing is real.

movies,Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo',"Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic ""stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen"" narrative. 

This is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. 

The film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. 

What I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.

The story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.

This is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate. Highly recommend.",keepfighting90,1h34ecp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,2024-11-30 04:20:44,311,0.84,311,0,76,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h34ecp

movies,"Ben Stiller could be thought of as more of a great director than as a comedic actor, in ten years' time","So Ben Stiller, damn he can pull some moves behind the camera.

He's known more as a comedic actor - but I think in ten years, he could be thought of as more of a great director. 

I'm currently watching 2018 mini-series Escape of Dannemora, and it is HBO level good. Based on a true story of a prison break. Really gritty. Starring top actors giving some incredible performances, Benicio del Toro, Patricia Arquette and Paul Dano. The scenes are all so captivating. Just a really well put together show all round. 

Then of course, there's Severance. Just stupendous, a real fine wine of a tv show. Gloriously quirky and compelling. Great to see Adam Scott beng given something more meaty to work with. He's such a great straight comic actor that it makes perfect sense he could play such a nuanced, thoughtful character. Plus, it's just such a great ensemble drama. 

Stiller's projects seem to all have a real subtext, and you see that in most scenes.

My points on these shows is that Stiller clearly can unlock special abilities in his actors to really explore a scene, a feeling or a premise and give it so much more depth

These are all really interesting performances and fascinating projects. 

I think as long as Severance doesn't continue to take hellishly long and wraps up after an appropriate amount of seasons, Stiller could go on to make a few more really renowned dramatic films or tv shows.

Plus, he has an impressive back catalogue of directing credits on more comedic movies, dating back to the 90s. Including The Cable Guy, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. You don't make these great comedy movies without having incredible directing chops.

I think Stiller could pull a Clint Eastwood and Jordan Peele on us and redefine his career.",Ok-fine-man,1h2zq8y,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2zq8y/ben_stiller_could_be_thought_of_as_more_of_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2zq8y/ben_stiller_could_be_thought_of_as_more_of_a/,2024-11-30 00:08:53,0,0.4,0,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2zq8y

movies,Comic strips into movies,"I’ve just started reading Doonesbury from the beginning. In all the years I’ve been reading comic strips I never got into Doonesbury so it’s a totally new experience for me. As I’m reading it I thought to myself more than once that it’s would have translated to film pretty well. 

So I started thinking about all the comic strips I’ve been reading over the years and how few of them have actually become film projects. 

Does anyone know why we haven’t had a few more comic strips turned into movies?

I know Bill Watterson has always been against the commercializations of Calvin and Hobbes but that’s the only one I’ve kind of heard about.

movies,"Benji ""A Real Pain"" (2024) ","While seeing this film I noticed small bits of things I tend to do that correlated with Benji (Kieran Culkin's) behavior. Just like Benji I am very extroverted and a happy person in general, but there are moments when certain things or situations just get to me very deeply and I get very emotional. I'm hypersensitive which means I enjoy life to the fullest and is grateful for the little things in life but I can also get sad for the littlest things which makes me suffer unconditionally. I've never met or seen anyone like me until I saw this movie. I was evaluating every single person's reaction to Benji's way of being, non of them wanted to be near him since the risk of him having a tantrum or having an emotional burst...This made me realize why I don't have any close friends or people around me, seeing the movie made me realize that if I had a benji I wouldn't wanna be near him or myself with the fear that they could hurt me in emotional and mental ways; being there for those types of people is very draining. They tend to be very negative towards themselves and feel like they don't deserve certain things. These negative feelings toward themselves makes them jealous of everyone since they feel like they aren't capable of deserving true love and real happiness. I am writing this description based on the things I saw he does in the movie as well as what correlates with me. I've been reading reviews like crazy to find a diagnoses because he has the same issues as me. He was diagnosed with bipolar disease and took medications but I've been told I don't have bipolar and would never take meds to solve a mental or emotional issue. I've been in a personal journey to help myself since my mother told me she prefers to protect herself from me since it's very tiring to be near me. The good times are amazing but she says she senses evil and negativity just as if I wanted to ruin a good time and have everyone focus on myself. I struggle with self-destruction tendencies since I was a kid and a part of me  thinks I do this because I feel like I'm not good enough and all the overthinking gets together and makes me burst with emotions or doing something to hurt myself or others just so I could stay alone and suffer. I think benji and I just both struggle with self-destruction tendencies. My psychologist told me that my personal self-love journey is going to help a lot and I won't be able to let other people love me until I learn to love myself. Personally I'm very happy that I've become self aware of all the people i've hurt in my life but most importantly myself, I'm glad I finally made the choice to help myself and stop being the victim. I'm a bit nervous because I've never been to truly love myself even after 22 years, I've always been quite negative about my body and even if I fix something it's never good enough, I just need to love who I am and I'm sure I can get through it with the right professional help.",Intrepid_Computer_68,1h2tzux,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,2024-11-29 19:41:26,0,0.44,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h2tzux
movies,Quotables,"Continuing a discussion from last night's Thanksgiving dinner, do you think movies have gone down in quality and quantity of Quotables?

I think the single most quotable film of all time is The Big Lebowski.  Pretty much every line in that film is God-Tier quotable.

Some films only have a few Quotables but they're just as epic. Aliens for example has ""they mostly come out at night"" and ""game over, man!"" which are both gold.

The great comedies are masterpieces of Quotables.  Airplane! and Hot Fuzz in particular (along with the already-mentioned Lebowski) are packed with incredibly awesome Quotables.

But what happened to cinema?  These days you barely even get a single great Quotable even in good movies.  I loved both the new Dune films, but I can't think of a single good quotable in either one.  ""I love you 3000"" is an ass-tier quotable.  ""On your left"" like that's not even fun, what else has Marvel even got?  ""I am Iron Man"" I guess but that movie is now 14 years old and the first one they made, and back when films still came with quotables.

I think we need to do something, write letters to the studios maybe or holler at James Gunn on twitterX.  Great one-liners are an important part of the moviegoing experience but nobody drops them anymore it seems.

Does this even make sense to anyone else?l or dod I just eat too much turkey yesterday and the tryptophan is still messing with my mind?

Unlike what he almost left us with as his last flick, Twixt. A bizarre meditation on loss and love. Megalopolis is everything plus the kitchen sink. It’d  be one of those films that when it’s on TV I’d have to stop and watch it. For a director (and writer) in his mid-80s, Francis has accomplished something his contemporaries can’t. That’s continue to take big, experimental risks on himself and his films. He’s done what George Lucas always said he’d do, but hasn’t. I haven’t enjoyed a Spielberg film in decades. DePalma can’t seem to get it together (and I root for him).

Which classic films would genuinely NOT benefit from a sequel, and WHY?   (Unless it’s obvious to all, might you tell us WHY you offer your answer?) 

These days, many (almost all) movies are made with a sequel or trilogy in mind. Even if the story ends with the destruction of the galaxy, there’s always room for that follow-up (and the potential for additional ca$h). 

In the past, movies were not created with this mindset.  Which movies are notably Not sequel ready?  In other words and in a roundabout way, how have sequels affected the quality of the movies being made today?

In my thinking, _Groundhog Day_ is a good example.  The story is completely wrapped up by the end.  No sequel necessary or wanted.

Especially with this in mind, the final result is very close: ***Krótki film o zabijaniu*** (engl.: *A Short Film About Killing*) has won the race with just 12 upvotes (minus the given downvotes).

Today, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in Portugal. As always, the winner  will soon take its place in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And as always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Some directors go beyond showing a skyline or a monument. They dive deep into the city’s culture, spirit, and unique character to weave it into the story.

Bollywood has some brilliant examples of cities playing side characters:

Wake Up Sid gives us a heartfelt glimpse into Mumbai’s monsoons and its never-ending life.

Kahaani celebrates Kolkata’s festive chaos and mysteries.

8 AM Metro dives into Hyderabad’s beauty while exploring human emotions.


Even Hollywood embraces this concept:

Before Sunrise romanticizes Vienna’s quiet charm.

Midnight in Paris takes us through the dreamy streets of the city of love.

La La Land reflects LA’s bittersweet relationship with dreams.

movies,An Observation about the Sixth Sense 25 Years Later,"Yadda, yadda, spoilers.

When Sixth Sense was released it looked like a generic ghost story movie which I had no interest in until a friend, whose opinion I respected, told me I **had** to see it, but wouldn't tell me why. I would bet that a number of other people at that time had something like a similar experience; either they heard from a friend or read some reviews or just saw the box office numbers and realized this movie had something going for it. So I went with a few other friends and we were blown away by the ending, naturally. Recently, I remembered the conversation we had immediately following the movie and I recalled that all of us said the same thing: just before the ending, we thought it was a fine film, but didn't see what the big deal was –and *then* we saw the twist and were just as thrilled as everyone else.

And that recollection made me realize something either truly ingenious about Shyamalan or that he just got incredibly lucky. Take your pick.

That is: up until the end, it's not really that great of a film at all. I mean, it's fine. A few good jump scares, definitely some creepy scenes, but without *that* ending, the film is a C+ or maybe a B. However, preceding that awesome twist with a just an okay film completely misdirects the audience into thinking this is, in fact, just a mediocre picture. But then when the twist happens and we're all blown away. It's the basically the ""Yeah, I'm not doing anything; don't worry about it, everything is just normal"" misdirection that magicians use all the time and, like in a good magic ~~trick~~ illusion, lulling or even boring the audience into thinking they know what's going to happen is makes what actually does happen all the more amazing.

So maybe Shyamalan made what he thought would have been a great ghost story all along, but just got really, really lucky that he thought of a really great ending. Or maybe he intentionally kept the first half fairly low-key/stakes to stun us at the end.

movies,After rewatching Inception my opinion on the ending has now changed forever,"I always believed that Leo was actually awake at the end. Nolan just showed us the spinning top as it was about to topple over before cutting to black and ending the movie. 

After rewatching the movie for who knows how many times I fully believe now that Leo is still dreaming. 

1. Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but…

2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven’t aged at all. 

Anyway that’s where I’m leaning now - he’s still dreaming. 

Edit: I’m loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo’s kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. 

I’ve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. 

I will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I’m even more curious! Is Leo dreaming because he still has not experienced his gravity drop in “the real world.” Hmmm 🤔 ",onlyididntsayfudge,1h2lv4j,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,2024-11-29 13:32:59,5521,0.9,5521,0,751,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2lv4j

movies,"Movie about White Death - Simo Häyhä, the finnish sniper who shot over 500 russian soldiers at Winter War, is in the makings","[translated from Yle news:](https://yle.fi/a/74-20127817)

The story of the most famous sniper of the Winter War has never before been brought to the silver screen.

The Russians gave Häyhä the name ""White Death"" — and for good reason.

According to his personal notebook, Häyhä killed 542 Russian soldiers during the 98 days of the Winter War. This is more than any other sniper in the world has achieved in such a short time.

The movie is set during the winter of 1939-1940 on the Kollaa front, where a small group of Finns stood to stop an overwhelmingly superior enemy from invading Finland.

Häyhä was seriously wounded in the battles at Kollaa just a week before the end of the Winter War. He awoke from a coma on the day the war ended.

Due to his injuries, Häyhä was unable to take part in the Continuation War, though he would have wanted to.

Simo Häyhä was born in 1905 in Rautjärvi, Karelia, and passed away as a respected war hero in a veterans' care home in Hamina in 2002.

The film's consultant is Major (ret.) Tapio Saarelainen, who has authored several books about Häyhä.

El Camino was somewhat of a step down from Breaking Bad, it was still a pretty amazing movie, and could’ve been pretty successful as a stand-alone movie, the plot definitely would’ve worked. Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse’s story. 

The Simpson’s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far. The movie wasn’t much of a step down from the series and episodes themselves. It was just as funny as most episodes are, but had a lot more emotions in it.

Me and my friends are embarking upon a long and very stupid journey to watch every single talking animal film (we will later also be creating a Tier List for them). In order to classify as a talking animal film it must meet these two criteria

1. the animal MUST talk (obviously) so human like animals such as snoopy are disqualified
2. the animal/animals MUST be one of the main protagonists (this leaves a movie like Shrek up to debate as he is a secondary protagonist, leaving open to discussion)

If we have somehow missed a movie (TV specials do not count) please comment and We will add it to the list, otherwise pray for our sanity. all we've seen so far is the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies and we already went slightly crazy

movies,Has a live action remake EVER been an improvement upon an animated movie or show? ,"I'm seeing people talk about the live action how to train your dragon, I made a comment on a different site about how in my opinion, no animated movie has ever been improved by being converted to live action.  The same goes with animated to live action shows, like one piece and Last Airbender.  

Aladdin, last Airbender, one piece, jungle book, beauty and the beast, I'd rather watch the original animated work every single time.  

Lion King doesn't count because it's only live action in appearance and is often considered an animated movie since every second of that movie was computer generated besides the first 10 seconds of the sunrise.  

I'm also not talking about different mediums, video game-&gt;movie, book-&gt;movie etc. Only if the original animated and live action remake are both a movie or both a TV show.  I don't really count when there's a movie that adapts a book, but also has a movie.  As an example mirror mirror is the best snow white and seven dwarfs movie in my opinion, but it isn't trying to adapt the 1930's animated movie to live action, it's simply adapting the original fairy tale.

movies,Out of My Mind (2024),"I saw this movie being advertised on Disney+ today. It was brilliant despite being a teen/YA Disney movie. Which, even when I was a teen, I usually saw as mediocre at best. I really want to promote it in my own way as I doubt it'll get too much mainstream attention. 

While it'll never be on any lists of greatest movies or anything, well maybe on a list of ""best movies about a disability/disabled person"", but it more than succeeds at what it aims to achieve. I admit I watched it because of a personal connection, I have cerebral palsy, just like the main character, and have only seen one other film about my condition before *My Left Foot*. I was very happy to see that another film about my disability has been made, and with an actor that actually understands the condition fully too, that didn't just patronise and seek to show us as weak and pitiful. 

Anyway, the film was great. It succeeded in providing an insight into the condition from both the disabled individual's perspective as well as the carer's perspective. All of the actors were believable and elicited genuine reactions from me as the viewer. It reminded me of the discriminations I suffered at that age but also the times that I was lucky (and continue to be lucky) to have good people in my corner to support me. 

The greatest praise should be reserved for the lead actress, Phoebe-Rae Taylor, who is a genuinely great actor. Especially for a 12-13 year old making her acting debut, even though you could argue that she is playing a character that she has a unique insight about and wasn't always acting in the traditional sense, as she has cerebral palsy herself. She shines in this movie, showing the highs and lows of living with this disability, and reminding me of things (both positive and negative) that I hadn't thought of in years. It also reminded me that the frustrations I live with on a daily basis, and can feel immensely guilty for, are normal.

I really encourage everyone to watch this film. Even if you don't have a disability yourself, or have any connection to someone that does, it is a great movie. It will show you how, and how not to, act around someone that has a disability. Even I learned something, it highlighted to me the impact of my own ableism, (be it self-hatred and/or external reaction to those I perceive as ""more disabled""), that I have recognised before but not as obviously as I could while watching this film.

I hope that, if you are able to watch this film, you enjoy it. It is bittersweet, and the last half hour or so was genuinely heartbreaking to me, but it is an important film that I'm happy to have experienced.

movies,What’s the purpose of a red herring? When are they good and when are they bad?,"In *Late Night With The Devil (2023)*, without giving anything away, there’s a background character that sticks out like a sore thumb.

I got all the way to the end credits assuming that, any second now, they were going to finally step forward and say: “Nyah haaaaahh! It was me! Me all along!”

But no they were nothing.

So, this is a (intentional I think?) red herring. I found it distracting and annoying in this specific case, but it’s such a common trope that there must be a reason for them.

Just at the moment though I can’t think of what it might be. I mean, I definitely don’t have a “favourite red herring”. They’ve always just seemed like a pointless digression, akin to a random background extra walking around with a handful of fireworks for absolutely no reason.

movies,"I watched 365 movies this year, and here is what I learned. ","I decided back in January that I wanted to try to stop doom scrolling. And instead of scrolling for 2 hours I would watch a movie instead. Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. 

1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren’t even IN other movies. 

2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. 

3: If your movie isn’t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. 

Couple of facts: 

First movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube

Last movie: Planes trains and automobiles. 

Best movie: American Fiction 

Worst Movie: The Creeps.  

Movies I watched that I had seen before: 16

Most movies watched in a single day: 5


It’s been a long year and I’ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. 

Edit: sexually lol 

As requested Top 10: 

1: American Fiction

2: biosphere 

3: They Cloned Tyrone 

4: 1917

5: Maxxxine 

6: the Blackening

7: the vast of night 

8: The green knight 

9: bottoms 

10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)


Edit 2: people have a lot of opinions about movies, yet it seems mine are the only ones that are invalid? 

There are a ton of other things I learned from watching so many movies in such a short time. I, however, typically like to enjoy things more than shit on them (I.e. the beautiful madness that is Shadow in the Clouds). 

So allow me to clarify what in reverse:

3: In regards to run time, yes I agree, a story is as long as it needs to be, but streaming places like Netflix don’t usually care,  because they want a longer movie that keeps you watching. This can kill whatever story they were trying to tell. This is less a problem with Older movies, and more a modern issue and issue with a lot of horror movies (which is 80% what I watched).  It was my way of saying that movies could be tightened up to be more impactful and memorable.  For the “movies should be as long as they need to tell the story” people, we all know if movies needed to be as long as they need to be then there wouldn’t be a need for an editor nor “directors cuts.” Some stories don’t need the time and some stories need more. 

2: of course movies have different budgets, I am saying it is VERY noticeable when you go back to back and see a difference. It is amazing what people can do on a smaller budget to make it look good and how a larger budget production can blow the money and you don’t ever really see it on the screen.  

1: so many faces end up looking the same. Admittedly I come from an era where there were big names in the theaters and someone being in a movie meant something. Not something GOOD necessarily but something.  With this last year, I would see movies with an actor in it and still not know what sort of movie it is. You see “Justin Long” is in a horror movie and you know you are basically in for a good time. You see someone like Gerald Farlong in a movie and you just wanna know if you should know him from something (you shouldn’t. I made him up).  I do like that Square jaw man from the Hit Man tho. 

If I learned anything real, it’s that I love movies, and even if a movie is bad, as long as it’s fun, then it didn’t waste my time. 

Glad you all love American fiction and vast of night.  

Glad you all hate American fiction and the green knight. 

I’m gonna go watch “It’s a wonderful knife” now.

movies,A blend of art and fear: Why Hereditary is a must-watch movie. ,"I always thought I didn’t like horror movies. I usually don’t enjoy blood, violence, or scenes designed to disgust. But recently, I watched Hereditary by Ari Aster, which is categorized as a horror movie, and for a change—not only was I not grossed out or anything—I genuinely enjoyed it! There were plenty of scary scenes that made me grab onto whoever was sitting next to me xD, but it was the kind of fear that’s fun and intriguing—I loved being scared.

The casting was excellent. The acting of the mother (Annie) was fantastic, and the choice of Milly Shapiro for the role of the daughter (Charlie) was spot-on, and so on.

The film's atmosphere was mesmerizing; for example, the fact that the mother was a ""miniaturist"" and recreated their home in miniature—it was simply brilliant! It didn’t necessarily add anything significant to the plot, but it contributed something very unique to the movie's vibe.

The scary parts were genuinely frightening, in my opinion, but what was special is that along with my fear, I also found myself laughing.
The amazing director edited the film in such a fantastic way that even in the scary scenes, there was a sense of humor. This movie is truly one of a kind.

In conclusion: Ari Aster, the crown is yours! 👑

There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?

I tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap. I wasn't sure if I should ask this here, r/AskHistorians, or some other sub, but if anyone has any ideas, let me know.

yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Norway. More than 24 hours and almost 100 comments later, we have a clear winner: ***Flåklypa Grand Prix*** (engl.: *Pinchcliffe Grand Prix*) will be a wonderful addition to our official Letterboxd list, which becomes more and more heterogeneous, as the time goes by. 

today, I ask you for your favorite movie set in the next european country by alphabetical order: We leave the letter N and go to P like **Poland**. It won't be quite as personal for me as Germany (where I was born and still live today), but both my parents come from Silesia, so I'm even more excited about your suggestions. All I ask is that you stick to the following two rules: 

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Recommendations for great uses of classical music in film?,"I posted something similar in the Classical music sub, and thoughts it might be interesting to see responses from here as well!

The context:

I'm totally new to classical music, but I've started compiling a bit of a playlist, and have found that I'm somehow really drawn to pieces that have been used to what feels like good effect in film / TV. There's something about how the music is connected to a storyline that makes it powerful for me, for example:

""Elizabeth"" (Elgar's Nimrod, Mozart's Requiem in D Minor)

""V for Vendetta"" (Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture)

""The King's Speech"" (Beethoven's Symphony #7)

""Wit"" (Arvo Part's Spiegel im Spiegel)

Is there anything that you might suggest I look into adding to this list? Something that you feel was employed really well in cinema?

(For what it's worth, I started looking into this after compiling a list of some scores composed specifically for film, by the likes of John Barry, Dario Marianelli, Howard Shore, Williams etc..).

Also, I think I initially got reeled in (ha, pardon the pun) after viewing this video essay on how Shore approached the Lord of The Rings score:

""How Music Elevates Story""

In the beginning it's all about why tremblay might have been dismissed by the last Pope. We then find out that he essentially brief people for the Papaya and being exposed by Lawrence effectively ends his run.

Only...if the Pope attempted to dismiss him before he died, he couldn't have done it on the basis of bribery for the Conclave as effectively  that couldn't have happened yet or be foreseen. They repeatedly emphasize that the Pope died unexpectatly, meaning it couldn't have been that Tremblay bribed everyone while the Pope was still alive, in preparation for his death as it were.
Also if this was the case, it would be just so dumb to do it whilst the Pope was still alive.

movies,Good movie scenes for kids to act in a theater camp.,"Putting together an acting camp this winter for kids in 5th and 6th grade. Each day we'll watch a scene from a film, then in groups they'll choose characters, make props, create a twist ending (if they like), choreograph their scenes, and perform them for each other.

Would love to hear thoughts on good scenes for them to act out. Live action or animated, all are welcome. Funny scenes usually work better than emotionally wrenching ones. 3-4 character scenes are often best, but we can also adapt scenes with other amounts of characters. The students are learning English, but they are pretty eager and open to most scenes. Ideally not too much violence as that can digress into chaos perrrty quick.

So one one of the things I've always been fascinated by our directors/writers who go out and make semi-autobiographical films. Obviously, every artist imbues a part of themselves and draws inspiration from their own experiences in whatever they make, regardless of if it's a realistic, domestic situation or a big action fantasy. But it always is interesting when you see films that are clearly drawn from past experiences and how that knowledge of pain and joy can help appreciate a film more.

Sure some may see it as being self-indulgent but some of the best movies of all time have been grown-up, mature directors looking at their lives.

And to be clear, it doesn't just have to be their adolescense/childhood. 

Antonio Banderas had to embody a dramatized adult Pedro Almodóvar reflecting on his path in life. All That Jazz looked at Fosse's career as a dancer, choreographer, and director. Celine Song has said Past Lives was inspired by a real childhood friendship she had prior to moving abroad and their reunion after she'd gotten married. Noah Baumbach has not been afraid of sayig how Marriage Story was inspired by the divorce between he and Jennifer Jason Leigh. And while not one character served as an exact mirror, Platoon was reinforced by Oliver Stone's real life experiences as a Vietnam veteran.

So what directors do would you like to see make a semi-autobiographical film about their own lives? I also want to put an addendum that **you can include directors who are sadly no longer with us and directors who are currently ""retired""**",dremolus,1h1qlk6,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1qlk6/which_directors_you_would_like_to_see_make_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1qlk6/which_directors_you_would_like_to_see_make_a/,2024-11-28 07:24:28,0,0.39,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Xv2oSuRxDNN0Pwl5Nz6aXNsKoiLDHBLHqIHQ5bFdUQo.jpg,t3_1h1qlk6

movies,"Currently rewatching ""I Care A Lot""","And I'm reminded how stupid this movie is. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching it. But c'mon, this chick has been doing the equivalent of petty crime, and gets ever increasing signals that's she's in over her head:

🙃

- First the lawyer shows up with $150k cash and negotiates to go to $300k (baby... you dealing with BIG players, here)

- Then there's a shootout at the assisted living facility and Russian nationals are arrested (oh shit, these are REAL thugs)

- then the doctor gets killed (who kill people, fr!!)

- then SHE is nearly killed, and in the process discovers her girlfriend is nearly blown up (damn, my eyebrows got burnt off)

and I remind you, at this point, she's never dealt with anything nearly approaching this. And instead of trying to bring this ordeal to a close, an ordeal FAR above her experience, she makes a final stand. Her and her army-of-one girlfriend.

## AND THEY WIN

Granted, she gets what she deserves in the end. But still...

Call me a coward but if all I've ever done is rip off old people, I'm tapping out as soon as ""Russian Mafia"" comes out of anyone's mouth.

movies,Does anyone know if actors/crew have any control over Feature Commentaries?,"This question from having watched the Conclave feature commentary. It was terrific and informative, for me. I love feature commentaries (Emerald Fennell’s for Promising Young Woman and Rian Johnson’s for Knives Out, to mention only two). Here, the director of Conclave clearly admires his actors and crew so much. Yet I thought at moments he was maybe a little too free with the comments about some of the actors: their disagreements over, for example, the costumes (whether they should have been actually what a cardinal would wear or not, etc.). Mostly Tucci and Fiennes. He mentions that Stanley Tucci had doubts about his performance near the end of the shoot, which I am sure is common. From the sound of things, Tucci in real life would probably say, “it’s fine"" (listen to the commentary;-)). Ralph Fiennes apparently was a bit piqued about his costume, because an actual member of the church showed him a costume detail, and Fiennes wondered why Berger wouldn't use it. It’s very here and there. It does NOT sound like the set of an Xmen movie, truly. This director, a wonderful filmmaker, sounds like a very decent and knowledgeable man who truly appreciated his cast and crew. Still, does anyone know if actors or crew members can prescreen these, and give their approval or veto to certain parts?

movies,Massive problem with Godfather part 2,"Godfather 2 is generally recognized as an all-time classic as it was nominated and won numerous Oscars and featured some outstanding performances. It's also one of my own favorite movies but I have one problem with it and I think I'm not alone. In short it's Michael's body guard. You know, the guy who wore an all black suit, black hat and black turtleneck while visvisiting Miami and Havana? He mostly stands in the background trying to look menacing but his advanced age and slow ambulation just made me think Hyman Roth could easily just walk away from him even with his heart condition. It's strongly implied that this man in black is a highly accomplished hitman/bodyguard given that Michael entrusts his own security to this one geriatric, zoombified stiff. But when it's time for him to shine, when he gets the call to show us what he's got he fails oh so miserably it's cringe worthy. First, when he takes out Johnny Ola he chooses for his weapon a wooden clothes hanger, never mind that even mild pressure on the cross bar will cause structural failure, but during the scene he loses his left hand grip on the hanger thus losing any leverage he may have conceivably had. Yet, Johnny drops into unconsciousness pretty damn quick, talk about being soft for a gangster. The man in black follows this up by following Roth to a hospital where he takes his sweet time to secure the room before making his move on the  utterly defenseless Roth. Does he pull a gun? No. A knife? No. A blunt object? No. Instead he opts for what looks like the kind of pillow you would get on a Jet Blue flight. His final act of pure incompetance is holding said pillow in a futile defensive act when police burst into the room underscore that this guy was completely unqualified to be a professional hit man. That sums up my complaint, and I understand that some will disagree with my assessment because he's part of one of the greatest films of all time but if you defend the man in black, you are just plain wrong and need to go back stream the film and you will be convinced that he was just plain lame.

This is my favorite thing she's ever done. And probably had an outsized impact on my taste in women. I appreciate when a chick will just say ""Get your shit together you fucking dumbass.""
* Also, I made it this entire time without even mentioning Dogma. Unfortunately, I would get entirely sidetracked by that movie. It's fucking awesome. But, unless you break the law you can't even watch it. Though, I think that's about to change due to Harvey Weinstein being a piece of shit. But with less money than before.

All that being Said, Kevin Smith is like The Farrelly Brothers meets Wes Anderson.

movies,I liked Challengers much more than I expected ,"This was actually back in July. A friend recommended it, so I bought it on Prime.

I went into it completely blind, so I had no idea about the plot besides the fact that it involved a love triangle, so I expected some kind of shallow sexy drama.

I've never watched Euphoria and I had only seen Zendaya in Dune, and I wasn't impressed, but she's great in this. It's funny to see how she clearly doesn't love either of them, and is just in love with tennis.

I also loved **Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' electronic soundtrack** and how it highlights emotions and moments of tension, especially when the characters are fighting. But the thing I liked the most was the portrayal of the boys' friendship and overall rapport, which looks and sounds, for lack of a better word, real. Especially in the flashbacks from their teenage years the dialogue and the acting make their relationship sound very realistic.

I felt stupid at the end when the credits rolled out and it showed that Guadagnino was the director. Maybe it's because I was very busy this year, but I didn't know he had directed this (shameful for an Italian).

But apart from that, his films that I’ve completely seen, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut failed to impress me MUCH (although I was impressed, just not enough as he is highly regarded as one of the best directors we’ve seen), except for Dr. Strangelove which was an absolute joy watching. I consider it to be on a pedestal among other films worthy of being there. 

I figured we could have a civil conversation about Kubrick and you could maybe help me see what I’m not seeing, or maybe there might be people out here who possibly agree with my opinion. Nonetheless, kindly refrain from spoiling 2001, because I truly want to see and experience it myself.

It's no secret that Quentin Tarantino is not a fan of 4K and I'm wondering if making that movie more prettier goes against the aesthetics of it being a genre picture? Something in the vain of Grindhouse and 70's exploitation movies, whereas cleaning it up maybe makes it look more like an ""prestige"" picture? Which it is, but only after the fact.   
I wonder, because I remember the first press of DVD's back in the day for this movie, and it was a ""dirty"" transfer, which was the version I first fell in love with.   
There is definitely some nostalgia on my part, but I'm also thinking that a ""dirty"" transfer does give a better sense of how it might have been at the movies showing a 35mm print that's been continuously played to being worn out.

Justice Smith’s characters narration about being young then suddenly growing old really just hit me like a brick wall. I'm a nostalgic person that grew up with 90's shows and that sequence just broke me, especially thinking on how quickly life has moved these past few years.

movies,What do you think is the first 80s move and the last 70s movie,"Probably more than any adjacent decades, I think the shift from 70s to 80s ethos and vibes is just incredible.  

When I think of 70s films, there are lots of themes we see that they created whole genres out of: 

City in Decline:  Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, The French Connection, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, The Warriors,  The Taking of Pelham One Two Three

Political and Paranoid Thrillers:  Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor, The Conversation, Marathon Man, Klute, Capricorn One, Chinatown, Winter Kills, The Day of the Jackal, All the President's Men, Chinatown

War Movies Shifted from Heroic to Pathos of War:  Coming Home, Deer Hunter, Patton, MASH, The Big Red One, Catch 22, Slaughterhouse 5, Apocalypse Now

Dystopic Sci-fi:  Logan's Run, A Clockwork Orange, The Omega Man, West World, The Andromeda Strain, Mad Max

Loss of the American Dream:  The Last Picture Show, American Graffiti, Nashville

The 80s. . . Instead of gritty realism we get escapism:

Raiders of the Lost Ark, Top Gun, The Empire Strikes Back

Instead of anti-heroes, we get heroes

Superman, Indiana Jones, Terminator, Die Hard, Commando

Instead of city in decline, we get consumerism and excess: 

Wall Street, Beverly Hills Cops,

A return to more triumphant themes in war movies: 

Red Dawn, The Hunt for Red October, 

An explosion of Teen Movies: 

The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Risky Business, 

Dystopic -Sci Fi is still a thing, but it becomes much bigger, infused with large budgets and massive world-building:

Blade Runner, The Road Warrior

I'd say in terms of cross-overs, Jaws feels like almost like an 80s film - certainly the first of the big blockbusters that everyone chases in the 1980s.  

The Thing is a good example of a 1980s movie firmly grounded in 1970s ethos and themes.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Norway,"Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in North Macedonia, and although there weren't really that many suggestions and votes, we were still able to find an interesting winner: ***You Won't Be Alone*** is an australian movie. To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out why an Australian filmmaker made a movie with a plot set in North Macedonia, but maybe I'll get back to this as soon as I've found out more (after the viewing).

But what I would like to find out very quickly is your favorite movie set in **Norway**. I think this time a movie that is genuinely from the country itself could end up on [our official letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) list again, but we'll see... The only thing I'm setting here are just two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

movies,Is Scream the reason people forget about The Town That Dreaded Sundown?,"Was quite surprised to see an article on this film as it never seems to get a lot of praise, but it’s a pretty fun slasher! For a sequel released decades after the original, it did a good job of being fresh and reinventing itself but with the familiarity of the original. 

I wasn’t a fan of the original but this is one of those cases where the sequel is better, like Ouija: Origin of Evil. 

Anyway, this article suggests Scream's popularity and it being heralded as the godfather of meta horror is the reason TTTDS gets overshadowed.

Any other fans of The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014)? Would love to know!

Also, Starship Troopers which had a 100 million dollar budget back in 1997 and was R-rated and had no stars whatsoall unless you count Doogie Howser. I gotta imagine that was a risky move selling it to the studio yet it was made.

movies,State of American film industry,"I'm not too deeply familiar and have a surface-level understanding of American film industry based on what I've read so far. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

If I understood correctly, American film industry is more focused on making money with mainstream mass audience over artistic cinema films like Martin Scorsese.

Meanwhile, in France (I'm not sure about other European countries) their film industry is the opposite: it focused more on artistic cinema output rather than making money with mass audience. Creators get funding for making artistic films that doesn't focus on box office performance while in the USA, it's the opposite of this. Films that doesn't guarantee box office performance will not get funding from major film industry.

Now that is out of the way, I have an idea: why not have space for both, mainstream blockbuster and artistic cinema films to be made? Why in USA only the former is prioritised while the latter is neglected? I think having both types of films get to be made is the best compromise. Yes, blockbuster franchise can get funded, but have space for artistic films to be incentivised and funded as well. It shouldn't be zero-sum.

They keep circling around the main complaint they do have but they don't don't want to be un-PC about it. Mescal is definitely a brilliant actor, making inroads in his career, but compared to Russell Crowe in Gladiator, he's just not delivering a testosterone-heavy performance. It wouldn't be a problem if the film didn't make it a point to compare Lucius with Maximus or having Lucius act like a macho beast when the first thought in one's head is how ""snatched"" Lucius' waist is. 

The fact that Lucius started out as a spoiled prince that looked like Peppermint Patty could have been an interesting correlation as he grows up to be a warrior, but the movie just starts with him being Maximus 2.0. He even has a dead wife. 

This made me wonder about other actors who tried to be action heroes and didn't cut it because they weren't convincing as macho meatheads.

movies,The first motion picture ever feels a bit.. Strange?,"Most of us know the film ""Carmencita (1894)"" the first motion picture (movie) ever, but whenever you see footage of it, it gives me a strange kinda uncanny feeling like it's not from it's time??



Now if you dont know about ""Carmencita"" it is a film directed by [William K.L. Dickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kennedy_Dickson) and featuring [Carmencita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmencita) (actor) and shows Carmencita dancing on a stage for 21 seconds

  
The part that is very strange is that the film was shot at 30 frames per second, now yes the first photograph was taken in 1826 but strangely this is as fast or faster than most films in the mid 1900s.

  
The workings of a [motion picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) [camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera) (at the time of creation) is where the light and darkness is captured and burnt onto a piece of paper and the motion picture camera has to do that at the rate of 30 frames per second into tiny film strips.

  
I dont know how fast they would create it at a time but it could possibly be created in a delay of 1-3 seconds (what i think).",lofeythelofster,1h0wlhr,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0wlhr/the_first_motion_picture_ever_feels_a_bit_strange/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0wlhr/the_first_motion_picture_ever_feels_a_bit_strange/,2024-11-27 05:00:13,0,0.21,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0wlhr

The first time he uses the machine, the Machine-Angier that stays put shoots the Teleported-Angier.

So if ""The Real Angier"" teleported that first time, he was shot and killed.

If ""The Real Angier"" didn't teleport, he drowned the first time the trick was performed.

Either way, he's a very smart man. He must know that by the end he's either Angier #100+ or Angier #2, which I think is why he breaks down about sacrifice, not the 100+ murders. He knows the original is long dead.

movies,Earl holliman passed away yesterday at 96,"While at the Pasadena Playhouse, Holliman entered the Paramount lot by claiming he had an appointment with a studio barber. Eventually he became friendly with studio executives. Holliman first got a small bit part opposite Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in Scared Stiff (1953). Next he was cast as a marine in The Girls of Pleasure Island (1953), for which he needed a G.I. haircut. Finally he saw the barber and ended up with a haircut (and bangs) that changed his life.

After he gained popularity in his image following a change in hairstyle, he then followed with three more films released in 1953.His many credits include: Broken Lance (1954), The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), The Big Combo (1955), I Died a Thousand Times (1955), Forbidden Planet (1956), Giant (1956), The Rainmaker (1956), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Don't Go Near the Water (1957), Hot Spell (1958), The Trap (1959), Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), Visit to a Small Planet (1960), Armored Command (1961), The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Anzio (1968), The Desperate Mission (1969), Smoke (1970), The Biscuit Eater (1972), The Solitary Man (1979), Sharky's Machine (1981) and Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge (1987).

Holliman played a doomed helicopter crewman in the William Holden war drama The Bridges at Toko-Ri and a gangster's double-crossed thug in The Big Combo. He co-starred with Jack Palance in the crime drama I Died a Thousand Times (1955), a remake of High Sierra. He starred in The Rainmaker (1956), opposite Katharine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster, playing a rancher's timid son, who finally must defy his brother to gain self-respect, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture; he was cast in the role instead of Elvis Presley. His role in Rainmaker brought him such praise that columnist Louella Parsons cited him being ""as dedicated as though he were Marlon Brando and Anthony Perkins combined"".",PatientCalendar1000,1h0slet,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0slet/earl_holliman_passed_away_yesterday_at_96/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0slet/earl_holliman_passed_away_yesterday_at_96/,2024-11-27 01:27:05,11,0.63,11,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h0slet
movies,La La Land's Ending: Intended Morals &amp; The Journey to the Destination,"Maybe my memory is hazy for not seeing the film for years, but I didn’t 100% like the ending.

Don't get me wrong; it's NOT for the sole reason of Mia &amp; Sebastian not staying together. I am not a hopeless romantic who thinks love overcomes all by any means. I do think it would have been less impactful of an ending (&amp; less unique) if they stayed together.

My problem is HOW they got to the point where they didn't stay together.

A common complaint I've seen about endings to anything in the last decade is ""It's not that it ended this way by default, it's how they got there."" Many people who hated how Daenerys' character arc ended in Game of Thrones (no spoilers) would have been fine with it ending that way had there been more development. Instead it only came not just in the last season, but the last 2 episodes.

If Mia got her big break, Sebastian landed a gig on his own doing the music he wants - but their schedules get so hectic that they can’t see each other as much anymore despite their efforts &amp; communications - then I wouldn’t have any issues (&amp; the ending would have been less divisive).

Instead (as far as I recall): it seems like they just had 1 fight, Sebastian says “you’re just an actress” &amp; immediately regrets it, he misses her play because of a band photoshoot he somehow forgot about (which I guess they didn’t communicate about to make sure their schedules didn’t get messy), &amp; she refuses to forgive him thus ending their relationship. It seems that one fight was enough to tank their relationship because Sebastian suddenly made a total dick move. Not communicating with her about their schedules, somehow not asking the band if anything was going on the same day as the play when they had a long time to prepare (photoshoots are planned 4-6 weeks in advance, I heard), etc. It seems like basic healthy communication skills that went out the window. &amp; this all happened in a year!

So if the film’s point is “you have to make sacrifices to achieve your dreams, &amp; that includes a person you love sometimes,” it falls flat if there wasn’t any in-character effort to keep the relationship afloat despite their schedules. If anything, I’d say the moral of the film seems to send is “find a partner who is compatible with your dreams &amp; schedules &amp; who will have a healthy communicative relationship with you.” Thus it's for THAT reason why Mia &amp; Sebastian weren’t meant to stay together, thus Mia seems to find a much healthier relationship with David who did have a compatible schedule with her &amp; put in effort to keep their relationship afloat.

Maybe that was the message all along, but I got the impression it was more about “you have to give up love for your career” (even though she has a husband &amp; a baby). Because in real life, you CAN have a career &amp; a love life &amp; family. You just have to find the right person to be compatible with in terms of careers &amp; schedules + you both making effort to make time for each other &amp; your family.  Sometimes that just doesn't happen no matter how much you love each other, but it's obviously not impossible since Mia has a family in the end &amp; seems to have no issues

Tl;dr: I think the ending would have been more satisfying if they had Mia &amp; Sebastian actively trying their best to stay together despite their growing success &amp; failing, so they break up (if the point of the film was about love not always overcoming if you want to follow your dreams).

There is going to be a Broadway musical adaptation at some point, so I hope they do something like that.",BasicBystander,1h0sk5l,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0sk5l/la_la_lands_ending_intended_morals_the_journey_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0sk5l/la_la_lands_ending_intended_morals_the_journey_to/,2024-11-27 01:25:23,0,0.22,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h0sk5l

movies,Prequel shows,"Specifically comedies, I’ve found that if there’s any comedy show that has a prequel the prequel somehow manages to out do the original, so much so that by the time the prequel show ends it leaves a sour taste in your mouth

My main 2 examples are Ted and Young Sheldon/ The new Georgie show, in Ted’s case there are a lot of references made by Blair to how John can make something of himself and for me at least it’s kind of demoralizing how John ended up turning out in the movies, sure he’s not that bad in the movies, stable job, Girlfriend, apartment but his life didn’t turn as planned yk and I think it’s always a victim or comedy set up in general 

Kinda how in Big Bang Theory (BBT) it used Sheldon’s family as a way to get a quick laugh out of the audience and somewhat explain why Sheldon is the way he is, but once we see how his life truly was as a child and how his family was you get to see a whole other side to them and you somewhat can’t believe how they turned out, if young Sheldon writers had their way then George would never have cheated on Mary and Georgie and Mandy would probably have been endgame. 

Instead we had to deal with the inevitable notion that this is doomed to fail someway or another, and as the Ted show progresses it’ll reach that point as well where John’s character will probably change for the worse over the course of the show",Flash_SA,1h0reqw,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0reqw/prequel_shows/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0reqw/prequel_shows/,2024-11-27 00:29:17,0,0.17,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h0reqw

movies,Is it even possible to use sound as an energy source? (Monsters Inc),"After rewatching Monsters Inc, which is an amazing movie btw, something always confused me. So if you don't the main plot of the movie is that Monsters have a whole society the where everything electrical runs off of screams from kids. In Monsters Inc we see how it's the monsters job who are professional 'scarers' to use a weird magical door that does into the homes of children's closets so that they can scare them to get to scream. And we see that when they scream it fuels up a device called a scream tank, which allows it to be used as energy. We even at one point see a child screaming out in the open and it basically overpowers all the electrical appliances around her and short circuiting them.

So I'm wondering is it even possible in real life to use sound as an energy source?

movies,"""Mary Reilly"" (1996): Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde through the eyes of a shy house maid. Maligned by the critics, it is a grim and moody film about the evil within us.","I loved Mary Reilly and it wasn't the folly the critics kept announcing it to be. I loved the setting, the emphasis on the claustrophic nature of the house, the menacing sensuality of Hyde compared to the introverted Jekyl, played brilliantly by John Malkovich. There are scenes that literally shock you like when Hyde stomps a little girl to near death or every scene featuring Glenn Close as Mrs Faraday, in the scariest performance I've ever seen from her. Faraday made Alex from Fatal Attraction look harmless by comparison. 

The brunt of the bad reviews was Julia Roberts and, to be honest, I didn't think she was that bad. On the contrary, I thought she gave a good performance as Mary Reilly. Was the accent bad? I don't know, but I did feel Roberts disappeared into this part, she made me believe she was a withdrawn and awkward maid with a dark past who becomes intrigued, fascinated and sexually attracted to Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. I can't help but believe Roberts was unjustly targeted because she was America's sweetheart playing such an against type of role.

The entire movie reminded me of ""The Company of Wolves"". At least, the direction. It had a bit of that eerie atmosphere with the fog and the cold brick houses.

movies,'Moana 2' Review Thread,"**Moana 2**

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moana_2) 69% (72 Reviews)

&gt;Riding high on a wave of stunning animation even when its story runs adrift, Moana 2 isn't as inspired as the original but still delights as a colorful adventure.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moana-2/):  57 (36 Reviews)

**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho-1236070676/):

&gt;Where Moana focused on the relationship between the titular adventurer and her reluctant demigod companion, Moana 2 divides its attention among more characters. These personalities become window dressing in a movie short on time.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson-auli-i-cravalho-1236222936/):

&gt;Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first “Moana,” at its best, transcended.

[Daily Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/) (4/5):

&gt;With a running time that brings us briskly ashore, the film is a grand voyage in miniature -- a taster epic.

[Empire] (https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-2/) (4/5):

&gt;A touch less fresh than the original, but this is still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination. It knows the way. 

[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/26/moana-2-disney-review-release/76466003007/) (3/4):

&gt;The follow-up plots an extremely familiar course but at least does so with fresh new personalities and more inspired Pacific Island influence.

[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/moana-2-review-disney-sequel-1235069079/) (B):

&gt;It’s always a tough ask to improve upon an original, but “Moana 2” is a sprightly addition to this sea-faring legacy. It does something nearly impossible in our sequel-glutted world: made me want further adventures.

[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1723102/disney-moana-2-review/) (7/10):

&gt;Fortunately, much like ""Frozen II,"" ""The Incredibles 2,"" and ""Toy Story 4,"" we may not have needed a sequel, but at least the one we got is enjoyable and manages to actually push the story forward.

[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/moana-2-review/) (3.5/5):

&gt;Moana remains as compelling a protagonist as ever in her much-anticipated sequel, whilst her reunion with Maui showcases the wonderful voice talents of Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. There’s plenty to admire in the animation and rich mythology of the tale, but it rehashes many of the themes and plot points of the original leading to a fun but less vital movie.

[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/moana-2-review) (C+):

&gt;A ramshackle Franken-ship ... with more in common with straight-to-video sequels than the clever original.

[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-1235175741/):

&gt;The overall sentiment seems to be something like Sequel 101: You loved the first movie, so here’s a second movie that’s a lot like the first movie. This is the good news if that’s what you’re after. If not, well: It’s one hour and 40 minutes.

[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241126-moana-2-review) (3/5):

&gt;Despite all this Moana moaning, though, it's still a high-quality piece of work: a hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride that small children, especially, are bound to enjoy. The irony is that if it had been a television series, viewers might well have gushed about how spectacular it was. But as a film, Moana 2 wouldn't be near the top of any list of Disney's finest.

[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho) (6/10):

&gt;While some of the elements still manage to get a laugh here, the world we were introduced to eight years ago doesn’t feel richer or more exciting.

[Screen Rant] (https://screenrant.com/moana-2-movie-review/) (6/10): 

&gt;The animation is still strong and the character beats are affecting, but the villain and his motivations stand in the film's way of true greatness.

[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/):

&gt;There’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2, but the fact that it’s necessary to write 'there’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2' means something still went wrong.

[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/moana-2-review-vacuum-packed-disney-ocean-adventure-that-will-leave-you-cold) (2/5):

&gt;It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency.

[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/moana-2-review-disneys-soulless-sequel-is-a-flabby-rehash-fms8l067g) (2/5) :

&gt;The narrative stumbles forward in episodic fits and starts through self-contained story bites that have little impact on the wider, regrettably flabby, arc.

**Synopsis**:
&gt;“Moana 2” reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced.

movies,Family stone - mind frick?,"This movie is truly all over the place. Mulroney's acting and character are so bizarre its hard to not view this as a parody.

Sjp is clearly ACTING like she has pretty noticeable autism, and at times I thought everyone was aware of it - the dad being virtuous and trying to calm the tempers of his family because she has a disability... However that doesn't appear to be the case? And if it's not the case then why is sjp playing the role of an autist instead of a type a asshole? It's so damn weird. We build up all of her obsessiveness, ordly, random fact based trivia, inability to understand personal space, tone, etc.  this woman is supposed to be a well connected white collar worker..yet she has zero people skills, self awareness, social awareness, spatial awareness? It just screams autism and otherwise makes no sense.

Mulroney has no charisma with anyone...and his attempts to intimidate his family at times is so bizarre..like he's playing an action hero in a love drama? His character was so poorly written and executed with awful acting. We never once felt like he was trying to make the relationship work..he hung his GF out to dry at every opportunity.. 

I felt like this movie was leading up to the discovery of SJPs autism and them embracing her, similarly to how they've embraced all of the divergence to norms in their family. Their son is a deaf gay man who is in an interracial relationship..it felt like it was building up to acceptance.

And then the brother..who immediately recognizes that the couple is not in love and starts making advances? To Mulroney immediately falling in love with his SJPs sister and her being immediately adored? 

And then we see a full frontal of Keaton's post op chest? The siblings swap partners and everyone is happily ever after? 

There was more to unpack that I'm not doing a great job of unpacking.. but I was floored over how uncoordinated, poorly written, directed and acted this movie was

Always fun to see a 'follow the bullet' shot, and Michael Bay, as always, pulls it of with unparalleled flare.

This [very cartoonish example](https://youtu.be/yP3roygSBmU?feature=shared&amp;t=64) (including both a bullet and a knife) from Oliver Stone's spectacular *Natural Born Killers* is a pretty early one, from 1994.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: North Macedonia,"Hello there,

since more than a month, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day and it seems like in this game, everyday, is a new day.

Let's take a look at the day, where I asked you for your favorite movie set in Monaco, for example: The thread got 16 comments and the comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) included a suggestion for a movie that isn't really set in Monaco plot-wise for the larger part. Same with the runner-up. Because third place was shared by three films in terms of upvotes and downvotes, but they all meet the rules, I had to think again about how to proceed here. I have now decided to simply let chance decide in such a case (in this case: the Excel random number generator) and so ***La fille de Monaco*** (engl.: *The Girl from Monaco*), a 2008 comedy movie, has now won relatively unspectacularly.

Now let's compare that with Netherland's tun yesterday: The thread got over 50 comments where 3 movie suggestions have reached the 30-point mark. And this time, the winner's plot is undoubtedly set in the Netherlands: We're talking about ***Zwartboek*** (engl.: *Black Book*) by Paul Verhoeven. This means that two films from the 2000s are about to land[ on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) and it will be interesting to see whether this decade will actually end up dominating the list.

At first, today we are turning our attention to **North Macedonia**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,I don’t get the love for The Truman Show,"So it's been years since I've watched. Think it was twice, in the cinema when it came out and then once at home years later. Honestly don't think it's a great movie. It's not bad, but I don't get its status. I've talked to people who thinks it's one of the best movies ever made, and it's many people's favourite Jim Carey movie. The premise is good but not ground breaking. I'm pretty sure it was done before on the twilight zone at least. I thought Ed Harris missed the mark in it, he just wasn't convincing. Some of the humour seemed forced, the wife doing ads etc.. and the catchphrase, like it's some great touchstone by the end of the movie. I feel like it was trying to be a deep movie but ended up being a mix of comedy and serious drama that just doesn't really work. Am I alone in this?

movies,"Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films","When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like ""Title 2"", ""Title II"", ""Title Part 2"", ""Title: The Revenge"", ""Tit2e"", etc.

This can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.

Sometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.

So what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",AporiaParadox,1h0bbt0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/,2024-11-26 13:01:49,1156,0.93,1156,0,1051,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h0bbt0

movies,What's so wrong with Napoleon (2024)?,"I don't get why there is so much hate about it. I've successively watched Gladiator 2 (which wasn't rated that bad) and Napoleon - and I've enjoyed the latter one more from the start.

Yes, it is:  
\- historically incorrect at some events I guess (although there shouldn't be total trust to history);  
\- fragmented, but it's still smooth to watch.

But:  
\- Joaquin Phoenix is perfect (as he always does). I love his hero changing from the start till the end.  
\- Nice battle scenes, blood and gore. Reminded me of those in Game of Thrones, maybe even better. Battle on frozen lake is my favourite. Taking moscow also.  
\- Nice atmosphere, costumes, sceneries.  
\- Ridley told that he didn't try to do documentary and mostly referenced Napoleon's letters. So it's a film about about a man, not a historical hero.

And what I still didn't catch:  
\- Was It planned to include some black humour like sex scenes, shooting of the rebels and so on.

P.S. I won't lie - I'm a great fan of Ridley Scott's movies. Mostly ""bad"" ones (like Counselor or Covenant) than highly acclaimed (like Gladiator 1 or Duelists).

I’m in the mood for a movie with a character who’s a bit of a ""beautiful troublemaker""—someone who stirs up a little chaos, but is ultimately charming and endearing. Think of someone who is mischievous but captivating, with a strong presence in the story.

Does anyone have any movie recommendations that feature such characters? I'm looking for something with a quirky, lively lead who makes a bit of trouble but in a lovable way.

movies,Running time longer than actual film time.,"Most of the movies are shortening real time, allowing us to witness events that occurred over a day, week, several years, or even centuries.

I'm looking for a example of a movie that does the opposite, where the running time from start to finish is substantially longer than the actual period of time represented within the story or events shown in the film.

For instance, a movie with a 2-hour running time depict events that lasts less than 2 hours.

  
p.s. Forgot to mention, not movies told from different perspectives/characters, repeating events (like groundhog day), or time-travel.

What I had in mind is kind of extending time with inter-cutting or maybe parallel stories or some other way.

movies,Are you a member of Gen Z that has seen True Romance?,"It’s one of my favorite movies, but I’m curious how Gen Z feels about it. Does it still resonate, or does it feel dated and over the top? I wonder if the movie’s idea of ""romance"" might seem more like codependency or a mix of personality deficits to younger generations.

I feel that the type of ""romance"" portrayed in the movie might feel a bit dated now. It seems to me that younger generations take a more practical and matter-of-fact approach to love and relationships compared to 35 years ago. For example, Chani’s love for Paul in *Dune: Part Two* strikes me as a more conditional kind of love. I can’t recall the exact quote, but she essentially says she will love him as long as he doesn’t harm the Fremen cause.

movies,The Art of Cinematic Tension: Why the Best Films Make You Uncomfortable,"Ever notice how some of the most gripping films don’t rely on big action sequences or flashy CGI, but on making you *feel* something? It’s the subtle discomfort that sticks with you long after the credits roll. Take *The Witch*, for example – a film where the tension is as thick as the fog rolling over the forest. The silence, the look in the characters’ eyes, the unbearable dread of what’s coming next… it’s all perfectly calculated to make us squirm. And it’s not just horror; films like *There Will Be Blood* or *Whiplash* use tension to stretch our nerves until they’re ready to snap. It’s like watching a slow-motion car crash, where you know something’s going to happen, but you can't tear your eyes away.

movies,2023 Alternate Oscar Nominations: One Nom Per Movie,"So I've made it no secret how much I loved 2023 but I also really did like the Oscar nominations this year. But it still saddens me how many great movies only got a single nom or went 0 for nominations.

I already did an alternate Oscar noms a while back but I thought of different idea. I wanted to spread the love as much as possible and so came my biggest project to date: the 2023 Oscars with each movie only eligible for one nom. Even Best Picture nominees only get that Best Picture nom. I watched as many movies as I could to fill this list up which was a bit tiring but still rewarding with how many discoveries I made.

To give myself some ease, as a rule given how broad the field is, I did only look at the submissions for Best International Feature as to not find up having to go through dozens of other films (luckily this year's noms were all really good). I also did the same for documentaries and what were shortlisted entries but again, a lot of the shortlisted documentaries were all fantastic so no complaints there.

I did also try to be as objective and fair. There are several movies I didn't care for or didn't like overall such as Maestro, Origin, and Showing Up but I could acknowledge one element that really did work that's at least worth recognizing. I didn't want this just to be a list of movies I personally loved ~~(that'll be a different list)~~

And in terms of how I chose which movie went were, it was rather simple.

The Best Picture and Best Directing noms for instance would perhaps be the most well rounded in terms of derserving noms in acting, screenplay, directing, production, score, editing, etc. Poor Things just being relegated to acting would feel wrong given how much of that movie is impressive.

In terms of acting, it had to be for movies who rested on their central performance, even if the writing is thin or abstract thus why A Thousand and One, 20000 Species of Bees, The Iron Claw, Perfect Days, etc. got acting nominations. It's also why I actually moved Teachers' Lounge out of the Best Actress and into Best Screenplay, I just feel that movie is so sharply written, it would feel wrong to just give it an acting nomination. And speaking of screenplay, given how a ton more praise is given to its story, I graduated Godzilla Minus One from VFX to Adapted Screenplay (that and I actually watched Origin and seeing how badly written it was, had to replace it with something)

Song and Score I judged how they fit well outside of the film and how much they would be enjoyed.

Production was straightforward but I did want to shout out Taste of Things because all of the food there was made onsite and that's part of the production and is a character of the film in and of itself.

The others are self-explanatory though I will say I went back and forth between movies in Make-Up and movies in costumes. Both had similar praise.

Unfortunately, I can't add all graphics I made so here

Should that not be the other way around?

The movie I’m arguing for this year is The French Connection which is an essential part of my top 5 list which includes: Rocky, The Godfather, Lethal Weapon, and Die Hards 1 and 2. The French Connection takes place during the Christmas season. In one early scene Popeye Doyle goes undercover as a bell ringing Santa Clause and chases down the bad guy who’s on his naughty list. As he and his partner “Cloudy”follow “Frog One” through the cold wintery streets of Manhattan one can’t help but appreciate the one of a kind Christmas storefront decor for which New York is famous. It’s a “Single Guy Living in the City” type of Christmas movie, abundant in background Holiday scenery and never short of depressing 70s dystopian imagery.

Somehow I missed how perfect Selleck played his role.  He’s always known as a tough brutish man or a smooth ladies man but sans the mustache and some hair gel and he becomes the perfect antagonist.

movies,Movies from which you did not expect anything and ended up becoming one of your favorite movies?,"Just as the question says.

 

I ended up watching this movie when it was already halfway through (when Brendan asks Frank to participate in the tournament)

 

And seeing that it was a mixed martial arts movie, coupled with the great cast it had, I decided to give it a chance.

 

It turned out to be one of the best decisions I could make and to date it is one of my favorite movies, mainly because the whole martial arts thing is left a bit aside, when the real plot revolves around Brendan's family drama, Tommy, and his father Paddy.

 

What opinions do you have about it?

movies,99 Homes (2015) Review,"I went into this only knowing the 3 actors listed on this poster and that the setting was coming out of the housing recession. 

The story follows Dennis Nash, played by Andrew Garfield, a recently unemployed construction worker that gets evicted by Rick Carver, played by Michael Shannon, because his house that him, his mom Lynn, played by Laura Dern, and his son Connor, played by Noah Lomax, was foreclosed on and is owned by the bank and Rick Carver is the one in charge of the evictions issued by the bank. Dennis and his mom and son had to move into a motel, and they immediately find out that others who were evicted moved into the same motel complex. Dennis is taking inventory of his tools that are in his toolboxes and notices some are missing, and goes to Carver's business to accuse one of the guys who was taking Dennis' stuff out of his house after he was evicted. Carver comes out to inform the guys of another eviction he has to serve and is impressed by Dennis' gumption and offers him a job to work as a repairman on properties Carver gets evicted, and Dennis accepts. Over time, Dennis becomes Carver's assistant and starts carrying out evictions himself. It's revealed over halfway through the film that Carver and Dennis have similar backstories with their fathers having worked hard for nothing in return. Dennis is then issued to serve an eviction to Frank Greene, played by Tim Guinee, who is his son's best friend's dad but Greene fights the eviction and says the court will overturn it. Dennis asks Carver to take his checks as payments for his old house, and Carver tells him he will buy the house from the bank then Dennis will owe him what he pays for it, with the caveat that he can't move in for a few weeks but he can make repairs and repaint. Dennis surprised his mom and son with the house and they start working on getting the house repaired and repainted. There's then a big argument between Dennis and one of the homeowners Dennis had evicted, who moved into the same motel, all the while Dennis denies knowing him, because his mom and son don't know how he was able to get their house back. It eventually comes out that Dennis works for the man who evicted home, after Dennis presents his mom and son with a new house that he bought after selling their old house, his mom and son not wanting to live there and leaves Dennis to stay with Lynn's brother. Rick then gets his hands on a multimillion dollar deal, but it's in jeopardy when it comes to light that Frank Greene's fighting the eviction and the file is missing a crucial piece to solidify the eviction, which Mr. Freeman, played by Clancy Brown, and Carver draw up and have Dennis get to the court to get the eviction finalized. When Dennis shows up to evict Frank, and finds out he's armed, Dennis explains to Frank that he gave a forged document to the court to get Frank evicted, which causes Frank to surrender. The movie ends with Dennis sitting in a police cruiser while cops talk to Carver in the distance and one of Frank's children coming up to Dennis, who smiles then runs off.

I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. It's a little under 2 hours long, and once Dennis and his family get evicted, the drama is pretty much nonstop. Michael Shannon is phenomenal as Rick Carver, you feel like he's up to no good instantly when you first get introduced to him. Andrew Garfield playing an unemployed single father, and Noah Lomax looking like he could be his son, were great castings. Laura Dern, as always, is great in this! I do love the backstories on both Dennis and Carver, even if we don't get Carver's backstory until the last 30 minutes or so. It's one I'm gonna have to watch again to see things I missed. 

My rating: 4.5/5

Do I recommend? Yes.

Best performance: Michael Shannon

-Release a sequel in 2027 on the 20th anniversary of TF 2007.

movies,"The first Cannes film festival was delayed because the Nazis invaded Poland THAT DAY, starting World War 2, and I can't believe there's never been a movie about this?!","Okay so it's been awhile since I read about this, I might be getting some details wrong. 

  
In the early 20th Century, Berlin and Venice were the only big international film festivals in Europe. France was jealous and wanted to get in on it. Mussolini and Hitler were in power, and when a French film lost the grand prize at Venice Intl Film Festival 1938 to an Italian film that was endorsed by Mussolini, they said that's it, and the French government created an international film festival as an official act. They decided on Cannes because it was a seaside, picturesque area and thought the end of the summer would be a perfect time of the year for it, so they decided on August 31st.

  
The first night, a Friday, only had one film screening, and Cannes had paid a ton of Hollywood film stars to come on an MGM yacht and shmooze, so they were drinking and hanging out and gossiping, with the understanding that the next day would be the real start of the festival, with multiple movies playing and discussions and all that. However, Germany invaded Poland on that day, September 1st, 1939, and the Cannes Film Festival was delayed, then 10 days later, France declared war on Germany and officially canceled the festival, sending all the American celebrities home, and the first real Cannes Film Festival was in 1946, after the end of WW2.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Netherlands,"Hello there,

since more than a month, I ask you for your most favorite movie set plot-wise in a certain european country once a day. Sometimes, it turns out, that one or another of the suggested movies wasn't really set in the given country. That seems to be the case with *To Catch a Thief*, the ""winner"" of the Monaco round, which unfortunately shows no sign of actually being set in Monaco to any great extent. The runner-up in the voting - *Grand Prix* \- unfortunately doesn't fit the criteria here either. As all the other films have the same number of upvotes (minus downvotes), I'll have to think again about how to proceed. However, yesterday's result is somewhat more rewarding: ***Igla Ispod Praga*** (engl.: *The Black Pin*) wins for Montenegro. 

Honestly, I really thought, that *Casino Royale* would win, when we come to Montenegro, but at this point, it seems as people have learned from what I call ""the Belgium accident"", where a not-so-belgian movie made the cut. As always, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens today, when we move on one letter in alphabetical order to N for **Netherlands**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

1. Why would Henry still be a dead man if he beat the case like the witness protection agent said? Is it because people would assume he was now an informant?

2. Why did Jimmy go along with killing Batts right away? I know he was wild but he was logical and watched how he moved. He would know killing Batts was a bad idea and Tommy would calm down eventually but the second Tommy came up behind Batts Jimmy grabbed him to help.

3. Was Jimmy actually gonna kill Karen in that scene? It obviously seemed like it but I couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be ambiguous. 

4. Was Paulie also gonna whack Henry regardless?

5. When Tommy says “come on bring the coffee to go” and then says “I’m joking what’s the matter with you” (paraphrasing) is that a joke on how he’s always saying it’s hard to tell if people are joking or not and they need to word things differently?

movies,Watching Inception again after some time. I think I have a good theory of the ending.,"There is a lot of controversy around whether Cobb is dreaming or not at the end of the movie. Many theories focus on the initial job and the main story job, but I have never seen a theory that discusses a very minor (but what I believe is a very important) scene.

In the beginning of the movie we see Cobb finish up the job and spin his totem in the hotel room and it successfully falls. At this point we know that the movie is in the real world. I have no doubt that Cobb starts assembling the team in the real world.

But here is where I believe the movie takes a turn. The scene in Mombasa, where they are meeting with the chemist, they show the basement where people come to dream and explain that this becomes their reality. Cobb wants them to show him how the sedative works. After this scene, Cobb fails to spin his totem and for the rest of the movie we never see him use his totem.

I believe Cobb is still in the dream world in Mombasa.

One issue that I see with this theory however, is that Cobb is seen entering the dream state prior to the Mombasa scene. I'd explain this away that it was only 1 level with no sedative, but may require more discussion.

I'd love having more discussion surrounding this.",Phillimac16,1gzcff5,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gzcff5/watching_inception_again_after_some_time_i_think/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gzcff5/watching_inception_again_after_some_time_i_think/,2024-11-25 06:18:46,0,0.39,0,0,26,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gzcff5

When I talk about this with friends or others, the answer is that movies cost a lot more to make now compared to before because of inflation, so they cannot afford to take the risks that they used to be able to, hence why there are so many remakes and reboots of everything compared to before.

there's guillermo del toro's frankenstein, which is probably going to be what the 1994 film was trying to be but...didn't succeed at. there's spike lee's remake of high and low, one of the best japanese movies ever made. there's the long awaited adaptation of stephen king's the long walk. there's the phoenician scheme, the newest film from one of my all time favorite directors wes anderson. there's wildwoods, the newest film by laika studios. there's grendal, a movie that is adapted from a stellar book, is made by the jim henson company, and stars jeff bridges as the voice of the titular monster. there's night of the zoopocalypse, an animated horror comedy based on a concept by clive barker of hellraiser fame. there's the running man, a remake of one of arnold schwarzenegger's best movies directed by edgar wright. there's eddington, a western from hereditary director ari aster.

movies,I generally don't like John Hughes but I like Home Alone 1&amp;2 and I think I know why. ,"I tried watching the remake of Miracle on 34th Street recently and saw it was written and produced by John Hughes and I tried my best to get through it but I just couldn't. It had a lot of his tropes and I can't get engaged in a film when I hate most elements of the ""good"" guys. 

  
Anyway, onto Home Alone 1&amp;2. While pretty much everyone is an arse but the main protagonist points it out and is quite likeable. In most John Hughes films the ""bad"" guys would be the ones calling out the ""good"" guys. 

Take The Breakfast Club, one of the events portrayed as ""good"" is when they take Ally Sheedy's character and change her from what she is into a clone of Molly Ringwald's character rather than saying, ""this person is different but that's OK."" 

I could go on, i've seen a few John Hughes films over the years and each one is generally dreadful. If he had written It's A Wonderful Life the banker would be the one the viewer would be expected to root for.

However, now as an adult, I still love her performance, but it’s so…old Hollywood.

There is only one scene in the film where she is far more hammier than any other scene. 

She is melting and screaming

It’s not bad acting, but it’s so hammy that it’s funny. 

Since Hollywood and the standard of movie goes has changed a lot over the years…

Would her performance have as much high praise if she was cast now? 

I get the feeling today it wouldn’t have as much praise. I don’t believe she would be blasted and blacklisted from film though.

movies,If You Were The Last (2023) - A beautiful and different rom-com,"I watched this movie yesterday and I've been thinking about it all day. Since I awakened my taste for romantic movies last year, I have pretty much watched all of the classics and some more, and it's a similar genre to horror in that it's harder and harder to be surprised by plot or execution. But you know, this one hits just right.

Imagine you're stranded on a spaceship for the rest of your life with one person of the opposite sex. You're both good-looking, smart, love what you do and have a lot in common. You are probably going to spend the rest of your lives up there, so... it's only natural that some sensations come to arise. Won't say anything more, but it has nothing to do with that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence movie.

And that creates such an interesting moral dilemma that is actually quite simple in theory but turns around the very conception of ""love ethic"" for me. I won't go into details as I got into it by just reading a two-line synopsis, but I would like to highlight the acting which is a very important factor for this movie to work.

I didn't know Zoë Chao, never seen her acting but hey, she is very good here. I'm hoping to see her more, I don't know her range, but she nailed it here and it was no easy task to go on par with Anthony Mackie, the real surprise. In my opinion, he has always been one of those actors that I see something in him, but he doesn't get the best roles for him for that something to shine. Well I think he shines here finally. Very charming, both of them, and they're given a good script that works and has a great pace to it.

movies,Smile 2 was frustrating ,"I can't say i loved the first one but it had a good performance from the lead actress and a good, impactful ending. Couldn't say the rest of the film was bad it was just not very memorable outside of the ending.
As for smile 2, i expected a full on popcorn horror flick, and it was that, although not in a very entertaining way?
Like, okay i get it, we've got jokes now, some of them made me smile, too. But the threat of the entity was barely present, it felt like a cringe comedy with occasional gore shots mixed in. 

My main dissapointment was the main character, Skye. Really interesting perspective with the mc being a celebrity and my god, did Naomi Scott tried her best. But there's only so much you can do with half of your dialogue is the word ""fuck"". I have no issues with her being flawed, and i suppose i'd be swearing like a sailor if i was in her position but it's just not entertaining to hear the swear words over and over. 

Although there were some positives i suppose. The car scene was the highlight and Naomi simply nailed it with her desperate screaming, some of the songs sounded like a legit pop stuff you can hear on the radio, Naomi Scott is hot (sorry but yeah i said it).

But i guess there's just no potential for a franchise or a sequel. It's all ""i'm going crazy and no one believes me"", the most annoying horror trope is the basis for the concept.

There is this great site called [250films.net](http://250films.net), which I've been using myself for years. Problem is, the site is seldom updated and it is full of bugs. For example, it hasn't been possible to load lists with over 500 entries for quite some time now. I have no idea who runs the site and I've tried e-mailing the webmaster on several occasions throughout the years, but have never gotten a reply. Kind of enigmatic! I'm guessing the site is run by someone who has it as a project among several others, and just updates it when there's time. The site is intermittently down as well. It has a Facebook page which I don't think have been updated since 2018.

Problem is, there are no other sites with an equal amount of relevant lists AND a design that doesn't do your head in. I have glanced at the site called ""icheckmovies dot something"" several times and have even created an account, starting to check off lists, but... I just can't with the way it looks, and I don't appreciate the ""create your own list-community aspect"" of it either.

I've tried googling for something akin to [250films.net](http://250films.net) for ages, but can't find anything. Do any of you guys have any tips? Would be much appreciated! I don't want to give up on 250films dot net, but as the years go along, it gets wonkier to use :-(

(I use Letterboxd a lot by the way, but don't like their system for lists - it's not the same thing as you have to add movies that count towards your total of watched films, to check off their lists.)

Bonus nostalgia: do any of you remember the old top250 dot org for the IMDb Top 250? It was this extremely basic site with a beige background, and when you clicked one of the titles (\*just\* the title, followed by the release year) it got crossed out. Loved that!

movies,"In considering criticism and negative regard for the first two Fantastic Beasts films, I feel they’re being treated unfairly…","In viewing the critiques, I can’t help but feel like a lot of individuals who could care less about Harry Potter as a story rooted in literature are shaping the narrative around why the films, more specifically their stories, are good or bad, and that is a bit frustrating to me. This is different from how the Star Wars prequels or The Hobbit were treated - with those, you at least felt the people criticizing and insulting them were truly knowledgeable about the stories and worlds they were talking about. Here, that’s less the case. It doesn’t seem to me that a wide segment of the GA hated the films casually, but that there is a concerted attempt from sociopolitical activists and “fandom campists” online to tear them down. 

I am particularly struck by the desire to bowdlerize the Potter series, in a weirdly malicious way. This treatment seems to underpin a lot of the nonsensical criticism the Fantastic Beasts films get (and the original Harry Potter films got, to a degree). These critiques are often oriented around deliberate misunderstandings of basic plot, tonal preference, or infantilized, pre-determined expectations and a refusal to take the story seriously from the get-go: 

1. Skewed Expectations for Critique

When audiences insist on framing a franchise as childish or simplistic, critics may feel pressured to engage with it on those terms, even if it was never intended to be consumed that way. This can lead to shallow critiques that fail to address the franchise’s actual thematic or artistic ambitions.

2. Overshadowing the Franchise’s Original Goals

A desire to reduce a franchise to a childish or nostalgic framework can overshadow its creators’ intent. When this oversimplified perspective dominates, critiques may focus on how “fun” or “whimsical” the franchise is, rather than acknowledging its deeper narratives or cultural significance.

3. Nostalgia as Infantilization

Nostalgia can play a significant role in framing a franchise as simplistic. Audiences who experienced a franchise in their youth may cling to a sentimental view of it, resisting any attempt by newer installments to grow or evolve. Critics responding to this infantilized view might either cater to it or dismiss it, but either way, it distorts the discourse around the franchise’s actual merits.

4. Infantilization as Cultural Critique

When a segment of the audience infantilizes a franchise, it can reflect broader cultural tendencies to avoid grappling with complexity or to view certain genres (like fantasy, animation, or superhero films) as inherently juvenile. This creates a dismissive atmosphere that can stymie meaningful critique by associating entire genres or franchises with immaturity.

5. Resistance to Growth or Change

Audience-driven infantilization can lead to hostility toward creative risks or narrative complexity. If fans expect a franchise to remain static and “simple,” any deviation—whether in tone, storytelling, or thematic depth—may be rejected outright. This resistance can influence critiques, as critics may feel pressured to side with or against the infantilized expectations.

6. Infantilization and Gatekeeping

Viewing a franchise as inherently childish can also gatekeep who “should” engage with it. This can discourage serious critique by framing the work as unworthy of intellectual or artistic analysis. Critics may shy away from deep evaluation if the audience insists the franchise “isn’t that serious.”

I’m still stuck on that perspective of thinking Fantastic Beasts ran into trouble because of people on both sides of the critical spectrum liking or disliking Harry Potter (and by extension  “the Wizarding World”) for what it was not, rather than for what it actually was. I hesitate to make that point because I guess it becomes kind of “gatekeep-y”, but I do think huge parts of the GA have a bowdlerized and completely stunted, false idea of what Harry Potter, the WW and Rowling’s writing, is all about (they would, of course, never read the books, and this infantilization tactic likely was a chief excuse as to why they wouldn’t and will not). And so you get this horseshoe coalition of “I love Harry Potter because of chocolate frogs and Quidditch” and “I hate Harry Potter because it’s kiddie doodoo crap” both promoting a warped picture of what the story is or should be, hating Fantastic Beasts because it didn’t conform to their most bowdlerized, infantilized expectations (hunting beasts, everything taken literally, lots of humor, action, and “Harry Potter” tropes, one simple storyline, with no hard-to-follow subplots or narrative complexity, etc). 

It makes sense precisely because of what critics singled out for praise (anything cute and cheaply funny), and what they claimed was “getting in the way” [sic] (basically everything else, anything that brought gravitas, etc). It’s no surprise that the only thing Reddit seems to consistently say about the Franchise is “it should’ve been magical Indiana Jones”. Whenever they talk about the first film, they deliberately miss massive chunks of plot, or characterize it in a way that is completely inaccurate to the story and its tone. Fantastic Beasts 2 was going up against this, and it already had a mountain of weirdly extreme hatred and dismissal aimed at it prior to its release.",DisastrousComb7538,1gyy4yf,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gyy4yf/in_considering_criticism_and_negative_regard_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gyy4yf/in_considering_criticism_and_negative_regard_for/,2024-11-24 18:43:17,0,0.18,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gyy4yf
movies,Watching The Village made me laugh at a Simpson joke 20 years later. ,"Mild spoilers for The Village. 

So in one Treehouse of Horror episode, everyone dies in Springfield except Homer because he's testing out a bomb shelter. After enjoying the empty town a while, he discovers that not everyone died, but some were transformed into hideous mutants. His first response is ""Where did you get those cloaks?!"" I thought this was a lame/lazy joke and didn't snicker at all. 

When I watched The Village and the monster is chasing Bryce Dallas Howard, my reaction while it was stalking her through the forest was, ""How can a monster die fabric such a bright red?!"" That bothered me more then the fact it had a cloak at all. I can suspend disbelief to think it threw on a tattered robe or something, but a well-made vivid red cloak had me scoffing. Suddenly the Simpsons joke clicked and was humorous to me.

In the release order the Queen is quickly introduced while in the in-universe order it is very late. Ash being a synthetic is not only a surprise because he's a bad guy but also because we didn't know androids even existed, while on the other David is pretty much established as one from the start. It's fun to note that the first Xeno/human hybrid is in the fourth movie in both cases. What would be your suggestion for a newcomer? Why?

I quickly checked rotten tomatoes and chose Conclave, rejecting Smile 2.     I didn’t watch trailers and incorrectly assumed Conclave was a horror movie, which would be my type of thing.  

I was not prepared for what I watched.   
The best word I could come up with:       

GRIPPING.      

The theatre was 1/3 full at best, but I swear that not a single person left to use the washroom or gets refreshments in the first hour of the film.    The characters, the process, the intrigue pulled you in to such an extent that  there wasn’t a moment to quickly step out that you might find in other movies.    

The movie challenged social and religious conventions.   It managed to have you suspect virtually every major character of skullduggery at some point in the film.        

The church and its warts were on display, from treatment of women to racism, regionalism, and modernity.        

It was the weaving of so many individual stories, the unknowns of a dead man’s thoughts and intentions, the political intrigue….. all together drawing you in like so many strands of spider silk making it impossible to look away.

movies,Top ten first movies you have or would share with your kids as they grow up?,"I sometimes think about which movies had a deep effect and meaning to me as a kid and wonder what I might share with my own kids some day. A lot of them continue to effect me to this day into my adulthood, so I take seriously that whatever I choose would also leave a permanent mark on them. There is crossover, but it's also significantly different than my plain old ""Top ten movies"" list.

I think my list would be, in no particular order:

1. Homeward Bound (DOGS)

2. Angels in the Outfield (Best most heartfelt kids sports movie)

3. Back to the Future (It will be hilarious to show them a movie about the far off future of 2015)

4. Just blanket all the Disney movies from the 90s (I miss 2d)

5.  Independence Day (Gotta teach them how to be patriotic and not go quietly into the night)

6. Die hard (They need to grow some hair on their chest too, a little action is a must)

7. Star wars, original trilogy (Yeah its basic, but its also important to me)

8. Singing in the Rain (Every kid loves ""Make 'em laugh"", no exceptions)

9. Galaxy quest (the best Star trek movie lol)

10. Iron Giant (""I go. You stay. No following."" tell me you didnt just tear up right now)

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Montenegro,"Hello there,

following [the idea of another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fpkzac/favorite_movie_by_state_fin/), I ask you for your most favorite movie set in a given european country once a day since more than a month so far. Yesterday, it was Monaco's turn and I had a hunch that it would be difficult to find a movie that was really set (almost) entirely in that country. When it comes to movies where the plot takes place in more than one country, I really like [the formulation of my predecessor, who once wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1e1yi2e/movies_by_state_hawaii/):

&gt;If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

For example, this would rule out *Grand Prix* in case of Monaco. But now my question is whether this should also disqualify the actual winner of the voting: Unfortunately, I've never seen ***To Catch a Thief***, but I thought that most of it was set in France. Even the (rough, I don't want to spoil myself completely) synopses I've read don't indicate that the movie would be largely set in Monaco. So once again I need your help here: Would you say, that the movie is really ""rooted"" in Monaco plot-wise? Thanks in advance - and [here is the link for the discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monaco/comments/1gyr6pc/favorite_movie_by_european_country_monaco_which/).

As long as the discussion is still ongoing, we will continue in alphabetical order to the next country with an M: **Montenegro**. And these are the rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix has not yet been announced, I will refrain from attaching an updated list of the films here and instead want to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) . make sure to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1gyr6br,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gyr6br/favorite_movie_by_european_country_montenegro/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gyr6br/favorite_movie_by_european_country_montenegro/,2024-11-24 13:39:44,4,0.58,4,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gyr6br

movies,A Quiet Place: Day One is a Frustrating Entry in the Series ,"Ok, I'll be honest, I didn't like this film at all. I know most people liked it and I was looking forward to it too but this one didn't work for me.

Part of that might be my miscalibrated expectations. I thought since it was called Day One it might be about people figuring out the rules — you have to be silent, natural repeating sounds can be a cover etc. But that wasn't the case. After the initial attack it cuts to everyone being quiet.

But if that was all I would've been only mildly disappointed and then adjusted to what the movie was actually trying to do but it's not really doing anything different or better than the other two films. It's just a regular monster movie with two characters running and hiding from monsters. And I know that's sort of what the first film is doing but that film did a lot with its visual language in building tension around silence and the possibility of sudden sound. That's what made these monsters feel unique. 

This film completely eschews that in favor of generic running and hiding sequences. There's always a convenient rain, thunde or fire to allow characters to talk. Sometimes they talk even without any cover. A huge crowd of people can walk without attracting the monsters (until it somehow does) but at other times the film wants us to believe that a small sound will attract the monsters.

The human story isn't much better. The performances are great but they don't really have much to do and their arcs go about the way you'd expect.

Ultimately it's the lack of tension (that permeates the other films) that bothered me. The one good scene that reminded me of what I like about this franchise was the scene where Djimon Honsou has to keep a guy quiet but ends up slowly killing him while his son watches. 

And yes you can do different things with a franchise but the monsters in this franchise are unique for one reason and if you don't take advantage of that in your storytelling then they kinda become generic monsters. If that's the approach you want to take, fine, but then the human story has to make up for it.

This one was a letdown.",LeafBoatCaptain,1gymine,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gymine/a_quiet_place_day_one_is_a_frustrating_entry_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gymine/a_quiet_place_day_one_is_a_frustrating_entry_in/,2024-11-24 08:42:34,0,0.48,0,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Review,spoiler,t3_1gymine

The emotions in this movie, the dream like states, the conspiratorial scenes; it all comes together in such a cohesive way. I’m reminded of when they intro Betty, and she’s overacting positivity to the degree of a 1940s American film, almost certainly deliberately. And then the cut to her grandparents smiling maniacally as they take a cab. David Lynch is almost like the Ween of movies, his films capture all genres.

movies,Mash Ville: A Helter Skelter Korean Neo Western,"Mash Ville is a little difficult to untangle. It takes place in a rural Korean town which has been nearly cleared out by a pair of gun toting cultists. Their mission: collect 12 bodies, each with a birthday corresponding to a different month. The film's ensemble cast stumbles into this strange ritual and must fight, avoid, or otherwise outwit each other to survive. Among these characters are dimwitted moonshiners trying to collect a poison brew before it kills anyone, an alcholic movie propmaster, and a psychotically laughing police officer.

I tend to be skeptical of movies that go out of their way to be quirky. Despite the eclectic synopsis, the movie's jokes rarely feel forced. It's a bonkers black comedy that manages to pull out a few suprising twists from it's interconnected stories. It does drag a little bit in the middle, but it's an unpredictable little movie with an interesting vibe. It apparently made a splash at Fatnasia Fest this year. With it's unique take on so many genres it's easy to see why.

As a fan of westerns I found the perspective interesting. I recently finished ""Late Westerns: The Persistence of a Genre"" by Lee Clark Mitchell. Mitchell argued the biggest commonality between modern westerns is a Bewildered Protagonist: that modern cowboys are frequently overwelemed, confused, or outmatched by a world that they can't understand, much less change. That fits this movie to a T.

The small town is a strange rural pocket. You're reminded that the rest of Korea isn't exactly far away. The cultists make a kind of artifical ghost town through their actions. They say that their ritual will bring about a new world, but given their actions, as well as traditional korean garb, it feels as though the frontier is attempting to claw itself back – a reset button at the end of a gun. The psychotically laughing sheriff is also facinating. Over the decades the wild west hero has been pushed from upright, to jaded, to morally dubious, to now outright deranged; as if he was put through the cloning machine from Multiplicity.

movies,Responding to an old GOODFELLAS post about the most brutal scene and Jimmy Conway..,"Context:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/pg7ivz/most\_brutal\_scene\_of\_goodfellas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/pg7ivz/most_brutal_scene_of_goodfellas/)

I'd argue Jimmy was more paranoid than greedy. He knew that the Feds already had eyes on their operation, and as good as the GOON crew were at their part they weren't exactly playing their role with enough caution that Jimmy found viable. He's a professional. Remember the diner scene where Jimmy chooses the seat that can scope out whos coming and going? Very paranoid/cautious man. Jimmy = a cold blooded killer but has a code of conduct to a degree. IMO he mostly wanted to cover tracks by erasing the trail that can be led to him and his main fellas. **Johnny Roastbeef**, the GOONfella that bought a pink Cadillac Eldorado and his wife a white mink fur coat was a HUGE deal to Jimmy.

Jimmy knew that even though his crew were good at executing a heist, they were too much a liability that couldn't be trusted/ignored. For crazy paranoid men like Jimmy all it took was one bad domino. From a business stand point, to Jimmy it was best to get rid of them before they ""fold under pressure."" And remember he learned the art of paranoia from Paulie. Tommy was a huge unhinged liability but Jimmy and Tommy were like brothers, and when Tommy got wacked it was one of the few, if only, times Jimmy cried in his life over a man. Tommy was one of Jimmys few weaknesses and if Jimmy didn't consider Tommy actual family he would have dug another hole in the desert.

I personally think the most brutal scene of Goodfellas was the opening scene. Tommy stabbing Billy Beaten Bats in the trunk the way he did, and hearing the sound of his mothers kitchen knife enter and exit, with Billy making those agonal noises to me was pretty realistic and brutally raw/macabre for a movie. Or should I say CINEMA? Jimmy knowing that the human body can survive many stab wounds deciding to finish Bats off with a .38 snub nose revolver. The dead silent ominous night with that red glow from the tail lights..

Right off the BAT I feel it set the mood for what kind of film it would be going forward.

movies,Sidney can’t be topped when it comes to being a main horror victim,"This post will contain any spoilers about the whole movie franchise from the 90s to early 2000s. This does not includes the recents ones because those suck (in my opinion).


Sidney Prescott literally outvictims any other main characters that survives in horror movies. Like literally. Imagine that life was going so well, then BOOM. Your mom dies. You’re slowly healing from that pain, then BOOM. Random students begin to die at your school. Sounding like the typical Halloween movie you see on tv. Then your closest friend dies and you’re scared for life. You’re scared to trust anyone when your boyfriend is the leading suspect for murder. Then come to find out, your boyfriend and his best friend did commit murder for “no reason”. 

Boyfriend dies and the friend goes  to jail (don’t quote me in that, I don’t really remember).

Life moves on, and then Sidney goes to college with people now taunting her with her past. The bodies began to show up again where she goes to school. Coincidence? It’s a horror movie that basically follows the basic horror rules. It leaves Sidney’s insecurities to resurface. 
She loses more friends and ANOTHER boyfriend is lost. Comes to find out, it was a classmate and your first boyfriend’s mom. She decides to kill Sidney because  Sidney’s mom was the reason why Stu’s parents divorced. Other guy? I think he enjoys the killing.

Third movie, Sidney goes into hiding to try to avoid more killing of good friends. The movie starts with another victim of the first movie. He recently has a part in the new movie based on her life. He ends up dead by the new killer. The new killer finds her and taunts her, saying this was gonna be the last ‘movie’. Keep in mind, all the movies lead to this. The classic movie rules are strict. Who else knew how to directs a movie other than a director? Obviously the director. Who then turns out to be your half brother.

Why? Why did he ruin your life?

All because your mother abandoned him and started her life over. She acted like he wasn’t her son when they met.

movies,Cocoon is a fantastic film from the 80s ,"This film was an academy winner and a huge box office draw and did extremely well in rentals, but in the past 20 some years it's become more famous for how widely unavailable it is in the states.  It's a really heart warming sci fi drama with touches of comedy.  It was previously released on DVD and blu ray but they are both long out of print and have never been given another release, it's not even available for streaming.

Some people believe it may have something to do with music clearance rights with the soundtrack but there is no definite answer as to why Disney and 20th Century Fox haven't given this gem a new release.

movies,Bonhoeffer Movie IMO Pulls the most hypocritical stunts I've seen in film,"I realize this is somewhat out of the scope of r/movies but have a need to discuss this with someone who is not my family.

If you aren't aware: Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a pastor in Germany who advocated against Hitler and his Genocide. Was even part of a resistance cell who tried to assassinate Hitler.

Anyway. My parents roped me into going to see the new Bonhoeffer film that just released; it was okay. Got some of the history wrong but that's movies for you.

My issue with the film. At the very end. They throw up an advertisement for the Anti Defamation League; asking for donations.

From my understanding the ADL is a pro-Zionist organization; support the Israeli state's actions going on in Gaza and the like. And from where I am sitting; is that not a impressive show of hypocrisy?

movies,"What are your favorite ""comeback"" performances?","Basically, movie stars have peaks and valleys in their career, so ""comeback"" roles are inevitable. What are your favorite ones?

1.) Natalie Wood in [""Splendor in the Grass.](https://youtu.be/s-CKnxqdRZg?si=5rWIpyz-9rZ16zKC)"" She'd made some crummy movies after being lauded for her breakout role in ""Rebel Without A Cause"" (and would again after this), but she really did hit it out of the ballpark with her role as Deanie Loomis, the fragile teenaged girl who is driven mad by her first love.

2.) Saoirse Ronan in [""Brooklyn.""](https://youtu.be/15syDwC000k?si=EGYWBqfzVOgsIWAn) A lovely, beautiful story that had Saoirse Ronan fully complete that transition from the child actor that wowed in ""Atonement"" to a bonafide leading lady. Things had been kind rocky for her especially after ""The Host"", but ""Brooklyn"" definitely put her back on the radar as a talented actress.

3.) Hailee Steinfield in ""[Edge of 17](https://youtu.be/NTMziMm7G2I?si=ftz7p0r0ByAUVzN8)."" A coming of age story that had Hailee Steinfield complete the transition from child star to bonafide leading lady. She came right out of the gate with an Oscar nomination for ""True Grit"" but kind of seemed to struggle to find another good role, which often happens a lot during that child actor/adult actor transition.

4.) Ke Huy Quan i[n ""Everything Everywhere All At Once](https://youtu.be/Do-CfOPfkUs?si=3HAy0BkCT45gqwwg)."" Former child actor of the 80's (best known for the Goonies and Indiana Jones) who transitioned into other aspects of the industry. I really loved his performance (as well as everyone else's) and it was really cool to watch him come back and get an Oscar for his efforts.

5.) Reese Witherspoon in[ ""Wild](https://youtu.be/tn2-GSqPyl0?si=2v9za3goUYhHr74N).""

movies,Why is it modern comedy actors like Jason Biggs and Adam Sandler were so much worse than 80's and early 90's actors?,"Look at the top tier comedy talent of the 80's and 90's:  
  
Robin Williams  
Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, etc.  
Bill Murray  
Steve Martin  
Billy Crystal  
Eddie Murphy  
Jim Carrey  
Mike Myers  
Rick Moranis  
John Candy  
Ed O'Neil (Bundy)  
Tim Allen  
All the 80's and 90's sitcoms (I could list dozens here)  
etc.  
  
From the 2000's we only really have Steve Carrell but he became famous later in life so I count him as part of the 80's/90's crowd since he was already in his 40's when he became big in the early 2000's. Or actors like Will Smith, who does both comedy and action.  
  
  
Nowadays we have Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Jason Biggs, etc. who are all much worse than the ""real talent"" of the 80's/90's. I think Jonah Hill is the only decent one nowadays because I find him funny and endearing.

movies,i made a whoopsie when i saw kalki 2898 AD in theaters.,"back in june, i went to see kalki 2898 AD in theaters. for those of you who don't know, kalki 2898 AD is a science fiction movie from india that i honestly think might be one of the best movies of the year. 

when i went, it was early evening and i had not yet eaten dinner. as such, i was craving something a little more filling then popcorn. as such, i ordered the signature burger of the theater. my grandfather had had this burger before and loved it so i decided to try it. 

as i entered the theater, i found that there were quite a few indian people in the audience. and as the time for showtime got nearer and nearer, more indian people entered the auditorium. as a matter of fact, i was the only non indian person in the theater.

eventually, it donned on me. i was eating a hamburger. hamburgers are made from beef. beef comes from cows. cows are sacred animals in indian culture. that realization hit me like a fucking brick. how did that detail slip my mind! 

thankfully, no one was offended and they allowed me to eat my burger in peace. as a matter of fact, i was welcomed with open arms.

movies,Plot twists so cliche it would have been more of a twist to have no twist?,"Spoilers for the movies Prometheus and Reindeer Games (apologies to all those people who are still holding out for that epic Reindeer Games twist)

When I went to watch Prometheus when it released, I just kinda knew that Vickers was Weyland’s daughter. When she actually says it at the end and the music plays it like it’s a twist, I was like “wait, this wasn’t just a given? I thought this was crystal clear from the beginning?” 

There’s a few movie twists like that where the director clearly thought it was a twist and you’re just like… really? THAT is a twist? It would have been a bigger twist for that NOT to be the case. 

The other one for me was Charlize Theron being a bad guy in Reindeer Games. The whole time I was watching it I just kept waiting for the moment she’d do something psychotic. And she does. 

By the way what doesn’t count is if everyone kinda new going into a big franchise movie what would happen. Like a lot of people went into Infinity War 99% sure a lot of people were going to die.

movies,I’ve seen 30 movies this month. Here's my ranked list with mini-reviews.,"Last month the r/horror sub enjoyed my mini-reviews of [42 horror movies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1gfdktq/i_watched_42_horror_movies_this_month_heres_my/) This month, I’ve watched 30 movies (so far) for the first time. The month isn’t up yet, but I've had such a good time with so many of these, I wanted to share now in case anyone was looking for random watch recommendations over the Thanksgiving holiday.

FYI, I try to lean into my subjective experience in my scores, and there is a lot of room for me between liking a movie and being blown away by a masterpiece. I also often like or dislike something without strong emotional feelings. This means a lot of people might rate things further towards love and hate, while I rate a lot towards the middle. It doesn't mean I'm not having a good time!

My rankings don't always line up with my scores. I don't know why--it just happens that way sometimes. Here's about what each score means to me:

5.0 - Rare masterpiece  
4.5 - Fantastic, top-shelf, personal favorite  
4.0 - Loved it  
3.5 - Really liked It  
3.0 - Liked It  
2.5 - Okay / meh  
2.0 - Didn't really like it  
1.5 - Really didn't like it  
1.0 - Actively disliked/annoyed by it  
0.5 - Angry at it

Finally, because sometimes it helps to know someone's pov, I’m a middle-aged white dude.

Without further ado, here’s the list:

**1 - Challengers (2024) - 4.5/5**

Challengers is electric and kinetic and ridiculous and thumping and smashing and mean and confident. Are we still talking about tennis?

There are moments it almost starts taking itself too seriously, then some clever camera work or the fantastic Reznor/Ross score or an absurd amount of trash blowing around in a storm releases the dramatic tension enough for the pulsating style and sensuality to remain the driving heartbeat of the film.

**2 - Perfect Blue (1997) - 4.5/5**

As well written and tightly constructed as any psychological thriller ever has been. There are hard-to-watch, leering scenes of brutality. There is also contemplation on what it is to produce and consume such things. And also what it means to judge such things. Sometimes these all come twisted up together. The layers in the text and subtext will reward multiple viewings. It deserves to be well-known and recognized for its brilliance.

 

**3 - His Three Daughters (2023) - 4.5/5**

An intimate portrait of family as we wish it to be: difficult but unbreakable. The performances are simply fantastic. The transcendent, optimistic ending spares the audience of truer difficulties and family drama. It’s better for it.

 

**4 - Chime (2024) - 4.5/5**

A worthy spiritual successor to Kurosawa's Cure, Chime is an unnerving short film with unexplained acts of casual violence and a slipping grasp of what it means to be a human in the modern world. The alienation of characters from their work, their passions, and those around them, along with the rising sense that not everything we see is what we think, gives the film a feeling of an off-kilter piece of cursed media.

Kurosawa is excellent behind the camera, and is matched by the wonderful cinematography and sound design.

 

**5 - The Apprentice (2024) - 4.5/5**

It takes its time, but once this movie reveals itself, it's absolutely captivating. Full of terrific, evolving performances. Looks right and sounds right. At the heart of the film is a terrifying idea: maybe these dark sociopaths know what America really is, and the rest of us are just deluded idealists.

 

**6 - In Bruges (2008) - 4/5**

A special movie that is funnier, sadder, and sweeter than it even tries to be. The central relationship here makes you want to spent time with these characters, even if it’s In Bruges.

 

**7 - Road to Perdition (2002) - 4/5**

A beautifully made killer-with-a-heart-of-gold revenge movie. Predictable and at times overwrought, it's endearingly earnest in its self serious gangster drama. Mendes has a firm grasp on what he wants from scene to scene, and ends up delivering a very good film with a number of great performances.

 

**8 - My Old Ass (2024) - 4/5**

My Old Ass is a charming coming-of-age romance fantasy that suffers a little from its unrelenting sweetness and an over-the-top, idealized portrait of a privileged care-free youth that will feel unrelatable to most viewers, including this one. But it's also more than that, and although its big reveal isn't all that surprising, and its central lesson is not unique, the way it unfolds will hit some viewers like a much-needed ton of bricks. Including this one.

 

**9 - Fallen Angels (1995) - 4/5**

Kar-Wai Wong does his own thing as a filmmaker, and the effect is mesmerizing. The camera, and therefore the viewer, end up right at home amongst this group of after-dark Hong Kong weirdos, basking in the surreal vibrant false colors of the night.

 

**10 - Quiz Show (1994) - 4/5**

Excellent period drama exploring the relationship between media, government, money, and truth. The themes are as relevant as ever, but it's not exactly reassuring.

The pacing is deliberate and patient, but ends up covering a lot of territory in surprisingly efficient construction. The performances, direction, sets, and camerawork combine to balance the larger-than-life nature of the institutions in focus with a grounded view of the characters (It's worth noting that, with one exception, the drama is seen as conflict between white male elites. Everyone else is downstream collateral.)

 

**11 - The Fall Guy (2024) - 4/5**

An excellent action comedy full of ridiculous set pieces one after another. Gosling has mastered the comedic lovable idiot. Could have benefited with a more aggressive cut. Satirizes it’s own lampshading without dipping into too-cool self mockery.

 

**12 - Hit Man (2023) - 4/5**

The bog-standard presentation of this film is like the Honda Civic that obscures the identity of something more exceptional inside. Powell is a joy to watch as he cycles through personas, and his character's evolution through the story hits the mark.

 

**13 - Emily the Criminal (2022) - 3.5/5**

An unconventional anti-hero story that seeks to subvert its conventional aesthetic. Has a lot on its mind and isn't particularly subtle. A little too melodramatic at times.

 

**14 - The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022) - 3.5/5**

Lovable film that knows how goofy and self-indulgent it is, wearing it on its sleeve with both charming self-awareness and earnest glee, thankfully avoiding the familiar cynical winking resorted to in too many films. In this the movie echoes Cage himself, and is all the better for it.

 

**15 - LaRoy, Texas (2023) - 3.5/5**

Terrific dark comedy with heavy Coen brothers influences. Full of inept characters crisscrossing in their attempts to dig themselves into or out of a hole. Steve Zahn steals every scene he's in.

 

**16 - Thelma (2024) - 3.5/5**

Thelma has a lot of fun with its form and formula. Full of clever and sweet comedy that produce genuine laughs, but even more full of love for the brilliance of what it is to be human: silly, resilient, needy, young, old, determined, and ultimately destined to diminish and die.

 

**17 - Miller's Crossing (1990) - 3.5/5**

Witty and tough, with crackling dialog, stand-offs, and old-school shootouts. The perspective follows the protagonist, Tom, as he ping-pongs his way around rival gangsters, bookies, and a love triangle, scraping by on thin margins, playing life on hard mode, cool and disaffected throughout.

It's his disaffected nature which threatens the film the most, but the Coens are at their best with tight-spiraling stories, and although there might not be much sympathy for who lives and dies, there's enough plotting and progress to keep up the interest in seeing what happens next.

 

**18 - Saturday Night (2024) - 3.5/5**

Uses the familiar faces and iconic images as ingredients in a pressure cooker of a film that leans into its dramatized nature, filling its runtime with funny little slices of moments that feel true and authentic to the legends as we remember them. It's well done, but the trade off is there are moments one wishes they could get off the ride and wallow in the nostalgia.

 

**19 - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) - 3.5/5**

Both an LA-based crime thriller and a ironic RDJ quip-fest that wants to make fun of its flaws before you do. It's constant lampshading can feel a little cheap and unneeded when there are real moments of comedy on hand. Val Kilmer's cool performance owns the film.

 

**20 - Woman of the Hour (2023) - 3/5**

Kendrick shows a lot of talent behind the camera, putting together beautiful images and lingering shots that let the characters dwell in the tension on screen. Unfortunately the construction and writing produces a safe and sanitized version of a story that should be far more unsettling.

 

**21 - Weird: The Al Yankovic Story (2022) - 3/5**

Seems obvious that Weird: The Al Yankovic Story would have to be a parody of musical biopics. Not always great, but always weird, and playful enough that even when the story loses momentum, it's still a lot of fun for those who grew up listening to Weird Al.

 

**22 - Lisa Frankenstein (2024) - 3/5**

Adorable goth teen fantasy romcom with fun music, fashion, and dismemberment. It plays it quirky, cute, and safe, and endears for not trying to be something it's not.

 

**23 - Speak No Evil (2024) - 3/5**

The film is good, and I would have likely rated it higher if I hadn't seen the original released just two years ago. It starts off just as that one did before eventually diverging and providing a new alternate ending (that manages a clever nod back at the first). James McAvoy and Aisling Franciosi are captivating and freaky.

 

**24 - Look Into My Eyes (2024) - 3.5/5**

Beautifully shot and edited, Look Into My Eyes is a documentary film that certainly isn't going to persuade anyone to change their minds about the veracity of psychic channeling. Which is fine, because it's not trying to. Instead it sees its subjects with a warm, sympathetic, nonjudgmental lens and asks viewers to see them not so much as authentic psychics as authentic humans.

 

**25 - Lowlifes (2024) - 3/5**

Dark comedy that delivers a few pleasant surprises. The satire doesn't always work and there's not much in the way of suspense, but the short run time keeps things moving along nicely.

 

**26 - Emilia Pérez (2024) - 2.5/5**

There is a lot to admire, but the film wobbles and waffles on what it’s really about until it ends up reducing itself into something shallow.

 

**27 - Snack Shack (2024) - 2.5/5**

This movie almost works because of the chemistry and energy of the three central actors, despite the grating nature of much of their dialog. In the end it’s too long, has too many contrived dramatic moments, and fails to evoke nostalgia either for any certain time or age.

 

**28 - Brothers (2024) - 2.5/5**

A bad movie in which good actors can't find their characters but still somehow manage to keep things just watchable enough to get the audience through it.

 

**29 - Wolfs (2024) - 2/5**

There might be a movie somewhere in this Clooney and Pitt bromance, but one would need a high tolerance for their flirty banter to bother sifting it out.

movies,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - Thoughts while watching with non-cinephiles,"There is a distinct interest when watching this movie with people who are not really into movies. I was screening it for a movie night and the reaction they had towards the movie was that the middle portion with Stan and Mary taking drugs was quite unnecessary. However, I do not think the movie would be a classic without it.

It is my first time watching the film. I believe I need to watch it again to gain the nuances. The 2nd act of the movie was distinctly more surreal compared to the first and last act. The sudden cuts between Joel grappling with his loss of memories and how Patrick was manipulating Clementine to Mary and Stan having a merry time were an artistic choice and to a non-cinephile, it really removes the tension from those scenes, which is a fair criticism.

I don’t really know what to feel about this? I believe that the subtext was that it made the situation that Joel was in even more absurd. While he is grappling with his own “mortality”, the workers are nonchalant and take this whole process with a seemingly disregarding manner. The idea of this company was not even willing to give the patient the respect they deserve shows a sort of callousness the company has.",wyhnohan,1gyddmj,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gyddmj/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind_thoughts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gyddmj/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind_thoughts/,2024-11-23 23:47:13,0,0.41,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gyddmj
movies,When buff characters grunt more than everyone else in movie battles,"I am not buff, so maybe the assumptions I make in this post are false. But something I've noticed for years is how characters who are muscular in action films tend to grunt a lot or say ""OOF!"" or similar involuntary hings in action scenes. I know this is such a trivial detail, but I find this an odd choice. For example, in scenes wnere the protagonist is of normal build and is being chased by a buff antagonist or grunt, or is fighting one, the buff opponent will do a lot more grunting than the hero. But I'd assume this is not realistic, because physical efforts should be easy for large muscled people?

I first noticed this in the kids movie Spiderwick, when the buff ogre is making all sorts of grunts climbing the house to chase our kid protagonist and the kid is climbing with ease. Here is the scene, two minutes long: [https://youtu.be/1xI\_CHaHWmw?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/1xI_CHaHWmw?feature=shared)

Animation opens up limitless storytelling possibilities without tampering with the charm and legacy of these characters. It allows creators to dive deeper into their worlds, explore untold stories, and experiment with bold new ideas—all while maintaining the spirit fans fell in love with.

movies,Matthew McConaughey nailed playing both an extreme pessimist and an extreme optimist in 2014,"I watched the first season of True Detective in the course of the last weeks and I was totally blown away, especially by the performance of McConaughey and also by how well written his character was. It made me want to re-watch Interstellar, since I remembered his acting to be really good in this one, as well. 

So I finished watching the movie a few minutes ago and during watching it, it became clear to me that his character's personality as Rust Cohle in True Detective is the exact opposite of Joseph Cooper's one in Interstellar. While Cohle sees humanity as a flawed, cancerous anomaly of mother nature, which, in his oppinion, would do best by stopping reproducing at all, Cooper believes in the good traits of society so much, that he even risks never seeing his family again, to get the chance of finding a new home for the human race. Both find themselves in a cruel world, where the bad habits of humans have negative impacts on their lives and both share the destiny of having lost a loved one, yet they couldn't be more different in their beliefs and their motivation to endure.

I really love both of McConaughey's performances on their own, but it's the thought of him mastering the challenge to impersonate two absolutely contradictory characters in the same year, both in a very authentic way, which leaves me in awe.

I want to be able to invest my time watching relationships and characters develop instead of trying to figure out what's going on every time and feeling empty after two hours.

Not sure if I've seen all the movies that fall in this genre or they're just not making it any more.

Leon the Professional also comes to mind.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Monaco,"Hello there,

everyday since more than a month I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain european country. While the search for the best movie set in Ireland probably has been the most fruitful so far, since then, things have become a little more difficult. So far, this week has been particularly tough here and this trend continued yesterday with Moldova. Nevertheless, I am sure that with ***Carbon*** we have found a worthy entry for [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

I'm following an alphabetical order here (before anyone asks: England is still to come, just wait and see) and we're sticking with the letter M for a bit, because today it's all about **Monaco**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Does Recasting Disrupt your viewing Experience? ,"Does it take you out of a movie or TV show if an actor has been recast in a sequel or when a younger version is a different actor?

I see a lot of discussion about this topic when it comes to franchises and their supposedly importance to continuity. How it takes people out of it and there needs to be some explanation why an actor is different. Or some meta-reference (i.e., ""I'm here, deal with it"" from Iron Man 2).

I feel like people these days are less willing to suspend their disbelief. Or think they aren't able to. They want their work of fiction to be 100% canon-perfect or they are being pulled out of it.

With the Penguin recently, I never questioned the younger actor playing Francis Cob. There was never a disconnect between Emily Meade and Deirdre O'Connell. All it takes is just two good actors, good costuming, and good makeup for me to believe that they were the same character.I tend to find it more distracting when the de-aging hits that uncanny valley.

movies,"Sylvester Stallones physique and career, opinions?","Lets talk about an ""old"" legend whos still keeping it going with Tulsa King, believe it or not. We're talking about Sylvester Stallone aka Sly. It's obviously been discussed a thousand times before, but it cant hurt to talk about again, am I right? So what are your guys opinion on stallones physique and what do you consider his absolute peak condition/best shape? The Rambo 2 photo of Stallone with the machine gun was literally THE photo/wallpaper that defined action movies in the 80s and early 90s, for most people. Everyone had a wallpaper of that (Rambo 2 cover) on their wall somewhere if they were a huge action movie fan. 

Stallone and Arnold were obviously the 2 kings at that time and the biggest action movie rivalry there ever was in the 80s and 90s. Both looked and acted so badass in their own way.

Stallone was clearly the most shredded one whilst also incredibly muscular actor you could find, while Arnold was the biggest in terms of pure mass and height (peak height was 6'1.75 187cm). Nowadays hes actually under 5'11/180cm according to celebheights, around 5'10.5 (179cm), imagine that height loss) I guess that's why Sly literally looks close to the same height as Arnold these days.

Anways, Slys abs and muscle definition were unmatched and unbeatable during movies like Rocky 3 (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Rambo 2 (1985) and Rambo 3 (1988). Safe to say he stayed in insane shape from 1982 - 1988. Oh and fun fact if you didn't know, Stallone himself actually said that he was in the best shape of his life during the filming of Cliffhanger which was mostly filmed in 1992 and released in 1993. I mean theres no denying that he does look massive and shredded in the tanktop in the beginning, and it explains the decision to wear jus a t-shirt on a freezing mountain throughout the movie, to show off them guns lmao. He rly did have massive arms though during that era (1992-1995). Also filmed around the same time as Demolition Man where his physique also looked amazing during the whole frozen nude scene, no homo... but all the homo. :&gt; Also looked great in The Specialist (1994) which was filmed right before Judge Dredd (1995), which was the last movie to star his amazing physique. Stallones physique went to hell after that and didn't resurface until The Expendables in 2010, and it's amazing how similar to Demolition Man he looks, despite it being almost 20 years later and him becoming ancient. He was at his biggest in mass during those years but more shredded in the earlier years (80s) in my opinion. What do you guys think?

My personal opinion is he looked the absolute best in Rambo 3, see attached photo from it. Like watching him in that stick fight, no one has ever looked as shredded and massive as Stallone did during that time. Despite only being 5'9.5 (176cm) which was his true height, not 5'10. He would often pull off the appearance of someone bigger tho (taller is probably the better word). But make no mistake, people often give Sly shit for wearing elevator boots or w/e, but the fact of the matter is in most movies he always wanted a bigger opponent to face. Thats why he got Hulk Hogan in in Rocky 3, and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky 4 (and even made him stand on a box to give an even taller look). Hes never been afraid to look the smaller guy like alot of ppl make it out to be. I mean Cobra is another example, he put Brigitte Nielson in it who was taller than him at 6'0. And he wasnt shy of looking shorter than her being only close to 5'10. He looks about 5'11 next to her in Cobra and hes wearing high heel boots which is obvious but still. If he was actually ""5'8"" or shorter that some ppl seem to think, he could never pull off looking that close to her. She was wearing heels if I remember as well.

And yes I am a huge Stallone fan incase this essay wasnt obvious. I love Arnold too and hes obv also a legend but Stallone &gt; Arnold. I mean the wild horse is still going (Tulsa King). What a crazy force of nature! In my opinion Stallone had the better movies (Cliffhanger, Demolition Man, Cobra, Copland, Daylight) and not to mention franchises (Rocky (8 movies if you count Creed I+II), Rambo (4 movies - not counting the last one sorry but its ridiculous and its not ""rambo""), The Expendables (4 movies), started out way earlier than Arnold and paved the way for him basically, and not to mention the fact hes actually directed and wrote like half of all his movies too all while acting as well. It's wild to think about.

movies,A quiet place: day one was the best horror film i've seen this year ,"The title says it all.

Lupita's acting was absolutely phenomenal and her relationship Joseph Quinn's character felt so real. The emotional moments are hard hitting and the scenes of mass terror are awe striking.
Overall an incredible drama set in a disaster/horror setting. 

But i actually hate that the movie is part of the quite place franchise lol. The creatures themselves always felt way too gimmicky to me (you've got a dozen ears and you can't hear a person breathing right next to you? Come on). They are utilitized perfectly in day one, but even then my only complaints about the film are related to creatures' functionality, which consistently doesn't make sense across the franchise.
 
But now the fans of the first two films are hating on an actual good movie because it isn't creature focused (even though the scenes of destruction caused by the monsters top anything from the first two films).

movies,Now I get why this sub doesn't like The Critical Drinker,"I've been watching Drinker's videos for a while. To be honest, I think the guy has a way with words, and I used to think most of his reviews of newer movies—like Alien: Romulus—were okay, maybe a bit biased toward his CLEARLY conservative view of the world.

However, I just watched his video on Gladiator 2, and... man, the dude was as disingenuous as it gets. Don't get me wrong, the movie is far from the OG Gladiator, but some of the points he made were disingenuous at best and outright lies at worst.

For example (SPOILER) &gt;!when he claims that Lucius pulls an army out of nowhere. Dude, literally half the movie teases the army waiting for Acacius' call to arms. The whole ""taking the word of a random guy with Acacius' ring"" might be unrealistic, but it’s justified within the context of the story arc.!&lt;

The guy does make some decent points about character development (or lack thereof), but overall his take feels like someone who didn’t pay much attention to what was going on on-screen.

So I'm on my third viewing of Alita and each time I have this weird response. Great source material, James Cameron producing, Christopher Waltz acting. Robert Rodriguez directing.

Yet the actual film is more B grade than I would expect and I find parts of the movie good like Alita's CGI and the moon battles. But other than that it just felt more drab and poorly constructed than I expected. The love story alone is straight to VHS quality.

I don't think we're getting a sequel which is disappointing. But then I almost think it's for the better.

The Motorball sequence is cool. But again that's one sequence.

I've also noticed the lighting is quite B grade aswell. Which lessens the impact. You only have to watch Avatar or Titanic to see how much lighting can improve the scene.

movies,Spellbound (2024) - Normalizing The Wrong Thing,"This is my review, there are spoilers for this animated film below, so I bared out the whole post.

&gt;!I loved it right until the end. As a child of divorce it hit hard. As a parent of four, with a spouse who is equally committed to the care of our love through the spiritual and mental upkeep of our relationship, the movie missed the mark for me.!&lt;

&gt;!The animation, singing, voice acting, all of it is really good stuff. I enjoyed that aspect and was pretty well drawn into the world of the movie.!&lt;

&gt;!The movie was about transformation - literally. When we forget to take care of relationships they transform on us, to a point of not being recognizable anymore. No one recognized the King and Queen because they had transformed into monsters. Now, if we interpret their ""monster"" selves as the representation of a toxic relationship (ie, all the helping the daughter does for them, all the destruction they create, etc), the end of the movie makes more sense, but that's not what we get.!&lt;

&gt;!Instead, it is set up that they've been cursed and need to be healed to go back to normal, so their daughter takes up the quest.!&lt;

&gt;!The transformation of the parents at the end, their resolution to the entire adventure, was to give up on their relationship, while the movie was about a girl who never gave up on her parents.!&lt;

&gt;!Obviously, there are exceptions for when relationships become abusive. But nowhere was that set up, that mom and dad had become toxic (or emotionally abusive). There was the potential, but this isn't realized in the film.!&lt;

&gt;!More peculiar, throughtout the adventure, there is some recognition from the parents. They recognize their fighting was hurting their daughter in the tunnel, and adjust behavior. They recognize that they can't listen to each other on the sand, and adjust behavior. There were several moments building to a place of understanding that they must work together to realign themselves in their relationship and the end of the movie is to give up on the relationship as a couple, things will be different now, the new normal - with absolutely zero care as to how that works out successfully.!&lt;

&gt;!Healthy families of all sorts (mom and mom, dad and dad, mom and dad) are vital for children; we shouldn't be normalizing divorce unless it's the absolute only way forward or its the clear resolution to abuse. We should be normalizing self care, which ironically, much of the adventure through the dark forest mirrors the work of therapy - confronting deep rooted emotions and moving through them.!&lt;

&gt;!I felt as though the movie took an easy way out and honestly, I felt betrayed because the movie missed setting up crucial details to make the divorce at the end (or separation, really) justifiable. I felt that the oracles easily represented therapists, I felt that when Ellian was wrapped up by the storm we could have seen her childhood memories through her now more mature eyes, and seen that her parents weren't perfect, fought alot, etc., and instead we see a perfect family, loving their daughter. I felt the themes of how stressful work can be on families, parents especially, and how setting boundaries is important, spending time together is important (even their song to Ellian had a line like, ""We forgot you come first"").!&lt;

&gt;!Ultimately, the reasoning for the divorce/separation was set up flimsy at best. And worse, the resolution to the entire thing was not fleshed out. Divorce, and post separation is incredibly difficult, and it was not given the proper attention.!&lt;

&gt;!Making a movie about divorce is brave, and I'd be here for it if it was clear that was the path. Making a movie about working through difficult, perhaps even insurmountable problems through intentional selfcare and boundary setting is even more brave.!&lt;

&gt;!I cannot recommend it for these reasons and felt it was a huge let down.!&lt;",Hrair,1gxqus8,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gxqus8/spellbound_2024_normalizing_the_wrong_thing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gxqus8/spellbound_2024_normalizing_the_wrong_thing/,2024-11-23 03:57:04,66,0.87,66,0,65,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Review,spoiler,t3_1gxqus8

movies,"Do movies have a responsibility to be historically accurate, especially in revisionist history?","I was listening to a podcast on Gladiator 2 and the hosts were saying that historians are ""overthinking"" the fact that Ridley Scott used sharks in the Colosseum fight. But honestly, I **don’t** think they are making a big deal out of nothing. Movies absolutely shape how people think about history—especially since we all know that most people don’t read anymore. Sure, anyone *could* Google and find out that sharks in ancient Rome would be impossible, but let’s be real: they're not going to. It’s way more likely that someone will watch this movie and then later argue with the internet or worse, an actual historian, about why it ""has to be true"" because they saw it in a movie.

I’m all for getting creative with storytelling and getting lost in movie world building , but we also need to admit that people are lazy, and critical thinking isn’t exactly thriving right now. If directors want to take big liberties, that’s fine, but there are two ways to do it:

1. **Make the world feel surreal or inconsistent.** If the movie leans more into fantasy or creates a heightened version of reality, something like ""sharks in the Colosseum"" wouldn’t feel out of place. It would match the tone, and viewers wouldn’t mistake it for a historical fact.
2. **Put in the research.** History is full of wild, unbelievable stories that could inspire equally cool (and more accurate) action scenes. If you’re going to tell a historical story, why not dig a little deeper to find something that fits the time period and still wows the audience?

What do you think?Do movies have a  responsibility to at least TRY to be historically accurate where they can be? or does it not matter as long as the movie is fun to watch? Where do we draw the line?  I feel like the least we can do is allow historians to complain when movies aren't accurate. Especially when it literally takes nothing away from the overall plot to make a slight change.

So what are the best hidden gems you've seen this year? Ones unlikely to be listed on all the year end lists simply because they weren't seen?

He also appear in a lot of middling films, rom-coms, that just come and go. I heard that he is sort of blacklisted from bigger films because of comments he had made against China, so he is kinda stuck doing indie or mid-budget movies.

movies,Quirky moments in history you'd like to see made into a movie,"What quirky moments of history would you like to see a film made about?

Here's my example:

I love quirky aspects of every day life an history.

I just found this out about the first ever CCTV camera:

&gt;An early mechanical CCTV system was developed in June 1927 by Russian physicist Léon Theremin[9] (cf. Television in the Soviet Union). Originally requested by CTO (the Soviet Council of Labor and Defense), the system consisted of a manually-operated scanning-transmitting camera and wireless shortwave transmitter and receiver, with a resolution of a hundred lines. 
&gt;Having been commandeered by Kliment Voroshilov, Theremin's CCTV system was demonstrated to Joseph Stalin, Semyon Budyonny, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, and subsequently installed in the courtyard of the Moscow Kremlin to monitor approaching visitors.
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television#:~:text=An%20early%20mechanical%20CCTV,visitors.%5B9%5D) 

This would be such an interesting and quirky fragment of history to show on film. Plus, it wouldn't be your standard biopic about Stalin. It would be about a specific moment in history to delve into and would no doubt provide some insightful commentary on surveillance and control etc. Hah perhaps get Nolan or Danny Boyle on the case, a director with some gravitas like that.

I look forward to hearing about more quirky moments in history from you all.",Ok-fine-man,1gxhpbv,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gxhpbv/quirky_moments_in_history_youd_like_to_see_made/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gxhpbv/quirky_moments_in_history_youd_like_to_see_made/,2024-11-22 20:36:47,2,0.58,2,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gxhpbv

movies,The Netflix movie 'Me Time' broke my brain,"So this movie is about as far removed from what I would normally watch as could be, but it was in a group setting and that's what was decided on so I was like alright, not my cup of tea but whatever.

For the most part, it's exactly what you'd expect a Netflix original comedy with a single-digit RT score to be; not overly offensive, just a complete waste of time that feels like it was made in a laboratory. That being said, there's one plot point towards the end of this that I cannot stop thinking about because it's so *weird*, and I feel like I must either be missing something or the people making this are really as out of touch as I think they are. 

Basically, one of the plot points throughout the movie is that Mark Wahlberg's character owes a ton of money, which at the end Kevin Hart agrees to pay him for, but then it's revealed that Seal (who had shown up at the birthday party) didn't actually just appear as a favor, he did so because Mark Wahlberg paid him $12.5K or something to appear at the party.

This isn't really played as overtly farcical, and the rest of the movie is very much about establishing Kevin hart as ""just a regular suburban dad"". If this was a satire about out-of-touch Hollywood elitists, it would make FAR more sense for this to be a plot point rather than being in the same movie where another plot point is having to replace a minivan. 

I can't help but feel like the bubble of Hollywood has gotten so thick that the people creating these types of totally soulless Netflix originals genuinely think that paying a musician 12.5 grand for a birthday appearance is just as relatable to people as Clark Griswold getting the new family pool. I know I'm overanalyzing a movie that was literally just made to farm watch-minutes and it isn't that deep, but this in particular was one of the most baffling things I've seen in any movie in a long time.

movies,Anyone else love Tarantinos pulp fiction and kill Bill but can't stand his historical movies?,"Let me start off by saying I thought pulp fiction and reservoir dogs are amazing movies. Pulp fiction is one of the best made movies ever. The themes, characters, music. It's such a good movie that has tension and drama and action but it's isn't a nonstop shootem up.

Pulp Fiction is ultimately a movie about humanity. It's about horrible gangsters but there are so many moments that showcase that even the worst criminals may still be heroic and do good deeds. Butch saving Wallace is the biggest example but there's also Jules revelation that he is actually part of the evil in the world. Vince and Mia have a connection and their entire subplot is really hiyt forbidden love. Vince however doesn't ever have a redemption the way Jules and Butch and Wallace do so he ends up dead just like any old criminal.

It's a complicated movie that explores what it means to be human and the choices people make. The foreshadowing of captain coons and his speech about when two men are in a hell hole together they take care of each other is paid off brilliantly with butch going back for Wallace.

Kill Bill is also very good and explore similar scenes with the bride trying to leave her life of violence for her child, only to loose her and start her journey of revenge. 
It's not as good as pulp fiction but still a very good revenge story with strong characters and plays with loose mortality.

Then you have Tarantinos historical movies like Django unchained and inglorious bastards. 

They are so flat and seem like they are written by a guy who just said, I wanna make a movie where people kill historical bad guys. It's like they were written by a child who knows slavery and Nazis are bad and just wants to watch basically super heros defeat them.

It's fine to want this, you actually should not be rooting for cruel slave owners or Nazis, but it's so simplistic and boring compared to pulp fiction, reservoir dogs and kill Bill. 

It's just here are the evil bad guys now kill them! Kill Bill characterizd bill and made you feel for him even though he's a horrible killer. That's what his movies are good at.  

The action is just over the top and kinda stupid, you can argue that it was for kill Bill but it was very much in a comic book style world where the bride talks to the camera, it doesnt work in historical movies. Django just goes and single handedly kills all the bad guys. It's like a dumb superhero movie ending. Igneous same thing. Such stupid scenes. 

Why bother doing any of the big set up with buying back his wife if he was such a good gunslinger he can just kill everyone? Django himself is flat and boring. Morally he's good and killing bad guys. Theres nothing deeper going on about humanity. It's just here is our good guy he will now shoot bad guys. Same with ignorious. 

That's my rant.

movies,Catch Me if You Can: Frank's Father,"What's the deal with Frank's dad (Christopher Walken)?

I got the sense that among his peers he was of low status and was faking his bravado. He made some comments about being the mouse that kicked so hard, he turned the milk into butter and the president of the club made a comment about him being in some sort of custodial / assistant role.

He was so proud of his induction into the rotary club and nabbed the attractive French girl who was out of his league (""I've been fighting for us since the day we met""). He was all about show, like that time he was trying to get a bank loan and had Frank Jr dress up as his driver. I feel like he was trying to play the part of a big shot, but in the end the ruse never really held up...except in the eyes of Frank Jr. He obviously screwed up somewhere - maybe committed some sort of fraud - and lost his money, his presumed status, and his family.

I think Frank Jr. never really caught on to this charade and always saw his dad as a hero. Or maybe he did know and just refused to face the truth that is dad was just a lying, ordinary nobody.

movies,Why do I not understand action thrillers like Mission Impossible?,"I consider myself to be pretty smart, well-versed, and in general I follow along to many shows/movies with complex themes and ideas.

So I don't know what it is about movies like Mission Impossible, or the Bourne movies, where I genuinely have no idea what the hell is going on. I can follow along in like a superficial level, I enjoy the witty banter/dialogue, I obviously enjoy the action setpieces, but I cannot follow the story at all. I rewatched the latest Mission Impossible movie (Dead Reckoning) since I last saw it in theaters, and I still didn't understand what was going on. It just seems to jump around and I can't follow the plot points. It feels like it literally is moving too fast for me? 

I remember a movie that I LOVED, Mission Impossible Fallout, I felt the same way. I loved it for the action. But towards the end of the movie, there's a bunch of double-crosses going on with Henry Cavill's character, Angela Bassett's character, and Alec Baldwin's character, and I just couldn't understand the conclusions the characters were coming to. The twist reveal that Henry Cavill was actually this character John Locke was completely lost on me and went over my head, because I didn't even understand the clues that led to the characters figuring this out or why it was even significant (I only could vaguely understand the gist that he was a double-crossing secret agent)

I feel pretty similar to the Bourne movies as well, and even the Daniel Craig Bond movies (I haven't seen them in a while though)

movies,Sean Connery's first appearance as James Bond in Doctor No - what an incredible movie introduction,"I've just been watching Dr No and it struck me how much of an awesome introduction it was to James Bond and how it must have taken audiences by storm when it first came out.

In the [first scene](https://youtu.be/b15-P12gIf0?si=IHj8iRMQ0PlKRb4R) we see Bond, played by Sean Connery hanging out at the poker table, winning a hand against a glamorous exotic woman, in a tux and smoking a cigarette. She asks who he is. 'Bond, James Bond' that iconic line. Then the just as iconic music plays. It gave me chills watching it now, there's just some magic in that moment. I can't imagine what it must have been like for movie fans at the time.

He is called away and cool as ice he gets his massive bundle of chips exchanged, and while he's waiting, he seduces the woman who was at the card table. He arranges a date and leaves his card while he walks away with his notes in hand.

Just a quick snappy scene that encompasses so much of what makes Bond cool. Just a pure alpha male depiction. A male fantasy, even. All just simply crafted in quick 3 minutes of show don't tell. Amazing scene.

I also like how Dr No is fairly grounded to begin with. No huge balls to wall fight scenes, gun fights or mad chase sequences. We see Bond doing what you'd expect of an international secret agent, following leads, sniffing out deception, being tales and interrogating villains, whike also pulling off some nifty defensive moves using his and his physicality. 

And you can't help but love the schoolboy rapscallion energy he has when speaking to his boss M. Sure he seems a bit handsy and pervy with Moneypenny but I'll give that a pass for now, haha - but audiences wouldn't have seen any issue with that type of behaviour at the time. Plus, they had a great dynamic and chemistry.

movies,"Did anyone feel ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978) had a gay subtext involving Mike (Robert De Niro) and Nick (Christopher Walken)?","I absolutely adore The Deer Hunter. I was obsessed. I loved the music, the characters, the fact it wasn't completely set in Vietnam and dealt with those who came back as well as those left behind. I still think Meryl Streep should have won the Oscar for this over Kramer vs Kramer. 

What I did find intriguing was the whole dynamic between Mike, Nick and Linda. At first, I thought Mike and Nick were in love with the same woman, but after Pushkov (John Cazale) accuses Mike of being gay, it made me think and do a further exploration of Mike and Nick. 

Do I think they were hooking up on the side? No, but I did feel Mike had unspoken feelings for Nick, feelings he seemed conflicted about. I mean, even though he does hook up with Linda when he returns, he seems uninterested. Like he gets closer with Linda just so he can be close to the memory of Nick.

And Mike's scenes with Nick feel very tense, a weird vibe that seems unresolved. In the 2nd half of The Deer Hunter, all Mike cares about is Nick and Linda is an afterthought. 

If you think Mike is in love with Nick, it does allow you to see the movie in a new light and even resolves some of the scenes which seemed to come out of nowhere.

movies,Gathering idea‘s of what Sing 3 could be about and what could be happening in the movie.,"Maybe some of the illumination employees will see this and take some ideas. I also have some:

1. It would be cool if ash would get a new boyfriend thats supportive and also loves rock. I know that in the second movie, meena already had a boyfriend and that could be a little copied, but after lance, its gonna be good for her.

2. This would actually be really sad but it would just be realistic if Nana died in Sing 3. Ofc it wouldn’t be cool but it would just be realistic, because even in the first movie everyone was surprised that she‘s still alive and she is over 90 years old so yeah i think you get my point.

3. If someone of the cast or a new character (maybe even the partner of someone like ash‘s or meena‘s boyfriend) would get injured in idk an accident or a crash, that would certainly make some dramatic and interesting scenes. Ik we ofc don’t want anything bad to happen to the characters, but this never happened in any of the films before and it would probably make more dynamic in the movie, if you get what i mean.

movies,John Carpenter's The Thing: What The Host Perceives,"**Note:** I made this as a comment to a question on this subreddit 2 years ago, and I felt so intrigued by the question itself I wanted to bring it back up as a discussion. The question is (credit to u/cinemaofthevoid FYI):

""Do the characters in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) in fact know they have been assimilated by the Thing?""

u/cinemaofthevoid cited Norris's behavior before his assimilation was discovered as what provoked this question, wondering if ""the imitation might be so perfect that even the person might not know they were an imitation. Norris appears to be genuinely in pain before he collapses, a human response that would be unnecessary to imitate, especially when he is not around others.""

My answer on my own take of this is copy pasted from the comment I made on the thread:

""I think it depends on HOW the assimilation occurred.

Norris-Thing had no objective reason to feign a heart attack or those pains. In fact, it had the opposite. Norris-Thing would probably know defibrillators are one of the ways to revive a person who has had a heart attack. And given how it reacts to the defibrillator (aka with great hostility where it would risk revealing itself which it canonically strives to avoid doing as the movie established), that means that if Norris-Thing was aware it had been infected, it voluntarily placed itself in a situation where it would have been in danger. That makes no sense; everything we know about the Thing's characterization goes against this.

But then there's instances like Bennings, who was quite clearly infected and was aware of being infected (aka Bennings no longer was acting like Bennings, but a Thing) in one of the rare instances on screen we see an infection actually occur in real time.

So that brings me to my initial claim, that it entirely depends on how the infection happened. I believe that when a blatant assimilation occurs, like with Bennings, the dogs, Windows, etc., yes, the Thing instances are 100% aware they are a Thing instance, and thus behave as such while still pretending to be the host.

But when the assimilation is NOT blatant, that changes the formula.

Take what Fuchs talks about in regards to food, and how he suggests that they should prepare their own meals and put it in cans to protect themselves from infection. Let's say that someone gets infected via food; aka a Thing instance puts their own cells into the food mixture, host eats it, Thing cells are now in the body.

The assimilation is consequently much more subtle. Less body horror, and more cells are simply being changed one by one. But full assimilation and imitation requires the cells to still behave as they are. A Thing blood cell is not going to be different from a normal blood cell in behavior...until it strikes.

So I believe that the Thing instances that are subtly infected in such a manner remain consciously unaware that they're infected. Their neurons, their behaviors, remain the same, because the Thing cells are still so deep undercover that the host isn't even aware there's an assimilation happening. Even when assimilation is complete, the Thing cells still operate like their normal real counterparts. Thus, the host behaves the exact same as their normal counterpart, because they don't know they're a Thing. No matter what you do or say to get them to confess or reveal themself, they won't deviate. It's a perfect camouflage; how better to convince something you're one of them if you genuinely believe it yourself?

It's only when there's external stimuli (aka something that would endanger it) that these subtle ""Thing"" instances turn the switch, and they become aware of what they are. Take the Norris-Thing instance. If it had survived and reconstituted itself into Norris once again, it would now be aware of what it is. Thus, it would now behave like a Thing pretending to be Norris, and not simply think that it's still Norris, because there's now no way the Thing neurons can pretend they aren't a Thing anymore.

More evidence of this behavior is the heart attack itself. It's implied Norris has heart problems, which would occur because of biological processes. So the Thing cells, in imitating Norris so perfectly, now mimic his biological processes, even if it's disadvantageous, because the Thing cells are acting as though they AREN'T infected unless it endangers them. And the heart attack doesn't actually endanger the Thing; the Thing is just a conglomerate of cells that decide it'd work to their advantage to work together, and are imitating a heart attack perfectly.

This is all consistent with the Thing's characterization. It doesn't WANT to do the body horror shit it does in the movie, because that would impact the ability of Thing instances to infiltrate and just naturally infect people. If it just naturally infects people over time, those people won't deviate at all. They won't try to sabotage or create in-fighting to deflect attention; they simply act the same, while allowing the inherent process of exposure to other organisms to do the infecting for them. 

Meanwhile, blatantly infected Thing instances WILL deviate from the behaviors of their host because it knows what it actually wants, aka spreading to all living organisms, and thus will work specifically towards that goal. Thus, it will sabotage, it will provoke paranoia, it'll do anything it can to survive, even if it's out of character of what it's imitating. It's still pretending to be the host, yes. But it doesn't THINK its the host, it doesn't think LIKE the host. Therefore, it's an ultimately inferior imitation.

Meanwhile, the more subtly infected Thing instances won't deviate, because that host still thinks they're normal. And the infection and success rate of these instances will be much more effective. Think about how often cells are exchanged between organisms on a daily basis. Wipe off a sneeze with your hand, a few hours later, shake hands with another person. That person is now infected with Thing cells.

This is much more consistent with how the Thing displays its preferences and personality. The Thing is patient. The Thing is smart. The Thing doesn't want people to know its among them. It's only when it's in danger that it changes into the infamous body horror forms the franchise is known for. If it had a choice, the Thing would conquer the planet without anyone ever knowing it.

This is an overall extremely long rant, but the short summary is:

The Thing cells, when they infiltrate the host subtly, are so good at imitation that they trick the body and brain into thinking there's no assimilating process occurring. Therefore, the Thing IS that person, even though that person is now long gone. Meanwhile, instances like Blair or Bennings are distinctly aware they have been assimilated, and thus act according to the Thing's interests, and not to what the host would be interested in, and they therefore make for a more imperfect copy.

Blatant assimilation, the Thing is pretending to be the host (aka worse camouflage).

Subtle assimilation, the Thing IS the host (aka better camouflage).""

I'm not sure if this is the clearest explanation of my thought process; I don't think there's an easy way to describe it.

movies,The worst use of voiceover,"I don’t mind the use of voiceover at all of it‘s well done, but I recently rewatched „In Her Shoes“, a film I like despite a few pet peeves (like trying to sell Toni Collette as a fat woman). But one thing that really bugs me is that the film starts with brief voiceover from both women - and then stops using it completely. If you could show everything else without telling for the rest of the film, couldn’t you do it for the other 90 seconds, as well? 

I think „Hillbilly Elegy“ did the same thing, but I don’t feel like rewatching it to double-check.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Moldova,"Hello there,

if I haven't miscalculated, this is the 30th time I've asked you - following the alphabet - about your favorite movie set in a given country. For example, we came up with a small but fine selection yesterday. At the end ***Luzzu*** has won for Malta  and can now take its rightful place in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). I haven't seen it yet, but the description by the poster, who suggested it, sounds very promising:

&gt;It talks about the dying fishing industry in the Maltese islands and feels extremely authentic. It portrays Malta and the maltese language very realistically and it is very well produced.

To be honest, we've actually had a pretty tough week, in which it was sometimes really difficult to even find a movie set in the respective country. And: Somehow, when I look at the downvotes and upvotes, there has already been more acceptance for this project in the past time. But then again,: I would really like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has participated so far - and also to those, who will participate on one of the next threads - perhaps already today, when it comes to movies set in **Moldova**? As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

I planned on seeing Blitz with my dad this weekend, but I can’t seem to access buying tickets after today (the 21st). A bit bummed, because we were both looking forward to it. 

Does anyone know how I can find out if it’s still being shown after today? I know it’s in select theaters, but our nearest theater was already showing it… so yeah

movies,Has anyone ever actually seen the famous Josh Brolin No Country for Old Men audition filmed by Robert Rodriquez and shot by Quentin Tarantino?,"Every actor goes through the process of self-shooting audition tapes. These tapes get sent to directors who are considering you for a part. The teams watch the tapes and then cast based on them.

Sometimes the actors are in the room, but a lot of times you're just watching someone deliver lines and hoping they show you enough to make it count. For actors, this lifeless shot in the dark is part of the process. But it can also be hard if you're not good with a [camera](https://nofilmschool.com/topics/cinematography-cameras), [lighting](https://nofilmschool.com/learn-basics-of-cinematography), or just [editing](https://nofilmschool.com/hollywood-editing-success-using-adobe-premiere-pro) your own stuff. 

Well, when Josh Brolin was working with [Quentin Tarantino](https://nofilmschool.com/tarantino-directing-actors) and [Robert Rodriguez](https://nofilmschool.com/pulp-fiction-star-wars) on *Grindhouse*, he got a call from his agents. The [Coen brothers](https://nofilmschool.com/coen-brothers-quotes) wanted him to do a self-tape for *No Country for Old Men.* Brolin was excited but knew to land a Coen movie his audition had to stand out. He approached Tarantino and Rodriguez at lunch one day and asked if they'd shoot him doing it. They agreed. 



Brolin told [Collider](https://collider.com/josh-brolin-interview-no-country-for-old-men/), ""Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarrantino filmed my first audition on a $1 million Genesis camera during lunch during *Grindhouse,* and so that was a really cool-looking audition, but I didn’t get the part. It was turned down."" 

It turns out, the audition looked so good all the Coens wanted to know was who shot it. After they got the explanation they didn't reach back out.

But Brolin was set on the role, so he had to pursue it himself.

He said, ""They watched it and their response was, 'Who lit it?' But I was much bigger and I had a goatee but it had nothing to do with the physicality, they just didn’t see it. It’s not what they were looking for at that moment. It wasn’t resonating, and I have a brilliant agent who just became a persistent pest and just said 'meet him, meet him, meet him, meet him.

If my point of view seems too radical, feel free to disagree in the comments and tell me your point of view.

Original:
Can we please agree that jump scares are the lowest form of horror device? They're cheap, lazy, easy and unbelievably annoying. Especially since they are abused so much. 

I suppose you could use one or two in a film, to highlight a certain high point in the climax of the story. Great example: Paranormal Activity only has one, at the very last second of the movie!

However it's so common to see entire movies using them as crutches to sustain a complete lack of artistic capacity, slowly and lazily limping away towards a cliché end.

movies,Sean Baker and Women as Victims ,"I've been thinking about Anora since I saw it a few weeks ago. I was extremely excited to see it since I have known many dancers in my life and even worked at a club for a few weeks in my 20s. I also LOVED Sean Baker's other films, Tangerine and The Florida Project. However, when I saw Anora I was the minority of people who disliked it because I felt like the reflection of Sean Baker's club wasn't the reflection of most dancers I know. In my experience, most dancers choose that profession because of the personal agency it gives them. You can make good money, make your own schedule, and it gives them an odd sense of control over men who can only have access to their body if they pay them.

When I was dancing I was also struck by how much love there was between the women. And although there's a host of truly awful things in the dancer community (racism, harassment, shitty working conditions, substance abuse), I felt like Anora was just a very male centered and stereotypical view of the dancer community. In Sean Baker's world, dancers are constantly catty, a bit vapid, pining over their customers, and overwhelmingly victims of their circumstance with no real agency or even a personality more than ""baddie stripper"".

This movie made me think back to Tangerine and the Florida Project with new eyes and I think that Sean Baker really has a problem with making his women ONLY the victims of circumstance. Although, I loved the voyeuristic nature of Tangerine and The Florida Project, following his female characters throughout their every day tragedies -- Anora makes me wonder is that the only perspective Sean Baker can portray? The modern day damsel in distress? It makes me uncomfortable to have a man tell stories of disempowered women in such vulnerable and honest way without highlighting the integrity, agency, intelligence, and loyalty that I personally see within these communities. I worry about him equating marginalization with victimhood. Would love to hear anyone's thoughts about this.

TLDR; Sean Baker's women continue to be the damsel in distress but can he portray other facets of marginalized women?",Automatic_Syrup_2935,1gwpcvt,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwpcvt/sean_baker_and_women_as_victims/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwpcvt/sean_baker_and_women_as_victims/,2024-11-21 20:26:10,0,0.35,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gwpcvt

movies,What are some of the greatest film adaptations of books,"If I've read both a book and seen the film based on it, the book is nearly always better.  There's much more ability to get inside the characters' heads in a novel and more time to develop backstory and subplots.  Film adaptations often need to simplify a novel to fit it in a reasonable running time.

However, some film adaptations do do an amazing job of capturing and in rare cases exceeding the novel they are based on.  What do you think are some of the best film adaptations of novels/books?

These are some of my favorites and I realize that they are obvious choices:

Goodfellas (from Wiseguy by N. Pileggi) - Wiseguy isn't really a novel, it's more a transcription of interviews with Henry and Karen Hill. But, this is the most perfect film adaptation I can think of. Reading the book and seeing the choices Scorsese made of what to show you, what to include as voice over narration, what to leave out, where to include music - in every case he made the perfect choice.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (book by Ken Kesey) - The film doesn't surpass the book for me, both are excellent.  The Chief is the narrator in the book and he is schizophrenic and it's cool to be getting the whole story from his point of view.  The film loses that aspect, but otherwise does an amazing job of developing the characters, the environment and the themes.  Amazing performances by the actors.

The Godfather (book and screenplay by Mario Puzo) - This is an odd one because the book was commissioned with the intent of then turning it into a movie.  IMO the book is kind of pulpy and the movie elevates it into a sophisticated work of art.  Lots of credit to Coppola for how he put it together and chose the perfect cast.",SherbertEquivalent66,1gwm8ih,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwm8ih/what_are_some_of_the_greatest_film_adaptations_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwm8ih/what_are_some_of_the_greatest_film_adaptations_of/,2024-11-21 18:21:06,0,0.38,0,0,80,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gwm8ih

movies,"Discussion about who is really the ""villain"" in centurion 2010","as much as we feel sympathy for the protagonists, namely Dias' group and the general, they are basically the villains. if we saw the story from Gorlocan and Etain's point of view, they would be the good guys.

gorlocan and ethain: gorlocan is just trying to defend his people from the roman invasion, he is not really doing anything ""bad"", ethain wants revenge for what happened to her and her parents, betraying the legion as a spy I think is normal in his situation.
When thax killed gorlocan's son, he sends ethain,vortix,aeron and other warriors to look for dias's group to take revenge, even if they are innocent and it's thax's fault they don't know it, it's revenge

virilus: if the legion had won it would have brought death and destruction to all of Caledonia, he would be responsible for everything but we feel sympathy for him because he treated quintus and his men well. 

I keep thinking that even if the group of Quintus apart from Thax were innocent they were not saints, just like Gorlocan or Ethain were not but here I saw more than just a cycle of defense attack and revenge

movies,Plot questions about The Long Goodbye (1973),"Finally got around to watching this one and loved it. Elliott Gould was fascinating to watch and Robert Altman's cross-talk is always a pleasure to soak in. But I'm not sure the actually mystery really came together for me. It's entirely possible that it's not *supposed* to present clear answers to every question, since this is a bit of a noir deconstruction. But I'm curious if anyone could help me out here.

1. Why does Terry Lennox need Marlowe to drive him to the Mexican border anyway? Terry has a spiffy convertible that he drives to Marlowe's place. Is he TRYING to get Marlowe involved for some reason?
2. What is the deal with Dr. Verringer? Marlowe suspects that Verringer's $5,000 is a fee to provide an alibi to Roger, who secretly murdered Sylvia. But at the end of the film it turns out Roger *didn't* kill anyone, and so we have no reason to doubt the police account that Roger was already at the clinic when the murder took place. So what's the point of Verringer? Is he just providing very shady, expensive rehab services after all? 
3. I'm a little confused about the Marty Augustine stuff. What is Marty's business with the Wades? We see him go to their house but we don't hear the conversation. The next day, Roger says Marty owes him money, and Eileen says that Roger owes HIM money? My guess is that Marty knows Eileen was having an affair with Terry, so he goes to threaten Eileen the same way he's threatening Marlowe - just trying to put pressure on anyone who might know anything about where his money went. That would explain why Eileen brings the money back (it's partially to save Marlowe but maybe she's at risk too). But I don't know if Eileen's connection to Marty was ever explained.
4. When does Marlowe realize Terry is actually the killer? Is it when he discovers Eileen has sold the house and disappeared? That doesn't seem too suspicious to me; her husband has just committed suicide and I don't think she had been happy in that house for a long time. But maybe it was enough of a red flag for Marlowe to seek out Terry and confront him, even if he wasn't sure.

Anyway, this one was fun.

movies,20 fun facts about the muppet christmas carol.,"with only a few days left before thanksgiving, christmas is coming closer and closer. we all have our christmas traditions. and one christmas tradition is watching christmas movies. and one of the movies that i like to pop into the DVD player every christmas season is 1992's the muppet christmas carol. the muppet christmas carol is not only considered to be the only muppet movie that could rival the muppet movie for the title of the best muppet movie but is also considered one of the best adaptations of charles dickin's novel with many going so far as to call it THE best. while i don't think it's the best adaptation(my personal favorite is the alastair sims version in case you were curious), i do still think it's quite great and i have it to thank for introducing me to one of the best stories ever written.

the film has quite a bit of interesting trivia surrounding it and i thought it would be fun to post some of them onto this sub to hopefully give you all a newfound appreciation for this holiday classic.

20: this was the first muppet project to feature gonzo and rizzo as a duo. since then, the two have been considered inseparable.

19: many of the extras in the street scenes are puppeteers. look closely and you can just about see the muppets some of them are walking with.

18: the voice of the ghost of christmas past was performed by jessica fox. if that name sounds familiar, she plays enid on the worst witch and nancy on hollyoaks. this was her film debut. 

17: this is actually not the first time that the muppets have done a christmas carol. several years prior, a Muppet based adaptation of a christmas carol was done in the form of a comic in muppet magazine. like in muppet christmas carol, kermit is bob crachit, miss piggy is his wife, and robin is tiny tim. 

16: in exchange for fetching the poulterer, scrooge offers bean bunny first a shilling, then raises it to 5 shillings. in the original novel, and most adaptations, scrooge first offers the boy a shilling, then raises it to half a crown. half a crown is worth 2 shillings and 6 pence. a crown is 5 shillings. bean bunny made out with double what most versions of his character do.

15: in the DVD commentary, the filmmakers relaid a funny story from a test screening. during the montage at the end of the film, scrooge gives the bookkeepers some coal to keep warm. a few children in the audience asked what the bookkeepers had done wrong to deserve coal. it had completely slipped their minds that santa gives naughty children coal.

14: speaking of the ending, when scrooge meets the charity men out on the streets, they are standing in front of a tavern with a sign that says ""grape tavern"". this may not seem noteworthy except for the fact that grape tavern is not only a real tavern but it's the oldest tavern in london. it was erected in 1583 and was visited by the likes of william shakespeare and charles dickins.

13: during the ""with a thankful heart"" musical number at the end, pay very close attention to the shops in the background. there's one shop named statler and waldorf's, an obvious reference to the famous muppet hecklers. however, there's another shop with the name micklewhite's. this is a reference to michael caine's real name, maurice micklewhite.

12: rowlf the dog has a brief appearance in the film but does not speak. although kermit was jim henson's signature character, rowlf was his favorite to perform and the character that henson felt the closest to. following henson's death, rowlf did not have a speaking appearance for a decade. it was only in the 2000s that bill baretta took over as rowlf's primary performer.

11: prior to this film, it was an unofficial tradition for theatrical muppet movies to feature cameos by characters from sesame street. however, after disney acquired the rights to the muppets, this tradition stopped due to rights issues. this was the first muppet movie in which characters from sesame street do not appear. however, there are appearances by characters from fraggle rock. keep your eyes peeled for mudwell the mudbunny, sprocket, and wander mcmooch.

10: there is an extra verse of ""marley and marley"" at the end of the song. it is absent from the film but is featured on the official soundtrack. it goes as follows. ""We're Marley and Marley, And now it's time to part (doot doot) To go back where they keep our kind, The wretched and the heartless The news we've shared has got you scared We're glad that we got through So make amends (and make some friends!) The future's up to you.""

9: the original idea for the film was for it to be a parody of a christmas carol rather then a straight adaptation. however, screenwriter jerry juhl convinced the muppeteers to go with a straight adaptation. similarly, the original plan was for the 3 ghosts to be portrayed by muppets. christmas past would have been played by miss piggy, christmas present would have been played by scooter, and christmas yet to come would have been played by gonzo, who's signature nose would have sitcking out of the black hood. eventually, the decision was made to create original puppets to play those characters. miss piggy ended up playing miss crachit, gonzo ended up being the narrator, and scooter was absent.

8: the ghost of christmas past was created by making a special puppet that was operated in a tank of water and then greenscreened into the movie. this gave the spirit the appearance of floating. 

7: numerous actors were considered for the role of Ebenezer scrooge. among the actors considered were peter o toole, george carlin, ron moody, and david warner. if warner had been cast, it would have been his second time acting in an adaptation of a christmas carol, having previously played the role of bob crachit in the george C scott adaptation. jack lemmon was also offered the role but, after saying that he'd rather play kermit instead, he was deemed crazy. bob hoskins was also considered but was deemed too short. michael caine got the role instead.

6: before production began, michael caine told brian henson that, even though he was acting in a muppet movie, he planned to play the role of scrooge completely straight as if he was acting with the royal shakespeare company. henson gave caine his blessing. and it ended up paying off since caine's performance is often considered to be one of the best things about the movie and many consider him to be among the best scrooge's. despite his commitment to playing the role straight, caine still had lots of fun on the set and he considers muppet christmas carol to be among his favorite movies he's been involved with.

5: this film was the first major muppet project after the death of jim henson as well as the first major muppet project with steve whitmare as kermit. the film was dedicated to both henson and richard hunt, a muppeteer who had died of aids earlier in the year.

4: it's difficult to talk about the movie without mentioning the fact that ""when love is gone"", the song sung by scrooge's ex fiance belle, was cut from the theatrical cut due to being deemed too sad for children. the last minute decision resulted in an extremely jarring edit where scrooge and rizzo's reactions seem disproportionate to what was shown. the number was restored on the VHS, laserdisc, and first DVD release. however, it remains cut from most TV airings, the blu ray release, and the disney+ plus, although it is available as a bonus feature on disney+. 

3: the film was originally planned to be a TV special before being changed to a theatrical release. despite solid critical reviews, the film opened in sixth place during the 1992 holiday box office. many attribute this to the film facing competition from home alone 2 lost in new york and Aladdin. 

2: there were two songs that were cut from the movie but do appear on the soundtrack. the first is ""room in your heart"" which is sung by bunsen honeydew and beaker as the charity workers. the second is ""chairman of the board"" which is sung by sam the eagle as scrooge's headmaster. both songs were cut before production began and the only evidence of their existence is their appearance on the soundtrack.

1: despite being a largely faithful adaptation of a christmas carol, there are some very noticeable differences. in this film, jacob marley is split into two characters named jacob and robert marley. the characters of fan and ignorance and want are also absent. the crachits also have a second daughter named bellina, who is exclusive to this film.",herequeerandgreat,1gwgsw5,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwgsw5/20_fun_facts_about_the_muppet_christmas_carol/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwgsw5/20_fun_facts_about_the_muppet_christmas_carol/,2024-11-21 13:54:14,155,0.86,155,0,40,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gwgsw5

movies,Movie franchises with confusing timelines,"The timeline in which movies come out and the actors age doesn't always match the in-universe passage of time, which can sometimes create continuity problems if the writers aren't paying attention or decide to ignore it for the sake of the story they want to tell. This is especially an issue with franchises with lots of prequels, time-skips, time travel, and reboots.

The X-Men movie franchise to me is the most infamous example. At first it was relatively straightforward, the first 3 movies are set at some point indeterminate the near future (the first movie came out in 2000), but then the prequels came out and time travel was introduced into the mix, and things became more convoluted, not helped by many contradictions and plot holes. The Deadpool movies naturally made fun of the whole thing while also making things even more convoluted.

Then there's stuff like Fast and the Furious 3 retroactively being stated to take place between the 6th and 7th movie, because they wanted a character who was in that movie who died to still be around in later movies (only for that character to later be brought back to life anyway). This leads to the weirdness of a movie made in 2006 actually being set in 2014, so the models of cars and other technology portrayed seem very out of date in hindsight.

So what other movie series have confusing timeline issues?",AporiaParadox,1gwfwwd,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwfwwd/movie_franchises_with_confusing_timelines/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gwfwwd/movie_franchises_with_confusing_timelines/,2024-11-21 13:10:51,10,0.69,10,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gwfwwd

movies,the dog in flirting scholar (1993),"*spoilers ahead for Stephen Chow's Flirting Scholar (1993)



There's a scene in the movie where Tong Pak Fu competes with a poor man in order to be bought into Madame Wah's family. The other man is poorer than him, and in order to appeal to the family he holds his dying dog in his arms. 

Obviously, my first thought was that the dog is acting, but the string around its neck looked really tight and it began to feel a little real - like it was really limp. I tried looking it up but got no results, even on doesthedogdie.com. Since it's an older movie, I couldn't help but think there's a chance it's real. 

Immediately paused the movie to watch something else because it left me with a weird, bitter feeling.

I recently watched the Army of Darkness on a streaming service and the ending was different from what I remember seeing on VHS back in the day.

In this version, when Ash takes the drops, he goes to sleep and then wakes up and is back at work. Then he gets attacked by a witch there.

The ending I remember is that when he starts taking the drops, there is a rock tumbling sound that distracts him and he takes one drop too many, making him sleep too long. When he wakes up, the world has clearly suffered an apocalypse or nuclear war or something. And then he screams ""I slept too long!"" The End.

movies,Inside Out (2015) is one of the most terrific movies out there for parents with younger kids.,"A lot of movies for younger people are either packed with action or adventure but provide very little educational content. Why should movies teach kids things about life? They don't have to but it's a great medium for that. If you can combine a great story, good visuals, with humor, with action, with adventure...and at the same time get them to understand life or themselves better, you really got a winner on your hands. That would be a movie both kids and their parents would love.

What Inside Out does well is just that. It makes emotions real. They are five distinct things inside the mind of the main character, a young girl named Riley: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger (my favorite one). We see these emotions again and again as she goes about her day, at school, and at home with her family as she tries to adapt to all kinds of changes in hew new life in San Francisco.

And we go along with the emotions in a kind of adventure through her memories later in the movie.

I feel that kids come out of that movie more self-aware, more accepting of emotions in themselves and others. This is particularly important for those children who come from families where nobody ever talks about feelings.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Malta,"Hello there,

everyday, I ask you for your most favorite movie in a certain european country. I'm following an alphabetic order here (wait for England until U, I get you covered) and today, we leave L and move on to M, with some very nice places in the line. But before that, I have a few winners from previous rounds to announce. 

Let's start with a correction: The original winner for Latvia was *Straume* (engl.: *Flow*), a film that was also submitted to the 2025 Oscars and is certainly close to the hearts of many compatriots... but unfortunately it doesn't seem to fulfill the rule that we are looking for films set in the respective country. So it's all the nicer that the runner-up after upvotes (minus downvotes) fits in much better here: We therefore welcome ***Kriminālās ekselences fonds*** (engl.: *The Foundation of Criminal Excellence*) as a brand new addition to the list, that will hopefully also soon be added to [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Now let's move on to the two new regular winners: Yesterday I started the new round before the competition for Lithuania ended due to deadlines, but I should have been able to announce the new winner by then. I am talking about ***Vaikai iš Amerikos viešbučio*** (eng. *The Children from the Hotel America*). As is so often the case, another movie has landed on my watch list that I hadn't even heard of before. But that's the beauty of this project: You get to know completely new film industries here.

Sometimes, however, things get a little tougher because of exactly that. To find a movie set in Luxembourg was a really big challenge. To be honest, I'm actually a bit surprised because I know this beautiful city quite well, but apparently not even a James Bond has ever stopped here. Nevertheless, we were able to find a winner here too:  ***Läif a Séil*** (engl.: *The Last Ashes*) wins with 2 to 3 points against the runner-up.

So, that was a lot of announcements. Let's move on to the next country - and I'm excited to see what **Malta** has to offer. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!
