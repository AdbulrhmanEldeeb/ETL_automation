devops,"In the Terraform world, why is there hate with Terragrunt?","Hello all. I have been digging deeper into the realm of Terraform and have dabbled with Terragrunt in my current company. We are beginning to branch into using multiple regions in AWS and even looking into using GCP wayyy in the future. I have used Terraform AND Terragrunt for 5+ years and I must say I like Terragrunt. Terragrunt is painful if the architecture is wrong or hasn't been well thought out but if it is done right, it works awesome with Atlantis!

  
Now back to my question: Why the hate for Terragrunt? (Especially in the r/Terraform group?) I am told just use Terraform Workspaces but in my experience, Terraform Workspaces was a pain in switching to each workspace to make changes especially when it comes to version upgrades.

  
This make me look into alternatives such as Atmos, Terraspace, and Terramate; however, I really don't see any BIG differences to switching. Would like to have a discussion on this and thanks for reading.

  
And btw, we use to use TFC until they changed their rates on pricing which was CRAZY! We got quotes from TFC, Spacelift, and Env0 which was comparable. We are happy with Atlantis using OPA and would like to better improve the infrastructure :)",DopeyMcDouble,1h4gmwi,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h4gmwi/in_the_terraform_world_why_is_there_hate_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h4gmwi/in_the_terraform_world_why_is_there_hate_with/,2024-12-01 23:20:08,74,0.94,74,0,46,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4gmwi

Recommendations?,"Hi, we’re designing a new web application and I was wondering if anyone could suggest a design or knowledge management solution that’s particularly robust. We have git repos and lots of google sheets/presentations currently. However I’d like to build out something more “sustainable” where we can keep documentation around multiple phases. 

Based on some searching in this subreddit it looks like a lot of people are doing KM in markup or their repo. It looks like a lot of mind maps and diagrams. I see references to Confluence and Bookstack, although I was hoping to self host something open source that I could adapt over time. 

I’m thinking about spinning up a Dokuwiki to house everything but I thought I’d ask the community if there was something out there that people really like.

I""m trying to setup Dagger pipelines, for a simple Github Actions YAML flow , as an attempt to carry out a POC, 

Now what i'm confused with is , I see most folks have organised it in one of the 2 ways - 

**Method 1 - dagger init --sdk=go -** 

This creates a dagger/ folder, and then gives me a **main.go -** with the 2 template functions, and then we've gotta modify , the traditional methods.

**Method 2 - Just place go-pipeline.go, in project root directory** 

  
**My doubts are -**   
**-** What is the right way?  
\- When to use both?   
\- And if I have **dagger functions** showing me 5 functions , for example ( lint , unit-test , e2e-test, build, publish) - i'm aware how we can call them independently with **dagger call** , but - what's the equivalent of running them all at once sequentially?

devops,Should I use WSL or DualBoot or Virtual Machine,"I was learning linux for devops. I am not new to linux, I knew th ebasic commands for copying, removing or installing apps.

devops,Need help on architecture layout,"Hey all,  
  
I'm creating a system that should have about 1 billion requests per month.  
Since I've never created a system that even comes close to this, I need help in deciding on the architecture...

I was thinking about:   
  
1. ELB with 4 servers (horizontal scaling) and add if needs be. Using php and nginx on each server.  
2. SQS so offload DB work instead of DB call each impression. Still, this comes out at around 380 records per second on average, so I'm not sure this is best way to go, cost wise and function wise.  
3. DB - what's the best DB to handle such a load? My plan is to collect daily data and create an aggregation through a nightly script, and removing daily data afterwards. Not sure if MySQL is the best way to go here, or BigQuery.  
4. Since each request should perform a SELECT and an INSERT, I was thinking about saving the SELECT call by having a cache server caching the results (They will be mostly the same).  


I would appreciate any advice you might have.
