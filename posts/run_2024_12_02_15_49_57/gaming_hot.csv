gaming,Games should have a seperate download option with non-4k textures and compressed Audio,"I was looking for some Games that I might want to get only to find that all of those Games are INSANELY large for the content they offer

After looking into it I found that 90% of that is just from high resolution textures and wav audio files... I'm sorry but I don't want that

As a Person that couldn't care less about Graphics I really don't want that a Game fills up so much space with some stupid images plastered onto a wall (And I say that with 8TB of storage).

Games already have multiple Download options, why not allow Me to choose between the Game with full resolution textures and wav audio, and another version that uses 2K **(2048x2048)** textures with FLAC Audio while keeping everything else the same

Sure it would be extra work, but batch scaling down textures and changing out WAV files with FLAC files isn't that difficult (Since I already did that with multiple Games. Problem is just that tons of Games don't allow it).

And I also think it would make sense from a business standpoint as I personally just don't buy some Games when I see how much storage they take up for the content they give Me.

A major reason why I don't buy Call Of Duty games anymore is because the Game size is insane for the short campaign and the repetitive multiplayer

Yes games can look great without having 4K **(4096x4096)** textures and because People will disagree on that I think we should give People both and just allow People to choose what they want to use

  
**Edit:When I say ""4K, 2K and Full HD textures"" I mean 4K=4096, 2K=2048, and Full HD=1080 or 1440. Yes I know it doesn't make complete sense but it was late when I made thi spost and I was tired.

I noticed Ubisoft really puts a lot of controls in the players hands when it comes to the gameplay as well.

In star wars outlaws you can change little things like turning on or off the mini puzzles when working on terminals or unlocking doors. You can change the text on the cards in the card games so it's easier to read among other things. I love this especially as you can turn off whatever you want so it doesn't hurt the flow of the game.

gaming,Is a PS5 or a higher refresh rate monitor worth it? (Maybe OLED),"Let’s say for example I have a 165hz 1440p monitor, but can push well over 200fps and then some as it is. Is it truly worth investing in a monitor that can handle that and then some? Potentially OLED too?

Or would it make more sense to invest in a PS5 to have as a system to play older games that are basically dead on PC, but very much alive on Series X/PS5. I know gamepass exists, but I’m not exactly interested in that. 

Kinda curious on feedback of what everyone thinks. I’ve only experienced an OLED TV, and it was incredible, and I don’t necessarily need a console but….i really only prefer the PC for things like MMOs where it really shines.

gaming,"Witcher 3 is almost a decade old, RDR2 is 6 years old. How are these still just about the best graphics? Are there no graphically stunning “show stopper” titles in the last 6 years to compete with them? Have video game graphic advances slowed to a crawl now?","**EDIT** I thought this was clear in my post, but maybe not. I am not saying there aren't better graphics to be found into today's games. I am saying they don't look a Decade better, they don't look 6 years better. For example, Legend of Zelda OOO came out in 1998, Crysis came out in 2007, that's the same gap between the release of Wild Hunt 3 and now. Skyrim came out in 2011, and 6 years prior to that, same gap as between RDR2 and now, the most graphically amazing game just released was the King King movie tie game. There is an ocean of difference, graphically, between Ocarina of Time and Crysis, between King Kong and Skyrim. You could show your grandma a picture of the two and she'd be able to easily point to the one with better graphics. But if you showed Wild Hunt 3 or RDR2 or Battlefield One next to many or even most big budget graphically cutting edge titles of the day, your gran probably couldn't say which have better graphics. The gulf is REALLY narrow compared to the same time span in the past. And if you look up just about any listing of the most graphically impressive games, RDR2, a 6 year old game, is still near the top of basically every list.

Was recently doing an RDR2 play though and was blown away coming back to it, just how damn good it looks. I remember it looked good, but I mean it looks GOOD. And I remember thinking the same about a year ago when I picked Witcher 3 back up. 

Hell star wars battlefront 2 was released in 2017, battlefield 1 was released in 2016, and you’d be hard pressed to find games in their genres released this year that look any better. 

I’m not saying games now look bad, they just don’t look a decade better than Witcher 3. I feel like for most of my life video game graphics have been making continuous leaps. I can’t think of any other time since, hell, the N64, when you’d go damn near a decade with the top tier most graphically impressive cutting edge game not really looking much better than those from 6, 7, 9 years prior. 

Are there graphical powerhouses out there I’m just not aware of?

Control is the only one I can really think of, and control looks great, I just don’t think it looks that much better than say rdr2, maybe slightly better lighting system? But it’s hard to compare since almost all of control takes place indoors.

There used to be a lot of great online game servers with different game types, and some with mods, and I used to play those quite a bit.  I always liked the game and the genre, but recently, I've tried playing and noticed the servers seem to be shut down.  And today I noticed I can't even log in anymore.

gaming,Deep Rock Galactic made me appreciate Indie games more,"Now to be honest, I'm still not that much of an Indie fan. I prefer my games to have a realistic artstyle, to have high visual fidelity, to have hollywood like moments and real time cutscenes and overall the polish only a AAA game can provide. Really, you couldn't bring me to touch an Indie game, because I got burned badly by some and after those experiences, they all looked so cheap and not worth the money.

That said, after a friend finally persuaded me to give DRG a chance and after I played it for a while, both with him and alone, I realized that indie games do can be fun and that stylized graphics can look good. I was really surprised at how fun the game is and over time, my mindset changed to:"" If this Indie game is fun, maybe others are as well."". 

And so I did try them and while most of them still aren't to my liking, I did find a few that I enjoyed (Ready or Not, Executive Assault 2, Cavern of Dreams or Eternal Evil to name a few). It also helps that Indie games become better and better and can reach AA quality levels nowadays, while also having a realistic artstyle.

That said, my tolerance still has limits. If I see any pixelart or cell shading in a game, I still instantly lose any interest, same with obvious pre made assets. And for stylized graphics, it really is a case by case situation. While I tolerate Running with Rifles for example, you can hunt me to the end of the world with Battle Bits Remastered or anything made with Synthy.

However, when you have a game like Ready or Not or SCP 5K, where you can show me ""Here, look. This game looks realistic, this game is dark and gritty and looks like a AAA title on the surface"", then you have my interest and usually a buy as well, if the end product is well made.",Nino_Chaosdrache,1h4elho,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,2024-12-01 21:51:06,0,0.21,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4elho

A couple of Qs from that:
- Which games use the dual sense feature?
- Do you know any reviewer at least touching on that? Nowadays it’s never really mentioned when a game is available on both platforms for there’s anything specific for the PS controller
- For those of you having the luxury to have both consoles, where do you decide where to buy your games? I’m looking at The Plucky Squire for example, I want to buy it but no idea of the PS5 dualsense adds something to the experience or not, it’s kind of weird really developers don’t really take the time to mention it. Given Xbox tends to be better with back compat and allows for Play Anywhere (thus PC or handheld) it seems safer to buy on that platform, unless I’m missing something.

Just as the title says, my horses will no longer gallop or even stride at a decent pace.  My horses only trot at the slowest speed, just happened out of nowhere today while playing on my Xbox Series X.  Even horses I steal from NPCs will stop and just walk.  I only just got the game a couple weeks ago, too.  I have tried every possible solution I could come across:

* I fed the horse
* groomed it over and over
* patted the horse
* removed the saddle and put it back on
* rode without a saddle
* switched to different horses at stables
* reloaded the most previous save
* reloaded old saves
* changed controllers
* closed the game and removed it from Quick Resume, waited a minute to relaunch
* did a hard restart on the XSX console
* I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it

All those things and my horse(s) will not move any faster than a walking stride.  This has affected every single horse across all my saves.  I have already put plenty of progress into the game, but now I either have to go without a horse or play at a snail’s pace

gaming,When was the last time a game made your jaw drop in awe?,"I had been running an older PC that was using a 3070ti but unfortunately, the computer had actually been dropped a few feet from my desk during one of my seizures. Still worked fortunately but it had like a weird effect on the graphic card, tried everything from disconnecting it from mobo and reconnecting it making sure it was synchronized correctly. With luck it kept working but when I would try to run games, especially games with more intense graphics you could really notice it so I wouldn't buy new games. Latest game I was playing was deadlock beta but you really noticed it even at the lowest of settings and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

Finally decided it was time to get a new computer so I built myself a new one and gifted it to myself as an early Christmas present (Dec 11) and got it up last week after building it myself. Currently running an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU, 4080 Super GPU, 64gb of memory.

The first game I bought and tried playing was Warhammer 40k Spacemarine 2 and immediately upon loading the initial load video, I was just in awe and my jaw dropped as I couldn't believe it. It felt like I was actually there and even more in-depth than ever before. Reminded me why I loved gaming on a computer so much and what it felt like when it was working in sync perfectly.

So when was the last time a game made your jaw drop in awe?",Zealousideal_Bad5583,1h2ng6j,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h2ng6j/when_was_the_last_time_a_game_made_your_jaw_drop/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h2ng6j/when_was_the_last_time_a_game_made_your_jaw_drop/,2024-11-29 14:51:42,0,0.42,0,0,52,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h2ng6j
