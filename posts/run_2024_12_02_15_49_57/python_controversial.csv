Python,Books for data science,"Hi,

I’m writing up an essay about a python program I’ve made for an assessment, which looks at cleaning, reshaping and all that kind of stuff with pandas. 

I’m trying to find some good references to back some stuff up, but would like some recommendations! 

I already have:
- Python For Data Analysis, McKinney
- Python Cookbook, O’Reilly

Do you have any others? I’m particularly looking for things that discuss:
1. Best data formats (json, csv, etc)
2. Cleaning for data analysis
3. Applicable APIs for various analysis tasks

Thanks in advance :) ",aspadora24,1h4s0xe,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h4s0xe/books_for_data_science/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h4s0xe/books_for_data_science/,2024-12-02 10:29:13,0,0.45,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,self,t3_1h4s0xe
Python,Advanced Python Development Workflow in Emacs,"Hey everyone!

Lately, I’ve been spending more time reading code than writing it, but I still code every now and then, mostly in Python. My daily editor — for both coding and just about everything else — has been Emacs for several years now.

Recently, I decided to dig into how the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) work in Emacs, how they can be integrated, and what minimal configuration is needed to get started. As I explored, I took notes for myself, and eventually, those notes turned into a blog post.

It ended up being quite a long read, but I’m really happy with the result. The more I researched and wrote, the further I drifted from my original goal of creating a quick and minimal Emacs setup guide. I rewrote the introduction a few times before landing on something I felt good about, and now I’m ready to share it with you.

The article isn’t perfect — there are still some rough edges and gaps I plan to address soon. For example:

* I haven’t covered tree-sitter integration.
* Navigation between code elements feels a bit underexplored.
* Some parts are more superficial than I’d like.

But it’s in a good enough state to share. If you’re curious and have the patience to read through, I’d love some constructive feedback. Let me know if there’s anything missing that you’d find helpful or if you catch any mistakes I might’ve made.

Here’s the link to the article: [https://blog.serghei.pl/posts/emacs-python-ide/](https://blog.serghei.pl/posts/emacs-python-ide/)

Python,Optimization-Based Rule Learning for Scalable and Interpretable Classification,"RuleOpt is a Python library that uses optimization-based rule learning for classification tasks, focusing on scalability and model interpretability. It helps practitioners generate transparent, rule-based models, even for large datasets, using linear programming. RuleOpt is designed to integrate smoothly with machine learning pipelines and is especially powerful for extracting rules from ensemble models like random forests and boosting algorithms.

An earlier version of this work is available in [our manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10751).


**What RuleOpt Does:**

- **Efficient Rule Generation and Extraction:** Uses linear programming to generate rules both as a stand-alone machine learning method and for extracting rules from trained models like random forests and boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Interpretability:** Focuses on achieving a balance between rule accuracy and transparency, allowing for clear decision-making.
- **Model Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM for smooth model development and rule extraction.
- **Extensive Solver Support:** Works with a range of solvers, including Gurobi, CPLEX, and OR-Tools, to optimize rule learning tasks.

**Target Audience:**
This library is ideal for:

- Data scientists and machine learning engineers who need transparent models.
- Researchers who are exploring rule-based classification systems.
- ML practitioners working with large datasets who seek interpretable, scalable models for decision-making.

**Comparison to Existing Alternatives:**
Here’s how RuleOpt stands out:

- **Versus Other Rule Learning Methods:** RuleOpt leverages the power of optimization and linear programming for scalable rule generation, offering higher efficiency for large-scale datasets compared to traditional rule induction methods.
- **Versus SHAP and LIME:** While SHAP and LIME focus on explaining model predictions, RuleOpt goes a step further by extracting clear, interpretable rules that can be used directly for decision-making and model transparency.

**Key Features:**

- **Scalable Rule Learning:** Efficiently handles large datasets and complex models through linear programming.
- **Transparent Models:** Provides human-readable rules, ensuring high interpretability.
- **Integration with ML Libraries:** Works smoothly with scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and other machine learning frameworks.
- **Solver Flexibility:** Supports multiple solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX, OR-Tools) for enhanced performance.

**Algorithm &amp; Performance:**
The RuleOpt algorithm focuses on formulating rule extraction as an optimization problem using linear programming. It has been tested on large-scale classification problems and demonstrated scalability and interpretability, even in the case of ensemble models.


**Quick Start:**
Install RuleOpt via pip:

```bash
pip install ruleopt
```

For examples, detailed usage, and API details, check out the [documentation](https://ruleopt.readthedocs.io/).

Python,"kanban-tui , customizable cross platform kanban/task manager in your terminal","* **What My Project Does**

Kanban-Tui is a CLI tool that gives you a visual board with moveable tasks in the terminal.

With the newest release v0.4.0, you can create multiple boards with individual columns.
More Customization like creating task categories for tasks or change the column visibility is also possible.
It also utilizes plotext to give you an overview about several metrics (created/completed/started tasks). 


For a quick demo you can use uvx to create a temporary database and config files with: `uvx --from kanban-tui ktui demo`
They get deleted after you close the application. For detailed instructions and features you can check the Readme on github.

Source Code on github: [Link](https://github.com/Zaloog/kanban-tui)


* **Target Audience** 

Terminal affine developers who do not want to miss a nice graphical experience.

* **Comparison** 

Its similar to kanban-python, which I created before before this project but less minimal and the interaction with the tasks is faster more convenient.
I.e with the TUI one is able to utilize vim-like motions to move cards around, which comes closer to the feeling of actually moving physical cards.

Python,Best PDF library for extracting text from structured templates,"Hello All, 

I am currently working on a project where I have to extract data from around 8 different structured templates which together spans 12 Million + pages across 10K PDF Documents. 

I am using a mix of Regular Expression and bounding box approach where by 4 of these templates are regular expression friendly and for the rest I am using bounding box to extract the data. On testing the extraction works very well. There are no images or tables, but simple labels and values.

The library that I am currently using is PDF Plumber for data extraction and PyPDF for splitting the documents in small chunks for better memory utilization(PDF Plumber sometimes throws an error when the page count goes above 4000 pages, hence splitting them into smaller chunks temporarily). However this approach is taking 5 seconds per page which is a bit too much considering that I have to process 12M pages. 

I did take a look at the different other libraries mentioned in the below link but I am not sure which one to choose as I would love to work with an open source library that is having a good maintenance history and better performance .
