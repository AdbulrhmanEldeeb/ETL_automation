programming,This PR replaces is-number package with a one-liner with identical code. Author argues this tiny change saves 440GB weekly traffic. JavaScript micro-package debate ,"A debate occurred between the author of the is-number package (and is-odd, is-even, and 1500more) and a PR author over micro-libraries. https://github.com/micromatch/to-regex-range/pull/17


The PR proposed replacing the 'is-number' package with its inline code. While the code is &lt;1KB, the full package with README/license is ~10KB. With 70M weekly downloads, this simple change saves 440GB of npm bandwidth weekly.

The author of 'is-number' called the PR ""useless"" - despite it being his own code just moved inline. Some of his other packages include 'is-odd' which depends on 'is-even' which depends on... you guessed it, 'is-number'.

The debate:
Pro micro-packages: Well-tested, auto-updates, saves dev time
Against: Security risks, fragile dependencies (remember left-pad?), unnecessary bloat

TL;DR: JavaScript's micro-package ecosystem might be getting out of hand. Sometimes the simplest solution is just writing the code yourself. Or standards library when?

programming,Announcing rust-query: Safe relational database queries using the Rust type system,"[rust-query](https://github.com/LHolten/rust-query) is a new type-safe database library for Rust that provides an alternative to traditional SQL by deeply integrating with Rust's type system, offering compile-time guarantees for database operations without requiring direct SQL writing. The library features explicit table aliasing, null safety through Rust's Option type, intuitive aggregates that guarantee single results per joined row, type-safe foreign key navigation and unique lookups, multi-versioned schema support with type-safe migrations, and encapsulated row IDs tied to transaction lifetimes, all while using SQLite as its backend database engine. It allows developers to write database queries that feel native to Rust, with the schema defined using enum syntax that generates the necessary database API code, enabling safe and intuitive database interactions with strong compile-time checks.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Balance-,1h4dovu,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h4dovu/announcing_rustquery_safe_relational_database/,https://blog.lucasholten.com,2024-12-01 21:12:34,14,0.68,14,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h4dovu

Most nodes used are actual C# methods, so C#/.NET developers will find it familiar. The video also shows how vvvv represents loops, branching, collections, generics, and mutable and immutable data types visually.

If you’ve joined the Advent of Code challenge, this example might give you a new perspective on visual programming.
