gaming,Games should have a seperate download option with non-4k textures and compressed Audio,"I was looking for some Games that I might want to get only to find that all of those Games are INSANELY large for the content they offer

After looking into it I found that 90% of that is just from high resolution textures and wav audio files... I'm sorry but I don't want that

As a Person that couldn't care less about Graphics I really don't want that a Game fills up so much space with some stupid images plastered onto a wall (And I say that with 8TB of storage).

Games already have multiple Download options, why not allow Me to choose between the Game with full resolution textures and wav audio, and another version that uses 2K **(2048x2048)** textures with FLAC Audio while keeping everything else the same

Sure it would be extra work, but batch scaling down textures and changing out WAV files with FLAC files isn't that difficult (Since I already did that with multiple Games. Problem is just that tons of Games don't allow it).

And I also think it would make sense from a business standpoint as I personally just don't buy some Games when I see how much storage they take up for the content they give Me.

A major reason why I don't buy Call Of Duty games anymore is because the Game size is insane for the short campaign and the repetitive multiplayer

Yes games can look great without having 4K **(4096x4096)** textures and because People will disagree on that I think we should give People both and just allow People to choose what they want to use

  
**Edit:When I say ""4K, 2K and Full HD textures"" I mean 4K=4096, 2K=2048, and Full HD=1080 or 1440. Yes I know it doesn't make complete sense but it was late when I made thi spost and I was tired.

In other games changing the controls can be more difficult than it needs to be but Ubisoft just gives you the power to do what works best for you.

I noticed Ubisoft really puts a lot of controls in the players hands when it comes to the gameplay as well.

In star wars outlaws you can change little things like turning on or off the mini puzzles when working on terminals or unlocking doors. You can change the text on the cards in the card games so it's easier to read among other things. I love this especially as you can turn off whatever you want so it doesn't hurt the flow of the game.

Playing through Halo: CE today and I again become amazed with how well Halo did vehicle combat. It’s not realistic in any way. It’s more like driving a Sea Do than a truck, but over twenty years later, it hasn’t been beaten. IMO, of course

Even Halo 2, which had amazing vehicle combat, lost something with destructible vehicles. There’s something pure about the indestructible warthog that goes soaring through the sky when it gets struck by a perfectly timed rocket/grenade. Hoping beyond hope that you’re able to pull off the landing and make it back to base with your flag

What happened? Why have game developers leaned so much more towards realism when it comes to vehicles? If they include them at all?

gaming,Deep Rock Galactic made me appreciate Indie games more,"Now to be honest, I'm still not that much of an Indie fan. I prefer my games to have a realistic artstyle, to have high visual fidelity, to have hollywood like moments and real time cutscenes and overall the polish only a AAA game can provide. Really, you couldn't bring me to touch an Indie game, because I got burned badly by some and after those experiences, they all looked so cheap and not worth the money.

That said, after a friend finally persuaded me to give DRG a chance and after I played it for a while, both with him and alone, I realized that indie games do can be fun and that stylized graphics can look good. I was really surprised at how fun the game is and over time, my mindset changed to:"" If this Indie game is fun, maybe others are as well."". 

And so I did try them and while most of them still aren't to my liking, I did find a few that I enjoyed (Ready or Not, Executive Assault 2, Cavern of Dreams or Eternal Evil to name a few). It also helps that Indie games become better and better and can reach AA quality levels nowadays, while also having a realistic artstyle.

That said, my tolerance still has limits. If I see any pixelart or cell shading in a game, I still instantly lose any interest, same with obvious pre made assets. And for stylized graphics, it really is a case by case situation. While I tolerate Running with Rifles for example, you can hunt me to the end of the world with Battle Bits Remastered or anything made with Synthy.

However, when you have a game like Ready or Not or SCP 5K, where you can show me ""Here, look. This game looks realistic, this game is dark and gritty and looks like a AAA title on the surface"", then you have my interest and usually a buy as well, if the end product is well made.",Nino_Chaosdrache,1h4elho,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,2024-12-01 21:51:06,0,0.21,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4elho

gaming,"Witcher 3 is almost a decade old, RDR2 is 6 years old. How are these still just about the best graphics? Are there no graphically stunning “show stopper” titles in the last 6 years to compete with them? Have video game graphic advances slowed to a crawl now?","**EDIT** I thought this was clear in my post, but maybe not. I am not saying there aren't better graphics to be found into today's games. I am saying they don't look a Decade better, they don't look 6 years better. For example, Legend of Zelda OOO came out in 1998, Crysis came out in 2007, that's the same gap between the release of Wild Hunt 3 and now. Skyrim came out in 2011, and 6 years prior to that, same gap as between RDR2 and now, the most graphically amazing game just released was the King King movie tie game. There is an ocean of difference, graphically, between Ocarina of Time and Crysis, between King Kong and Skyrim. You could show your grandma a picture of the two and she'd be able to easily point to the one with better graphics. But if you showed Wild Hunt 3 or RDR2 or Battlefield One next to many or even most big budget graphically cutting edge titles of the day, your gran probably couldn't say which have better graphics. The gulf is REALLY narrow compared to the same time span in the past. And if you look up just about any listing of the most graphically impressive games, RDR2, a 6 year old game, is still near the top of basically every list.

Was recently doing an RDR2 play though and was blown away coming back to it, just how damn good it looks. I remember it looked good, but I mean it looks GOOD. And I remember thinking the same about a year ago when I picked Witcher 3 back up. 

Hell star wars battlefront 2 was released in 2017, battlefield 1 was released in 2016, and you’d be hard pressed to find games in their genres released this year that look any better. 

I’m not saying games now look bad, they just don’t look a decade better than Witcher 3. I feel like for most of my life video game graphics have been making continuous leaps. I can’t think of any other time since, hell, the N64, when you’d go damn near a decade with the top tier most graphically impressive cutting edge game not really looking much better than those from 6, 7, 9 years prior. 

Are there graphical powerhouses out there I’m just not aware of?

Control is the only one I can really think of, and control looks great, I just don’t think it looks that much better than say rdr2, maybe slightly better lighting system? But it’s hard to compare since almost all of control takes place indoors.
