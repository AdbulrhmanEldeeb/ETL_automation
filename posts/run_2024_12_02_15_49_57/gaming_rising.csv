gaming,Games should have a seperate download option with non-4k textures and compressed Audio,"I was looking for some Games that I might want to get only to find that all of those Games are INSANELY large for the content they offer

After looking into it I found that 90% of that is just from high resolution textures and wav audio files... I'm sorry but I don't want that

As a Person that couldn't care less about Graphics I really don't want that a Game fills up so much space with some stupid images plastered onto a wall (And I say that with 8TB of storage).

Games already have multiple Download options, why not allow Me to choose between the Game with full resolution textures and wav audio, and another version that uses 2K **(2048x2048)** textures with FLAC Audio while keeping everything else the same

Sure it would be extra work, but batch scaling down textures and changing out WAV files with FLAC files isn't that difficult (Since I already did that with multiple Games. Problem is just that tons of Games don't allow it).

And I also think it would make sense from a business standpoint as I personally just don't buy some Games when I see how much storage they take up for the content they give Me.

A major reason why I don't buy Call Of Duty games anymore is because the Game size is insane for the short campaign and the repetitive multiplayer

Yes games can look great without having 4K **(4096x4096)** textures and because People will disagree on that I think we should give People both and just allow People to choose what they want to use

  
**Edit:When I say ""4K, 2K and Full HD textures"" I mean 4K=4096, 2K=2048, and Full HD=1080 or 1440. Yes I know it doesn't make complete sense but it was late when I made thi spost and I was tired.

In other games changing the controls can be more difficult than it needs to be but Ubisoft just gives you the power to do what works best for you.

I noticed Ubisoft really puts a lot of controls in the players hands when it comes to the gameplay as well.

In star wars outlaws you can change little things like turning on or off the mini puzzles when working on terminals or unlocking doors. You can change the text on the cards in the card games so it's easier to read among other things. I love this especially as you can turn off whatever you want so it doesn't hurt the flow of the game.
