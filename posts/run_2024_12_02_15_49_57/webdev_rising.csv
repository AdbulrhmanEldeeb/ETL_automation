webdev,why indie developers tend to prefer game startup rather than web startup?,"or at least seem to be...

I think there are still many problems that intermediate computer science undergraduate students can provide solutions to. The public still can't develop web services on their own even if the problems are very easy to solve. And top level engineers spend the same amount of time doing much more value-added activities. In other words, this efficiency keeps some solvable problems unsolved.

Is it because these niches aren't being exploited because they lack marketability and viability?

Web service-based businesses are not easy, of course.

webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,4,0.64,4,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

webdev,Managing High-Volume Notifications with Digest (Batching) Strategies,"I'm implementing a notification system using [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) that needs to handle high message volumes without overwhelming users. 

I'd like to share my current approach and get feedback on potential improvements.

**Context:**

* Building a collaborative app with frequent updates (comments, file changes, tags)
* Using Novu as the notification infrastructure
* Need to prevent notification fatigue while ensuring important updates reach users
* Currently implementing in Node.js with PostgreSQL backend

**Current Implementation:** I've developed two digest strategies in Novu:

1. **Time-Window Digest / Batching:** 

&amp;#8203;

     // Using Novu to collect events in a 3-day digest window  
    const digestResult = await novu.digest(""digest-3-days"", {
      backoffUnit: 'days',
      backoffAmount: 3,
      digestKey: 'userId',
      events: notifications
    });  
    
    // Send digest via Novu
    await novu.trigger('digest-notification', {
      to: {
        subscriberId: userId,
      },
      payload: {
        events: digestResult.events,
        totalCount: digestResult.events.length
      }
    });

2. **Look-Back Pattern:**

    const shouldDigest = async (userId, eventType) =&gt; {
      const recentNotification = await novu.getNotificationHistory({
        subscriberId: userId,
        type: eventType
      });
      return Date.now() - recentNotification.timestamp &lt; ONE_DAY;
    };

Here is a visual representation I'm referring to - but with much smaller batching time window:

[Digest \/ Event Aggregation ](https://preview.redd.it/qozoe9akbf4e1.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301cfb85c68526175d084b86374fa8f3c29a3c21)

**Interesting Discovery -** [OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/journeys#time-window)**'s Time Window Approach:** While researching this, I found OneSignal's implementation of time windows interesting.   
  
They use a different approach where you can:

* Define specific allowed time periods (e.g., Tuesday 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST)
* Set intelligent delivery delays that randomly distribute notifications within allowed windows
* Handle out-of-window notifications by scheduling them for the next available window

For example, if you set a notification to trigger outside of Tuesday 1-6 PM PST, their system automatically schedules it for a random time within next Tuesday's window. This helps prevent notification clustering at window boundaries.

**Technical Challenges I'm Working Through:**

1. Race conditions when multiple events occur simultaneously
2. Handling failed notification deliveries within digest groups
3. Database schema optimization for efficient event aggregation
4. Coordinating time windows across multiple time zones
5. Implementing similar time-window functionality as OneSignal within Novu

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. What indexing strategies work best for quick digest compilation in Novu?
2. How do you handle digest delivery failures and retries?
3. Has anyone implemented custom time window logic similar to OneSignal's approach in Novu?
4. What's your approach to testing digest timing across different time zones?

If you've implemented similar systems with Novu or other notification services, I'd appreciate insights on handling these technical aspects efficiently.",Sudden_Profit_2840,1h4t9jv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,2024-12-02 11:53:39,3,1.0,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/S_ZmR_1cU5aKbwzfea80L7OQ7oKBdb43DuJDAxM8-xM.jpg,t3_1h4t9jv

webdev,How would Google selling Chrome stop its monopoly?,"Might be off-topic to this sub, but I don't know what other sub would have redditors with enough knowledge about the web to answer this correctly.

My understanding is that Google has tried to maintain a monopoly over the search engine market by making other companies use Google as the main search engine for their browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).

If that's the case, what's the point of having Google sell Chrome, the browser? There are plenty of other browsers out there -- Google doesn't hold a monopoly over the browser market. Chromium is a thing, yes, but neither Firefox nor Safari is Chromium based, and Chromium is open source anyway. The problem here is the ubiquity of 'Google' the search engine, not Chrome the browser.

TLDR: if what Google holds a monopoly over is the search engine that browsers use and not over browsers themselves, how does selling Chrome stop their monopoly?",cachehit_,1h491sj,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,2024-12-01 17:55:57,76,0.82,76,0,92,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h491sj

I recently learned the ""basics"" of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (still going through materials as I'm not feeling too confident yet).

* [https://phaser.io/](https://phaser.io/)
* [https://japan-dev.com/](https://japan-dev.com/)

I understand, correct me if I'm wrong here, that all of those websites could be built from scratch using the 3 mentioned technologies, but I assume that's not what people do in practice?

I'm basically looking for guidance as to what I should learn (maybe there's a solid beginner stack or something?) to build similar websites by myself.

I'm also wondering if those websites (especially the first one is designed by ""hand"" or if they are using some kind of kit or a prebuilt design?

\- Using a CSS reset  
\- Using a CSS normalize  
\- Using the !important tag to make sure it takes precedent  
\- Using specificity like body, html, and #musicplayer  
\- Overwriting the default stylings through developer tools  
\- Checked for overwritten lines using dev tools (which has shown very different results across browsers)
