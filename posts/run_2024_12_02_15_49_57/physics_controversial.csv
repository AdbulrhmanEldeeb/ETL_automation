Physics,Offering Free Plasmonic Nanoparticles for Research or Prototyping Just Cover Shipping,"I’m currently working on starting my own company specializing in plasmonic nanoparticles synthesis for biosensing and chemical sensing applications, and I’d love to get my particles into the hands of researchers, developers, or anyone interested in testing them out.

I produce gold-plated silver nanoparticles (or other metals) tuned across the visible spectrum, with sensitivities upwards of 400 nm/RIU for LSPR (Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance) technology. These nanoparticles are ideal for applications in biochemistry, nanotechnology, or sensor prototyping.

Types of Nanoparticles Available:

* Gold-Plated Silver Particles: Optimized for high sensitivity and stability.
* Custom Sizes/Tunings: Let me know if you have specific requirements.

Why I’m Doing This:

I’m passionate about advancing LSPR technology and helping others explore its potential. By offering free samples, I hope to gain exposure, feedback, and connect with like-minded researchers or industry professionals.

How to Get Some:

* Send me an email [salmansha8821@outlook.com](mailto:salmansha8821@outlook.com)
* Tell me what you’ll use the nanoparticles for and if you have any specific needs.
* Just cover the shipping cost, and I’ll handle the rest

Let’s collaborate and explore the possibilities of plasmonic nanotechnology together",winteyte,1h497lq,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h497lq/offering_free_plasmonic_nanoparticles_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h497lq/offering_free_plasmonic_nanoparticles_for/,2024-12-01 18:02:37,19,0.75,19,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h497lq
Physics,What do y'all consider to be the required math to start to learn general relativity?,"There's unfortunately no relativity courses in the studies I'm heading at, yet I would still love to fully learn general relativity.

Unfortunately, when I see courses online, I can get a bit lost because I am not familiar with the mathematical concepts used to describe curvature, such as tensors.

What would you all recomment me to learn in math fisrt, before diving into general relativity?
If you have math courses online about these specific required fields, feel free to share!",Beryllium5032,1h4tt6f,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h4tt6f/what_do_yall_consider_to_be_the_required_math_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h4tt6f/what_do_yall_consider_to_be_the_required_math_to/,2024-12-02 12:26:23,11,0.72,11,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h4tt6f
Physics,What made you interested in physics? ,"My reason for getting into and being interested in physics is quite odd now i look back on it, but i got interested in physics when a truck went past me going quite fast which generated a gust of air/wind

Then i started to think about how and why that happens, so i went home that day and started doing some research, and from that point on, i was hooked.",NoSun6378,1h4cuqs,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h4cuqs/what_made_you_interested_in_physics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h4cuqs/what_made_you_interested_in_physics/,2024-12-01 20:36:46,36,0.81,36,0,55,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h4cuqs
Physics,Accelerated Structure Formation: The Early Emergence of Massive Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies,"Paper is open access - [link to paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad834d)

Great Blog by Prof. Stacy McGaugh - The most recent post is about his and collaborators recent paper about JWST results and structure formation.
[Link to blog](https://tritonstation.com/new-blog-page/)

Highly recommend the blog, whether you are interested in Galaxy dynamics or not, simply because it is great and McGaugh has all the hallmarks of a good guy and great communicator. As ever, judge the physics for yourself.
