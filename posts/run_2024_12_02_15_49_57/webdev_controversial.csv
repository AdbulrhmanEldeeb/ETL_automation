webdev,When does automation stop in web development?,"Lately, I’ve been using some tools that automate work and processes, and it got me thinking about where we’re headed.   
  
On the surface, it’s amazing—tech keeps getting smarter, and makes us faster.  
  
But there’s a weird tension between “streamlining everything” and creating systems that make us *more* dependent on them.

For example, I stumbled on this [site](https://www.polipo.io/) that promises to make creating web apps super fast. It’s efficient, sure, but at what point are we automating creativity itself? Are we making people obsolete, or are we just pushing the limits of efficiency?

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

* Where should the line be between what we automate and what we keep human?
* Is relying on these tools making us lose valuable skills, or are we just adapting to new tools like we always have?
* Are we sacrificing quality or individuality for speed and convenience?

webdev,How do you develop micro-services locally?,"How do you develop micro-services locally when there are several applications that communicate with each other and you need to see logs in several applications at once.

I'm using Docker Compose + Dozzle for such purposes to run batch of services and watch logs, but with this approach the file system can slow down a lot when live reload is enabled.

Recently I found out that there are Procfile and overmind, which allow to conveniently run several services at once with one command without virtualization. But logs are shown in a single console and it is not convenient to see what is going on (my application has a large business logic and a lot of communication back and forth, so a lot of logs).

UPD:

Combining [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) (Procfile launcher) and [logdy](https://logdy.dev/) (logs viewer from pipe to browser) can be working 
solution. Run it as:

```sh
logdy stdin hivemind

webdev,Scraping keywords from webpages - method suggestions wanted,"Hi All,

I'm making a keyword scraper in order to do some competitor research on the top google search results. I've come here to ask for your ideas on the best ways to extract the most important keywords from a page I'll detail what I'm currently doing below.

This is all done in python using Selenium and BeautifulSoup

1. Get the text from all visible elements
2. Delete the first header and all of the following elements: footers, navs and elements with ""aria-hidden=True""
3. Flattens all inline elements so that the text is all in block level elements -&gt; just done for ease of parsing
4. Then it creates 8 lists
   1. A list where each of the h1-6 elements are collected
   2. A list for roughly the first 200 words measured from the start of the first h1
   3. A list for all elements after the start of the first h1
5. I then return a dictionary to my keyword scraper which has all of the lists above plus the title, url and meta description

Then I run my langauge processing which is a combo of SciKit learn and SpaCy.

I have three methods currently working to extract keywords:

* TF-IDF -&gt; TfidfVectorizer from sklearn
* Noun-Phrase extraction -&gt; I'll post my matcher below but this is a custom pipeline for spaCy
* Named entity extraction -&gt; spaCy as well, super basic just collecting important types of named entities like person, product etc...

Here is my matcher:

    patterns = [
                # Optional Adverb(s) + Adjective(s) + Noun(s)
                [{'POS': 'ADV', 'OP': '*'},
                 {'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '+'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
               
                # Nouns joined by coordinating conjunction
                [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'},
                 {'POS': 'CCONJ'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
               
                # Gerund + Noun
                [{'POS': 'VERB', 'TAG': 'VBG'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
               
                # Noun + Preposition + Optional Adjective + Noun
                [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}},
                 {'POS': 'ADP'},
                 {'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '*'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
                #  Noun + Hyphen + Verb/Noun
                [{""POS"": ""NOUN""},
                 {""TEXT"": ""-""},
                 {""POS"": {""IN"": [""NOUN"", ""VERB""]}}]
     ]

This collects a decent amount of keywords but I feel like it could be improved. Has anyone else approached this problem and has any advice on new methods I can try I'd love to hear about.

webdev,How to have sub pages with unique URLs on my site?,"Sorry I'm not sure how to explain this in the title! I built my own site in Wordpress, but I'm a bit of a noob. I do quite a lot of different jobs - videography, editing, composition, sound design etc. I've had it all on one site, but I've had some people tell me they think I should have a separate site for Music and Sound Design as Agencies want a specialist, not someone who does everything, which makes sense

So I currently have my main .co.uk site and I have .com with the same name redirecting to the .co.uk site.

Are my only options for doing the above to buy a new domain and create a new website, or to have a page on my current site that doesn't link back to the main site or have a menu, but then people could just change the URL to get to my main site if they noticed

Are there ways of doing this I'm missing, which don't involve buying new domains?

webdev,How would Google selling Chrome stop its monopoly?,"Might be off-topic to this sub, but I don't know what other sub would have redditors with enough knowledge about the web to answer this correctly.

My understanding is that Google has tried to maintain a monopoly over the search engine market by making other companies use Google as the main search engine for their browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).

If that's the case, what's the point of having Google sell Chrome, the browser? There are plenty of other browsers out there -- Google doesn't hold a monopoly over the browser market. Chromium is a thing, yes, but neither Firefox nor Safari is Chromium based, and Chromium is open source anyway. The problem here is the ubiquity of 'Google' the search engine, not Chrome the browser.

TLDR: if what Google holds a monopoly over is the search engine that browsers use and not over browsers themselves, how does selling Chrome stop their monopoly?",cachehit_,1h491sj,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,2024-12-01 17:55:57,75,0.82,75,0,92,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h491sj

Junior was let go last week, we've got some work done on his last few weeks, but the project was due 2 months ago and management was not happy about not having anything to show for it, we have some basic crud forms and a rest API that would make anyone familiar with OpenAPI spec cry, but nothing 'usable' in the business sense.

I recently learned the ""basics"" of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (still going through materials as I'm not feeling too confident yet). To further improve my skills and also learn new technologies I would like to build some websites that I'm personally interested in. I found a ""type"" of website that I would like to build. They all look somewhat similar. Now they could all be build from scratch, it's kinda hard to tell for me as a beginner, or they could all be using the same or maybe a similar stack?

Here are the websites I'm talking about:

* [https://phaser.io/](https://phaser.io/)
* [https://japan-dev.com/](https://japan-dev.com/)

I understand, correct me if I'm wrong here, that all of those websites could be built from scratch using the 3 mentioned technologies, but I assume that's not what people do in practice?

I'm basically looking for guidance as to what I should learn (maybe there's a solid beginner stack or something?) to build similar websites by myself.

I'm also wondering if those websites (especially the first one is designed by ""hand"" or if they are using some kind of kit or a prebuilt design?

webdev,Managing High-Volume Notifications with Digest (Batching) Strategies,"I'm implementing a notification system using [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) that needs to handle high message volumes without overwhelming users. 

I'd like to share my current approach and get feedback on potential improvements.

**Context:**

* Building a collaborative app with frequent updates (comments, file changes, tags)
* Using Novu as the notification infrastructure
* Need to prevent notification fatigue while ensuring important updates reach users
* Currently implementing in Node.js with PostgreSQL backend

**Current Implementation:** I've developed two digest strategies in Novu:

1. **Time-Window Digest / Batching:** 

&amp;#8203;

     // Using Novu to collect events in a 3-day digest window  
    const digestResult = await novu.digest(""digest-3-days"", {
      backoffUnit: 'days',
      backoffAmount: 3,
      digestKey: 'userId',
      events: notifications
    });  
    
    // Send digest via Novu
    await novu.trigger('digest-notification', {
      to: {
        subscriberId: userId,
      },
      payload: {
        events: digestResult.events,
        totalCount: digestResult.events.length
      }
    });

2. **Look-Back Pattern:**

    const shouldDigest = async (userId, eventType) =&gt; {
      const recentNotification = await novu.getNotificationHistory({
        subscriberId: userId,
        type: eventType
      });
      return Date.now() - recentNotification.timestamp &lt; ONE_DAY;
    };

Here is a visual representation I'm referring to - but with much smaller batching time window:

[Digest \/ Event Aggregation ](https://preview.redd.it/qozoe9akbf4e1.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301cfb85c68526175d084b86374fa8f3c29a3c21)

**Interesting Discovery -** [OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/journeys#time-window)**'s Time Window Approach:** While researching this, I found OneSignal's implementation of time windows interesting.   
  
They use a different approach where you can:

* Define specific allowed time periods (e.g., Tuesday 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST)
* Set intelligent delivery delays that randomly distribute notifications within allowed windows
* Handle out-of-window notifications by scheduling them for the next available window

For example, if you set a notification to trigger outside of Tuesday 1-6 PM PST, their system automatically schedules it for a random time within next Tuesday's window. This helps prevent notification clustering at window boundaries.

**Technical Challenges I'm Working Through:**

1. Race conditions when multiple events occur simultaneously
2. Handling failed notification deliveries within digest groups
3. Database schema optimization for efficient event aggregation
4. Coordinating time windows across multiple time zones
5. Implementing similar time-window functionality as OneSignal within Novu

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. What indexing strategies work best for quick digest compilation in Novu?
2. How do you handle digest delivery failures and retries?
3. Has anyone implemented custom time window logic similar to OneSignal's approach in Novu?
4. What's your approach to testing digest timing across different time zones?

If you've implemented similar systems with Novu or other notification services, I'd appreciate insights on handling these technical aspects efficiently.",Sudden_Profit_2840,1h4t9jv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,2024-12-02 11:53:39,3,1.0,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/S_ZmR_1cU5aKbwzfea80L7OQ7oKBdb43DuJDAxM8-xM.jpg,t3_1h4t9jv

The reason for the last one is a recurring problem where different browsers will add the ""https://"" automatically.

Is there an easy way to link an easy URL like ""bongable.cc"" to the Github.io address so that it loads faster and has less errors?

Also, I'm testing out the website on different browsers in their respective ""Private"" modes to avoid loading from the cache. Is this method of testing flawed? I might be tripping a little, but I foresee some customers quitting if the site doesn't load quick enough :/

Do I have to buy actual webhosting to get this to load correctly? All I'm really trying for right now is a simple site with a discord link and links to some documents that are also on Github.io.

webdev,Optimal Oauth flow?,"My web app has react frontend and java backend.
Will be using keycloak on the backend eventually.

Here's how the oauth flow would go: 
1. On the frontend user clicks authenticate which calls an auth endpoint on backend.

2. On the backend, a random state param is generated and what not. 
Then auth url is formed (with query params: state, clientId etc, and sent to auth provider for authentication code.
Redirection url is set as a backend endpoint.
The backend sends/redirects this url to the front end.

3. On the frontend the resource owner would be on the auth provider's auth page to either allow or decline the requested scopes.

4. Assuming the resource owner accepts, the auth code would be sent as query params with the backend redirect url. 

5. The backend endpoint verifies state param, auth code and obtains an auth token. Stores the auth token in db.

At this point, what does the frontend do to check if step 5 has been successfully executed since at step 4, the redirect url calls the backend endpoint and not the frontend endpoint.

\- Using a CSS reset  
\- Using a CSS normalize  
\- Using the !important tag to make sure it takes precedent

webdev,Wanting to embark on a personal project with no prior experience,"Hello, I have a personal project in mind that I want to build for myself, so I am willing to devote a lot of time and effort into this project. I personally have little to no experience in full stack development but I am willing to learn (I have a few months to spare). I figured its also a good way to explore web development as a whole since I am entering University next year.

I wish to create an image hosting website. It can do basic things like uploading images, displaying them on the website and deleting them. I took a lot of inspiration from [Pixiv.com](http://pixiv.com/)

 for the following functionalities I wish to include:  
\- Create and delete tags  
\- Assign as many tags as I like to images  
\- Assign Title to images and able to add description below. Display all the tags associated with the image  
\- Search for images based on Title and search/sort based on tag(s)  
\- Roughly have similar interface shown for when I search and when I select an image

I would like to ask how should I go about approaching this project (What should I start doing/learning first)? Is it realistic to create something like this in the first place as a personal project or its only suited for actual companies?

Edit: I intend for this to only be for personal use, so I intend to be the only user. Also I intend for it to run off GitHub since I don’t rlly want it to be in the public domain.

webdev,"A website to copy basic/advanced html, css, js components? ","I was looking for websites where I could copy and paste basic components like buttons, footers, sidebars, etc, just like in Shadcn or Aceternity

Some similar websites/options I found are:

* [https://animata.design/](https://animata.design/) : Components for react, not html
* [https://tremor.so/](https://tremor.so/) : Components for react
* [https://ui.aceternity.com/](https://ui.aceternity.com/) : Components for react
* [https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/) : Components for react
* [https://shoelace.style/](https://shoelace.style/) : Web components but I'd rather own and modify the code by myself
* [https://copy-paste-css.com/](https://copy-paste-css.com/) : Only provides the CSS code
* [https://html5up.net/:](https://html5up.net/:) Html templates, but most of the times the code is messy/hard to read/hard to use (the same is true for many html template websites)
* [https://vanilla.delldesignsystem.com/2.41.1/index.html:](https://vanilla.delldesignsystem.com/2.41.1/index.html:) This is pretty close to what I was looking for, but I was hoping to find other alternatives
* [https://tailwindui.com/components](https://tailwindui.com/components) : This one is great
* \[Copy and paste the components from any website\] : This could work but often the .css, .js is minified/bundled which makes it hard to read/hard to use

Do you know any other websites like shadcn which provides code using html, css and js?",Not_a_Cake_,1h46qpf,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h46qpf/a_website_to_copy_basicadvanced_html_css_js/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h46qpf/a_website_to_copy_basicadvanced_html_css_js/,2024-12-01 16:16:04,2,1.0,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h46qpf
