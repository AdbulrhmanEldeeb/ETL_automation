math,Number I just thought of,"sorry if this is dumb but I just thought of a cool number let me try to explain:

basically you know that graham's number = g64 right? Well do g(Graham's number), elevate it to the power of googolplex! (factorial), repeat the power a graham's number amount of times that's it",F9klco,1h4tcgx,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h4tcgx/number_i_just_thought_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h4tcgx/number_i_just_thought_of/,2024-12-02 11:58:49,0,0.2,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h4tcgx
math,Names for two desired properties of classifcation schemes?,"Hello! Forgive the improper terminology. 

If you are coming up with a system of classifying some set of things, you want the system to be: 

1. Complete, meaning every item in the set falls into one class or category, i.e., there are no items that cannot fit into some category or another, and 

2. Unambiguous, meaning every item falls into one and only one category; no item could be said to fit into more than one category. 

I'm pretty sure there are actual mathematical terms for those two properties, but I don't know what they are. Any wisdom or me? 

Incidentally, I'm sure this issue comes up in about a billion different settings, like library science, cladistics, law and legal statutes, etc.

math,How monstrously long papers are made?,"Following the steps of a recent discussion in the community, I have read a Wiki page on the Feit–Thompson theorem. There I found the following:

*The final paper is 255 pages long. &lt;...&gt;*

*Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the proof was its length: before the Feit–Thompson paper, few arguments in group theory were more than a few pages long and most could be read in a day. Once group theorists realized that such long arguments could work, a series of papers that were several hundred pages long started to appear. Some of these dwarfed even the Feit–Thompson paper; the paper by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen D. Smith on quasithin groups was 1,221 pages long.*

How do authors come up with such long proofs? I don't believe there are brilliant insights every few pages. If there were, these gigantic papers would be valued as high as FLT proof, but they are not. I imagine there should be some machinery that produces arguments more or less mechanically, but still,  these arguments are not so standard that they could be just omitted from the paper.

But that's just my guess. If it is true, what does this machinery look like? If it is not, how are behemoth-long proofs actually made?
