movies,What do you think of the women characters in John McTiernan's films?,"Hi everyone,

John McTiernan is one of the legends of action cinema, known for iconic movies like *Die Hard*, *Predator*, and *Last action Hero*. His movies are packed with high-stakes tension, larger-than-life heroes, and explosive action, but what about the women in these stories? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on how they‚Äôre portrayed!

Here are a few women in his films that stand out to me:

* **Holly Gennaro McClane (*****Die Hard*****)**: She‚Äôs a career-driven, no-nonsense woman who also happens to be at the heart of John McClane‚Äôs emotional journey. Her strength comes across in the way she handles Hans Gruber and leads the hostages, but do you think she‚Äôs given enough agency beyond being someone for John to save?
* **Anna (*****Predator*****)**: At first, Anna seems like a typical prisoner-of-war character, but she becomes a key figure in unraveling the Predator‚Äôs backstory. She provides a voice for her people and their legends. Does her role feel substantial, or does it fall into the trope of the ""exotic other""?
* **Virginia Baker (*****The Thomas Crown Affair*****)**: Rene Russo‚Äôs character is sharp, confident, and undeniably one of McTiernan‚Äôs most complex women. She‚Äôs Thomas Crown‚Äôs equal, which is rare in movies like this. Does she break the mold of how women are portrayed in action/thrillers?
* **Whitney and Irene (*****Last Action Hero*****)**: This movie pokes fun at action clich√©s, and it‚Äôs fun to see the ""screaming damsel"" and ""grounded working-class mom"" tropes being played for laughs. What do you think McTiernan was trying to say about female characters in action films here?

I know McTiernan‚Äôs films are heavily focused on their male leads, but I‚Äôm curious‚Äîdo you think the women in his movies hold their own? Which characters stand out to you, and which feel underdeveloped?

Would love to hear your thoughts and insights! üòä",Fennel_Zealousideal,1h4th9d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4th9d/what_do_you_think_of_the_women_characters_in_john/,2024-12-02 12:06:22,0,0.44,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4th9d

movies,Most Fitting Movie for Each Month,"Haven‚Äôt seen a post like this, so I figured I‚Äôd make one.

What are the most fitting movies for each of the 12 months of the year? Which movies best fit the vibes and aesthetics of each month? Thought this might be an interesting discussion.

January: Something grim and desolate like Fargo would fit pretty good, wintery and cold and all

February: Equally as cold and miserable, but with the added benefit of Valentines Day. Some sort of romance movie with a wintery theme would fit here, especially if set on Valentines Day. Groundhog Day is also a strong contender.

March-April: No specific ideas, these blend together for me. Movies about spring would fit for all of both.

May: Still springtime, but also end-of-school and graduation, so any moviess about graduating or school letting out would fit.

June-Aug: These blend together for me. Plenty of summer movies, but not necessarily specific to a month. I will say, August also has back to school as a potential setting or theme, and I personally associate that month with dreary, overbearing heat and fatigue, the kind of visuals heavily present in the film Falling Down

September: School is fully back in swing, and I would lean towards placing a High School movie or something here.

October: There‚Äôs plenty of Halloween movies, but it would have to be one that celebrates fall and the month of October more so than just being scary. The miniseries Over the Garden Wall Would Fit, not sure of other examples 

November: Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be the easy choice for Thanksgiving, but I do wonder if there are any other films that would fire better.

December: There‚Äôs a litany of holiday movies of course, but out of all of them there‚Äôs have to be one that embodies the month as a whole and not just Christmas time. A plot incorporating the advent season might work, like Christmas Vacation, or a film that incorporates New Years.

Hi, let me tell you how it went for me first because I need to vent. 
Sunday night, I wanted a thriller that would keep me on the edge, fun as I could say. After one hour, I felt so helpless for the characters, just as they might feel. After the movie, I just feel like it was such a sad, cold, depressing tragedy about unhealed trauma. Keller need of being in absolute control and completely selling his soul in order to not being hurt more. The guy still trying to do the mazes from when he was kidnapped. Alex Jones who was kidnapped and tortured. And perhaps the most subtely tragic, Detective Loki whole past of being abused that might have kept him from suspecting the woman. I believe that‚Äôs how he was didn‚Äôt see Alex suffering or the guy with the maze lighting a candle or acting their deaths. 

All that to say, this film left me heartbroken for them. It‚Äôs a good thing with how these stories tend to be sensationalized through crime documentaries etc. But I would not say it‚Äôs a thriller, or a tragedy/drama with some real thriller mechanics.

Today (and this ‚Äútoday‚Äù is valid no matter where you are, as long as you read it early enough), I can then also announce the winner: ***4 luni, 3 sƒÉptƒÉm√¢ni »ôi 2 zile*** (engl.: *4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days*) continues the trend of newer films tending to end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Once again, unfortunately I haven't seen the winning film yet - but that's exactly what makes this filmic journey so exciting for me. As far as I understand it, it's a relatively political movie - and the next country we turn to is certainly also a political subject for some people here: now we come to **Russia**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Most realistic addiction movies you've seen? I find Requiem for a Dream is not it.,"The movie Requiem for a Dream is quite popular and often receives high ratings and praise from people who just saw it. And it is indeed a well done movie, but it's not a realistic movie about drugs.

I think of it more as a horror movie that uses drugs than a movie about people becoming addicted. It gets details wrong, like heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. That's just one example.

But it works great as anti-drug advertising for people who have never done drugs before. And like I said, it's a pretty good movie from the artistic point of view. Like the visuals are so powerful you can't forget certain scenes for a long time. Combined with the great score, you are left at the end of the film with that sense of horror, of powerlessness in face of terrible doom, of things unraveling rapidly for everyone. It's a nightmare visualized really.

So my question is whether you find the movie realistic, especially if you or someone you know has done drugs.

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",PresentRevenue1347,1h4lwrm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,2024-12-02 03:41:52,117,0.77,117,0,77,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4lwrm

They went for the dirty and gritty look for this one, no colorful costumes for our heroes.   Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  

We all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.
So I wonder‚Ä¶ Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   

I can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale‚Ä¶. But I found this rather jarring.

movies,How many movies have you seen in your lifetime? ,"I've asked myself this and as an avid movie goer, I thought the number would be much higher and find others tend to overestimate. 

I sat down and over time, did my best to list out every movie I have ever seen. I tried to narrow it down to movies I know for a fact I have watched beginning to end. Not ""oh, I saw 70% of it on television once"" or ""eh, I think i watched it when I was a kid."" 

Especially for things like ubiquitous Disney films. Everyone is seemingly fimiliar with Bambi, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, etc, but I think the number of people who watched these movies in their entirety is lower. And while I myself couldnt exactly remember a time where I didnt know these characters, I also couldnt remember taking the time to watch them as a kid. So I didnt count them. Unless I knew 100% I watched it. 

I also tried not to count television specials unless they were feature length and billed as a movie. Does Channel Chasers from the Fairly OddParents count as a movie or is it a tv special? It sounds dumb but unless it was billed as a movie, I tried to avoid counting it. Kim Possible The Movie: So The Drama may only be like 70 minutes and aired straight to Disney Channel, but I counted it. 

So after counting movies I'd seen under the criteria and with a huge help from Letterboxd, I was able to pin down a rough estimate: 

At the age of 27, I have seen about **1000-1100 movies**. I definitely watch more movies I havent ever seen now than I did maybe a decade ago so I am wondering how that number will look in the next 25 years of my life.

In my college days, I'd see roughly 40-70 movies a year? While not much at all relative to most film lovers, I would say definitely a higher number than the average person. This year, the number is over 100, and will likely finish at about 115-120. The number of movies I watch per month tends to fluctuate greatly. Sometimes I get more into television or video games or too busy with social life to be watching movies. In March, for instance, I had only seen one movie and it was Dune 2. But back in September, I had managed to watch 25 movies.

movies,Me Before You (2016) Discussion,"Watched for the first time last night

The real standout to me was that all the characters seemed extremely relatable and understandable

I got a really gross feeling when it was clear there was emotional cheating going on, yet I still found myself rooting for the main actors. Even until the end, I wished she had broken it off with her boyfriend before moving on, but I couldn't help but wish her and Will would spend their last moments together

It was nice to see a movie, especially knowing this was made in 2016 tackle assisted suicide so well in my opinion. Will had resigned his life, but still provided 6 months to his parents for things to turn around. His parents fought on both sides to help and stop him. Louisa's mum also was vehemtly against it and didn't want her daughter being involved as she knew this would upset her

My favourite scene overall was Louisa coming home to nod her head ""no"" towards her sister. I've had situation that resulted in a near identical scene and I knew how much that would've hurt

I really enjoyed all the characters and the few bits of humour sprinkled throughout. The scenes were all engaging that what was originally ""I'm juat gonna sit here, you watch what you want"", turned into me glued to the screen after the first minute

Overall, I don't think this movie has any real flaws and I'd consider it a 10/10. I was very surprised I had never heard of this one and even more surprised to see the bad reception regarding the assisted suicide topic. I do wonder how I would've felt had I watched it in 2016

movies,Nutcrackers (2024) starring Ben Stiller ruined my day,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  
  
Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I‚Äôve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can‚Äôt stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he‚Äôs ruined.
  
It‚Äôs rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn‚Äôt exist. This is one of those times. The movie‚Äôs not entertaining, it‚Äôs not dramatic, it‚Äôs just pointless. I honestly can‚Äôt believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years‚Ä¶ and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it‚Äôs probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you‚Äôre stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I‚Äôve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I‚Äôm actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt waste your time. You‚Äôll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

2. The Wild Robot   - Dramwork's best in years and one of the most hard hitting movies of the decade.

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

It's darkly comedic and sometimes tragic and it manages both emotions with ease.

movies,"The Prestige (2006) is a great magic trick, but once you know the secret, it impresses no one","I recently rewatched The Prestige after many years and although it is a completely different and exciting experience, the third act kinda doesn't make any logical sense.

# Obviously, big spoilers below as I will be discussing the ending so be forewarned...

First of all, I just want to say that I love this movie and I think it's among one of Nolan's best films. This is really nitpicky, so I hope you will read this more as a fan poking holes than a criticism.

There are 4 parts of the story that I either didn't see or overlooked in my first dozen viewings. But now that I've seen it again after many years, I can't ignore these illogical choices.

1. **Borden should have revealed their secret to save his own/brother's life.** I get that they have dedicated their lives to magic and withholding the secret but with the threat of a hanging, they should have said something if it gave them a chance at clemency. The surviving brother wouldn't have been able to keep performing magic anyways because the Alfred identity would also legally be dead; he'd have to start from scratch. And finally, by letting the trick die with one of the brothers, it makes Sarah's death even more meaningless. Taking the secret to the grave only makes thematic sense, but not logical sense.
2. **Cutter kinda kidnaps Jess and no one really cares**. After one of the Borden twins in hanged, the surviving Borden teams up with Cutter to get revenge on Angier. (So I guess he ends up revealing his secret anyways?) They show Cutter sneaking onto Lord Caldlow's estate and grabbing Jess during the day, but Lord Caldlow is murder by Borden at night. If Jess was kidnapped the same day as the murder, wouldn't Caldlow have be extra careful and maybe not go to his warehouse alone? And if Caldlow was murdered the night before the kidnapping, wouldn't the house be extra careful to guard over Jess? This was ignored just to give Borden a happy ending.
3. **Angier didn't need to keep killing this clones.** He literally could have made one clone and lived as twins, thus allowing him to perform the New Transported Man as Borden did. I get the initial shock of shooting the first clone, but to devise a plan to keep killing each sequential clone is illogical. In fact, I'm starting to believe that this was Tesla's initial design in the first place. Tesla doesn't strike me as someone who would build a cloning machine instead of a teleporting machine. I think he wanted to give Angier a perfect double so that he could perform the trick and enjoy the prestige half of the time. But story-wise, it would have been more poetic to drown night-after-night like his late-wife.
4. **Angier couldn't have pulled off the Real Transported Man as shown in the film.** We only see this trick performed twice and both times, you kinda have to turn your brain off.
   1. The first time is when Angier shows off the machine to Cutter and the talent manager. After he activates the machine, Prime-Angier just **disappears**. There was no trap door implemented yet; the talent manager is the one who suggests it. So at this point, there should be two Angiers and no way of killing either one of them.
   2. The second time is during one of the Great Danton's 100-show-run. Prime-Angier falls through the trap door and into the water tank and Borden is framed for supposedly killing him. But why doesn't Clone-Angier complete the trick and reappear for the Prestige? Clone-Angier is all the way up in the wings of the audience so how would he know that Borden would be under the stage? Realistically, Angier wouldn't know which show of the 100 shows should be the one when he needed to fake his own death and not reappear.

All in all, the film WORKS better without logic. I mean it's about magicians and there's a fucking cloning machine in the 1800s. But I mainly wanted to bring these up just to make sure I wasn't going insane. Thanks for taking the time to read.

The Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.

Honorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.

movies,Dune and Dune part two,"I finally came to watch both movies and they're audio-visually masterclass. The sound mixing of the first was a bit too much Nolan but still good. What I didn't like was that for some reason only stars where casted that are the ""hot stuff"" right now and not for talent. I really liked the performances of Chalamet, Ferguson and Skarsgard but Zendaya, Bautista and even Brolin were run-of-the-mine. Imo much potential was lost in the casting and other actors would have been better.",tmoe1991,1h4vwgx,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4vwgx/dune_and_dune_part_two/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4vwgx/dune_and_dune_part_two/,2024-12-02 14:15:31,0,0.24,0,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4vwgx
movies,the mom's initial response to cujo is very puzzling.,"in cujo, the trentons arrive at the camber house to have their car repaired. eventually, cujo shows up. the mom, seeing cujo coming, instantly picks up her child.

now, i find this reaction very puzzling. keep in mind that this is before cujo's rampage. at this point, no one knows about the rabies and cujo is still very much a normal dog. 

this is made stranger to me since saint bernards are notorious for being among the most gentle dog breeds. they are often considered to be the best example of a gentle giant in the dog world. and they are noted to especially good with children. 

you may be inclined to say that she just saw a rather large dog and feared the worst. fair enough. however, after the son assures her that cujo won't hurt her son and that he likes kids, she is still looking at cujo with fear on her face. even trent's father and her own husband assures her that everything is alright but she's still worried.

movies,Can't finish The Shining after characters casually dropping the N word in a derogatory manner,"Who thought this was going to age well?  I understand Jack isn't supposed to be a good guy, and that the hotel spirit whatever is just manipulating him, but here I am, invested in the story, then out of nowhwere WHAM n word referring to character who is portrayed as a good guy, between two white guys

Its like, did people at the time just not react to that? Was it supposed to paint him a bad light? I get that it was 1980, but that was only 16 years past the civil rights act - you would think a large portion of the potential audience would have been fine with using the slur so flagrantly. 

My flight ended around the same type as this section of the movie, and now I have no desire to pick it up again,  knowing that the rest of the movie follows that scene. It almost cheapens things.
