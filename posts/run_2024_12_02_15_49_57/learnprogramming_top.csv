In high school my teacher used to send us to a website which used to read and also give us some tutorials videos on it and used to provide us with a assignment.

If I could find something in that regard in which I don't get a lot of videos about this the code, but also tell me the right and wrong between it and gives me not to hard but small excercise in which I could code and not get stuck in tutorial hell and if there are some flash cards where we choose the correct option that would be perfect.

learnprogramming,How to become faster at coding and completing tasks at work? ,"Hey everyone,  

I’ve read a lot of posts about people feeling slow at work, but most focus on productivity or focus issues. That’s not my case—I work my full 8 hours non-stop, sometimes even skipping lunch to get more done. On some occasions, I even work overtime when I get at home (without my team knowing) just to speed things up.  

The problem is that my lead thinks I’m slow. He’s generally a chill and cool person, and he doesn’t put a lot of pressure on me, but he often seems disappointed with my progress. I frequently hear comments like, *“Oh, you’re still working on that? Don’t you think it’s taking too long?”*  

I’ve reflected on this, and I admit that compared to the other member on the team, I am slower. But here’s the frustrating part: I’m genuinely putting in the effort. I work nonstop, put in overtime, and still struggle to keep up. It’s not that I don’t know what I’m doing—I do. I make progress, sure sometimes i get stuck but most of the time I'm not stuck i am progressing but still slow

Honestly, this is starting to get to me. I’m not offended by the comments, but I’m frustrated with myself because I feel like I’m failing to meet expectations, no matter how hard I try.  

It’s worth mentioning that this is my first job. I’m five months in, and before this, I use to work as a freelancer for years. This is my first experience in a company setting.  

Have any of you faced similar challenges? Is there some things that we can do to become more fast at coding? I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

I've seen videos like ""How I code for 4 hours straight"" and it's so awesome! but when I try something like that it's so bad that I don't try again.

I couldn't focus for more than 10 minutes, so I gradually upped it to 10 to 15 minutes, then 20 minutes then 25 minutes, and now can focus for up to 50 minutes(I essentially continuously do 10-15-20 minute sessions and a 15-minute break), but not all the time, sometimes I need to take 10-minute sessions with 2-minute breaks to recharge my brain. It works for studying. I feel like that's my max. Anything more than that, I would lose focus and turn my attention somewhere else.

I’m new to programming (just about a month in) and have been experimenting with an idea I’m calling *The God Protocol*. This project started as a way for me to learn and explore data compression and encoding, but it’s turning into something I feel might be worth sharing for feedback.

The basic idea is to compress and encode data in a way that speeds up how AI systems, humans, and machines share and process information. While I’m new to all this, I’ve done some testing and wanted to share what I’ve observed so far:

# What I’ve Found So Far:

* **Faster Processing:**
   * Compared to traditional formats, the protocol handles large datasets much faster.
   * Example:
      * RDF/XML: 2.97 seconds for 78 KB.
      * Standard JSON: 0.52 seconds for 8 MB.
      * My approach: 0.31 seconds, and combining it with binary encoding brought it down to 0.003 seconds.
* **Works with Any File Format:**
   * The encoded data seems flexible—it works across binary, CSV, JSON, etc., while staying compact and fast.
* **Scales Well:**
   * Even as datasets grow, the framework holds up with low processing times and flexibility.
* **AI-Centric Design:**
   * The setup seems to help AI systems, allowing for smaller, faster models without extra processing overhead.

# Why I’m Sharing This:

I’m still very new to programming, so I’m sure there are things I’m missing. I wanted to ask this community for thoughts and advice because I’m not sure if this is practical or if there are blind spots I’m overlooking. Specifically:

1. Does this seem like a useful or valuable approach to improving how we handle data?
2. Are there areas I should research further to improve my understanding?
3. How might this compare to tools like Protobuf, MessagePack, or Avro?

# Note:

I’m not revealing the exact methods just yet since I want to refine my understanding first. But I’m happy to share more general details if that helps clarify anything!

Thanks in advance for your time and feedback. I’m still learning and want to grow from this experience, so any advice is greatly appreciated!",SHIR0___0,1h4r19h,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r19h/beginner_project_the_god_protocol_looking_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r19h/beginner_project_the_god_protocol_looking_for/,2024-12-02 09:14:17,1,0.67,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Code Review,,t3_1h4r19h

1. Do you prefer video or text-based materials for learning programming languages? Why?
2. Do you feel there’s a lack of high quality resources for learning programming?
3. Would you be interested in a platform that:
   * Generates personalized coding lessons based on factors like your experience level and age.
   * Dynamically adjusts lessons based on your performance.
   * Requires you to repeat lessons to address weaknesses and forces you to be consistent by resetting your progress if you stop taking lessons for a certain number of days.

learnprogramming,Need Help Confirming Address Space Size Calculations for Logical and Physical Addresses,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on a problem involving address space sizes, and I want to confirm if my understanding and calculations are correct. Here’s the problem:

We’re given:
1. A logical address space of **256 pages**.
2. A page size of **4 KiB (2¹² bytes)**.
3. Physical memory consisting of **64 frames**.

I’ve attempted the solution as follows:

### Logical Address:
The number of pages in the logical address space is 256, so to represent 256 pages, we need:  

**Bits for Page Number** = log₂(256) = 8 bits.  

The page size is 4 KiB = 2¹² bytes.  
To represent the byte offset within a page, we need:  

**Bits for Page Offset** = log₂(2¹²) = 12 bits.  

**Total Logical Address Bits** = Bits for Page Number + Bits for Page Offset = 8 + 12 = **20 bits**.  

### Physical Address:
The number of frames in physical memory is 64.  
To represent 64 frames, we need:  

**Bits for Frame Number** = log₂(64) = 6 bits.  

The frame size is the same as the page size (4 KiB = 2¹² bytes).  
To represent the byte offset within a frame, we need:  

**Bits for Frame Offset** = log₂(2¹²) = 12 bits.  

**Total Physical Address Bits** = Bits for Frame Number + Bits for Frame Offset = 6 + 12 = **18 bits**.  


Can someone confirm if these calculations are correct, or let me know if I’ve misunderstood any part of the problem? I’d also appreciate any insights into alternative ways to think about address space size calculations if there’s a simpler approach.

learnprogramming,"Having trouble sticking to any one thing, advice? (ADHD may be relevant)","note: I wrote this somewhat out of order so excuse if I've repeated myself.

Background: I'm in my early twenties and this year got diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, recently I was able to get on medication, which has been a good help, and it's why I'm choosing now to try to tackle this.

I'm not a CS student, nor do I want to be. I'm not pursuing a career in CS or anything related to it. I just have a significant interest in programming, and see it as a hobby and creative outlet.

I got my first computer at 12 and I've been using Linux since I was about 13. So I'm pretty competent at using Bash, writing shell scripts for friends to solve little tasks, and writing ebuilds for my Gentoo install.

In high-school I took an intro to programming class, where I learned some basic Python and Java. The most complicated of things that I made were some terminal based games, and a couple of basic GUI games with some Java game engine.

But outside of the classroom environment, I've really struggled with adding some depth to my knowledge with self-learning. I've basically forgot all the Python and Java I learned after I finished the class, and the only thing I'm able to retain is a fair bit of Bash since I use it daily in the shell.

I've had a lot of fun in the past messing with different languages and started a handful of projects.

* Didn't love C
* Stuck with Haskell for awhile before I started to feel like I was wasting my time as a hobbyist
* Stuck with Scheme and Racket, for SICP and HtDP2, but again felt like I was wasting time
* Stuck with Go probably the longest out of anything since high-school, never really had a reason to stop, but I broke my streak of using it, and never started back up
* Thought C++ was cool
* More recently wrote some simple Rust, thought it was very productive, but kinda funky feeling? Starting to get a little embarrassed at how many attempts at learning and stopping I've made, and this isn't even all of them, so I'll cut it short here

I'd say at the moment, maybe it's just recency bias, but I'm most interested in C++ and Rust. There's something I particularly like about compiled languages, that I can't really explain, just makes my brain happy I guess. I have a preference for languages with a good book to read. And I have enough experience I feel, that I don't need to restart with a beginner to programming book like, one that might teach you to use Python to program a magic 8 ball or something.

I'm very much rambling at this point that I don't think I've stayed on topic, and instead just dumped a mishmash of details about myself here, so a tl;dr is in order...

***tl;dr:*** I have ADHD, recently got on medication. Despite taking a high-school programming class, I've forgotten everything except some Bash. I don't want a CS career or education, just a hobby that might be useful at times. Any advice on how to stay focused on a project/language long enough for the snowball to keep rolling? And where might be a good place to pick back up, as someone with a little experience?

Would ""Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++"" or ""The Rust Book"" be a good fit?

learnprogramming,Can someone explain the output of this code for me? (C Language),"I'm studying Computer Programming. There is a code in a question in one of my exams. The solution say that the correct answer is ""The last letter of the output is ""I"""".

I got ""T"" as the last letter. I got confused so I tried run the code with AI and it also say that the last letter is ""I"" so I got even more confused.  The code is:

    int i = 2;
    char text[] = ""ALGORITHM"";
    while (i &lt; 8) {
        printf(""%c"", text[i]);
        i += 2;
    }

* When `i = 2`, `text[2]` is 'G'.
* When `i = 4`, `text[4]` is 'R'.
* When `i = 6`, `text[6]` is 'I'.
* When `i = 8`, the loop condition `i &lt; 8` fails, so the loop stops.

So, the output of this code will be:

    GRI

\[The output is from AI\]

So, from what my little brain understands, the text\[2\] which is the third letter in ""ALGORITHM"" is ""G"".  
text\[4\] which is the fifth letter is ""R"". Understandable.

But the text\[6\] which ""should be"" the seventh letter which is ""T"" but it appears to be ""I""

I've been stunned by this for a couple of hours now, someone please explain this to me please.

Edit: The output I got is from AI though and correct answer to this question also is ""The last letter of the output is ""I"" ""  
Edit 2:  I think the solution to this question might be wrong (Last letter of the output is ""I"") and there is no correct answer on my exam even the AI is unreliable.

learnprogramming,How do I access files a game dev sent me?,"For context, I am a newbie game dev using Ren'Py, an assisted program for making visual novels.

The developer of an awesome game sent me the code so I (a newbie) can learn and study. The files come in three forms: Windows Media Player, RPYC File, and BAK File.

I can access BAK Files just fine, but only a few of the files have that option, most just have the first two. RPYC is gibberish (it's what Ren'Py uses to run) and Windows Media Player just... can't. It isn't a video. I downloaded a better video player and it doesn't work (it's a file. I want the code.)

I'm at a loss. Is there a way to decode a file like the RPYC? Do I have to somehow open the Windows Media Player file on notepad (works for BAK)? Should I reach out to the dev and, if so, what do I say? Any advice welcome.

SOLVED! i deleted all the media players and it'll finally open where I want. Hopefully this doesn't kill me in the future, thank you!",WritingFANIII,1h4fz23,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4fz23/how_do_i_access_files_a_game_dev_sent_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4fz23/how_do_i_access_files_a_game_dev_sent_me/,2024-12-01 22:50:38,0,0.5,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h4fz23

learnprogramming,"Having low motivation with school, wanting to learn from home","Hello! Sorta freaking out a bit here. This semester in college I am doing not so great, and I have a couple years of community college pre reqs and many BS classes left before I even start what I want to do, which is programming in my major.

My motivation just keeps on dying, with each passing semester, and especially as the future progresses. So, is there anything out there that I can reliably either get a proper chance at a job, learn and put my 100% to learn programming and that maths required? I see that Harvard provides online classes for programming, which is good, but are there any pre reqs for that? 

Anything with pre requisites will just kill me, due to my horrible performance in high school, college placed me in Development Math, then I failed Algebra 1, passed the second time, and now I'm taking Algebra 2. I still have so many years of maths and classes left, again, before I even think about taking programming.

I'm sorry if this reading is all over the place, but if anyone could please point me in a better direction than my counclers, then I'll be more than happy to listen. I just need an ounce of motivation 😅",peter90098,1h48bqk,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h48bqk/having_low_motivation_with_school_wanting_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h48bqk/having_low_motivation_with_school_wanting_to/,2024-12-01 17:25:26,0,0.25,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Topic,,t3_1h48bqk

learnprogramming,Is programming a good field to go into if you don’t do well in a 9-5?,"Title. I’m currently working a typical 40hr per week job, but I don’t think I’m the type of person who can do that long term? I have lots of social issues and often feel ostracized, I’m trans but I don’t pass and not being referred to as my chosen gender is really really hard on me, I also just have a soup of mental illnesses that make it hard to deal with a ridged schedule, etc. I wouldn’t even need a job that pays all that much, I’m able to support myself and my cats with $15 per hour as long as I am stringent. 

So I’m trying to figure out a job I could do that has a more flexible schedule or where I can be my own boss, and that will feed me. 

I definitely think I could teach myself how to program too. I did well in an AP computer science class that used block coding(?), I was able to teach myself html in under a week like two years ago, and I’m generally interested in all sorts of computer related stuff like hardware, gaming/gamedev, 3d modeling, helping my family troubleshoot their computer issues. 

So yeah. Just asking if learning programming would be worth it based on the things I’ve written and what specific fields might be good for me to focus on.
