In high school my teacher used to send us to a website which used to read and also give us some tutorials videos on it and used to provide us with a assignment.

If I could find something in that regard in which I don't get a lot of videos about this the code, but also tell me the right and wrong between it and gives me not to hard but small excercise in which I could code and not get stuck in tutorial hell and if there are some flash cards where we choose the correct option that would be perfect.

I have seen code academy being one with free JavaScript program. If anyone has resources for this type of learning that would be great also, I have heard about Leon Noel person who posts streams and videos about these thing would like to have a opinion on him as well

learnprogramming,How to become faster at coding and completing tasks at work? ,"Hey everyone,  

I’ve read a lot of posts about people feeling slow at work, but most focus on productivity or focus issues. That’s not my case—I work my full 8 hours non-stop, sometimes even skipping lunch to get more done. On some occasions, I even work overtime when I get at home (without my team knowing) just to speed things up.  

The problem is that my lead thinks I’m slow. He’s generally a chill and cool person, and he doesn’t put a lot of pressure on me, but he often seems disappointed with my progress. I frequently hear comments like, *“Oh, you’re still working on that? Don’t you think it’s taking too long?”*  

I’ve reflected on this, and I admit that compared to the other member on the team, I am slower. But here’s the frustrating part: I’m genuinely putting in the effort. I work nonstop, put in overtime, and still struggle to keep up. It’s not that I don’t know what I’m doing—I do. I make progress, sure sometimes i get stuck but most of the time I'm not stuck i am progressing but still slow

Honestly, this is starting to get to me. I’m not offended by the comments, but I’m frustrated with myself because I feel like I’m failing to meet expectations, no matter how hard I try.  

It’s worth mentioning that this is my first job. I’m five months in, and before this, I use to work as a freelancer for years. This is my first experience in a company setting.  

Have any of you faced similar challenges? Is there some things that we can do to become more fast at coding? I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

learnprogramming,🏎✏ Dotrace game in Js,"After 4 months of development, I'm delighted to present my DotRace game!

This strategic racing game is inspired by the classic game of racing with a pencil on a small sheet of paper (moving points with inertia)... yes, I drew trajectories for a good part of my childhood!

It can be played online at this address: [http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/](http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/)

Some technical information:

* Choice of game mode :
   * Time Attack: Beat the AI
   * Race: Single race
   * Championship: Several races in a row
* Choice of tracks :
   * Pre-integrated tracks (well-known F1 circuits, spirals, bizarre shapes, etc.)
   * Random track generator with choice (min, max) of total track length, width and length of road sections, angles...
* Player configuration :
   * Up to 4 human players (on the same screen)
   * Opponents with configurable AI level
   * 8 players in tracks
   * Button assistance options (best choice)
* Screen configuration :
   * Quick glance to see the entire track
   * Full screen mode
   * Camera follows player
   * Speed-dependent widening of the view (to “see further”)
* Sound configuration :
   * Choice of 3 sound themes:
      * Sound of marker pen on a sheet of paper
      * Sound of my car (A-Class 250, yes, I'm a 50-year-old)
      * The sound of a spaceship
   * Choice of sound volume for opponents
   * Speed of movement...
* Main path-finding algorithm
   * The main principle of my algorithm is that it doesn't know the arrival points, it just tries to go as far as possible in as few moves as possible. A nice recursive function calculates all possible paths and determines the best one.
   * The “AI level” (variable from 2 to 8 for each player) corresponds to the depth of this recursive search for the best path.
   * The position of opponents is not taken into account when calculating the path, which can lead to accidents and run-offs when the width of the track is reduced and several players covet the same point.
* About 4,000 lines of javascript typed with my old fingers...

My question concerns the possibility of simply running the same code in an android apk? for free?

I am also interested in your suggestions for improving my game.

Thank you.

","Hi there!  
I'm planning to build a user authentication system and I'm considering the best way to store passwords in 2025. I know that Argon2 has become one of the most popular hashing algorithms recently, but I’d like to better understand why it’s worth choosing over, say, bcrypt.

Why is Argon2 considered superior to bcrypt or PBKDF2?",Belzebubiec,1h4r6gm,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r6gm/password_hashing_in_2025_why_choose_argon2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r6gm/password_hashing_in_2025_why_choose_argon2/,2024-12-02 09:25:25,2,0.63,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h4r6gm
