**Tips to get the best suggestions**

* Be detailed! If you're looking for a roguelike, say that. If your game must include zombies, you should probably mention that. The more detailed you are the better the recommendations will be.
* Are you limited by PC specifications or a budget? That's all good stuff to include.

pcgaming,Anyone out there still like written video game reviews/articles?,"Just curious if anyone out there still enjoys reading video game articles/reviews? Like - oldschool style - longform text + screenshots.

I myself tend to just skim down to the review score (not that these really mean much these days in the world of sponsored reviews) - but once upon a time, I used to really enjoy a good, longform review.

I myself wrote them freelance for a while, for a local gaming site and the small amount of money I made from it coupled with review copies of various games was always pretty exciting.

But I've been thinking a lot lately - possibly because I'm getting on in age these days, if anyone actually reads the reviews / articles rather than just skim them? Reading for the enjoyment of reading.

pcgaming,Are classic games overrated?,"TLDR: are older games getting an advantage in rating because there were fewer games back then?

I‚Äôve been thinking about this from time to time. There are good and solid games now for sure but a common consensus is that old games were made with more passion, with more focus on it being fun instead of selling well, with simpler but more fun design, thus resulting in being just, better. However a good analogy would be being seated at a table with almost everything you can think of, then you get to be more picky about which food tastes good. The same food that you hate right now may be the best tasting thing if you‚Äôre stuck in a desert for several days. It may not be that extreme but the point is, our perception can sometimes be influenced by the context and become deceiving/subjective.

From another angle, almost everything in game developing is considerably complex and requires years of experience to master (things like level designs, quests, gameplay, character progression, story, sound, what have you). How can it get worse over time? If you put me 20 years back I definitely wouldn‚Äôt predict that the games are going to become worse in the future right? It is true that with the inflated economy, increasing competition, developer/publisher separation, things can get complicated and out of control, still I would have thought things will become better in general.

What are your thoughts on this?",sinnytear,1h29y5l,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h29y5l/are_classic_games_overrated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h29y5l/are_classic_games_overrated/,2024-11-29 00:49:32,0,0.08,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h29y5l

pcgaming,Has gaming gotten less social?,"Has gaming gotten less social?

I remember playing games like Halo, COD and other online games. There would always be people in game chat and you‚Äôd talk crap, make friends etc.

These days when playing multiplayer games, lobbies are dead quiet. Add to the fact that with things like SBMM lobbies pretty much always disbanded after every match so there‚Äôs less opportunity for online games to be social.

Though when I started to notice this, it was around the time that I moved over to PC from console. So does anyone else think games have gotten less social? Or is it possibly the difference in platform? As in could it be that most people on PC are just using discord and don‚Äôt use the in game chat?

pcgaming,"As a 90's gamer, the gaming scene today has exploded with great and bad games. Don't let the outrage farming youtubers get to you.","After Doom I and II were released, there were so many Doom-clone slop. We truly had terrible games back then among the GOATs.

Today, gaming has truly becoming a mainstream force with tons of marketing money, production money, and all the good and bad things that come with it.

DOTA 2 &amp; other competitive games had tens of millions of eSports prizes already. Studios are also focusing on amazing single player games and the titles back that up.

Overall we have amazing games and hardware today. Don't let the outrage farmers get to you. We already 'made it'.

Who needs CDs?  I just redownloaded my whole catalogue of games out of thin air with a few mouse clicks via steam.

Lacking innovation?  I don't know about you, I'm FEASTING here on:

* Dave the Diver - mixing management sim + adventure
* Elden Ring DLC in all its AAA glory, CP2077 too.
* I love roguelikes - Hades I and II are amazing.  I also play 2-3 clones which are amazing too.
* What the hell are all these Truck, farming, and life simulators?  I'm not into them, but wow!
* Path of Exile 2 etc etc..
* Street Fighter 6 and I get to play as Terry Bogard vs Ryu?  This would've been my 90's kids' dream!

pcgaming,"[Blackwell Update] Historical analysis of NVIDIA GPUs relative performance, core count and die sizes across product classes and generations","Hello there!

Some 9 months ago I posted here and in some other subs about some discoveries and overall analysis I did over NVIDIA GPUs and their performance and core count across their generations (from Maxwell 2.0 (9xx) up to Ada (4xxx)). You can check out the complete comprehensive original post [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1b0ln9d/historical_analysis_of_nvidia_gpus_relative/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). It gained a fair bit of traction back then.

&amp;#x200B;

With the new leaks and rumors (sources below, not unfounded), I just grabbed the rumored SM/CUDA core count for the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and 5070 cards and plotted them against the previous generations up until Maxwell 2.0.

If you haven't read the original post, here's what matters to understand this chart:

* The X-axis in the chart (named ""Generation Name"") plots all released, rumored to release (4090 Ti, back when Ada wasn't EOL) and the new leaked Blackwell (marked with two asterisks) GPU SKUs for each generation.
* The Y-axis in the chart plots each of these cards according to the maximum CUDA core amount possible for each generation. This maximum value is derived by the most powerful GPU die each generation. Quoting from the original post: in Pascal (GTX 10 series), the TITAN Xp is the fully enabled top die (GP102), with 3840 CUDA cores, so it is at 100% relative core count. In the other hand, the 1060 6GB (GP106) has 1280 CUDA cores, which is exactly 33.3% as many cores as the TITAN Xp, thus, it has 33% relative core count.

Effectively, this means that when buying a 1060GB you're getting 33% of the most powerful GPU compute technology available at the time for the gaming cards (considering how advanced the manufacturing, nodes and processes were available at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

The results speak for themselves. I'll leave you with the initial chart and I'll give some insight afterwards:

[(Can't post images directly in this subreddit, here's a link)](https://i.imgur.com/B4sqraS.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The results are... depressing? I've sourced the data from leaked, but not unfounded information from minimally reputable sources such as [VideoCardz](https://videocardz.com/newz/geforce-rtx-5090-5080-5070ti-and-5070-to-launch-in-q1-rtx-5070-expected-to-feature-6400-cores) and [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/?generation=GeForce+50&amp;sort=generation). Let's dive into some thoughts:

* For Ada, the fully unlocked AD102 die never released (I put a fake 4090 Ti in the charts in both posts to give some perspective), but yeah. The 4090 was cut down to \~89% of the full AD102, and the full leaks suggest that the 5090 might also be \~88.5% of the full GB202. Seems fair and leaves room for a TITAN BLACKWELL or 5090 Ti, which might or might not release. **I don't see competition from AMD so I find it difficult to believe in a 5090 Ti**. That die makes more money as an AI card.
* In my original post I highlighted the **MASSIVE** abyss between the 4090 core count and the 4080/4080S core count. Never did we get such a small fraction of the top die for so much money. The base 4080 had 52.8% of the cores of the full AD102 die, and the 4080S had 55.6%. For comparison, in Ampere (RTX 3xxx), the 3080 had 81% of the cores of the full die used in the 3090 Ti. In all honesty, that was an outlier, because the trend up until then (Maxwell 2.0, Pascal and Turing) all had their xx80 cards hovering at the 66.6% relative core count. Well... If you thought that the gap between 4080 and 4090 was massive, **then the rumored gap between 5080 and 5090 is EVEN LARGER. The 5080 is rumored to have 10752 cores, which is only 43.8% of the cores of the top die.** This puts the 5080 at the same ""cut down level"", or to say, it is as cut down as a 4070 Ti was when compared to its top die. **If we go back to Ampere, the 5080 is as cut down as a 3060 Ti was compared to the top Ampere die (!!!!!).**
* **The 5070 Ti has 36.5% of the cores of the top Blackwell die.** In past generations, getting roughly 33-36% of the top die was something that the 960 (33.3%), 1060 6GB (also 33.3%) and 3060 (also 33.3%) cards achieved. **This means that the 5070 Ti is almost as cut down as previous generations xx60 cards.**
* **The RTX 5070 is 26% of the full die**, putting it in the range of previous generations RTX 4060 Ti (which was already a big disappointment as per my original post, at 23.6% of its top die) and brace for it... **the 5070 seems to be almost as cut down as an RTX 3050 (23.8%).**

&amp;#x200B;

So, it seems despite the newer generations increasing the total amount of raw CUDA cores that are possible to manufacture and put on a chip, we're getting less and less of a fraction of these node/tech advancements.

Here's the chart with some guiding lines to try and show some trend. I've been liberal in placing xx80 Ti cards as replacement for xx90 cards in past generations because there never was a 990, 1090 or 2090 card, despite there being TITANs, they would be the modern equivalent of a xx90 Ti. In case there are base and SUPER versions of the same card, I tried putting the trendline in the middle between them.

Unless Blackwell proves to be a revolutionary architecture generation (difficult, it is on the same node as Ada), then I can see really meh performance gains for the lower end. Pricing will dictate everything, and also, consumer feedback. We actually do have SOME power (remember the unreleased 4080 12GB?) in regards to product segmentation!

I'll update these charts with the Relative Performance database once these cards are out as TechPowerUp provides raw data.

pcgaming,"Windows 11 - turn ""Automatic Colour Management"" off","!!!This only tip works if you have a screen that is able to display colours beyond the sRGB range - those are 10+ bit IPS/OLED panels.

Simply go to display -&gt; Color and you'll see it as the toggable setting. Switch it off and all colours will look a bit more vibrant.

You can test this by looking at an image of something bright and red - such as a fire hydrant. The image will be a bit more vivid with ACM off.

What ACM essentially does is, it analyses the display's native Color profile and tone-maps the image sent to the display in such a way as to ""emulate"" the sRBG colour space in an attempt to ""trick"" the display - that is by compressing the brightest and darkest colors, and by reducing Color vibrancy to fit the standard colour range for internet pages, etc. This would be great if the monitor itself weren't doing a double-conversion back into its native Color space unless it's specifically set to ""sRGB mode"" in its OSD menu - and as you'll quickly notice sRBG mode just looks bad. This double conversion results in dull colors, reduced contrast and crushed blacks.

Some have died, some have grown apart, some dont play multiplayer games much, some quit playing all together. I miss those days though, made a lot of good friends over the years. 

However most games now a days are matchmaking, you see some guys once for 30 - 40 mins and thats it.

I play a lot of games with matchmaking like deadlock, valorant, apex, etc... Ive seen people make friends on these games and Ive tried, but very rarely does it turn into anything.

pcgaming,I'm very impressed with how good remote play has become,"When Resident Evil 7 came out, I bought a Steam Link with the plans to stream it to a TV and despite the PC being 10ft line-of-sight from router, and then the router 6ft wired to the Steam Link, it was a nonstarter and I shelved the Steam Link. It could not maintain any smoothness at all, and it was a crashfest.

I revisited remote play with the Deck and I was surprised how consistent it could be. Pulling out my Steam Link again, I set it up in the living room and honestly? Not as good as a couple feet from my PC monitor, but 12ft back on a couch looks great besides some loss of dynamic range. And this is with a good 40ft, a floor, and a concrete wall between Link and router.

I beat a few games this year this way and I had a great time.

pcgaming,BACKROOMS 0 - Announcement Trailer - A psychological horror walking simulator set in an abandoned office complex. No monsters. No jumpscares.,"Hello everyone,

I've been working on creating a **psychological horror game that focuses purely on atmosphere** \- a vast abandoned office complex with repeating yellow corridors, humming fluorescent lights, and your camcorder. This is my take on the Backrooms.

The Backrooms represents one of the internet's most fascinating horror concepts - **a vast maze of empty office rooms** that exists just outside our reality, where people can accidentally 'noclip' into and find themselves trapped. Something about these empty spaces gets under everyone's skin.

**No monsters, no jumpscares** \- just pure environmental horror where the very absence of threat becomes unsettling. The game creates tension through architecture, sound design, and the feeling of being lost in a vast abandoned building.

**We are happy to announce that our game is now in early access!** 

Sprite's Honor is a cozy and cutesy, colony sim set in a fantasy Fairy world. In the game, you're shipwrecked on an island and have to farm and ranch (once they've hatched!) the seedling creatures to stop the no good gnomes and leave the Island. While managing scout mates, you can get to know them better and learn about their lives back home.

This is our first ever released game so we are super excited (and nervous!) and greatly appreciate you checking it out.

*(The game is currently in Early Access as we would like to be able to shape it based on player feedback, polish it, and add in controller support!)*

pcgaming,Thoughts on a completely new Game of Thrones game? ,"So I‚Äôm a massive fan of game of thrones series but overall dragons are so cool to me. Now there are many dragon games like Day of Dragons, ARK and so on. But I think we need a massive open world game where we have a detailed campaign as long as a coop/multiplayer.  Ability to find dragon eggs around the map and then waiting for them to hatch and train the dragon and so on. Have the ability to ride the dragon and just fly around in a detailed and nice open world üåç.  Now ik there is a game of thrones game but tbh I hate it and it‚Äôs not good.  Need a modern graphic game made üî•üî•

Would be cool to even have game of thrones dragons in the game as well, even house of dragons as well.

pcgaming,[Health?] I physically cannot play UE5 games,"Here's a weird one, and I hope someone else is out there with similar symptoms.

Every time I try to play a realistic-looking game, I get so... tired. I just forced/struggled myself to a few hours of Stalker 2, and confirmed it. It happens whenever I play games that are not stylised, pixelated and whatnot. If it looks realistic, I get fatigued: my eyes get teary and try to close, my brain turns off, heart rate lowers... 

It might sound weird, but it happens 100% of the time. It sucks, as I really want to play some of those games. It's not a performance thing either, as I have a 14th gen i7 with a 4080 and an expensive HDR monitor. It also happens with my PS5 on the TV.

pcgaming,For fans of Hollow Knight and Blasphemous ‚Äì Volkolak: The Will of Gods is here to ruin your day,"If you thought Hollow Knight‚Äôs Soul Tyrant was bad, or Blasphemous‚Äô Esdras made you question your life choices, wait until you meet Volkolak: The Will of Gods. This Metroidvania doesn‚Äôt just test your skills, it actively judges you for every wrong parry and missed transformation.

But this isn‚Äôt just another hardcore platformer. The Volkolak transformation system lets you shape your playstyle and story: stay human, wield the power of pagan gods, or let the curse take over entirely. Add in hand-drawn frames and a combat system built for perfectionists, and you‚Äôve got a challenge that‚Äôs as rewarding as it is brutal.

If you feel like testing your patience, I invite you to [check out the free demo that is available right now on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499040/Volkolak_The_Will_of_Gods/). Let me know how it went and what do you think!

pcgaming,hogwarts legacy is actually REALLY good,"honestly, this is one of those games that i see in the store, think ""oh cool, looks like a nice game to play"", and then after playing it i start to realize ""HOLY SHIT, this is actually a REALLY REALLY good game, wow. holy fuck""

there's many reasons why it's such a good game in my opinion

first of all, if you like harry potter and wizardry/magic themed stuff, you will definitely like this game

you essentially get to create your own character and name them, this is your avatar that you play with throughout the game

then you find yourself enrolled as a student in hogwarts

yes, you are a wizard that is attending the school of hogwarts, to fine tune your skills in wizardry

part of the challenge of the game is that you SHOULD be a good student

if you want to be a reckless student that fucks off in the back of the class, doesn't learn anything, causes trouble, you can certainly play the game that way

but if you want to actually learn something, then you should be a good student

you should go to class, listen to the professors, etc

once you're no longer in class, you have the opportunity to do other quests. either within the castle of hogwarts or outside of the castle

that's another thing, hogwarts is very BIG, so just walking through the halls of the castle makes you feel like an important student of wizardry

you also get to see other students walking through the halls as well, talking and discussing about unimportant matters or what have you

you as a higher level student have more important matters to attend to so you go about your business accordingly

you also develop a bond with your professors and get to know them well

in particular, the herbology professor is very nice. she reminds me of some of my professors i had when i was in university in real life

she is a very nice lady that teaches you very good information on herbology

for you to cross these professors and make them disappointed in you would be very bad. it depends though, at least for me i find the herbology professor to be a very nice professor, so i wouldn't want her to be disappointed with me as a student

overall the point i'm trying to make is that the way i like to play the game is i take my magic studies seriously

the world is very whacky, all sorts of things can happen. it's the harry potter world, so people can make objects disappear, there are spells that set you on fire, cause you to fly, and cause objects to phase into and out of existence

this is a very incredible world that you are in and you have to be aware of the different things that can go wrong or go in your favor as you are exploring and doing quests

in short, there is really a lot to do in this game

hogwarts is huge, there's always new things you will run into as you are walking through the halls

i will say that this is a pretty good game

once i graduate from hogwarts i will feel very satisfied

another thing i like to do is dress for the occasion

so if i'm attending classes for the day i make sure my clothing is a proper school cloak and uniform

once class is over for the day and i am exploring outside of the castle or going to Hogsmeade, i change into more casual attire, maybe even put on a sorcerer's hat

it's all about dressing for the proper environment

you wouldn't go to class in real life wearing a trench coat and a top hat would you? probably not. so why would you do that in this game? exactly, that's how you should think about it

and one last thing i will say is that if this game were possible to play in a full dive virtual reality setting, it would be pretty epic

walking outside the castle really produces some cool sights that would pretty epic to see if you were physically standing there

it would be a scary situation though, given that in a world like that, someone could cause you to vanish into thin air or light you on fire with magic

just something to think about",nervomelbye,1gxkybx,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,2024-11-22 23:02:01,0,0.28,0,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gxkybx

pcgaming,Handheld gaming PC comparison table I made to compare Steam Deck and 35+ alternatives on their specs and features,"Hi, I did a deep dive into handheld gaming PC's, and created a pretty comprehensive comparison table that I hope some of you might find useful:

[https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/)

It's got every handheld gaming PC available right now (that I could find), and allows you to compare all of them on their specifications and features; from display specs, CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD, built in sensors, connectivity, ports, battery, available buttons and inputs, physical specs like size/weight/available colors, and more.

There's options to filter the table on specs or features, too. So you can for instance filter on screen size, resolution, refresh rate, whether it's got a trackpad, gyro controls, detachable controllers, or a built-in keyboard, etc.

You can also sort columns. So for instance, to easily find the cheapest handheld that has the specs you're filtering for, you can sort the table on the price (MSRP) column.

Also, if you want to compare aby two models side-by-side, there's a separate tool available for that. So for instance, if you want to compare the Zotac Zone vs the Asus ROG Ally X: [https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs) \- and you can use the checkbox for 'Differences only' to only show the specs/features with differences.

Other than that, I've made sure to apply conditional formatting to most specs, to make it visually clear what the pros and cons of each model are.

There's also a size comparison image of some of the most popular options if you scroll past the table.

Let me know if you have any feedback! It's totally possible I've made a mistake somewhere, or missed a product or spec that could be interesting to add. I'm considering adding benchmarks to the table as well, but am not sure which ones would be best to use in this case - and if there's data for all or most of these handhelds? If anyone has thoughts on that, let me know!",CookieDelivery,1gv5y1x,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,2024-11-19 19:41:27,121,0.91,121,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gv5y1x

pcgaming,8 Years on and 0 lessons learned. Another swing and a miss for Frontier with Planet Coaster 2 - and barely anyone is talking about the broken state of the game.,"Frontier has once again excelled at creating a pretty Sandbox. Unfortunately, there's supposed to be a Theme-Park management game behind this and it's hard to believe that they learned zero lessons from their failures with Planet Coaster back in 2016.  

With a meaty update coming in December that promises to fix only some of the most egregious concerns, I really can't see how this game will maintain any kind of longevity, but with that little preamble let's start tearing apart this carcass for the juicy, gossipy flesh.  

---  

**As a game, it is completely and utterly broken.** We all know these games, right? Put rides down, put shops down, connect them all together with paths and scenery to balance your guests needs and hire a roster of staff to keep everything running. A simple enough premise.  

Planet Coaster 2 falls completely flat on its face. Both the guest *and* staff systems are utterly broken, but scandalously, they work *just well enough* to pass the sniff test with the Play Testers &amp; reviewers before release.  

**How is it broken?** You might ask, shall we start with the staff? 

* Rides will degrade less than an hour after placing them.
* Janitors ignore overflowing bins
* Mechanics ignore broken down rides
* Mechanics ignore ride and facilities maintenance 
* Rides degrade *minutes* after placing them down and need maintenance, but the Mechanics are too busy wandering around ""looking for work"".
* Ride operators and shop vendors leave to go on break without waiting for the person who's supposed to relieve them to even show up, suddenly leaving gaps in operations.  

**What about the guests?** The logic for these guys is completely busted. 

* If a coaster has a capacity of 32 guests, when the queue has 31 guests in it, nobody else will queue up, thinking ""That queue is too long"". They will walk up to the queue and do a 180 and walk away.
* Guests will be dying to use a toilet, and walk to the opposite end of the park, even though there's a toilet next to them. 
* If you open the park and place one tiny teacups ride down, it will attract thousands of guests.
* If you have a mix of water park slides and rollercoasters in your park, every guest will flip-flop into all wanting to go on one, or the other. But they'll all buy pool-passes despite not needing them.  
* Guests will drop trash on the floor even if there's an available trash bin nearby.  
* If there's too many rides, guests just won't use pools and flumes at all.  
* Still no guest wandering mechanics. They just move in a straight beeline from A to B.
* Major guest congestion issues. It's not uncommon to see 300 guests all mashing against each other in a mosh-pit  
* They added weather but it appears to be cosmetic and doesn't affect guest riding decisions.  
* They added picnic benches but guests won't sit down and eat. In fact, I've not seen any guests sitting down and eating on anything.  

---  

So yes, you can build rides, spend an hour creating the perfect station, filling in all the scenery, adding shops and weaving paths around. *But the actual, core aspect of the game just doesn't work*. There's no management here, it is just a glorified sandbox with a piss-poor campaign and completely broken staff and guest system.  

Avoid, and even then think twice if/when they fix it, because releasing a game as broken as this should not be rewarded with sales.",Chaoslava,1gu48ts,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,2024-11-18 13:05:20,449,0.89,449,0,148,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gu48ts

pcgaming,So how did Quantic Dream create the amazing character models in Detroit?,"Probably the only game that has gotten closest to realism as far as character designs go.

Senua's Saga looked good but it still looked akward at times especially the expressions.

Tiny facial movements and emotions can actually be read in the game and I find it truly remarkable that the developers are able to render all of that in real time. 

Is it because of the linearity?

I was thinking why can't every dev go with the same design when it comes to rendering human characters.

Pretty amazing what they did with the game.

pcgaming,Detroit: Become Human on PC,"Just bought it at $11.99 and I have to say it's quite a steal.

The short episode format is perfect and it definitely promotes replayability.

The acting and character renders are one of the best I've seen in a video game.

Visuals are stunning at 4k with the image resolution doubled (so basically 8k?).

Performance is pretty steady keeping the framerates close to 60fps most of the time.

It's like playing an interactive dystopian scifi novel.

No wonder the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews.

I kind of find a sense of fulfillment when missing on these types of games and eventually finding it.

Just wanted to share and I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

When I saw the announcement last week that ""Episode 1 and 2 are now included with the base game on Steam"" I thought - what the hell? Wasn't it like this the whole time? 

No. HL2 is standalone, and Episode 1 and 2 are extra content.

I legit thought for nearly 15 years that Episode 1 was the first segment of the game, kinda like Life is Strange or other episodic games, and when you buy HL2 on Steam you get all the episodes released. I thought it was the reason people were pissed about Episode 3, because the game was never actually finished.

pcgaming,"Hi folks!  I'm making Kitchen Sync: Aloha!, a cooking strategy RPG, inspired by a mashup of Overcooked and Fire Emblem.  There's a free demo update on Steam for Cooking Fest!","Hi¬†r/pcgaming! I'm the developer for Kitchen Sync: Aloha!, a cozy cooking RPG set in Hawaii.  My game is currently featured in the Steam Cooking Fest with a free demo and wanted to make sure fans of cooking games and quirky strategy games know about it!

Steam Page, Trailer, and Demo:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333930/Kitchen\_Sync\_Aloha/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333930/Kitchen_Sync_Aloha/)

I've always been a fan of cooking games and tactical RPGs, and wanted to try mashing up my favorite parts of each genre.

* üç≥ Take on the role of head chef of your family's pop-up restaurant. Rather than cooking everything yourself, issue orders to your team of chefs in your kitchen.  Deliver food tasty enough to clear your customer's Hunger Points (HP) and satisfy all your guests before running out of time. The game automatically pauses whenever your chefs need direction, giving the game a laid back, turn based tactics feel.
* üåü Kitchen planning with strategic depth.  Fine tune your chefs' builds with ability trees and learnable skills, and combine them with specialized menus, kitchen layouts, and team skills to make your restaurant the best around.  Optimize for certain flavors, build in synergies between your chefs, go all in on a powerful special ability, or keep it casual and randomize it all.  It's up to you!
* üíû Chefs build relationships when paired together - whether or not they're the player's character! Each pairing leads to friendships or even romantic endings, unlocking a ton of unique dialogue scenes, side quests, and special abilities for your favorite characters.  If you're familiar with the support system from Fire Emblem/Unicorn overlord and other tactical RPGs this will feel familiar!
* üó∫Ô∏è Master dozens of different kitchen layouts around the Hawaiian Island of Maikai. Beaches, backyards, resorts, malls, and more, each with different challenges.  Like Overcooked or Plate Up, even small changes in layout or menu mean a big difference when efficiently moving around the kitchen and wasting as little time as possible.
* üêü Take a break between levels with minigames like fishing and hiking.

Kitchen Sync's demo was previously featured this year in the Wholesome Games Festival, the PixElated Festival, and the Seattle Indie Expo, and player feedback has been incorporated along the way to make the game even better. For this event, the game's gotten an entire UI overhaul and new tutorials to make getting started as easy as possible.

If you're a fan of cooking games and/or strategy RPGs, I'd love for you to give the demo a try and let me know what you think either here or on our discord! Wishlist are also always helpful!

The game will be skipping early access and go straight to a full launch, planned next year.

pcgaming,How is no developer making a Bethesda-Equivalent RPG (a la Skyrim) but updated/less buggy/less complacent?,"Skyrim was a great (although flawed) game but it's been so long since it was released that it's incredibly dated, and the intervening releases from Bethesda across its IPs have depleted a lot of the trust in the fan base. So it seems that the first person, sword and magic (or sneak and bow) open world RPG genre would be ripe for competition. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't really see any alternatives in the offing.

Conversely, there seems to be an insane amount of competition in the Soulslike genre (the very name of the genre gives away how many titles have attempted to supplant Fromsoft). Why would you attempt to follow up one of the sharpest developers with an imitation that almost certainly won't measure up to the Souls games or Elden Ring (in my opinion one of the greatest games ever made, and I'm not really a Soulslike fan)? Where's all this effort in the Skyslike arena?

I really just wish there were an updated, cutting edge open world fantasy RPG that would be the next generational timesink, having the added benefit of forcing Bethesda to not just phone it in with their own IPs.",lakadazakal,1gtla4a,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gtla4a/how_is_no_developer_making_a_bethesdaequivalent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gtla4a/how_is_no_developer_making_a_bethesdaequivalent/,2024-11-17 19:20:55,0,0.49,0,0,218,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gtla4a
