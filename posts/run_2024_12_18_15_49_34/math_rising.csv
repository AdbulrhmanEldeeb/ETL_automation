math,US vs EU (Bonn) graduate progams,"I've been looking at the course offerings for the first two 'masters' years of a standard US maths PhD and comparing them to courses offered at a top European university, specifically the University of Bonn. I'm a prospective maths grad student.

It looks to me that there are significantly more courses and many more advanced courses, at Bonn when compared to US universities. Here is the [course handbook of Bonn](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/studium/medienordner-studium-1/dateien/po-modulhandbuch/mscmath-modulhandbuch.pdf). Finding course schedules for US schools is a bit more difficult, but generally I see fewer options.

Is this an accurate representation of the difference in course offerings of top math graduate schools in the EU vs US? Is Bonn an outlier for this? If this is true, is this reflected in the knowledge of successful masters and PhD candidates in the EU vs US?",Infinity_Crisis,1hgzfw7,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hgzfw7/us_vs_eu_bonn_graduate_progams/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hgzfw7/us_vs_eu_bonn_graduate_progams/,2024-12-18 11:16:38,27,0.83,27,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hgzfw7

I was nervous about taking Real Analysis because it has a reputation if being really difficult and a lot of people at my university have had to retake it.

math,What do you think of abbreviations?,"When I'm doing calculations and during lectures, I find it convenient to use common abbreviations like 'iff' and 'wlog' so that I have to write less. I'm curious about what others think about these in formal writing. Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with the usage of such abbreviations in somebody's arxiv work, and I feel I could even adjust to seeing these in formal publications, though it would be necessary to have a grace period where papers included a terminology section clarifying abbreviations or something like that. Do you feel similarly to me? If you disagree, do you have strong feelings about this, or is it just a stylistic preference?

math,Learning advice,"Hi all. 

I’m 32 years old, mechanical engineering student. The last time I study math was probably 12 years before committing to the course in September this year. This is the first year and I have huge doubts if I’m capable of making it. 

I never been good at math, poor teaching, poor resources etc., and at some point I gave up even trying.

I have big math test tomorrow that I know I fail. There is no doubt about it. There will be one last chance in May, but other than that, that’s it. 

The test tomorrow will cover subjects such as functions, vectors, complex numbers, matrices, differation, integration and statistics. 

I’m fairly comfortable with matrices, statistics and vectors. 

It just feels from the begging of the course like I’m lacking basic knowledge to even progress further, and that demotivating feeling of failure keeps me company from the very start. 

Fact that I’m study in English, not being native English speaker probably makes things more complicated as well. 

I’m seriously considering withdrawing or switching to the different course because of that, actually this is one of the many reasons but weights the most. 

How would you recommend approaching this? Should I give up on test tomorrow and take a huge step back?

math,integral shaped pillow,This is an odd request but I figured I'd reach the most math people here- anyone know where I can buy a pillow (preferably body sized pillow) shaped like an integral?

math,Is it possible for a probabilistic operation of an infinite set to produce a finite set?,"I think my question is the general case of something more specific I have in mind, which is:

If I have a fully connected graph of infinite nodes and I probabilistically remove edges across the graph (any number of times), is it possible to have at least one node end up with a finite number of edges?

My intuition says it is not possible, but math can be wonderfully strange so I thought I would ask.",tgillet1,1hgmbk8,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hgmbk8/is_it_possible_for_a_probabilistic_operation_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hgmbk8/is_it_possible_for_a_probabilistic_operation_of/,2024-12-17 22:12:22,20,0.83,20,0,53,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hgmbk8
