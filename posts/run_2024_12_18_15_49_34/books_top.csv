books,Throne of Glass is horrendous. How has it sold over 25m?,"Sometimes I love to read books that are easy going, nothing high brow, the equivalent of a Big Mac for the brain. I’m currently reading Sarah J. Maas’s Throne of Glass for a number of reasons. I’m an English teacher and some of my kids have said they’re reading it, so I wanted to be able to talk to them about it. I’m also 3 months post partum and when I was pregnant I bought the series thinking it’d be something that would keep me reading but not take too much brain power. I’m almost finished the  first book, Throne of Glass, and honestly don’t know how it was published as is. It feels like it needs at least one more redraft to make it even readable, not even good. None of the characters have distinct personalities, the dialogue is so unrealistic and awkward, the action is slow, to name a few issues I have with it. It’s shockingly bad. In a time when the majority of the kids I teach don’t read for enjoyment at all, I’m glad they’re reading something, but this is honestly so poor I wonder are they even better off? (Edit #2: this comment was me being flippant. Of course they’re better off reading this than not at all!) I will finish this book, just because I hate to leave a book unfinished, but will definitely be DNFing the series. It’s a chore to pick the thing up to read, I’m looking forward to getting it finished and getting stuck into something decent. 

Edit: ok I did not expect this to get so much traction, I can’t keep up with the comments! Some points though: 
- I totally understand that people have different tastes and I have no expectation that everything that gets published has to be ‘high brow’. I love a good fluff read as much as the next person! 
- Maas was 16 when she started writing this, and more power to her for that, but it wasn’t published until her mid 20s. My question is how she or an editor/publisher didn’t think it could be polished/redrafted a bit more at that point. 
- a lot of people saying give the series to the third book and it gets way better. I might take a break from it and come back. I’m a bit of a mood reader unless I’m hooked on a series, so I’ll see how this one ends before I decide to DNF the series.

books,"Well-known books with bizarre, disturbing and unnecessary sequences?","
Warning - reference to underage sex below.

I have been trying to think of books to read my 12yo son, and Bryce Courtenay’s ‘The Power of One’ popped into my head. I remember enjoying it when I was a kid, 30 years ago.

I decided to revisit it first to make sure it was suitable. 

I had no memory of a character called Big Hettie, who is this fleeting maternal figure earlier in the book. She is obese and has an eating disorder, which the author stresses to the point of absurdity, with her whipping out whole roast chickens and gorging on them. Ultimately, after really hammering home yet again how fat and smelly she is, the author has her fall over on a train and get stuck like a beached whale. And then she dies, unable to be freed by the conductors.

It’s such a strange section in the book and seems to add nothing of value, and just feels cruel and disturbing.

This got me thinking of sequences in other books that struck me as not just unnecessary but disturbing and poorly conceived. 

The only other one that came to mind was the infamous 11 year olds having group sex in the sewer to restore their supernatural powers/bond scene in Stephen King’s IT. I’ve read literary justifications and analysis and think they’re a bunch of hogwash. It was flat out stupid and should never have been included. 

I’m curious if anyone has any other examples?",MenuSpiritual2990,1hgzx7s,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgzx7s/wellknown_books_with_bizarre_disturbing_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgzx7s/wellknown_books_with_bizarre_disturbing_and/,2024-12-18 11:51:54,135,0.83,135,0,285,0,0,False,False,True,True,True,,nsfw,t3_1hgzx7s
books,I feel that reading Albert Camus is smoother than Kafka.,"I've noticed that I can read Albert Camus's works with much more ease compared to Franz Kafka's. With Camus, the reading feels fluid and straightforward, while Kafka's writing often feels dense or harder to process. Is it just a stylistic difference, or does it have something to do with their philosophies, themes, or even translation nuances?

Ive read the trial, metamorphosis and letter to his father. When compared to the stranger (in which i'm currently reading) I feel as though it's easier. Initially, I thought it was due to Kafka being german-translated. But Camus is french-translated no? Albert Camus has a more simplistic, straight to the point, descriptive style in my opinion.

I'd love to hear others' thoughts on this!",nasescob4r,1hgp0hv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgp0hv/i_feel_that_reading_albert_camus_is_smoother_than/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgp0hv/i_feel_that_reading_albert_camus_is_smoother_than/,2024-12-18 00:17:43,92,0.83,92,0,40,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgp0hv
books,I love books where the main character dies,"Obviously noooo don’t recommend books that do this because that’s a huge spoiler we just gotta find them on our own which kinda makes it even better because it’s so unexpected.

There’s not many books where the main character dies I’m trying really hard right now to think of how many books I’ve read where this has happened and I think it’s only like 2 I’m not quite sure.

I love it because usually the plot armor is so strong with the main character to the point where you don’t even believe their life is ever in any true danger. I mean the stakes can be so so high and it’ll be like well they’re gonna get out of this situation somehow idk how but they will they’re definitely not gonna get killed off they can’t because it’s the main character there’s no story without them. I mean maybe they’re gonna get seriously injured and some beloved side character is gonna die but definitely not the main character.

So when the main character dies?! Of course heart broken but also complete and utter shock which when you read a lot it takes a lot to shock you because you get used to the patterns of different genres and are like I can guess how this is gonna go I’ve read a book similar to this before because nothing is completely original everything is inspired but something else.

But very few books dare to go the route of killing of the main character because it’s an insane thing to do it’s putting a complete and final also sad ending to the book. There won’t be a sequel, the bad guys probably win, and all the side characters are sad. It’s a sh*t ending right? But I LOVE it! 

If I were to ever write a book I’d definitely kill off the main character because no one would see it coming.

I don’t want this to become a popular thing in books because then it wouldn’t be so unexpected right like it’s better as a hidden gem but anyways here’s some silent appreciation for the books that kill off the main character.",MooMooTheDummy,1hgw3jx,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgw3jx/i_love_books_where_the_main_character_dies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgw3jx/i_love_books_where_the_main_character_dies/,2024-12-18 06:59:43,48,0.78,48,0,49,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgw3jx
books,"The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is such an amazing book, so full of wisdom.","I was thinking about books I've enjoyed reading and recall the first time I read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran. I was in a bad place emotionally and a friend recommended it. I said that's not the kind of book I enjoy reading and I don't need another book that offers 'spiritual"" guidance or wisdom or whatever. My friend insisted.

I began reading it on and off and slowly began to take an interest in it, rereading some passages, even thinking about them at random times, like while doing the dishes or watching a movie.

I still go back to the book and find it quite valuable. You don't have to think of it as offering wisdom either, I mean it's just another way of looking at life that may be new to you and help see things differently. Some people will probably connect with it more than others, and you probably need to read this at the right time in your life, but it's just such a wonderful little book to have around. And it's written in beautiful, poetic language.

I'll just post a couple of quotes.

“Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself”

""We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us. Even while the earth sleeps we travel. We are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered.”

“You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts; And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime. And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.”",crawthumper,1hgxs9k,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgxs9k/the_prophet_by_kahlil_gibran_is_such_an_amazing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgxs9k/the_prophet_by_kahlil_gibran_is_such_an_amazing/,2024-12-18 09:08:34,36,0.8,36,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgxs9k

4. A classic novel - Right now it's War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells because I've been on a sci-fi kick.

books,Revisiting The Waves by Virginia Woolf,"I’ve been listening to this on Spotify (I actually had no idea how many books were on there?) because audiobooks have become my favorite way to revisit books I really liked. I think I love it even more the second time.

I feel like Virginia Woolf wrote books for people who feel too many things and get overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of feelings (me) and this is my favorite one besides maybe *Between the Acts*. It took me a while to get used to the *no plot just feelings and beautiful words* vibes of her books but once I did they became SO fascinating to me.

Also, the way the characters kind of exist collectively as a unit made me think about the concept of chakras, and I really like thinking of each of seven main characters as embodying one of the chakras. (In my mind this means Percival as the Root Chakra, Jinny as Sacral, Susan as Solar Plexus, Bernard as heart, Neville as throat, Louis as Third Eye and Rhoda as Crown.) It makes for a really interesting lens to consider the book through, imo.",notthemostcreative,1hgpl9w,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgpl9w/revisiting_the_waves_by_virginia_woolf/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgpl9w/revisiting_the_waves_by_virginia_woolf/,2024-12-18 00:46:51,24,0.91,24,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgpl9w
books,How do you read glued hardback books comfortably?,"Hello Reddit,

I'm currently unsure wether I'm cognitively disadvantaged or if this is a real topic to be talked about. Most of my books (both hardcover and paperback, mostly from the US or Germany) lay perfectly flat when placed on a table, but now I started collecting books from the UK and noticed they have very stiff pages that stand up like a hedgehog and the books shuts close when I let go off it.

Am I doing something wrong or do you really have to hold it with both hands to read it comfortably?
