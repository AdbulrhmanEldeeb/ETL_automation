It reminds me of the old saying that goes: ‘Never insult (or throw rocks at) a man with a gun” or something like that. So I can’t help but wonder why he did that even despite having been shot by Tommy previously.

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1236089195/):

&gt;It certainly possesses enough of the requisite frenetic action sequences and silly jokes to keep small fry entertained while not boring their adult chaperones.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-times-two-overly-frenetic-sequel-to-video-game-turned-hit-movie-franchise-1236209424/):

&gt;

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-1236250284/):

&gt;“Sonic 3” gives hyperactivity a good name. Jeff Fowler, who directed all three of these movies, is a quicker and wittier flimflam magician of energy than he was when he made the first “Sonic” in 2020.


[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review/) (8/10):

&gt;The weaker elements of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 feel unimportant in the wake of an entertaining time that will no doubt thrill audiences of all ages.

[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review) (4/5)

&gt;Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow. Between this year's games and film, Sonic's shining bright with Shadow in tow.


[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1741398/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (7.5/10):

&gt;The outcome is a ""Sonic"" movie that feels like everything fans love about the games distilled into a film that's fast, flashy, a hell of a lot of fun, and boasts an absolute banger of a soundtrack.

[The Irish Times] (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2024/12/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-a-hunk-of-good-honest-rubbish-for-the-festive-season/) (3/5):

&gt;Carrey’s antic madness – elsewhere often too much to digest – is just what the Sonic films needed to balance out the digital gloss.

[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (3/5):

&gt;Should Carrey, who has consistently hinted at retirement plans, decide not to return for Sonic 4, this will certainly be a fine trilogy capper.

[Screen Daily] (https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/5200227.article):

&gt;Whether it’s Jim Carrey playing not one but two supervillains, or the introduction of even more supporting characters, Sonic 3 wears out its welcome, resulting in an entertaining but exhausting affair.


[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba) (6/10):

&gt;Against all odds, the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go.


[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-supplies-laughs-and-energy-for-hedgehog-threequel) (3/5):

&gt;While no one could deny the cash-grab fan-service underpinning to the entire project … well, it’s actually a not unenjoyable experience, even if you are someone on whom the intricacies of early-00s game narrative are lost.

[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-1235078147/) (D):

&gt;It might be enough to entertain young children or diehard SEGA loyalists, but the rest of us are left to lament that the running time isn’t as fast as its blue protagonist.



**Synopsis**:

movies,The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano changed my entire view of Tom Hanks. ,"I grew up knowing Tom hanks from Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, Toy Story, You’ve got mail, saving private Ryan. He was a staple in my household and one of the first movie stars I admired. But for some reason my early mind couldn’t come to accept his early films. 

I saw numerous times the vhs boxes for The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano at the rental store and always created in my head the reasons these weren’t movies for me. I think it was chaos on the covers. I just got a sense they weren’t made for me at that age and I wouldn’t appreciate them. And in a way I was right and in a way I’m beyond glad I waited to age up before I watched them for the first time. 

You are never surprised watching early hanks movies that he became what he did but at times your disappointed that beyond snl appearances that he focused on dramas. There is a rare blend of grounded humanism and over the top performances in these two films that I feel was lightning in a bottle. 

As a Joe Dante fan I have to say other than gremlins 2 and perhaps beyond it felt like the movie most representing the distillation of his spirit as a filmmaker. The cast is top to bottom perfect. It felt like both a love letter to late 50s early 60s tv like Ozzie and Harriett, leave it to beaver, the munsters and 80s hijinks comedies while altogether becoming its own thing. 

 Tom Hanks masters over the top comedy in this movie. I’ve never seen anything like it, his outbursts, monologues, and physical comedy are unmatched in their ability to play to the levels of gonzo Joe Dante asks of him while simultaneously feeling endearing and believable. Which leads to the reason the ending was changed from a twilight zone like twist to a double twist where he HAS to win in the end. But albeit in the wrong way. 

Also props to Bruce Dern, I don’t know how he ended up in this movie but I’m damn glad he did. What a driving force and “straight man” if this movie could even have one.

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mufasa) 59% (78 Reviews)

&gt;Barry Jenkins' deft hand and Lin-Manuel Miranda's music go some way towards squaring the Circle of Life in Mufasa, but this fitfully soulful story is ill-served by its impersonal, photorealistic animation style.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mufasa-the-lion-king/):  58 (36 Reviews)


**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1236087876/):

&gt;With a solid gang, Mufasa conforms to a typical journey of misfits. But that charm from the early scenes is lost with the addition of each new plot point.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-turns-origin-story-into-rousing-action-adventure-buddy-movie-1236205310/):

&gt;Though James Earl Jones is impossible to follow, these voice actors give it all a game try.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-1236250945/):

&gt;Jenkins has not sold out; rather, the studio bought into his vision, which respects the 1994 film and recognizes the significance that its role models and life lessons have served for young audiences.

[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-disney-prequel-xfksllzbq) (5/5) :

&gt;Disney has gone back to the drawing board with this dazzling animated musical, a film that matches photorealistic spectacle with hummable earworms and, mostly, a genuinely mythic sense of story.

[RogerEbert.com] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (3.5/4):

&gt;“Mufasa” never quite bursts free of the constraints placed upon it, but those constraints never stop it from moving, or from being moving.


[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-beyonce-donald-glover-barry-jenkins) (8/10):

&gt;Barry Jenkins’ Mufasa is a strong, uncomplicated effort that should charm kids. The Moonlight directors involvement in a CGI-heavey Disney prequel caused serious film lovers to wring their hands, but the results speak for themselves: This is simply a lovely movie.

[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/):

&gt;It’s in little danger of becoming a classic but it’s gratifying to know that Barry Jenkins made this film his own, telling a fine story with genuine emotion and visual aplomb.

[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/17/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/77020873007/) (3/4):

&gt;Thanks to Jenkins’ inimitable grace and Miranda’s tuneful swagger, it continues to feel vibrant.

[Chicago Sun-Times] (https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/12/17/mufasa-review-lion-king-disney) (3/4):

&gt;The voice work from the outstanding cast is rich and warm and vibrant, and while the songs from the great Lin-Manuel Miranda (with Lebo M. making valuable contributions) might not make for a generational catalog, they’re still infectious and clever.

[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/) (7/10):

&gt;Even with a few flaws, Barry Jenkins' Mufasa: The Lion King has enough heart and depth to stand on its own feet and surpass its 2019 predecessor.

[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235194304/):

&gt;We tell ourselves stories in order to live. Corporate movie studios tell you stories in order to keep their board happy and make their bottom line. Find the Venn diagram center between the two, and that’s where this Hakuna Matata 2.0 lies.

[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235077385/) (C+):

&gt;Mufasa has hidden charms that are arguably best described as Jenkins released straight to VHS.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king/) (3/5):

&gt;Barry Jenkins’ verve only faintly shines through in an origin story that is mildly, not wildly, entertaining.

[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (3/5):

&gt;It's no Hakuna Matata, that's for sure. And it's far from Jenkins' best work, but in any other hands, a lot of Mufasa's intentions would have completely misfired. Thankfully there are some stellar vocal performances and VFX – but it could have been so much better.

[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1740391/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5.5/10):

&gt;""Mufasa"" will satisfy, but it also feels ultimately useless. Like Disney is once again spinning its wheels, trying to wring billions of dollars out of old ideas while they brainstorm new ones. Fans of ""The Lion King"" may be slightly moved. At the very least, you'll finally know how Rafiki got his stick.

[Collider](https://collider.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5/10):

&gt;Fans of the franchise and younger generations will find a lot to like about Mufasa: The Lion King, but it's hard to imagine it will have a legacy comparable to the original animated classic that started it all.

[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241217-mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (2/5):

&gt;This series of unfortunate events raises more questions than it answers.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (2/5):

&gt;While Mufasa is never as actively depressing as 2019’s Dumbo or 2022’s Pinocchio, the exercise has perhaps never felt as craven or pointless as it does here.

[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lion-king-2-barry-jenkins-review-b2665329.html) (2/5):

&gt;Unfortunately, finding the Jenkins in Mufasa is like putting a blindfold on in the Louvre and trying to feel your way to the Mona Lisa.

**Synopsis**:

&gt;“Mufasa: The Lion King” enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny—their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.
