* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mufasa) 59% (78 Reviews)

&gt;Barry Jenkins' deft hand and Lin-Manuel Miranda's music go some way towards squaring the Circle of Life in Mufasa, but this fitfully soulful story is ill-served by its impersonal, photorealistic animation style.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mufasa-the-lion-king/):  58 (36 Reviews)


**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1236087876/):

&gt;With a solid gang, Mufasa conforms to a typical journey of misfits. But that charm from the early scenes is lost with the addition of each new plot point.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-turns-origin-story-into-rousing-action-adventure-buddy-movie-1236205310/):

&gt;Though James Earl Jones is impossible to follow, these voice actors give it all a game try.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-1236250945/):

&gt;Jenkins has not sold out; rather, the studio bought into his vision, which respects the 1994 film and recognizes the significance that its role models and life lessons have served for young audiences.

[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-disney-prequel-xfksllzbq) (5/5) :

&gt;Disney has gone back to the drawing board with this dazzling animated musical, a film that matches photorealistic spectacle with hummable earworms and, mostly, a genuinely mythic sense of story.

[RogerEbert.com] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (3.5/4):

&gt;“Mufasa” never quite bursts free of the constraints placed upon it, but those constraints never stop it from moving, or from being moving.


[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-beyonce-donald-glover-barry-jenkins) (8/10):

&gt;Barry Jenkins’ Mufasa is a strong, uncomplicated effort that should charm kids. The Moonlight directors involvement in a CGI-heavey Disney prequel caused serious film lovers to wring their hands, but the results speak for themselves: This is simply a lovely movie.

[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/):

&gt;It’s in little danger of becoming a classic but it’s gratifying to know that Barry Jenkins made this film his own, telling a fine story with genuine emotion and visual aplomb.

[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/17/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/77020873007/) (3/4):

&gt;Thanks to Jenkins’ inimitable grace and Miranda’s tuneful swagger, it continues to feel vibrant.

[Chicago Sun-Times] (https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/12/17/mufasa-review-lion-king-disney) (3/4):

&gt;The voice work from the outstanding cast is rich and warm and vibrant, and while the songs from the great Lin-Manuel Miranda (with Lebo M. making valuable contributions) might not make for a generational catalog, they’re still infectious and clever.

[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/) (7/10):

&gt;Even with a few flaws, Barry Jenkins' Mufasa: The Lion King has enough heart and depth to stand on its own feet and surpass its 2019 predecessor.

[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235194304/):

&gt;We tell ourselves stories in order to live. Corporate movie studios tell you stories in order to keep their board happy and make their bottom line. Find the Venn diagram center between the two, and that’s where this Hakuna Matata 2.0 lies.

[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235077385/) (C+):

&gt;Mufasa has hidden charms that are arguably best described as Jenkins released straight to VHS.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king/) (3/5):

&gt;Barry Jenkins’ verve only faintly shines through in an origin story that is mildly, not wildly, entertaining.

[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (3/5):

&gt;It's no Hakuna Matata, that's for sure. And it's far from Jenkins' best work, but in any other hands, a lot of Mufasa's intentions would have completely misfired. Thankfully there are some stellar vocal performances and VFX – but it could have been so much better.

[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1740391/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5.5/10):

&gt;""Mufasa"" will satisfy, but it also feels ultimately useless. Like Disney is once again spinning its wheels, trying to wring billions of dollars out of old ideas while they brainstorm new ones. Fans of ""The Lion King"" may be slightly moved. At the very least, you'll finally know how Rafiki got his stick.

[Collider](https://collider.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5/10):

&gt;Fans of the franchise and younger generations will find a lot to like about Mufasa: The Lion King, but it's hard to imagine it will have a legacy comparable to the original animated classic that started it all.

[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241217-mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (2/5):

&gt;This series of unfortunate events raises more questions than it answers.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (2/5):

&gt;While Mufasa is never as actively depressing as 2019’s Dumbo or 2022’s Pinocchio, the exercise has perhaps never felt as craven or pointless as it does here.

[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lion-king-2-barry-jenkins-review-b2665329.html) (2/5):

&gt;Unfortunately, finding the Jenkins in Mufasa is like putting a blindfold on in the Louvre and trying to feel your way to the Mona Lisa.

**Synopsis**:

&gt;“Mufasa: The Lion King” enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny—their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.

&gt;

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-1236250284/):

&gt;“Sonic 3” gives hyperactivity a good name. Jeff Fowler, who directed all three of these movies, is a quicker and wittier flimflam magician of energy than he was when he made the first “Sonic” in 2020.


[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review/) (8/10):

&gt;The weaker elements of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 feel unimportant in the wake of an entertaining time that will no doubt thrill audiences of all ages.

[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review) (4/5)

&gt;Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow. Between this year's games and film, Sonic's shining bright with Shadow in tow.


[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1741398/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (7.5/10):

&gt;The outcome is a ""Sonic"" movie that feels like everything fans love about the games distilled into a film that's fast, flashy, a hell of a lot of fun, and boasts an absolute banger of a soundtrack.

[The Irish Times] (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2024/12/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-a-hunk-of-good-honest-rubbish-for-the-festive-season/) (3/5):

&gt;Carrey’s antic madness – elsewhere often too much to digest – is just what the Sonic films needed to balance out the digital gloss.

[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (3/5):

&gt;Should Carrey, who has consistently hinted at retirement plans, decide not to return for Sonic 4, this will certainly be a fine trilogy capper.

[Screen Daily] (https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/5200227.article):

&gt;Whether it’s Jim Carrey playing not one but two supervillains, or the introduction of even more supporting characters, Sonic 3 wears out its welcome, resulting in an entertaining but exhausting affair.


[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba) (6/10):

&gt;Against all odds, the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go.


[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-supplies-laughs-and-energy-for-hedgehog-threequel) (3/5):

&gt;While no one could deny the cash-grab fan-service underpinning to the entire project … well, it’s actually a not unenjoyable experience, even if you are someone on whom the intricacies of early-00s game narrative are lost.

[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-1235078147/) (D):

&gt;It might be enough to entertain young children or diehard SEGA loyalists, but the rest of us are left to lament that the running time isn’t as fast as its blue protagonist.

movies,The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano changed my entire view of Tom Hanks. ,"I grew up knowing Tom hanks from Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, Toy Story, You’ve got mail, saving private Ryan. He was a staple in my household and one of the first movie stars I admired. But for some reason my early mind couldn’t come to accept his early films. 

I saw numerous times the vhs boxes for The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano at the rental store and always created in my head the reasons these weren’t movies for me. I think it was chaos on the covers. I just got a sense they weren’t made for me at that age and I wouldn’t appreciate them. And in a way I was right and in a way I’m beyond glad I waited to age up before I watched them for the first time. 

You are never surprised watching early hanks movies that he became what he did but at times your disappointed that beyond snl appearances that he focused on dramas. There is a rare blend of grounded humanism and over the top performances in these two films that I feel was lightning in a bottle. 

As a Joe Dante fan I have to say other than gremlins 2 and perhaps beyond it felt like the movie most representing the distillation of his spirit as a filmmaker. The cast is top to bottom perfect. It felt like both a love letter to late 50s early 60s tv like Ozzie and Harriett, leave it to beaver, the munsters and 80s hijinks comedies while altogether becoming its own thing. 

 Tom Hanks masters over the top comedy in this movie. I’ve never seen anything like it, his outbursts, monologues, and physical comedy are unmatched in their ability to play to the levels of gonzo Joe Dante asks of him while simultaneously feeling endearing and believable. Which leads to the reason the ending was changed from a twilight zone like twist to a double twist where he HAS to win in the end. But albeit in the wrong way. 

Also props to Bruce Dern, I don’t know how he ended up in this movie but I’m damn glad he did. What a driving force and “straight man” if this movie could even have one.

movies,Most disappointing adaptational change from book to film?,"So I really loved Denis Villenueve’s two-part film adaptation of “Dune,” but man, they really did my Mentats dirty. 

My biggest disappointment in each film was the way Mentats Piter De Vries and Thufir Hawat were completely stripped of everything about their characters that made them interesting and snuffed out unceremoniously. They might as well have been cut from the films altogether for all they contributed. 

It’s astounding to me that for as much material was gutted from the David Lynch film, he still managed to portray Piter and Thufir more faithfully and more compellingly than Denis.

If you liked John Lithgow in ""Cliffhanger"", you'll enjoy his work. And you even have a young, nearly unrecognizable Elizabeth Hurley play one of his accomplice.

Passenger 57 is your typical airplane hijack actioner. Generic, not complicated, Wesley Snipes as a hero who can do everything and has a traumatic past which is connected to the present, a likable stewardess. Then, when things get rough, criminals hijack a plane and keeps passengers hostages, it's up for Snipes' security officer to save the day as he's in the plane and he becomes one man against a gang after all his coleagues get shot and killed.

There's even time for social commentary as Snipes is a victim of racism from ground cops who assume he's a criminal just because he's black.

movies,Allied (2016) is one of my favorite WW2 movies,"First, I am a sucker for spy romance stuff, so I may be a bit biased. Casino Royale '06 is my top favorite movie ever. But still, I think Allied is very under appreciated. I rewatch it semi-yearly with my wife.

Beautiful presentation and atmosphere, great cast, lovely music, brisk pace, the brief action sequences are slick and brutal. My favorite scene is the house party, it captures the tension and sinking feeling Max is experiencing very well as he frantically tries to find answers. I love the clever way he attempts to catch the jeweler in a lie too.

It's very human in a way that they let go of inhibitions when they know they're very likely to die the next day. I always wonder why characters don't ever do that in other films. The trauma bond was very real.

There's two common ""plotholes"" people talk about often that I quickly wanna explain.

1. ""Why did they even tell Max they were conducting the blue dye test?""

The movie was pretty clear that the blue dye test was a sick test of Max's loyalty to the country, more than it was a spy hunt. They wanted to see if their dear commander was willing to betray his country for his wife and mother of his child, after a lifetime of service. The army irl has done far worse for far less.

2. ""Why didn't max sabotage the test or not write it""

First, he had no suspicions at all at that point of the movie. In his mind, they'd be proven wrong and they'd all move on and forget about it. Second, you never know how much the military knows. They might already know everything about the gal. They might have had ways to verify he did sabotage the test. The good guy's side of the war doesn't necessarily have... good guys.

movies,When movies leave more than memories...,"Yesterday, I was watching The Green Mile. I know it’s already an emotional movie, but this time it hit me differently. It wasn’t just the story that made me teary--it was the thought of the movie’s making that made me even more sentimental. I found myself thinking about that particular jail where they shot the scenes, imagining what it’s like now. I thought about the side characters--are they still alive? After all, the movie was made back in 1999.

And this wasn’t the first time. Just a few days ago, I had the same feeling while watching Indecent Proposal. Demi Moore--God, she was so beautiful. But my mind didn’t stop there. I thought about the little things: the pet dog that the couple had, the side characters, the clothes they wore. Are those costumes still tucked away in some forgotten corner of a studio warehouse? What happened to the dog? It’s heartbreaking to think that the little creature we saw on screen must be long gone by now.

I don’t know why, but thinking about all of it—the passage of time, those beautiful films that now feel so distant--makes my heart heavy. It’s like a weight in my chest, and sometimes, I can’t even breathe.

Is it just me? Does anyone else feel like this? Or is there something wrong with me?

movies,Seeking Indie Movie from 2009 about Post-Breakup Tropical Vacation,"Hi everyone! I’m looking for an indie film from around 2009, and I’m hoping someone here can help identify it. Here’s what I remember about the plot:
	•	The main character plans a tropical vacation for himself and his girlfriend (or wife), but they break up before the trip.
	•	He’s initially hesitant to go, but his best friend convinces him to take the trip instead.
	•	The vacation is in a tropical, jungle-like setting.
	•	During the trip, the protagonist steps out of his comfort zone, trying things he’d never thought he’d do, like participating in bar fights and scuba diving.
	•	By the end of the movie, he decides to stay and continue traveling with other people, rather than returning home.

It’s not a very well-known film, and I believe it’s an indie production. I watched it on Amazon Prime or a similar streaming service about 5+ years ago.

movies,What’s your opinion of the Disney sequels/live action adaptations?,"This isn’t just a Disney problem, but it does concern them mostly. I’m all for sequels that are useful to the plot of a story, but sometimes it seems as if they make them because they lack creativity or just want a quick buck. 

After seeing Moana 2 last weekend, it really opened my eyes as to how many of these movies Disney plans to make. Moana 2 lacked the emotional feeling, cohesive storyline, water graphics, and quality characters of the first movie. Especially at the end, it seems like they just wanted a quick ending that didn’t require much thinking to do. 

Live action movies are quite explainable. They want to make money off of an old idea. I do like the live action Aladdin though, but the others are skippable for me.

As someone who really enjoyed Disney’s recent projects Luca and Encanto, it seems like they gave up writing new stories after Wish flopped. (The writer’s strike most likely made an effect on this as well).

movies,"The Departed (2006) - How could Billy Costigan possibly know Madolyn is, specifically, Colin Sullivan's girlfriend?","Spoilers below if you haven't seen this 18 year old movie!!

-----

Let me first start by saying the Departed is one of my favorite movies. I have watched it probably a hundred times, and I know all the dialog back and forth. It does so many things well in tying together weird details to explain all the weaving storylines. Or, at least, if things are not outright explained, it's easy to understand HOW the characters could easily come to the conclusions they did.

*However, one thing that has NEVER made sense logically to me is how William Costigan (Leo DiCaprio) knows that Madolyn is SPECIFICALLY Colin Sullivan's girlfriend.*

What he should know is the following:

- She's dating a guy who has ""problems"" (coffee shop scene, 1hr10m)
- She's in a serious relationship for about 4 months (coffee shop scene)
- She's moving into this guy's apartment (apartment scene, 1hr20m )
- He knows Sullivan is the rat when he finds the Citizen's Trust envelope (2hr10m)
- It's probably reasonable to think he knows Madolyn's boyfriend is a statie of some kind, even though its not discussed outright

---

**But how could he POSSIBLY know that Sullivan, in particular, in Madolyn's boyfriend, when he confronts her at her (his) apartment (2hr11m)?**

**Or does he NOT actually know, and it's just pure luck that Sullivan happens to be her boyfriend?**

**Or does he put two and two together when he sends the tape to Sullivan (2hr13m) and sees his address is the same as the one he knows for Madolyn?**

Without understanding this it's kind of hard for me to make sense of that part of the movie, because otherwise he's essentially sending weird incriminating evidence (the ""Costigan"" envelope, the tape) to a woman who is dating a guy in the staties, who to Costigan may or may not even be involved in anything related to him. It's like saying ""Yes I have evidence the police lieutenant is a rat, so I'm sending it to a random sergeant's wife.""

movies,Comedy films: what do you think it would take for them to make a theatrical comeback? ,"I think any avid movie fan is aware that about a decade ago, the theatrical comedy film went into extinction. I would say that the last of its kind were Neighbors and 22 Jumpstreet, both released in 2014. 

I think Netflix is definitely partially responsible. Once they started making more original content, comedy slowly began to make its way out from being in theaters. However, one cannot mistake that Netflix movies do not have that same quality that theatrical films have. Even a bad theatrical film is still richer than a bad Netflix original. Add to the fact that now there are dozens of streaming services with their own films

I think the increase in popularity of social media also had something to do with it. Vine was the first of its kind, short videos, mostly humorous, that people could watch at any given moment for a chuckle and release of dopamine. Comedy used to only be consumed by the masses through live shows and movies/TV shows. You had to leave your house to laugh. However, once we had comedy in our hands, the incentive to go out of your way to be entertained disappeared. We can be entertained and laugh anywhere at any time. 

And last but not least, the current sensitivity of our culture. I remember in the mid 2000’s, comedy was, well, funny. Was a lot of it problematic? Yes. But was it all in good fun, just so someone could laugh a bit for 90 minutes? Also yes. They ripped on everyone. Racial stereotypes, homosexuality, religious groups, people with disabilities. No one was safe. I recently watched the first Scary Movie again, and I thought to myself, there’s a reason why 25 years later people are still quoting and recreating lines and scenes from this movie: it’s hysterical. Are there racial stereotypes, homophobia, ableism, and problematic elements? Of course. But is that such a bad thing, if not just for the sake of being entertained? Everyone’s supposed to be in on it. I’m gay, and I have always found gay jokes and humor to be funny. It’s all in good fun, no one is trying to be purposefully cruel to any group. They mock me, they mock you. We’re all under attack. And audiences loved it

I think, for comedy to make a comeback, they would have to for sure first run with my last point, and not care who doesn’t like it or finds it offensive. You have to give people a reason to want to leave their house to laugh, as an addition to consuming humor through their phone. Make it outlandish. Make it stuff that won’t be accepted by TikTok’s community guidelines. Also, big stars should stop resorting to signing on to movies for streaming, and stick to theatrical only films. That would also get people to come out. 

What do you guys think? I’m sure some won’t agree with me on certain points, but I know that the lack of presence of the comedy film is felt greatly by many.

movies,Showgirls (one of my favorites),"Ok so I’ve seen a few forums on the movie “Showgirls” by Paul Verhoeven and I think ALOT of people actually missed the mark of the movie as well as many lessons. For starters I am a dancer and have been in the lifestyle that is portrayed in the movie along with very similar situations (keep in mind this movie is from 1995, not much about this lifestyle have changed nor the people who are in it). IMO it was a pretty realistic movie about a naive girl with BIG dreams who statistically went down the path most underage girls in the foster care system travel especially when they have no family and grew up dealing with a HUGE traumatic event young which also explains why she was still very naive and childlike because she didn’t have much of a childhood.

1. The lesson taught when guy stole her luggage is : just because a person is being nice doesn’t mean you can trust them and always stick with your first instinct. On top of that (I know it’s cliche) “Everything happens for a reason”. If that guy never would’ve stole her bag she would’ve never met Molly who turned out to be a great friend or never got to be a showgirl.
        I do find  it hard to believe Nomi wouldve left her bag with the guy who picked her up in his truck. The fact he kept joking about her being in the “mafia family” as well as kept asking about her luggage and if she had money was a dead giveaway he was gonna take her bag. Not only that she already didn’t trust him and grew up bouncing around so she knows not to trust him or leave her stuff but the lesson from that scene shows exactly why people have their guard up even when a person is nice and to never give anybody the benefit of the doubt 

CHARACTER BREAK DOWN :

- Cristal reminded me of Ronnie from players club. Cristal represents the OG dancer who’s been in the industry for years and threatened by any new young and pretty dancer because they represent what she once was “fresh meat” and that lifestyle was you reach a certain age you’re “washed up”

- James, ugh I HATED him and he gave me wannabe pimp vibes and was very manipulative, insecure and jealous of Nomi. For starters their first time talking he tells her she can’t dance, next he only bailed her out to make himself look like a good guy and as if she owes him while adding she’s the reason he lost his job, then he talks about her being a dancer trying to shame and belittle her (I also found it funny he brought up how it’s STDS all over the city but tried to have seggs with her and was caught with another girl). Lied about a dance number he created for her, Then when she an audition for her dream job he talked 💩 about her going and tried talking her out of it while quitting his new job and telling her again she got him fired. I’m happy she cut him cause he was gonna use her til he couldn’t no more and tear her down 

- Nomi stayed true to herself for as long as she could but like most toxic environments it will push you to your limits to see how far you’re willing to go to accomplish your dreams. Cristal knew what she was doing and hated how Nomi still had an innocence about her. In this lifestyle you eventually have to show people that you can’t be bullied and constantly have to stand up for yourself because people will try you. I also think Nomi having seggs with Jack wasn’t just about getting the role but really to spit Cristal and Jack is shown as charismatic that’s easy to fall for especially when naive and haven’t got any 🍆 lol.",Fantastic_Ad_3022,1hgjmqt,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hgjmqt/showgirls_one_of_my_favorites/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hgjmqt/showgirls_one_of_my_favorites/,2024-12-17 20:12:14,0,0.29,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hgjmqt

movies,Waterworld is really... weird,"People were always praising waterworld everytime something related to it was brought up, and i decided to give it a try.

I know it's a product of it's time, so i'm not even talking about all the coincidences and mcguffin's that moves the plot, but rather how it's silly story-wise.

  
For starters, how's dryland simply ""that way"" and not even that far away, and yet no one has ever managed to find a beach with mountains so tall that could be seen all the way up in the clouds in a world where there's literally no vision obstructions;



Why was the girl, Elona, found in the middle of the sea with a bunch of dirty, and with a ""map"" tattoo on her back, what's even the logical reason for that? Did her parents tatooed that on her back and dropped her at the middle of the sea, and hoped that not only someone would randomly find her, but decipher an enygma to find where dryland is, instead of simply telling people directly where that is? Were they fucking sadists? Also, why in japanese, everyone is white in that movie;



What are those monsters on the water (monsters in plural, but there's only one instance where one even appears), why do they exist, and why they only attack people who are specifically swimming on surface, and when he swins underwater with the woman, there's simply no wildlife to be seen;



At one point the protagonist says that he's mapping the cities underwater. Why? What's even the point of him doing that, why does he bring that up if that serves no purpose on the plot.

  
I feel like the writer this movie had like, a LOT of ideas for a story, and grand ambitions for his story, but didn't know how to handled that, and tried to fit everything into a single movie, which ended up making this soup with a lot of narrative inconsistencies and plot holes",lipehd1,1hgrnp5,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hgrnp5/waterworld_is_really_weird/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hgrnp5/waterworld_is_really_weird/,2024-12-18 02:33:07,0,0.4,0,0,48,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hgrnp5

movies,What is happening in modern movies? ,"So, I have been recently watching the Harry Potter series and I have noticed one thing in the movies that are now becoming a problem in the modern movies. That is the reaction of the characters inside the world towards their own world and the things that are found in it. 

So, what I mean to say is that, let's take the example of the first Harry Potter movie where we, alongside with Harry, are introduced into this wonderful and magical world of wizards and witches. It's completely new to us, new for him, and he reacts according to just like how a normal child will react to this world. He is awestruck, he is scared, he is afraid, but his reaction hasn't lost the sincerity. He doesn't wink to the camera and says, this is some crazy shit. Even the characters know that these things are not normal compared to the muggle world, so they react accordingly. Some of the characters humorously add that, yes, this is the status quo of the world. Some of the characters are disappointed that muggles are not knowing of their world and culture because they know so much about the muggle world. Some have the wise outlook that, yes, of course, both the worlds will have different kind of things in them. So, people will act accordingly towards their world.

 What I mean to say is that, everybody in that movie reacts differently to the things around the world. But, even if some character winks at the camera to show their reaction, they do not lose their sincerity. 

This is what I believe is lacking in modern movies where every character just winks at the camera, loses their sincerity and keeps on rambling about the jokes, how their world is, how their situation is so crazy, how this is happening. This is what I believe that in most of these modern movies who are trying to tell so modern stories with new outlook, with so-called fresh outlook on things are not serious at all. The world itself, it is a fictional world. Who cares if your character is a normal human being that gains the ability to fly. We know that because it is a movie. We do not need to be told that this is a crazy event. Of course, it is a crazy event. That is the sole reason. It is a movie. I don't think that you will make a movie about a normal day of a normal person in a normal world. Even if you do make, it will have some crazy event happening within the rules of functioning of that particular world.

It's just my opinion that we need that sincerity back in movies!

movies,Baffled by the love for Trap ,"I've seen a lot of people loving this movie (even a critic put it on his top 10 list this year!), and I'm just not getting it. Outside of Josh Harnett's performance, Trap might legitimately be the worst movie I've seen this year.

Plot holes (of which there are a thousand) notwithstanding, it just fell flat in so many ways for me. It comes close to working as a black comedy (which I""m sure M. NIght was going for), but I don't think the writing was campy enough to really pull it off. But I think the biggest issue I have with it is that nothing is set up in a way that makes a good payoff. For instance: 

\- We should have gotten a glimpse at Hartnett as a family man AT HOME in the beginning, interacting with his wife, kids, neighbors, etc. A huge angle of the movie is the double life he's been living, but we don't really see that at all. And by the time his wife shows up like 3/4ths of the way through, I don't care about their relationship at all. They could have added all of this in if they cut down the concert performances by like 30 minutes lol 

\- Other moments aren’t set up well either, like the mom that keeps accosting him at the concert. Her interaction with her daughter during the concert is supposed to be funny, but we don't see her interact with her daughter at all before that, so the joke seemingly comes out of nowhere. We don't see if her daughter is snobby, bratty, what kind of relationship they have, etc. So the joke doesn't really land. Just bad writing.

Also, the dialogue is horrendous, and once again not always in a campy way. The way people talk to each other is completely baffling throughout the whole movie lol. ""You're a good dad. You don't see families like that anymore. No, really. I love a good family with good values. You know what? I'll hold a shirt just for you."" 

The last third switch to bring the singer in as a formidable opponent to Hartnett could have been great, but the singer isn't characterized whatsoever before then and just comes off as a bland pop star. It could have been more interesting if she was set up as a mutli-dimensional character with some gravitas.

movies,Who do you feel is the best actor &amp; actress of the last 25 years? ,"I was talking with a buddy about this and could not think of which actress I would consider the best. Actor? Hands down, Tom Hanks. Awesome actor, great range, from comedy to deep drama (looking at you Philadelphia).  And as an honorable mention for Denzel Washington,but I think Hanks edges him out. 

But as for truly great actresses? I can't think of anyone that stands out. Who do you like?

movies,[jurassic park] about the tyrannosaurus attack on the car...,"some things I've never been able to understand until today:

1. What was the girl's reason for taking the flashlight? I could never understand her reasoning for doing so.
2. If she couldn't turn off the flashlight for some reason, did neither of them think of hiding the flashlight under the bench?
3. Why was Rex so focused on attacking the cars? After all, he had already eaten a goat and was full. Why didn't he just ignore them and leave?",snoke123,1hgzqs1,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hgzqs1/jurassic_park_about_the_tyrannosaurus_attack_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hgzqs1/jurassic_park_about_the_tyrannosaurus_attack_on/,2024-12-18 11:39:19,0,0.17,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hgzqs1
movies,[No Soilers] Kraven was a really fun movie,"Very fun action scenes, very entertaining Easter eggs and references, good acting, good cast, some moments that would make any comic book fan get chills. For this one, I would say the reviewers are a hundred percent on the wrong. I would highly recommend it. Just give it a try.

movies,Most disappointing movie you watched recently?,"Doesn’t have to be a movie you thought was bad. I finally watched Mad Max Fury Road today after being on my watchlist for almost a decade. It was solid but with years and year of build up and constantly seeing it on the best of 2015 movie lists. Seeing it on best action movies of all time lists, best movies of the decades list I have to say I was slightly disappointed. I had fun with it, it had some great visual moments but overall I don’t think it’s a masterpiece or deserving of all the hype it has had over the last 9 years. Maybe with more viewings I’ll grow to appreciate it more but on one time viewing I think it was slightly overrated.
