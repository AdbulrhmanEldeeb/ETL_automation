learnprogramming,Thinking of Starting a Tech Channel – What Would You Watch?,"I’m a software developer with 1 year of experience, and I’ve worked with a bunch of technologies like JavaScript, Java, C++, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind, Spring Boot, SQL, and more.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about starting a YouTube channel to share my experiences and help others in their tech journey. But honestly, I’m a bit stuck on what kind of content to create. YouTube is already packed with so many tutorials and courses, and I want to make something that stands out or at least feels helpful and fresh.

Here are some ideas I have in mind:

1. **One-shot videos for different tech stacks**: Quick, beginner-friendly overviews of various tech stacks, helping viewers understand the basics and explore further on their own.
2. **DSA-focused content**: A complete LeetCode or DSA playlist. (Although this is very common on YouTube already.)
3. **System design content**: Creating different products from scratch, like building your own version of Vercel, GitHub, or a DNS server, along with their architecture (inspired by creators like Piyush Garg and Harkirat Singh).
4. **Project-based learning**: Long, detailed tutorials for building multiple projects using different tech stacks.
5. **Language-specific playlists**: Comprehensive, long-form content for mastering a specific programming language.
6. **Daily learning vlogs**: Sharing my daily tasks, challenges, and learnings related to software development (tech-focused content only).

What do you think? Do any of these ideas sound interesting? Or is there something else you’d love to see on a tech channel?",SomeoneDotDev,1hh35sc,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hh35sc/thinking_of_starting_a_tech_channel_what_would/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hh35sc/thinking_of_starting_a_tech_channel_what_would/,2024-12-18 14:49:01,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hh35sc

learnprogramming,Would you recommend Harvard cs50 and The Odin Project as a path to learn,"Hi there :)   
  
I'm interested in learning to create websites and mobile apps. Like most people I have plenty of ideas for things I believe would be worth building and I think technology will soon be at the point where even more complex projects will be something an individual or a small team can create and maintain vs needing the resources of a giant company.

Would the Harvard cs50 course followed by TOP be a good path for me to learn what I need, and if not what would you recommend?  
\- University is an option too but it seems like it would be slower than learning on my own plus my goal isn't to get hired in a job    

Would there be any holes in my knowledge from going this route and what resources would you suggest to learn what I missed?

What are some communities you recommend joining?

I am at my final year of College and you know the final project is mandatory.

I don't get it like, OpenCVs I search on YouTube are tutorials with 45 minutes and what great would you learn from that. I don't mean to downgrade it but I need to do something useful. I will definitely do OpenCVs in the future. And what about the predictions and what about the ML? Is it any good? I don't know that's why I am asking.
