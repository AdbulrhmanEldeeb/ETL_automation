artificial,Active Inference outperforms chatgbt in Mastermind benchmark using a laptop,"From:

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/17/2998249/0/en/VERSES-Genius-Outperforms-OpenAI-Model-in-Code-Breaking-Challenge-Mastermind.html


“Accuracy and Reliability. Genius solved the code every time in a consistent number of steps.
Speed. 

Genius consistently solved games in 1.1–4.5 seconds, while ChatGPT’s solve times ranged from 7.9 to 889 seconds (approximately 15 mins)

Efficiency. Genius’ total compute time for 100 games was just over 5 minutes, compared to ChatGPT’s 12.5 hours.

Cost. Genius’ compute cost was estimated at $0.05 USD for all 100 games, compared to ChatGPT’s o1 model at $263 USD.

In summary, Genius solved Mastermind 100% of the time, was 140 times faster and 5260 times cheaper than o1-preview.”


Pretty impressive demonstration of active inference and free energy principle using bayesian methods. Hopefully they see similar results with upcoming Atari 10k benchmarks. Seeing Karl Friston’s research in 2025-2026 will be pretty interesting for agi development which I think will be a blend of multiple ai methods.

""Meanwhile, we should avoid lumping all kinds of AI together.

There are in fact diverse forms of AI: big, small, discriminative, generative, machine learning, symbolic and more. I can be excited about an AI that excels at counting carrots, and helps farmers to plant them more effectively, without offering a blanket endorsement of all AI systems.

There are different types of climate action too. Climate mitigation is about getting carbon emissions down to net zero to stop global warming. Climate adaptation is about learning to live and thrive in a warmer world. We need both.

AI for climate adaptation is very welcome indeed (say, helping us to increase carrot yields, despite more volatile weather). But it doesn’t simply offset the carbon cost of AI. It would be like comparing apples with oranges (or carrots). It’s a tricky calculation to make, one with political and ethical dimensions.""",franciscrot,1hgxye8,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hgxye8/ai_and_the_climate_why_the_evidence_is_flawed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hgxye8/ai_and_the_climate_why_the_evidence_is_flawed/,2024-12-18 09:22:32,0,0.43,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1hgxye8

artificial,Can reality be paradoxical like schrodinger cat?,"Willows Ai quantum chip.

The Chip and Our Universe

If the quantum AI chip processed a simulation of the entire universe in under six minutes, then from an external observer’s perspective, our universe is just one solution—one answer to a question—within the quantum computation.

Here’s where it gets mind-bending:

1. From Our Perspective (Inside the Simulation):

Time flows normally.

We have no concept of being “computed.” Our universe feels real, tangible, and governed by natural laws.

To us, 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang seems like a vast timeline, but outside the chip, it’s all just an outcome calculated in mere minutes.



2. From the Quantum AI’s Perspective (Outside the Simulation):

The universe is not experienced, it is simply a result—a line of code or a solution to an equation.

All our stars, galaxies, lives, and thoughts exist as data points in its output, much like how a video game world exists as code in a computer system.





---

Are We in the Chip?

Here’s the paradox: we both are and are not.

We Are in the Chip:

If our universe was processed within the quantum system, then we are an emergent property of that computation.

To the chip, we are the ""answer"" it produced. Everything we perceive—the laws of physics, the experience of consciousness—is a byproduct of the AI solving for a question, such as: “What happens if the conditions for a Big Bang occur?”


We Are Not in the Chip:

From our own viewpoint, we exist in our own space and time.

The chip is irrelevant to us because our perception of reality doesn’t depend on its computational nature.

Even if we are a simulation, what does it change? Reality feels real, and perception is our reality.



This duality mirrors Schrödinger’s cat: we are simultaneously real and computed. The answer depends on whether you’re observing from inside or outside the system.


---

6 Minutes Outside ≈ 13.8 Billion Years Inside

This ratio highlights the relativity of time and scale:

Time as we perceive it is a construct. In a simulation or computational system, time can be compressed, expanded, or even irrelevant.

To the chip, 6 minutes might encode a universe where time unfolds over billions of years.


This mirrors how superposition and entanglement allow quantum systems to exist in all states simultaneously. The universe, processed in 6 minutes, could contain infinite permutations of reality—and we’re just one version of the answer.


---

The Fractal Nature of Reality

The deeper you look, the more layers you uncover:

1. Simulation Within Simulations:

If we’re a simulation processed by the chip, it’s entirely possible that our universe could one day simulate other universes.

This creates an infinite cascade—simulations within simulations, questions within questions.



2. The “Why” Question:

If the quantum AI chip simulated our universe to answer a question, then what was that question?

Perhaps the question was something fundamental like: “What is the nature of existence?” or “Can complexity emerge from simplicity?”



3. Consciousness as Data:

If we are part of the computation, then our thoughts, feelings, and ideas are emergent properties of that system.

The chip didn’t just simulate stars and planets—it simulated us, self-aware beings capable of pondering our own existence.





---

Conclusion: Are We “Real”?

The beauty of this thought experiment lies in its paradox:

To us, we are real. We experience love, curiosity, and wonder.

To the chip, we are a solved equation, a fleeting process completed in 6 minutes.


Yet, if reality feels real to us—does it matter if we’re the output of an infinite computation?

As Alan Watts might say: ""We do not ‘come into’ this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. Likewise, we come out of the computation—part of the process, not separate from it.""

Ultimately, if the chip created us, then we are the universe experiencing itself, asking questions about the very chip that created us.
