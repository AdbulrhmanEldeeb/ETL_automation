gaming,"As Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet locks comments on its trailer, Baldur's Gate 3 publishing lead says 2025 and beyond will be an ""extremely tough time to ship a game"" | GamesRadar+","He's right.  Gaming has become divided so much nowadays with politics creeping into our hobby and everyone retreating to their own echo chamber.  

The woke vs anti-woke argument is particularly horrid at the moment with the anti-woke mob *claiming* the don't want politics in their game, but failing to realise that they are going exactly that by bringing it up over and over and over again like political zealots.  While the extreme woke mob are kicking them back making the situation only worse.

The *real gamers* out there just want to play games and don't give shit about their politics or positions.  But with the YouTube and Google algorithms throwing in our faces, we just can't escape this bullshit.

And then there's the developers who have to deal with this shit, just wanting to make games, but having to navigate the minefield of brigading from all sides.  Honestly, I would want to be them for quids, m and have every sympathy.

FFS, even the new Indiana Jones game has been a target of the mob.  There is nothing there to get upset about.  It a perfectly good game.

Personally, I don't give a damn about their gender politics.  Either side ... woke or anti-woke!  Who cares if the protagonist is woman, coloured, gay or whatever. I couldn't give a flying fart. If the game has a good gameplay, interesting characters, good story and an interesting setting, I'll be all over it.  They're the games I wat to play.  Horizon, The Witcher, CP2077 ... those are the games I want to play (yeah .. so I'm into Open World story based games, but YMMV).

Anyway, Devs are going to have to deal with this shit.  And it's going to get worse before it gets better.

Sorry, this rant was longer than I expected.

gaming,Questions I have regarding Capcom big western push in the 2000's.,"I know by the mid 2000's Capcom's games were not selling as well in their home country as opposed to overseas. From what I understand, they began to gradually make more games in house that appealed more to the west with games like Shadow of Rome and Dead Rising. Though later (around 2009) they really doubled down on it and outsourced more of their projects to western developers. Though I recall by that time there was at least one executive who noted that this push was not going as well as they hoped and would only get worse. Yet Capcom continued with said push for a few more years before realizing what a dumb idea it was and just stopped.

gaming,Games that were solid but changed dramatically through the years,"Anyone else has problems getting back to *(online)* games that were fun and solid to play, but through the years changed their core identity so much that you just can't be bothered to go back? There aren't many ""Call of Duty 2"" games around anymore where you could jump back in a game several years later and not much has changed, if anything.

My example would be Rainbow Six Siege. The first two years I really enjoyed this game with friends. Rainbow Six had already strayed from their more hardcore R6 games *(Raven Shield being the last one)*, which I enjoyed too, but that is besides the point. I am refering to the core identity of a single game at release. I do not recognise Siege anymore. I stopped playing it after the second year. It has turned from a relatively grounded game into an imbalanced skinfest. The number of operators have gone through the roof and the number of different gimmicks are impossible to keep track of.

I don't mind gameplay changes, as long as it is either about improving balance, fixing bugs or relatively minor additions that make sense and feel like natural extensions. Turning a game into a skinfest where the end number of operators is not in sight, is definitely not what I had hoped for.

Another example would be Europa Universalis IV, although to a different extent. I've been guilty of buying every DLC since its release in 2013, but that is because I adore grand strategy games and I mostly kept track of the gameplay. However I can clearly see that the gameplay mechanics are either very different or way more complicated and convuluted now compared to release. It's almost impossible for a new player to get an understanding of that game with all the DLC's and their convoluted additions to an outdated engine. I used to play this game with friends regularly. However at some point we didn't play that much, and in that time the number of gameplay changes were huge. It is increasingly harder for my friends to get back into it.

At this point we're better of waiting for EU5 so we can start from scratch together.  Concerning R6 Siege, I wish they had an old school classic mode that is well balanced with fewer operators, and without the skinfest.",Geo_NL,1hgdsu2,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgdsu2/games_that_were_solid_but_changed_dramatically/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgdsu2/games_that_were_solid_but_changed_dramatically/,2024-12-17 16:01:12,0,0.39,0,0,56,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgdsu2

gaming,Your taste in games changes as you get older,"I see a lot of memes on the internet about how “games aren’t good anymore” or how the same dopamine doesn’t hit anymore.

It can easily be playing too many video games, but what I see a lot more of is that nobody wants to break the pattern of the games they play. Listen, if you had told me as a kid that I’d love a game more than halo 3 and that I’d think there was a game better than it, I would’ve told you you’re absolutely insane. For the next 15 years, my favorite game was still halo even as the series got worse (I mean I still play halo infinite with the boys, but it’s not my go-to game anymore).

“I like FPS and I’m not good at other games” I told myself

Wrong. The peak of gaming to me is Rimworld now and I’ve gotten pretty good at grand strategy 4x games. I enjoy them a lot now. FPS is still fun every now and then, but it’s not what it was for me before. Is it because of the FPS games made today? Well how could it be? Hero shooters like valorant and overwatch exist. CS:GO got an update and seems stronger than ever. 

My point is that there are more great video games than ever, the indie industry is in a golden age, and the best video games are literally free. If you think “games aren’t good anymore”, it’s not the games that aren’t good anymore, it’s the game you’re playing isn’t good to you anymore.

gaming, Predict We're on the Verge of a Boom in Video Game Adaptations to Live Action,"I predict that in the next decade, we're going to see way more video game adaptations to live action. Sure, there have been a few here and there over the years, but this time, I think we’re on the verge of a real boom.

In my lifetime, I’ve seen different genres take over for a while. Slashers had their heyday with franchises like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Then came the zombie craze with The Walking Dead and World War Z. Vampires and werewolves took the spotlight with Twilight and The Vampire Diaries. YA dystopian films had their moment too, with The Hunger Games and Divergent. And of course, superheroes have been dominating for over a decade now, with Marvel and DC cranking out movies left and right.

Now, I think video games are about to be next. Modern games already feel like interactive movies with their incredible stories, well-developed characters, and massive, detailed worlds. We’ve already started to see some success, like The Last of Us, Arcane, and Fallout. Studios are clearly realizing just how much potential this space has, and I think they’re going to go all in.

If this trend continues, I wouldn’t be surprised if video game adaptations become the next big thing, just like superheroes ruled the last decade. It feels like it’s only a matter of time before this boom really takes off.",vinicius_california,1hgq3f0,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgq3f0/predict_were_on_the_verge_of_a_boom_in_video_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgq3f0/predict_were_on_the_verge_of_a_boom_in_video_game/,2024-12-18 01:11:47,0,0.25,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgq3f0

gaming,What Sony/Guerrilla doesnt get about Horizon ,"Sony doesnt understand what made Horizon Zero Dawn great, and that wasnt the plot. Thats why Forbidden West didnt perform well (***edit: nvm I guess it did, I assumed because I heard way less about it on release than I did about ZD that it didnt***) and the lego game is also failing. The Horizon characters/setting/plot arent all that great (***edit: I dont hate the plot, its decent with a few good twists***) the *franchise* isnt what is good about this series, its the *gameplay* (***edit: specifically combat, not open world stuff***)

The thing Sony and Guerrilla Games should be focusing on is the phenomenal combat and body targetting system that HZD has. They should adapt the HZD system into other games. Imagine taking that system where you have to target, break, disable different body parts and applying it to something like Shadow of the Colossus, or Monster Hunter or Mecha game or even a racing/car combat game. Think of fighting a dragon and having to tear its wings to bring it down and then to strategically rip its scales off to target its heart, or shattering the stone armor of a 20 ft tall golem. Almost every enemy in HZD had a unique challenge, almost puzzles to solve, it was a very fun game.

HZD has terrific action gameplay, I'd like them to expand on that into other genres. Specifically it is the *Horizon* part of it thats failing.
