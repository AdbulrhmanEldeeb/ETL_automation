learnprogramming,DLL only returns status,"Good day, no time wasted, I am confused and not even an AI can solve it.

I have to write a program to control an LED Lamp which uses a DLL file to provide methods. Problem is, nearly every single methode returns 1 for true/successful or -1 for false/failed. This is fine by me for Setter, for example, a Color Setter.

But the Color Getter is nearly identical with the Setter. Meaning, also all setters return a single int (1/-1)

Example: 
int GetRBGStatus(int DevIdx, int Red, int Green, int Blue);
DevIndex is the choosen Device.
I dont have to explain RGB.

The Return is saying:
""1 if successful, otherwise the return value is -1""

Meaning, it does not return Color information, it returns a status. 

I did use dotPeek to find out how it looks in the DLL File.

Under some folders I found it and it says for GetRGBStatus ""0x0000B044 [12] 0x0000BFAA (DWord), followed by a name, ordinal and function RVA.

I have no idea what that means. Does anyone know what I have to do here?
Thanks already for reading.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about starting a YouTube channel to share my experiences and help others in their tech journey. But honestly, I’m a bit stuck on what kind of content to create. YouTube is already packed with so many tutorials and courses, and I want to make something that stands out or at least feels helpful and fresh.

Here are some ideas I have in mind:

1. **One-shot videos for different tech stacks**: Quick, beginner-friendly overviews of various tech stacks, helping viewers understand the basics and explore further on their own.
2. **DSA-focused content**: A complete LeetCode or DSA playlist. (Although this is very common on YouTube already.)
3. **System design content**: Creating different products from scratch, like building your own version of Vercel, GitHub, or a DNS server, along with their architecture (inspired by creators like Piyush Garg and Harkirat Singh).
4. **Project-based learning**: Long, detailed tutorials for building multiple projects using different tech stacks.
5. **Language-specific playlists**: Comprehensive, long-form content for mastering a specific programming language.
6. **Daily learning vlogs**: Sharing my daily tasks, challenges, and learnings related to software development (tech-focused content only).

   * Calculation: 0.75 MB/s \* 1000 users \* 3600 seconds = \~2700 GB/hour. At $0.085/GB, that’s $229.50/hour.

For my use case (a VOD platform for an education center), that adds up to over $1000/month just for streaming, which isn’t sustainable.

I’m exploring alternatives like Cloudflare, which seems significantly cheaper. At the same time, I’m wondering if I should reconsider Mux, even though I initially avoided it due to pricing.

Has anyone dealt with similar issues? What cost-effective streaming solutions have worked for you?

I’m looking for some guidance about whether pursuing a Master's in Computer Science is the right step for me. Here's my situation:

Coding Journey: Over the past couple of years, I’ve been learning to code on my own. I’ve completed several projects, and I feel like I’ve developed a good level of proficiency and a real passion for it.

Dilemma: I’m wondering if it’s worth pursuing a formal Master’s in Computer Science to deepen my knowledge and improve my career prospects in tech.

Would this be a good investment of time and resources for someone like me? Or should I focus on building a portfolio, certifications, and gaining practical experience instead?

learnprogramming,Seeking Guidance to Relaunch My IT Career After an Extended Hiatus,"Hello :)

I graduated in Computer Science about 10 years ago, having spent one year of my undergraduate studies in the USA. I have advanced/fluent English and speak other languages at an intermediate level, such as Spanish, French, and Italian. During my degree, I was very dedicated—I always participated in research projects and extracurricular activities. I have a solid foundation and a strong ability to learn in programming, databases, and software engineering.

In contrast to this strong theoretical foundation and affinity for the field, unfortunately, I have little market experience. In IT, I only worked during my mandatory internship (6 months in software development) and approximately a year and a half at a BIG FOUR, which turned out to be a huge disappointment. There was zero intellectual challenge—just endless hours of repeating processes that required none of the technical knowledge I had. I would say it was practically a null experience in terms of IT.

Shortly before my time at the BIG FOUR ended, I was far along in a selection process to work in software development in central FLORIDA. However, for family reasons, I couldn’t accept the position or continue working in the field because my family needed my full-time help—and for me, family always comes first.

Well… now that my family matters are resolved, I intend to return to my IT career. In the meantime, I had some freelance experiences on platforms like UPWork and Workana, developing websites using WordPress, but nothing particularly relevant to build a strong portfolio.

In summary, I’m an IT professional with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, solid theoretical knowledge, ease of learning, and great interpersonal and communication skills. However, I have very little practical experience and have been away from the field for about eight years. I’m looking to resume my career and am open to your suggestions on where to start. I believe the ideal scenario would be a remote job that pays in dollars and is suitable for someone with little experience. I'm even willing to take an unpaid internship or get a job with a low hourly rate.

Thank you in advance for your time and attention, and I hope to also contribute to the community in some way.

I am working through the last capstone of my Java boot camp. We’re working with rest, spring boot, sql and postman to make a fully functional online store. We received the basic code and have to add feature and a couple of bugs that were put in on purpose. I have completed most of the assignment but still keep getting 401 errors for pretty much every test when I run the JSON script. The security code was already provided and we were told it was working but I can’t figure out another reason. 

When I run it in postman it says “Authentication: ‘Bearer null’” in the header. I’m not sure if this is allowed but here’s the GitHub repo. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

I’m a computer science major currently focusing on software engineering, and I’m looking to expand my skill set through group projects or even individual mentorship. I want to get hands-on experience, collaborate with others, and improve my coding abilities.

Here’s where I’m at: I’m very much a beginner, so I’m still building confidence and knowledge, but I’m eager to learn and contribute in any way I can. If you have a group working on a project that wouldn’t mind a newbie joining in or if you’re someone who’s open to guiding me, I’d be incredibly grateful.

I’m hoping to connect with like-minded people who can help me grow, give me pointers, or just let me observe and learn along the way. I’m open to working on anything — whether it’s open-source, hobby projects, or something else.

I’m currently in my first year of university studying Computer Science, but I already have substantial experience in programming and development. I’ve recently started preparing for GSoC 2025 and wanted to kick things off early by contributing to some projects.

I’m revisiting a few interesting projects from last year’s GSoC (2024) that align well with my tech stack, and I’m torn on the best strategy:

* Should I focus on contributing actively to *just one* project to show deeper involvement and commitment?
* Or would contributing to 2-3 projects that align with my skills be more valuable for demonstrating versatility and consistent contributions?

I want to make sure that once applications open, I’ll have some solid contributions to showcase.

If you’ve been through GSoC or have any tips, I’d greatly appreciate your advice! Any other general recommendations for preparing at this stage would be super helpful too.

learnprogramming,Bsc in Computer Science ?,"Is Starting a Computer Science BSc with an Earth Science MSc a Good Idea?

I hold an MSc in Earth Science and have been considering starting a BSc in Computer Science. My main motivation stems from the challenges of finding stable and family-friendly work in geology. The industry often involves long shifts, extensive travel, and jobs far from home, which has made me reevaluate my career path.

What excites me about computer science is the potential to combine it with my Earth Science background. Could my knowledge in geology and Earth sciences be integrated with programming, data analysis, or machine learning to create a unique skill set? For example, could I apply computer science to geospatial analysis, simulation modeling, or real-time data prediction in geological research?

On the flip side, I am concerned about the investment—both financial and time-related. Would it be worth committing to a completely new degree when I already have an advanced qualification? Would this transition be feasible and rewarding in the long run, or am I overestimating the compatibility of these two fields?

However, I'm getting a comp sci degree and so far have learned several basic concepts via pseudocode that I know want to test out and fuck around with. Stacks, queues, lists, arrays, loops, etc, I have starting familiarity with how they work.


I originally wanted to be a writer but that doesn't pay the bills so I've shifted to combining my writing hobby with developing my software engineer skills. I frequent this sub and see pretty often that it's suggested tinkering with a project I actually care about is a good idea so I'm looking for a good starting point. 


I know there's Ren Py for visual novels but I don't know how much coding I would actually learn doing that if it's too modular - I do eventually want a job in the field. Making little games or prototypes for games seems the right path but I'm specifically looking for how to mess around with games that lean on writing in particular. Or maybe games aren't the right answer at all!

Problem:
We're trying to build a regression model to predict a target variable. However, the target variable contains outliers, which are significantly different from the majority of the data points. Additionally, the predictor variables are highly correlated with each other (high multicollinearity). Despite trying various models like linear regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, along with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV, we're unable to achieve the desired R-squared score of 0.16.
Goal:
To develop a robust regression model that can effectively handle outliers and multicollinearity, and ultimately achieve the target R-squared score.

So my question how do you guys retain everything that you learn? Do you learn a concept and then keep practicing until its at your finger tips or do you write notes for later?

        calc1.py
        calc2.py
        plotResultsQuantity1.py
        plotResultsQuantity2.py

Where `calc1.py` and `calc2.py` use the Physics module to obtain different results. For example in `calc1.py` it might be interested in testing how the simulation looks like as I change the initial conditions, whereas `case2.py` does the usual simulation (whatever that means) but outputs some very specific plot at each step in the simulation (which I achieve by appropriately wrappinng a method defined in `mainCalculation.py.`

Finally, `plotResultsQuantityN.py` has a file selector that gives a choice (in this example, between `case1.txt` and `case2.txt`) so that it can plot `QuantityN` from the different data sets. For example in `plotResultsQuantity1.py` I might be plotting the derivative of the file that I choose, where as in `plotResultsQuantity2.py` I might be interested in calculating the integral.

Now the project has gotten fairly big, and the amount of files has grown really fast in the last couple of weeks. I think now it would a good time in which I should reorganize the directory so that utilization is easier in the future.

What would be a nicer way of organizing this? I was thinking of

       plot.

Where `calculate.py` looks something like

    from Calculations import calc1

learnprogramming,"What are the ground rules of using Python for competitive programming, especially with regards to memory allocation? I keep getting Runtime Errors in Python with solutions that are accepted one I reimplement them in C++. Are there obvious basic tips to working with Python on coding problems?","For a bit more context, I used to do competitive programming in my high school almost 10 years ago and even went to the IOI. At that point, I only knew how to code in C++ because that was the best for competitions. Nowadays, I'm a machine learning researcher and I have basically only used Python ever since high school.   
  
The last time I stumbled upon coding problems was when I gave a look at the two level 4 ""coding puzzles"" at Meta's hiring platform for curiosity. I believed I knew how to solve them and naturally tried to implement them in Python, but I got stuck with runtime errors in both problems. I tried to debug that for hours and find a test case that would give me the RE locally, but nothing. After a long time, I finally tried to locate the line that raised the error (classic binary search with wrong answers) and it was simply a line that created and populated a list... on both problems! I proceeded to simply reimplement my code in C++ and both solutions passed.

I have no clue why a simple `list.append(x)` would result in Runtime error. I thought if it was some simple Python memory inefficiency I'd get a MLE instead. This is not the first time I have this experience trying to use Python for something like this. So all these years after I left competitive programming, is Python still unusable for these things? Does anyone use it? Is there a good blog post or set of ground rules about how to avoid these issues with Python?  

Anyway, I also found it remarkable how C++, that I only used for 3 years in high school and haven't used ever since still gave me better control over my code than Python, the language I've been working daily for the past 10 yearsI and that believed I was the most proficient at (until today 😅).

learnprogramming,"I have a CS degree but suck at programming, looking for advice on moving forward in life.","I have a degree in CS, no experience, overall suck at programming and am looking for help.

  
I understand that my only chance of getting a job in this field is to have created some outstanding project that would impress the hell out of a recruiter to the point where they could confidently assume I am proficient in my ability to design/build things. Currently this is not what I am as a developer at all.

I have dabbled in many different areas attempting to build projects and either get stuck and quit, lose interest and quit, or just feel too overwhelmed to even start. I've tried game dev and some full stack applications so far and honestly haven't accomplished much. I believe my problem is that I rely too hard on AI to write code for me. I know this is kind of a controversial thing to say, as many people who are established professionals use AI to help them write code all the time. But the problem is I'm letting AI write code I don't really understand. I'll tell myself I understand it, but later down the line when it comes to fixing something or adding something new I can't do it.

I believe a lot of my inability to program comes from my lack of programming principles. In school I learned some theory, some basic programming in C, C++, Java, and Python. In my spare time I've attempted to learn React/JavaScript, Godot, Spring boot, and databases like MongoDB and Postgresql.  I've found that generally speaking I seem to be more interested in low level code and the C++ language, but when it comes to jobs involving these things it seems the main industries are quant and embedded systems which I have no foundation in at all, and don't even know how to start learning them.

I've tried learning through YouTube and online courses and have found that these just don't work for me. They are either too slow and boring or too fast and not explanatory enough. I know most people say to just learn by trying to build things, but I don't even know where to begin half the time.

learnprogramming,Design patterns for programming GUIs with motion controllers? (Python/PyQt),"Was wondering if anyone had any good design patterns or experience for communicating with motion controllers in a GUI? 

I’m controlling my stage using TCP or Serial but I want a live position read back and motor status which makes me sort of need to poll the controller in a thread, but that complicates all the application level logic and I don’t really want to stick all my commands in a queue when I need to make sure some like stop will get received instantly. 

Is using a thread and queueing commands to the controller just the only way of doing this? I need to read the responses from the controller to validate it received the command so I can’t mix thread and non thread. 

I can’t find any examples or literature of people doing serious GUI programming online and controlling stages. Using pyside6 but this is sort of language/framework agnostic so if you have any good examples let me know!

learnprogramming,Why would an enterprise choose C# over Java?,"C# has syntax features that some people say are better in some ways?

So why so many job postings for enterprise C#? What am I missing?

(edit: Thanks to everyone for the answers! I learned a lot today... I think I understand now, that more libraries and frameworks doesn't mean ""better"", as C#'s ecosystem, tools, and development ease is better-designed especially for enterprise business and development speed, and that big data performance isn't the deciding factor of every business on what tech to use, because like in this instance, C# is faster on desktop.)",Human_Study2244,1hg2eg5,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hg2eg5/why_would_an_enterprise_choose_c_over_java/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hg2eg5/why_would_an_enterprise_choose_c_over_java/,2024-12-17 04:11:32,40,0.72,40,0,113,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hg2eg5

my issue is I will go to websites like leetcode to ""test my knowledge"" and what leetcode is asking seems next to impossible for me to solve (is this because I am so early on in my coding?).

learnprogramming,Dropped out of college to pursue web development—need advice!,"Hey there,

I recently dropped out of college where I was pursuing a diploma in Automation and Robotics. After some reflection, I realized this field wasn’t the right fit for me. Instead, I’ve decided to follow my passion for tech and have enrolled in the **PW Skills Full Stack Web Development** course.

Now that I’ve left college, I’m dedicating myself fully to becoming a web developer. However, I don’t have a degree, and I’m learning through self-study and structured courses.

I’d love to hear from others who have taken a similar path:

* How hard is it to get a job as a self-taught web developer without a degree?
* What steps should I focus on to stand out in the job market?

Any advice, tips, or shared experiences would mean a lot.

learnprogramming,Hello to the community!,"I'm 28 years old, soon to be 29. I'm a college dropout who never had any clear path in life. 
In school I was always pretty decent, but never really applied myself, never really tried, I could not be bothered.

I currently work as an Electrician, its good work, but again, I can't be bothered. I only do it for the money.

Last month I found myself bored, and intellectually unstimulated. So I decided to pick up a hobby and learn to program for the fun of it.

I have been either coding, or learning to code every single day for the past month.
And I've been having a blast with it. The hours pass me by like minutes while I sit in my computer.

I feel like I wasted 10 years of my life running around like an idiot. I could have found this passion in my earlier years, and by now who knows how good I could be. 

Computer Science is such a magical field. And I regret that it took me so long to start studying it.

I've never really felt this strongly about anything in my life. Which is why I was so excited I had to post this, to share my joy with you all.

I was initially thinking to keep the auto inc integer ID for internal operations, then UUID for any requested interaction, but still having an ID I would assume \_could\_ in edge cases where for example a DTO mistakenly keeps an ID to be open to guessing an ID.

So in 2024, whats the most accepted approach. 

1. Keep both an ID and GUID, refer to ID internally, and UID externally

2. Ditch the int ID and use GUID as primary key

learnprogramming,Help me create a structured 6-month roadmap to crack an SDE role at a product-based company!,"Hi everyone,

I need some guidance and advice! I have **3 years of experience** (primarily in Flutter development), and I'm now aiming to transition into an **SDE role** at a product-based company like **FAANG, Zomato, Swiggy, PhonePe, Cred**, etc.

I’ve taken a **6-month career break** and can dedicate **12 hours daily** to preparation. My goal is to crack an SDE-2 role within the next **5 months**. I understand this role requires strong **DSA, system design**, and **backend knowledge**, areas I need to strengthen.

# What I need help with:

1. **DSA**:
   * How do I structure DSA prep efficiently? Which platforms are best (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.)?
   * What topics should I focus on, and how many problems per topic are realistic for mastery?
2. **System Design**:
   * Any resources for both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**?
   * How can I make system design concepts stick?
3. **Backend Development**:
   * Key topics (databases, REST APIs, microservices, etc.) I should focus on.
   * Recommended projects or resources to build practical understanding.
4. **Projects and Portfolio**:
   * Should I build new projects that showcase system design or backend expertise since my experience so far is in Flutter?
   * What kind of projects will stand out for SDE-2 roles?
5. **Mock Interviews**:
   * When should I start practicing mocks? Any platforms or groups you recommend for peer interviews?

# My Plan:

I want to make the most of these 5 months with a **structured and focused approach**. Given I can dedicate **12 hours daily** (a mix of learning, coding, and practice), I’d love input on a clear **timeline or weekly/monthly roadmap**.

If you've successfully cracked similar roles or have experience preparing for these positions, your suggestions would mean a lot!

I’ve been trying to improve my skills in both frontend and backend development by working on personal projects. But there’s something that keeps getting in the way: Git.

It’s not that I don’t understand Git. I know how branches work, how to write commit messages, and the basics of version control. The problem is when I actually try to use it for personal projects. My projects are usually super spontaneous, I just dive in and code without a clear plan.

When I try to involve Git, I feel paralyzed. I overthink everything: *“How do I structure my code so I can commit it properly?”* or *“What if I change a component five times in one session, how do I organize that into meaningful commits?”* It’s like I can’t let myself commit anything less than perfect, and the pressure completely kills my flow.

Sometimes I spend so much time worrying about *how* to commit that I stop coding altogether. I know Git is supposed to make things easier, but instead, it’s making me overthink everything.

Has anyone else dealt with this?

learnprogramming,I have no idea what to do with my programming knowledge ,"I am 17M, I've been coding in Java for 4 years doing Minecraft modding. I've contributed to some open source projects there, at this point I think I can accomplish any type of programming project quickly, Minecraft modding gave me ability to search across large code bases with no documentation and do what I want to do with them. Also I am really into linux stuff, I use Gentoo and DWM as my daily driver. But one and a half years ago I had a really bad burnout out of all of this because I lost interest in Minecraft community, and gaming in general, for straight up a year I wasn't able to even open IDE, yet write any code. Recently I kinda got out of it, started learning C++ and digging into lower level programming/reverse engineering just because I felt like it. I had a pet project coding my own digital synthsizer in C++ because in that year of programming burnout I taught myself electronic music production, tried out opengl too. For now what I try in programming doesn't have any goal, nor I want to seriously publish it or promote it, just for the sake of practice. I no longer have that much of a motivation and enthusiasm I had when I was starting, my main passion being music production nowadays. My programming knowledge feels really like an elephant in the room, it's big, it's always there, but I seem to hardly ignore it most of the time.

I thought about video game development since I've chosen more artistic niche and already have done modding, but personally I don't play them at all, nor have any video game idea worth spending my time.

I have a youtube channel about Minecraft modding which got popular by an accident. (1,3k subscribers, not that much but not too small, the most popular video has 20k views) but I literally make videos once half a year, and honestly I no longer want to make any videos for it because I am no longer interested in Minecraft, nor I want to be a youtuber, because I am definitely not a media/entertainment kind of person. I tried live streaming and even made some money off donations, but it's too exhausting for me.

I think I'll get a programming job at some point just because it's what goes easy to me and plan to go into CS uni after finishing high school. Tho honestly I have absolutely no idea who I am and what I want to do in my life. Am I an artist? Am I a technical person? Am I a youtuber? I feel like none of them.

learnprogramming,Is it a ok to stream a paginated array?,"This is probably a noob question but I haven't been able to google streaming a big array of items from the server to the browser.

Let's say I have a list of 10k (or even just 100) bank transactions that I must get into the browser for some reason. Naturally, I want to paginate this maybe loading 10 items each so that in case the client network is bad they don't stare at a loading spinner for too long.

Which option is better?

1. Traditional Pagination: send a request, wait for 10 items to load, render them, send the next one. This is the easiest and most common. But we gotta wait for 10 items and 10 is kinda a magic number, if the network is really good, we might want to load 1k at a time, or if it's really bad, then perhaps 5 items per page is better. In the context of reactive programming, this seems like a waste, we stream the array from db but right before writing response stop and buffer it up?
2. Streaming Pagination: establish a connection, send a request message, parse and render 10 items as they come in one-by-one, send the next request, ... , at the end close the connection. Same as above but now we don't wait for 10 items! However if the connection is good, constant rendering might be overkill but we can throttle it on the client, so it shouldn't be an issue.
3. Streaming: establish a connection, send an unbounded request, parse and render one-by-one all of them, close the connection. Same as above but we don't need to keep sending the requests for ""10 more"".

I left the protocols out of it as I don't know much about them, but I am aware that there's HTTP that's good for #1, long-lived HTTP that's good for #2 (but I don't think any of my tools support it: apollo graphql client, spring graphql webflux - I know that's how Next.JS streams the webpage in the same request as it loads), websockets that's good for #2 and maybe #3, and rsocket that's good for all 3 options.

I see a problem with #2 and #3 where the client can get overwhelmed with processing items but the connection is still open - is that a big deal? In case of #2 it will not request next until it is done processing the current. And in case of #3 it will need to tell the server to stop explicitly - with websockets, that would have to be a custom logic, and with rsocket, it would be naturally done via backpressure (if done via backpressure, will the server pause or will it keep reading the db and buffer until it runs out of memory?).

Let me know if there's anything else to consider but it seems to me neither of these options are ideal but #1 is the easiest. The perfect solution would be lightweight end-to-end and the items would smoothly pop up in the UI as they come straight from the backend db.",MrJaver,1hfd6ys,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfd6ys/is_it_a_ok_to_stream_a_paginated_array/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfd6ys/is_it_a_ok_to_stream_a_paginated_array/,2024-12-16 06:35:30,3,1.0,3,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfd6ys

That being said, if I wanted to use Python for other (smaller) scripts at my job, do you think this will hurt my growth or effectiveness in Powershell? I'm not yet an expert in Powershell, so I don't want to do be a jack of all trades but master of none, but I can't tell if using Python (for personal projects in addition to smaller work projects) would help or hurt my skills in Powershell.  Also, by smaller work projects, they will essentially be small scripts that fetch API data or something similar as my team does not work with or troubleshoot or know Python, they only know powershell (so in essence, I won't be getting the feedback like I do in powershell from seniors)

learnprogramming,Got marked wrong for saying SELECT is 'the SQL keyword for querying' in my DS exam - am I wrong?,"Quick sanity check needed regarding a Data Science exam question I'm disputing.

Question asked: ""The SQL keyword for filtering after grouping is **(i)**, and the SQL keyword for querying is **(ii)**.""

I correctly put HAVING for (i), and put SELECT for (ii) but was marked wrong. Prof says WHERE is correct because ""SELECT is for specifying a subset of columns; querying is the act of specifying a subset of rows.""

However, PostgreSQL's documentation literally states: ""The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. In SQL the SELECT command is used to specify queries.""

When I disputed it, prof mentioned it was meant to parallel Pandas concepts from lecture, but the question itself made no mention of Pandas or specifically asking about row filtering.

I get that WHERE filters rows. But if you're asked ""what's the SQL keyword for querying"" with no other context, isn't SELECT a valid answer? The question doesn't specify row filtering anywhere.

I'm 1.3 exam points from an A in the course, so this isn't just me being pedantic. Would love to hear what other DS folks think.

Additional context: This was in an intro DS course where we covered both Pandas and SQL.

Edit: here's the conversation that ensued with a grader:

ME: ""I believe this question is ambiguous. SELECT is fundamentally the main querying keyword in SQL, beginning every query statement. While WHERE filters rows, 'querying' isn't exclusively about row filtering in SQL terminology. Could you please reconsider this answer?""

GRADER: ""Hi \*\*\*! I see where you're coming from. But, the idea behind this question was to identify the SQL equivalent of various ideas in pandas that we discussed at length. Filtering after grouping is an idea we know about in pandas. Similarly, querying was well-defined as a Thing in pandas in Lecture, and so we were looking for the SQL equivalent of that. I hope that clarifies things; sorry about that!""

ME: ""Thank you for explaining the Pandas connection. However, the question only asks about 'the SQL keyword for querying' without mentioning Pandas. I interpreted it from a general SQL perspective, where SELECT would be a valid answer. I'm currently just 1.3 exam points away from an A in the course, so I'd really appreciate if you could reconsider this question. Thank you for your time.""

GRADER: ""Unfortunately, even within a SQL context, select is for querying specific columns, not rows.""

ME: ""From PostgreSQL docs 7.1: 'The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. In SQL the SELECT command is used to specify queries.'

If the question specified 'the SQL keyword for filtering rows' rather than 'the SQL keyword for querying,' then WHERE would be the clear answer.

I'm a junior CS student, and I’m starting my first serious personal project. My goal is to create a website where users can download YouTube videos, TikTok sounds, etc., as MP3 files.

That said, I’ve never worked on a project that exists outside my laptop, and I’m feeling a bit lost about where to start. Here’s what I’ve figured out so far:

* I’ll use VS Code as my IDE.
* The back end will be written in Python, using Flask.
* The front end will be built with basic HTML and CSS.
* I plan to figure out how to implement a web scraper as I go (I've never made one), and how to download files to someones computer/phone.

While I feel confident I can handle the coding with enough time and troubleshooting, I’m unclear about some broader aspects of the project:

1. **Project Structure:** How should I organize my files and code for a web app like this?
2. **Hosting:** What’s the best way to host a project like this so others can access it online?
3. **Best Practices:** Are there general tips or advice on managing and structuring a project like this?

  
Ultimately if this pans out smoothly I'd love to try even monetizing it with something like Google AdSense. I know I'd probably get next to zero traffic, but it'd sound even better on a resume.

learnprogramming,How to get better at designing your systems and splitting up functionality in clean ways?,"Hi! I've been a professional developer for 3 years but I find myself running into this pretty often. Any time I need to make a new system, I find myself struggling to decide where to draw the line inside how the program functions, to split things up ""correctly"". 

I'm familiar with design principles like single use and DRY and ""orthogonality"", but I tend to struggle to put it into real use. For example, I'm making a sort of Oregon Trail text game for fun right now, and I'm always asking myself when trying to insert a new function to the program ""where should this go?"". If I have a class that handles text (dealing with flow of dialogue, moving in the correct order, pausing where needed, inserting variables like player names and player inventory) and a class that handles the game flow (starting, exiting, saving, loading, etc) which one should get the ability to prompt the player for an option? Should they *both* have this ability, and should I make another class that handles all forms of user input? The menu to choose dialogue and the menu to exit the game may be pretty different, or they could be very similar. 

And then I end up in a seemingly endless loop of trying to rearrange things, only to stumble into a different weakness of the design. Anytime I add something new, it's a major question of ""where does this fit?"", which tends to change a lot of other things, which I know is a big sign that I'm doing some things pretty wrong with designing my programs. 

It's honestly possible I'm just overthinking (maybe I'm too early in the program because it's not at any kind of functional state at the moment, so all these ARE major design decisions that SHOULD be hard), or maybe I'm underthinking (should I graph this out instead?) or something else. I'd just love some tips on tackling this in the future.

learnprogramming,BIG legacy monolith: how to deploy it securely?,"Hi!

Anyone working here with big (and by big I mean really big) legacy monolith? And with a lot of devs with various levels of experience... And most of them fresh in the company?

I wonder how do you approach deployment in such kind of cases? Is everyone allowed to do this? How do you train new people so they can also feel welcomed to deploy it? What processes have you built around it? Do you prefer Big Bang but well tested releases once a week or continuous integration with small, easy to rollback features?

Happy to hear all kind of stories: scary stories about Monoliths which barely had any monitoring and tests and cheerful ones about fully automated workflows.

learnprogramming,What database should I use for my app? ,"I'm building an app with Flutter that right now is fairly basic regarding data but will definitely grow in complexity in the future. 


It has documents of text that are associated with results from an already existing search engine that creates uniqueIDs for each result. So I just need to save the uniqueID to the document and it should be easy to get from the database. 


Each text document is broken into paragraphs, in the future users should be able to comment on each paragraph, which will be visible to other users.  


There will also be multiple translations of each document. 


I would like to be able to search by key phrases and words, which seems doable. In the future I would also like to be able to search by grammatical structures, verb tenses, etc. I think this will require pre-analyzing the text and adding tags to it and then searching the tags.  


Users should be able to access these text documents and then create new versions of them into a new document (while preserving the original) and saving that to a personal library + to a public directory if they desire. 


It may at some point become more of a social app where users can message and add friends, etc. but that is extremely far off.

learnprogramming,AppleScript: How to preserve email formatting when duplicating drafts in Apple Mail?,"HI!!

I'm creating a Python-based mail merge tool that uses Apple Mail drafts as templates. The goal is to duplicate the drafts, replace placeholders like \[Name\] with data from an Excel file, and retain the original formatting (bold, italics, etc.).

What’s going wrong:

The issue is that when the draft is duplicated and modified using AppleScript, the formatting of the original draft is lost. Instead, the new drafts appear in plain text.

When I run the script, the generated drafts do not contain the formatted text.

learnprogramming,Being different from the programming stereotype: is it possible to be successful in the field? ,"I'm a 17-year-old girl who's going to graduate soon and really wants to pursue a career in technology and programming. My big dilemma is that my profile doesn't match the image that people have of people who work in technology, who are very intelligent and accurate since childhood (in fact, I'd say I was the opposite of that). 

I'm not naturally good or intelligent at exact subjects, I've always had to work hard, I didn't grow up playing video games, watching anime or immersed in geek culture. I was never that student who excelled in exact sciences at school, I even had a lot of difficulty in some subjects, despite never having to recover or anything like that.

Even so, every day I become more interested, I bought books, took courses (Gustavo Guanabara was a great find in my life) and I participate in groups of programmers and students, which helps a lot, in fact, there they talk about their daily lives and their experience. in programming, on the other hand, I even feel embarrassed to join these groups because of the huge number of men, and even the girls, I haven't seen any that really look like me, they also follow a pattern.

 I tried to read a lot and research about all the difficulties and challenges, and I really believe that it really is my dream, not because of the false illusions of absurd salaries, I really love the idea of ​​working with this.

What makes me so fearful and fearful, in fact, is that the impression is becoming stronger and stronger that those who are successful have always had a natural talent for technology and exact sciences, something that I don't have even remotely, I barely know how to use it. I disagree to this day. 

This makes me wonder if I can really fit into a college (I want a federal one), for example. I would probably be overwhelmed both by the subjects I tried to learn at school and by the students and teachers who wouldn't take me seriously. Everyone I talk to about my desire takes a long time to believe, they say it “doesn't suit me” or that I should look for something else, but it's something I truly believe I love.

Anyone who has experience in the area, have you ever seen someone with a more “non-standard” profile in the area still do well? Sometimes I wonder if actually following this stereotype would make that much of a difference, but I also feel like I would be chopped into little pieces when entering a federal college, for example (I'm from Brasília, so on top of that it would be UNB).

learnprogramming,Common Misconceptions About Open-Source,"I work in OSS based company, have my own popular OSS projects, and contribute to OSS, for last 15 years. So no BS.

1\. ""If I share my code, someone will steal my idea""

The success of a project depends on people, not just the code. You can also protect yourself legally by choosing the right license.

2. ""Open-source equals free""

Open-sourcing simply means sharing your work with the public. It doesn't dictate anything about the commercial aspects of your project.

3. ""If I open-source my product, no one will buy it""

There are many ways to legally protect your product from unauthorized use. Companies take licensing seriously because violating licenses can create significant problems during audits, investments, or certifications. The risks of abusing licenses aren't worth it.

In fact, being open-source can be a major selling point, as it reduces vendor lock-in risks and helps with security audit processes.

4. ""Open-sourcing means giving away control to the community""

It's perfectly acceptable to reject community contributions that don't align with your vision. You're not obligated to build a community around your project.

5. ""Only developers can contribute to open-source""

Many projects actually struggle with user interfaces, design, documentation, and community support. Whatever your skills are, you can likely contribute meaningfully to open-source projects.

6. ""Open-source is all about code""

Open-source is fundamentally about sharing, not just code. For example, projects like [undraw.co](http://undraw.co) demonstrate how designers can contribute to the open-source community.

Remember: Open-source is a development philosophy and licensing approach that promotes transparency and collaboration. It doesn't mean giving up control, losing commercial opportunities, or limiting contributions to just code.",leonidbugaev,1hepxuq,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hepxuq/common_misconceptions_about_opensource/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hepxuq/common_misconceptions_about_opensource/,2024-12-15 10:31:02,10,0.73,10,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hepxuq

learnprogramming,Giving up programming after 5 years trying it.,"This is more of a vent than anything else, and maybe it will be useful to someone as to not give up too late as I did.

You see, Programming is an ability that much like a Soccer Player, an Artist, etc, you either can do it or you can't. You see some people simply sit in front of the keyboard, and in less than 10 seconds they write 30 lines of code, whereas others like me, even trying so hard to dig in deep into the subject, couldn't even get past my 5th line. To have that level of understanding, in less than one year some people may do what you took 3 or 4 to make.

Programming is an exceptional and amazing ability, maybe professional programmers don't see it as outsiders like me do, but if you can code, you do HAVE a really valuable ability that sooooo many people wish they had, so try not to stress that much over non important things, because you are amazing.

Unfortunately, I won't be there with you guys. The competition is harsh, and I can no longer keep being left behind in a market I can't compete. Just wanted to let it all out.

It's no shame if you're in doubt if you should quit or not. To lose a battle is natural, but as long as you can keep standing. I will still stand, but somewhere else that fits me more. It's not healthy either to keep doing something that clearly isn't giving results. It was a good (and LONG, long long) journey.

learnprogramming,"I want to work in software engineering/machine learning in the future, but I cannot study pure CS as it is hard to transfer into. Should I study Linguistics and CS, Applied Math, or Data Science if there is a possibility I will do a bootcamp in the future? What downsides are there?","For context, I am currently in my last year of transferring with three classes of math and two classes of CS already finished. I want to transfer to only UCLA or UCB. My end goal is to become a software engineer at a FAANG company or any high-paying corporation and hopefully make my own startup. However, CS is 1. Way too hard to transfer into for these college as it is only a 5% acceptance rate, and 2. I struggle with learning physics and I am not good with the hardware aspects of CS. (A separate question could be if it is better to just lock in and tackle those physics classes despite how difficult it is for me)

I know that the CS market right now is hard for new grads, especially with finding internships, so going to a boot camp after college is not out of the realm for me, in order to obtain more practical skills and apply for mid-senior level positions. However, I have heard that going to a boot camp kills your ability to understand a lot of the theoretical knowledge for CS that may not always be used, but is important for some positions and for making your own company.

Right now I am leaning towards the Ling + CS major, as I am able to learn all the courses in the CS department if I wish to, as well as learn some NLP programming which is a field that I would be happy to have more opportunities in. Right now my only concern is that if I end up learning a boot camp anyways, would it not be more useful to learn another major like Applied Math or DS that will prepare me for problem solving and ML better than a Ling + CS degree?

I guess a more broad question is this, **if my goal is to transfer into a college in the hopes of eventually working as a software engineer/machine learning or making my own startup, what would be the best major for me to pick to study with/without a boot camp?**",Kitchen_Client_8067,1helrh5,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1helrh5/i_want_to_work_in_software_engineeringmachine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1helrh5/i_want_to_work_in_software_engineeringmachine/,2024-12-15 05:23:40,0,0.38,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1helrh5

learnprogramming,Would appreciate some advice on structuring my 6-month period.,"I'm in a situation and I would really appreciate some advice.

Over the past couple months I've built the habit of working deeply for long hours and I want to translate that into learning programming- specifically C.

I have no experience programming and I've gone through this sub for a while to learn what mistakes people usually make when starting to learn. Unrealistic expectations, underestimating the workload or the time it takes to be good and not being patient. Overall, I found it usually boiled down to these factors.

Before I get started I want to make sure that I'm doing it right. And I don't mean looking for the perfect resource but making sure the way I'm going about it is not the worst.

I’ll lay out some important points regarding my situation-

\- I'm in no rush to get good at programming. I'm currently 17 years old and starting next summer i would get approximately 6 months to do whatever i want and i really want to learn the absolute basics of programming and how computers work. This of course doesn't mean I'll stop after 6 months but  I’d be joining university and i wouldn't be able to provide my undivided attention to programming. 

\- In terms of my career, I'm not really interested in being a software developer or a professional programmer. I'm interested in Data Science but it's not concrete. Either way, I think what I spend these couple months learning would help me a great deal. According to what I've read, understanding how a computer works on the most basic level- dealing with memory and storage and energy, is an important part of being a data scientist, and having a complete root fundamental understanding of how a computer works is extremely important.

\-As mentioned, over the last couple months I’ve built the habit of working consistently  everyday and as of now I'm able to dedicate around 6-7 hours of focus into whatever I'm doing. I plan to keep this up for the 6 month duration.

\- I've chosen C as being one of the first true languages, it's extremely basic (in its working not in complexity) and it gives one a pretty good understanding of how things actually go down in a computer.

\- I’m not particularly interested in learning as quickly as possible, as long as I'm understanding what I'm doing. I could for example spend weeks on a fundamental concept  that's extremely important but often gets overlooked. I don't want to take shortcuts as I'm doing this for the long run.

\- I don't particularly want to ask for the best resource , but I do appreciate recommendations of resources that specialize on the basic understanding aspect, rather than getting me job ready as fast as possible. Currently I'm finding K&amp;R to be the best option but I'm open to suggestions.

\-I have experienced tutorial hell in other spheres and it absolutely drained the life out of me. I have no intention of going through that again. I want to get committed to only a couple resources which are great that I can rely on throughout the period. I shouldn’t be switching resources and I don't want to. As a side note-  What’s the right balance between sticking to figuring out a problem yourself even if it takes a long time, to knowing when to give up and just google it?

\-I’d like to preface that all of the above is tentative and subject to change, keeping my ultimate goal of being knowledgeable about the inner workings of a computer system in mind (and eventually a data scientist/analyst), is there anything specific i should really focus on early in the process? Maybe a soft skill or a mindset shift while learning. Maybe I should focus more on hands-on stuff like breaking down an old laptop and building physical things which use code.

\- I'm aware that my entire approach could be wrong so I'm open to suggestions regarding how I should go about learning this. What is the right balance between understanding everything fundamentally from the get go and just keep messing around until you understand it eventually?

\-Although it's not a priority, i’d prefer having something tangible to show for at the end of the 6 months because this entire thing is also a way for me to show my parents that im capable and i can handle studying on my own (I eventually want to leave the country for my education but it's a hard sell. I do NOT want to study in my home country for obvious-to-everyone reasons but my parents only listen to proof of capabilities. They need external validation from a third party telling them I can actually do something). So maybe something like partaking in a competition or contributing to a project? I'm not sure how to go about it.

\-Considering I have complete control over my time,there's room for basically any routine, habit or schedule. If you have advice that might seem niche and very prerequisite-y, I would still ask for it as there's a good chance I might be able to implement it(assuming it's useful.) It doesn't even have to be directly related to programming, but a habit which would indirectly help me with my goals.

All of this has been on my mind for quite some time now, and I'm very excited at its prospect. As you could probably guess, it's not exactly set in stone. I really do believe that I can accomplish a significant amount within this time period and I'm proud of myself for that.

learnprogramming,Is CS50x Right for Me? (Need Advice Based on My Situation),"Hi everyone,

I’m considering diving into CS50x to improve my programming skills, but I wanted to get some advice to see if it’s the right fit for my situation. Here’s a bit about me:

* **Background:** I’m a 20-year-old university student majoring in Informatics, but I currently know little about programming. While I’ve taken some classes in the past, I’ve forgotten most of the content and relied heavily on AI tools for assignments, so I feel like I’m starting from scratch.
* **Current Goal:** I want to give programming one final attempt, committing fully to it with the aim of securing an internship quickly. I plan to dedicate about 6 hours a day during my winter break (Dec 15–Jan 5) to learning and building my skills.
* **Concerns:**
   1. I’m not sure if CS50x is too basic or too advanced for someone in my position.
   2. Since I’m under a time crunch, I’m wondering if CS50x is the best way to build foundational skills quickly or if I should explore other resources (e.g., The Odin Project, LeetCode, or specific internship prep courses).
   3. I’ll be juggling a heavy course load after my break, so I want to use my free time wisely.

For those who’ve taken CS50x, do you think it’s a good fit for someone with my background and goals? Would it help me build a strong enough foundation to start applying for internships after completing it, or should I pair it with other resources?

learnprogramming,Struggling with Math for Algorithms,"Hey everyone, I’m 24 and heading back to school next semester after not touching math seriously for over six years. I’ve done about 90% of CS50x and nearly finished CS50 Python, plus some background in C and Python. I’m really enjoying Python lately, but I’m noticing that a lot of algorithm courses assume a strong math background—especially for complex problems, induction proofs, and more advanced techniques.

I picked up “Everything You Need to Ace Pre-Algebra and Algebra 1” but feel overwhelmed. I learn best through videos and hands-on practice, and while “Grokking Algorithms” is a great, simplified start, it’s not digging into the deeper math or theory. The most complex data structure I’ve handled was a linked list in C (which felt more tangible with malloc and all), but in Python it’s straightforward to just use lists without understanding the lower-level details. I really want to build a solid foundation so I can confidently tackle more complex algorithmic challenges, but my weak math background is holding me back.

learnprogramming,Is IT just not for me? [Ranting],"TL;DR: I feel miserable studying IT. Should I quit it and do something else? What can I pursue?

Howdie!

I'm a 16 years old guy living in Russia (becoming 17 yo in 5 days). I'm in my 10'th year of school (out of 11) and in the 10'th year of school in my city (just the city, not the country), a student must pick what they want to study in order to do specialized preparation for state exams and university enrollment. The choice is: medicine, engineering, IT, business/economics, media and psychology/teaching. There is no middle ground for those who can't decide; to add more, our schools don't have any kind of guidance counselling, nor any sort of career guidance at all! We must just know what we want to do in the future already.

I knew about this system since I was 10 and I've been desperately trying to figure out what I'm good at for more than 6 years already. I had been reading tons of articles for years, tried learning natural sciences, game developing, writing literature (fictional and non fictional), learning languages, translating and localizing, drawing, composing music, 3D modeling, video editing and so many other things I can't even remember all of them. That's how I found Reddit, by the way. I learned English mostly by reading the discussions here.

However, instead of finding something I want to do as a career, I gained even more doubts because what I liked and became passionate about (reading and writing, composing music, translating and localizing) are either low-paying or dying careers.

The only things I became certain about are:

1. I have bad spatial reasoning. I have tough time imagining and visualing even basic figures in 3D.
2. I work better with abstract, non-visual concepts and information (texts, maths outside of geometry, tables, theoretical informatics)
3. I do everything slowly, but carefully. If someone rushes me, I become even slower and my work becomes way worse due to the stress. I've been rushed by my teachers and classmates through my whole school life.
4. The subjects at school I do the best and enjoy the most are english, russian, literature, algebra and informatics (we didn't study programming, only abstract theory about how information works, not even in computers).

I picked IT because I enjoyed informatics and it could lead to a better career than, say, media. It's been the 4'th month and I'm devastated.

First of all, we're already expected to know how to programm in C++ with Arduino and in Python with libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyQT and Flask). Nobody's teaching us programming at school at all, but whenever we're failing, the teachers reply 'But you're programmers! You must know it already!' and refuse to help. I'm using ChatGPT to complete the tasks and I feel very guilty for it. I wanted to learn how to programm, but instead of explaining a bit, we're just thrown to practice immediately.

Second of all, we're studying in person for 48 hours a week (from monday to friday). We must attend a college every tuesday and university every wednesday.

Moreover, we have loads of homework from the school, university, college, and we must make 2 individual projects with a deadline in a month. The projects must be complex, absolutely new and demanded, they should contain at least a thousand of lines of code in Python without any empty lines. We must also watch and read online lectures from school and university and complete tests after them. We do a lot of statics, dynamics and 3D mechanical drawing besides the main curriculum and I suck at it (bad spatial reasoning).

That's definetely not what I expected and including the fact I'm not burning with a passion for computers and programming in general, this led me to a miserable life. I just had some sort of interest, but it's not enough to bear all of the pressure from school. I experience insane amounts of stress, having mental breakdowns and weeping in horror every week, my head and spine constantly hurt, even though I was in great health just half a year ago. I started forgetting things after several minutes (my memory's been good throughout my life). I feel how I'm going insane and it terrifies me. My grades at maths, informatics and physics are getting worse and worse.

My classmates, on the other hand, are mostly chill and enjoy doing what we're told to do. A lot of them are really passionate about programming and computers. Some were taking programming courses and made personal projects before. They're not only able to keep up with the pace, they're even asking for more tasks and lessons.

This has brought me to think if I should quit studying IT if I'm not passionate about it. Should I do it? If so, what else could I study, considering my self-assessment?

I do have a tiny bit of experience with 3D modeling and digital art as a hobby (maya and a bit of blender) and I wonder if there’s a way to tie that into a career path maybe in game dev? or if it’s better to focus on something like any of the above?

I’m also unsure about where to study. Should I go for an intensive bootcamp, take a longer course, or try self-teaching?

I’ve recently started competitive programming, and I’m finding it challenging to solve even 800-rated problems on platforms like Codeforces. Here’s a bit of context about my current situation:

1. **My Background**:
   * I’m comfortable with the basics of C++ (loops, arrays, if-else, etc.) but haven’t done much problem-solving before.
2. **Where I Struggle**:
   * Understanding problem statements: Sometimes, the language is too confusing for me to break down the question.
   * Coming up with the right logic or approach: I don’t yet recognize patterns like greedy, simulation, or brute force.
   * Solving within constraints: Concepts like O(n) or time complexity are still new to me.
3. **Example Problem**: For instance, I recently tried this 800-rated question *""Alyona and a Square Jigsaw Puzzle""* on Codeforces. Even though it’s labeled as a beginner problem, I couldn’t figure out how to approach it. The editorial solution felt complex, and I’m not sure how to think like that.
4. **What I Need Help With**:
   * How do I get better at breaking down and understanding problems?
   * What’s the best way to practice and improve? Should I stick to Codeforces or try other platforms first?
   * Are there specific resources or guides that helped you when you were at this stage?

learnprogramming,Unsure how to move forward with project for Java Fundamentals class,"This is my second time asking this subreddit's help for my lessons... As I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding them, and have only been learning Java for this school semester, but that's a whole other topic... I reached out to my teacher over a week ago now, and received no response or help, so this is a last resort for me...

We have to design an inventory system for this project in Eclipse IDE. I followed and replicated the lessons as closely as possible. There are two classes in the project, named Product.java and ProductTester.java. The project at this stage is intended to print out the inventory products and information in some way, but prints nothing when the program is run. The code is as follows.

For Product.java:

    package inventory;
    
    public class Product {
      //instance field declarations
      private String name;
      private double price;
      private int qty;
      private int number;
    
      //default constructor
      public Product(String string, double d, int q, int n) {
      }
    
      //mutator methods
      public void setName() {
        this.name = name;}
      public void setPrice() {
        this.price = price;}
      public void setQty() {
        this.qty = qty;}
      public void setNumber() {
        this.number = number;}
    
      //accessor methods 
      public String getName() {
        return name;}
      public double getPrice() {
        return price;}
      public int getQty() {
        return qty;}
      public int getNumber() {
        return number;}
    
      //toString return
      public String toString() {
        return ""Name: "" + name +""\n"" + ""Price: "" + price + ""\n"" + ""Units: "" + qty + ""\n"" + ""Item       Number: "" + number;}
    }

For every line of code under the ""mutator methods"" comment, it reads ""The assignment to variable (x) has no effect"". Having these methods were outlined in the project requirements.

For ProductTester.java:

    package inventory;
    
    public class ProductTester {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
        Product p1 = new Product(""Pens"", 13.99, 50, 0001);
        Product p2 = new Product(""Sticky notes"", 16.99, 70, 0002);
        Product p3 = new Product(""Office tape"", 20.99, 50, 0003);
        Product p4 = new Product(""Calendars"", 6.99, 20, 0004);
        Product p5 = new Product(""Envelopes"", 13.39, 100, 0005);
        Product p6 = new Product(""Binders"", 6.49, 50, 0006);
      }//end method main
    }

For every variable assignment, it reads ""The value of the local variable (p1, p2, etc) is not used"".

I've been programming off and on since the late 80's and have used a bunch of different languages. However, I haven't programmed for almost ten years since I worked on my EE (Computer Eng) degree (long story). 

I know that there have been some changes in what is common/best for different uses now so I'm looking for a recommendation for: Cross-platform desktop application development but programmed in a Linux environment to start. Application would need to load/save XML, be able to draw basic line drawings, and have multiple resizable/toggled window areas. Basic productivity type application that might consume a ton of memory.

So, what should I use? I've seen NW.js talked about but that seems a bit passe and possibly lacking in power. I know Rust is big right now, but I've also seen some negative comments about using it for desktop app development.

learnprogramming,Question about using C and C++ files together,"There was an interesting problem (for me) with C and C++ files that was fixed in a way I don't understand. I would love it for someone to explain a little bit how this actually works (and if it's proper usage):

Basically I have C library that needs to run some C++ class's code. But the C file does not include any C++ files.

myCFile.c:

    SetSwitchValue( 0 );

myCFile.h:

    #include ""extern.h""

extern.h:

    extern void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value );

The .cpp files:

Connector.cpp:

    #include ""Connector.h""
    extern ""C"" void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value ) {
      // some code
    }

Connector.h:

    extern ""C"" void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value );

That's the setup and it compiles. Nowhere in the C source and header files is `Connector.h` ever included. When I did add `#include ""Connector.h""` directly in `myCFile.h` without going through `extern.h,` there were errors, mainly:

    Connector.h:18:8: error: expected identifier or '(' before string constant
       18 | extern ""C"" void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value );

Why is this the case? Why does one work when the other doesn't? What's happening with the compiler?

But honestly, I feel like I understand concepts better when watching tutorials. They give me a step-by-step breakdown, and I can follow along without feeling overwhelmed. On the other hand, diving straight into documentation feels intimidating and too abstract sometimes. 😓 but documentation has more content than tutorials .

learnprogramming,I'm tired of Front-End Development. I've lost my passion and need something more exciting.,"TL;DR: I'm a first-year computer science student who's been learning front-end development for two years, but I'm burned out from working on layouts and animations. I want to explore something more engaging with possibility to build huge projects.



Hi, I'm a first-year computer science student from Poland. I've been learning front-end development for about two years, on and off. I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript well. I also know how to work with SQL databases using PHP and have a basic understanding of React. Thanks to my college and high school, I've learned the syntax and general basics of C++ and Python, though I haven’t tried applying them to practical projects yet. I've just made some easier console apps and solved few leetcode problems with these two.

Over the past few years, I’ve completed many web projects, starting with simple forms, followed by Odin Project exercises like Tic-Tac-Toe, and even larger websites, such as a fully usable gym site with login system or an online store with huge database.

The problem is that constantly choosing matching fonts, centering divs, and adding dark modes has become exhausting. It feels like the only thing left for me is learning more libraries and frameworks to make my code faster and my websites prettier. But creating smoother button animations no longer gives me satisfaction, to the point where nowadays, I only log in once every few days to do one or two LeetCode problems.

I’m the kind of person who loves expanding projects and adding new features. The project I’ve spent the most time on was a console-based RPG game in Python. I worked on it every day for weeks, adding new bosses and weapon upgrades, and to this day, it’s the most exciting thing I’ve ever worked with.

Next year, I’ll have to choose a specialization for my college (I don't know about the USA computer science, but in Poland there is something like specialization where you have to choose what exactly do you want to learn).

learnprogramming,"Best resources to learn Python (ultimately, machine learning)?","Hey people, hope you're having a great day;

I wanted to ask which are the best resources out there for learning and mastering python, i started with R since my field would be data analysis and prediction projects (i guess ultimately neural networks \[i apologize for my apparent ignorance, that's why i'm here\]) but i found out Python has everything R can do and much more.

As of right now i have already taken the Introduction and Intermediate Python courses on DataCamp, i plan to go ahead with Data Manipulation with pandas and matplotlib, to then go for Statistics in Python and ultimately Introduction to Machine Learning in Python; i am also planning to participate in Kaggle tournaments but i just want to make sure this is the right track.

(I have seen the first few videos of CS50, but i don't like my rhythm being dependent on a video, i have my own pace and would like better to learn in the most practical way, i need to see the objective or the functionality of something in order to fully understand; i know CS50 has its own environment and its own mini projects for learning but i need something more dynamic, to me, the best way to learn is by fucking up.)

My ultimate goal is literally to be a problem solver, i want to be able to build projects regardless of the field, be it marketing, marine biology, trading, economics, optimization of any kind, etc. As you can probably guess i am pretty new to this, i barely started this journey on december 10th.

I do not want to discard any alternative, be it learn other languages, go to another platform, or rectify my idea of what i need to do in order to achieve my goal; i live in a country where data science and programming is really neglected and want to show people within my reach how big this field is and how it will be the future of everything, i have always thought that in 5 years, not knowing how to program will be the equivalent to not knowing how to read in medieval times.

I usually approach it like the classical structure: 

    src

    -- models
    -- services
    -- utils
    index.ts 

The thing is, I don't know how to separate these logics to different services/ managers/ utilities/ functions etc. How can I learn this? Most of the project tutorials just simply says ""I'll create the ExpenseService"" but doesn't tell you why it's a service or a manager.

I am open to communicate with people from anywhere in the world, but it would be great if it was mostly people from England, as I would like to be able to meet in person in the future.

I'm learning Python and want to improve my skills with others who already know a bit of the language. My goal is to create projects, share experiences and grow together.

Besides Python, I am also interested in Machine Learning and am looking for people who want to get into this field or are already involved in it to work together on projects and share knowledge. I also want to learn and discuss statistics - would be happy if someone joins.

If anyone is interested in Frontend or Backend (e.g. Flask), that's welcome too. This will give us the opportunity to create quality web interfaces for our projects.

I would also like to add that I am not a native English speaker, and by working in this community I aim to improve my spoken English. I am open to communication, and I think it will help all of us to learn and grow together!

I plan to use Discord for communication and collaboration, so if you want to improve your skills in Python, Machine Learning, Flask or statistics, we'd be happy to work together!

If you're interested, drop me a line in the comments or private messages. I would be glad to meet you and start working on projects together!

I have tried using the keyboard library with the is\_pressed function, adding if statements, the pastes continue. I have tried pynput with keyboard listeners, the pastes continue. I am slipping.

learnprogramming,knapsack like problem,"I have a problem that seems to be a Knapsack problem, however  I find it hard to apply the Knapsack algorithm because all the weights change depending on what is already in the Knapsack.

The problem is: I have a DB of movie directors and their movies. And I have a db of streaming providers. I want to select one or multiple movie directors and find the cheapest combination of streaming services that allows me to watch the most movies from those directors.

Brute-forcing through all the possible streaming services is infeasible. Applying Knapsack doesn't work because one movie can be streamed by multiple platforms. So the value that putting streaming platform A into the Knapsack depends on all the items already in the Knapsack.

His free stuff is great, but I really recommend you buy the full experience if you have skme extra cash to spend.

learnprogramming,"5 years of experience, 4 months without a job, anxiety issues, and gaps in modern technologies – what should I do next?","Hey everyone,

I’m facing a dilemma and need your advice. I have 5 years of experience as a full-stack developer, primarily in a small company where I was the sole programmer. I built websites (with custom CMS), CRM applications, and e-commerce systems from scratch. The main technologies I worked with were HTML, CSS, JS (formerly jQuery), GSAP, PHP, and MySQL. I would receive designs (from Figma/Adobe) and client requirements, and then complete the project from start to finish.

However, for the past 4 months, I’ve been unemployed, and I suffer from anxiety, which adds a lot of stress. On top of that, programming is my passion, and I deeply miss it. The issue is that I never chased higher salaries, I just loved the work itself. Now I realize that technology has advanced, and I feel like I’m falling behind. I don’t have experience with tools like **React, Laravel, Next.js, Docker, Kubernetes** – and I’ve never even used **GitHub**. In my previous job, I worked alone, handling everything from code to deployment (FTP), and I did all my local work on my own computer using **XAMPP** instead of a proper Git or CI/CD workflow. Now I see that focusing on performance over learning new tools was a mistake.

**My questions:**

1. **What should I do next?** I’m lacking motivation and don’t know which path to take. Should I focus on learning **React**? Although I’ve done full-stack projects in the past, I don’t feel confident about keeping up with both frontend and backend simultaneously. I’ve always learned through practical experience – solving tasks rather than focusing on theory – and I’m worried I won’t perform well in technical interviews where they test theoretical knowledge. This is especially scary since I’ve never been through a formal job interview before.
2. **Will 4 months off cause me to forget everything I know?** I feel like as I try to catch up on new frontend topics (like JS), I’m losing touch with backend skills (PHP). Is this just an illusion, or can you actually lose skills that fast?
3. **How should I structure my learning?** I tend to be a perfectionist and have trouble knowing when to move on to the next topic. I feel like I can’t master both the frontend (React) and backend (PHP/Laravel) at the same time. I want to focus on frontend right now, but in the future, I still dream of building full applications from A to Z, as I’ve done in the past. However, with the current pressure to learn frameworks, I’m not sure how to manage both. How should I plan my learning for the next 3 months to maximize my chances on the job market?
4. **Has anyone been in a similar situation?** How did you deal with job gaps, stress, and catching up on modern technologies? Is my perfectionism slowing me down, or is it actually a good strategy?

# My Experience:

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS (no experience with SASS/LESS, used Tailwind once but found it simple), jQuery, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Swiper, JS (DOM manipulation, form validation, handling JSON returned from PHP, animations).

**Backend:** PHP (no frameworks, mainly CRUD operations, database/file handling, generating PDFs, processing Excel data, managing user roles, handling forms and sending emails, payment gateway integration, API integration), MySQL (database design, query optimization, indexing).

**What I’ve done:** Built websites, CMS systems, CRM apps, applications with payment gateways (PayU, parcel locker integration), PDF generation, database management, API creation.

**Concerns:** I’m afraid that lacking modern technologies in my CV makes me unattractive in the current job market, and my anxiety only amplifies those concerns. Should I apply for jobs even if I don’t meet all the requirements? Or should I focus on catching up with new skills first? I feel stuck because I’ve never been through a recruitment process, and that scares me.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer!",guffcio,1hcxw6r,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcxw6r/5_years_of_experience_4_months_without_a_job/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcxw6r/5_years_of_experience_4_months_without_a_job/,2024-12-12 22:57:37,19,0.91,19,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcxw6r

learnprogramming,From Programmer to Plumber and back to Programming ,"Hello Everyone , i moved in United States (New York) in December 2023 through green card .

I was a software developer back at my country for 4 years with a very good paying job and a very good work life balance. I had a lot of time to do also side projects and learn new things even at work which was very nice and challenging because we were always implementing new stuff and it was very fun. 

Fast forward leaving my country for US it was a hard decision but because of the experience i thought why not do it let me try and maybe i can find a job and make my dream come true to work on a high-rise building in Manhattan.

4Months i didn't find a single thing applying and applying the same thing every day and so i decided to start plumbing for prevailing wage which i waås getting good money for. Approx 1800-1900$ every week 

So i went from a programmer to a plumber . I know it's a funny stroy but you gotta do whatever to survive and anyways last month that job came to an end and i haven't found a new job yet. So basically i'm not liking United States that much anymore and i really wanna go back even though we might start a new prevailing wage job which pays a lot of money/per week. I just wanna go back at my country and do programming which i find interest on doing and have been doing so for weeks .   
  
I just wanna know what you guys think in general about this whole situtation ?  
Would you go back and quit getting a passport you have an opportunity or  work something totally different like i did on plumbing to get some money but you don't like doing it at all and you feel like do are doing it just to survive ?

learnprogramming, Good libraries for automating logins on websites? ,"In my country (Sweden) we have lots of housing companies, some of them state owned, that build and own apartment complexes all over the country, many of which provide housing queues that allows anybody to queue for an apartment.

learnprogramming,I cannot seem to understand pseudocode or the assignments given to me.,"So for context I’m about to graduate from highschool but the only thing I need is an elective which is why I chose a course that had to do with advanced applications (pretty much teaching how to use word, excel, and PowerPoint.) I competed that one and I’m now on introduction to programming. I’ve read the text book that was provided to me and have turned in 3 projects and 2 out of the 3 were wrong, the ones that I thought were good were wrong but the one I felt was off and wrong was correct. My point to this little rant is I need help understanding how to create pseudocode, I understand loops and do-while statements but I don’t understand what they exactly want from my project to be correct. For the assignment I’m working on now I need to design a program with validation functions, and it has to validate that fat grams and calories aren’t less than 0 and ensure that the number of calories entered isn’t greater than fat grams * 9. 


I completely understand that I have to do this assignment on my own and am not seeking someone to MAKE the pseudocode for me rather i am asking for someone to help me understand how to create pseudocode like this.

learnprogramming,How to write great documentation for your project,"When I first started working on different projects, I really struggled with documentation. But after a lot of trial and error, I learned a lot about writing clear and helpful docs. Working on several open-source projects has also taught me just how essential good documentation is to the success of a project. So, I'd like to share with you some of the tips that have helped me improve (in the hope that they will save you the same headaches I've experienced😂):

1️⃣ **Guide first**  
Start with simple guides that focus on common use cases to help users get started quickly.

2️⃣ **Show, don’t tell**  
Use screenshots &amp; screencasts early &amp; often to visually demonstrate features.

3️⃣ **More code than text**  
Prioritize clear, working code examples over lengthy text explanations.

4️⃣ **Use plausible data**  
Craft realistic data in examples to help users better relate &amp; apply them to their projects. I use [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev)for this.

5️⃣ **Examples as stories**  
Write examples in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to ensure accuracy &amp; consistency between code &amp; visuals.

6️⃣ **The reference follows the guide**  
If an advanced user is looking for all possible options of a component, they can find them in the same place as the guide.

7️⃣ **Pages can be scanned quickly**  
Break content into short, digestible sections for quick navigation and easy reading.

8️⃣ **Features have several names**  
Use multiple terms for the same feature to improve searchability.

9️⃣ **Document features multiple times**  
Cover features in different contexts (guides, HowTos, references) to enhance discovery.

🔟 **Overview section**s  
Provide high-level summaries of feature groups to help users grasp concepts before diving into details.

1️⃣1️⃣ **Beginner mode**  
Offer a simplified view of the doc to avoid overwhelming new users.

1️⃣2️⃣ Eat your own dog food  
Regularly use your own doc to spot usability issues &amp; improve user experience.

Here's a [doc example](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/documentation.html) where I've tried to implement these ‘best practices’.

learnprogramming,How to import a function from a Javascript module and use it inside a HTML page?,"This is a seemingly simple problem but I don't know why I'm struggling with it. Could it be a syntax issue?

I have a HTML page and a Javascript file. I have a function inside that Javascript file that simply returns a string. I want to print that string to the console on my html page.

The html file is like this (simplified):

    &lt;html&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;script type=""module""&gt;

    &lt;/html&gt;

And the Javascript file called Robot.js is like this:

    function sayHi(){
      console.log(""Hi"");
      return ""Hi"";
    }
    
    export sayHi;

Nothing happens. My console is blank. As you can see the sayHi function is printing to the console as well as returning a string.

I have also structured my Robot.js file like this:

    export default function sayHi(){
      console.log(""Hi"");
      return ""Hi"";
    }

But it doesn't seem to work.

learnprogramming,Mastery in programming ,"
Hey devs,

I’m planning out the next three years of my development journey and aiming to achieve proficiency (if not mastery) in Flutter, Python, and React. My ultimate goal is to build apps that integrate AI/ML into both mobile and web projects.

Here’s my rough timeline:
	1.	Focus exclusively on Flutter for 8-10 months to build strong app development skills.
	2.	Transition to React for web development and spend about a year mastering it.
	3.	Dive into Python, focusing heavily on AI and ML in the final year.

I’m currently dedicating 45+ hours per week to studying and building projects, so I have the time and drive to make this happen.

My questions:
	1.	Is this plan realistic for a three-year time frame?
	2.	Should I overlap learning these technologies, or stick to sequential learning as outlined?
	3.	What are some must-have resources or strategies for progressing efficiently in each of these areas?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s attempted a similar journey or has experience with these tech stacks. Any advice, roadmap tips, or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

learnprogramming,Advice for a novice ,"Hey, guys, 

I've been learning Java for a month and a half now.  I've went through Types and Variables, Conditional Statements,Loops and just heard what Arrays are. To be honest, math was never a strong side of mine, I have not practised math in years. So I am solving problems to get in a bootcamp if I decide, but once I look at some problem if I can not solve it under 2-3 minutes, I just go to the solution, as I do not have an idea how to solve it.  May you advise if the problems are friendly for a novice with just over a month and let's say 1-2 hour 4-5 days a week of writting code or watching videos. As well, any tips on studying such as models for studying etc. 

2 example loop problems:

Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N and prints a matrix like in the examples below. Use two nested loops.

# Input

* The input will always consist of a single line, which contains the number N

Bob and Elly.have very weird taste - their last idea of fun is calculating the ""distance"" that a word is from a given number. The distance is calculated by summing the position in the alphabet of each letter in the word and than finding the absolute difference between that word and another predefined number. You are a programmer so you must ruin their fun by automating the process.

Examples:

* word 'bob', number = 22, distance = 3 ('b' + 'o' + 'b' = 2 + 15 + 2 = 19)
* word 'bob', number = 10, distance = 9

Write a program that calculates the distance for each string and also outputs the average distance.

# Input

* The input consists of several lines.
* **T** \- the target number
* **N** \- the number of words to follow
* on the next **N** lines - each word on a new line

# Output

* Output consists of **N + 1** lines
* First N lines - word + its distance in format `word distance`
* Last line - the average distance, rounded to two digits after the decimal point

# Constraints

* Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase english alphabet letters

learnprogramming,Help to solve this exercise,"**Efficient Container Stacking Algorithm - Practice Problem**

I'm working on a problem related to algorithm design and would appreciate any help or suggestions. Here’s the scenario:

In a commercial port, goods are transported in containers. When unloading a ship at the terminal, it's crucial to use the smallest possible surface area. To achieve this, the containers need to be stacked optimally.

We have **N containers** (numbered from 1 to N), all with the same dimensions. For each container, we are given:

1. Its **weight**.
2. Its **maximum load capacity** (i.e., the total weight it can support on top of it).

The goal is to stack as many containers as possible in a single pile while respecting these constraints:

1. A container can only be placed directly on top of another.
2. A container cannot be placed on top of another with a **larger serial number**.
3. The total weight of all containers placed on top of a container cannot exceed that container’s **maximum load capacity**.

# Input Format

* The number of containers, **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 800).
* For each container, two integers: its **weight** (wᵢ ≤ 5000) and its **maximum load capacity** (cᵢ ≤ 5000).

# Output Format

* The **maximum number of containers** that can be stacked.
* The **serial numbers** of the containers in ascending order that form the pile.

# Example

**Input:**

    21  
    168 157  
    156 419  
    182 79  
    67 307

    122 118  
    58 308

    3 84  
    

**Output:**

    Number of containers: 13

learnprogramming,"So my cs final is today, a rant","Basically, I passed the first midterm with a C and miserably failed the 2nd. This means i need to pass this final to pass the class. I have been severely lacking motivation for the past two semesters, and with the way my college is, everything is practically self taught.

CS1 was taught in python. We learnt the basics of it, learned recursion (which is still a confusing topic for me), and that’s about the extent of it. This was around 3.5 months. Now CS2, which is the class I am now retaking after last semester practically humbled me. CS2 is taught in java, not python. They do this to teach object oriented programming, though in this case they should just teach in java from the beginning but ohhh dear. CS2 is also heavily focused on data structures. I consider it a data structure course.

This final is on generics, which hmm ok I guess, binary search trees, not worried about that. Tries. Very worried about that. Heaps/priority queues. I watched Abdul’s lecture on youtube, I understand them so well I could reteach it, can’t apply it in code. Hash tables. Quite worried about that, but maybe I can figure it out. Self balancing binary trees, specifically red/black. Lord help me I don’t understand them

I have studied 2 days straight, using leetcode after learning something to try and apply it considering time is limited. It’s worked to an extent, leetcode isn’t necessarily beginner. Today, the final is at 4. That gives me another few hours to try to wrap my head around everything I still lack understanding in so that I can at the very least write my responses in pseudocode. If you’re wondering how I figure out homework… I don’t. There was a time I would. I really do enjoy coding, don’t get me wrong. If I understand it, it’s very fun. I have not been understanding.

learnprogramming,Seeking a mentor to help me transition to top-tier software engineering roles,"Hi!  
  
For the past decade, I’ve been working on various IT projects, primarily as an SDET. Two years ago, I decided to transition into a Backend Engineer role. However, I’ve come to realize that my coding practices, knowledge, and the projects I’ve contributed to are far from optimal. Despite having 10+ years of experience, I’d currently rate myself as a mid-level developer.

Recently, I made a bold decision to quit my job and dedicate myself entirely to learning, with an ambitious ultimate goal: to become skilled enough to confidently apply for top-tier software engineering positions (e.g., OpenAI, Tesla, FAANG, etc.).

To achieve this, I’m seeking a mentor who can guide me through projects and help me elevate my knowledge and skills to that level.

**What am I looking for in a mentor?**

* **Experience:** The mentor should currently be where I aspire to be in the future.
* **Commitment:** The mentor must be willing to participate in regular meetings (1–2 times a week, depending on availability) to track my progress. Additionally, occasional ad-hoc meetings may be needed to address specific challenges or questions as they arise.
* **Guidance:** The mentor should help create a personalized roadmap of skills and projects to focus on.

My main areas of interest are **AI** (where I have limited experience) and **blockchain** (where I’ve already worked in the industry for a few years).

Of course, I’m offering compensation for this mentorship.

If you’re someone who fits this description—or know someone who does—I’d greatly appreciate your advice or recommendations.

learnprogramming,Struggling to Understand next and path Output Order in Floyd-Warshall Algorithm 😫,"Hey everyone,



I’ve been grappling with the Floyd-Warshall algorithm lately, and honestly, it’s been a real pain. Specifically, the way the next and path matrices handle the output order of nodes in the shortest path is driving me crazy.



Here’s the deal:



When I use the next matrix to reconstruct the path, the nodes are output from front to back.

But when I use the path (predecessor) matrix, the nodes come out from back to front.

I understand the theoretical difference between them, but what’s really tripping me up is why initializing next\[i\]\[j\] = j and updating it with next\[i\]\[j\] = next\[i\]\[k\] results in front-to-back output, whereas initializing path\[i\]\[j\] = i and updating it with path\[i\]\[j\] = path\[k\]\[j\] leads to back-to-front output. I just can’t wrap my head around the mechanics of it.



When I try to simulate the process manually, it feels like trying to untangle a knot. Every time I think I’ve got it figured out, something breaks, and I’m left more confused than before. The initialization and update rules make sense on paper, but translating that into a mental model or even a hand-drawn simulation is excruciatingly difficult. It’s frustrating because I know these concepts are crucial, but no matter how many times I go over them, they just don’t click.



Has anyone else been through this struggle? How did you overcome the confusion between next and path matrices in Floyd-Warshall? Any tips, explanations, or even just commiseration would be greatly appreciated. Sometimes it feels like I’m the only one stuck on this, and that’s really disheartening.



Thanks for reading and for any support you can offer!

learnprogramming,"What exactly does ""experience and knowledge equivalent to a bachelors degree"" look like?","I'm a 19 year old programmer, who started programming in high school, I did about 3 years of computer science classes there, and it felt like decent progress, but the more I learned I naturally found there was more I still needed to learn. My main interest is game development, and I've dabbled around mostly in Godot.  
  
Afterwards, I went to college, tried to suffer through the prereqs, especially math and... The combination of struggling so hard in math even with assistance from tutors, and all of these other random classes I needed to take for general education was so draining. It felt like it sucked the little motivation I already had, and didn't leave any left for me to learn about the things I wanted to learn, like programming. I couldn't take it anymore, so I dropped out after a couple months into my second year.

Most of my time programming since high school has been working on passion projects and game jams, sometimes with a few other people in a team. Admittedly, it feels like I've been less and less productive since high school when it comes to coding and learning. So stating I have 5 years of experience feels like a bit of an overselling.

Right now, I'm at the stage of continuing my main passion project, and looking for jobs, hoping to start a programming related career. It is extremely discouraging, I hear so many people telling me I need to go back to college if I want a chance. I'm told there is no point because AI will take over my career path and at best raise the bar for skill I need for a job. I won't make good money unless I earn a degree. (my interest is not about making a lot of money) College is not an option, I was so unhappy there, I don't want to go back. I know its possible to learn on my own, but I feel directionless.

Looking around at job postings, almost every position, whether its an internship or a job seems to require you to be pursuing a degree or graduating by a certain date. It's beginning to feel hopeless. Usually the best I can find is ""bachelors degree or equivalent experience and understanding"".

How do I know if I have reached this level of understanding? What exactly am I expected to know and be good at? What do I need to do to get to this point? Where can I learn these things effectively? It doesn't help that I already doubt how capable I am, it feels like I start to learn and use a new language, and feel like I forgot everything when I go back to the language I used before. I get stuck on an issue or a bug, and I tell myself ""There's no way I'm ready for a job if I can't even figure this out"".

tldr: what concepts/understanding/capabilities am I expected to know/have when I claim I have an equivalent experience and understanding to someone with bachelors degree? This goes for software and game development, I know they are likely different.

learnprogramming,Am i crazy? Or is the documentation not for beginners trying to learn whatsoever?,"Its way too complicated. I tried using cppreference to refresh myself on arrays. for those curious this page: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array)

After being lost for 5 minutes I found myself just asking chatGPT who promptly told me ""std::array&lt;Type, Size&gt; name;"" And then followed it up with a basic example using a for loop. 

now over on cppreference where im supposed to ""just look at the documentation dude"" and it says right off the bat: ""This container is an aggregate type with the same semantics as a struct holding a [C-style array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/array) T\[N\] as its only non-static data member. Unlike a C-style array, it doesn't decay to T\* automatically. As an aggregate type, it can be initialized with [aggregate-initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization) given at most `N` initializers that are convertible to `T`: std::array&lt;int, 3&gt; a = {1, 2, 3}; ""  HUH? 

Ok maybe that was just a mistake... scrolls down:

  
""The struct combines the performance and accessibility of a C-style array with the benefits of a standard container, such as knowing its own size, supporting assignment, random access iterators, etc.

`std::array` satisfies the requirements of [*Container*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container) and [*ReversibleContainer*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ReversibleContainer) except that default-constructed array is not empty and that the complexity of swapping is linear, satisfies the requirements of [*ContiguousContainer*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousContainer),(since C++17) and partially satisfies the requirements of [*SequenceContainer*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SequenceContainer).

There is a special case for a zero-length array (`N == 0`). In that case, array.begin() == array.end(), which is some unique value. The effect of calling front() or back() on a zero-sized array is undefined.

An array can also be used as a tuple of `N` elements of the same type.""

All of this gobledigook and they STILL havnt just given me the basic syntax: array + data type inside of &lt;&gt; and the amount of elements.

learnprogramming,How to actually get good at programming,"## What Programming is About

In my view, programming has two main components: problem
solving (including debugging) and system design (a.k.a.
architecture). Problem solving is figuring out how to get the
computer to do what you want it to do. Practicing Leetcode is
practicing problem solving. But Leetcode tends to be a certain
kind of problem solving, that is more focused on math and
algorithms than regular day-to-day problem solving is. You
don't necessarily need to be super good at Leetcode to be a
decent programmer. (Small rant: An algorithm, by the way, is not
just any program, or piece of a program. An algorithm is a
description of how to solve a well-defined problem (like
sorting), that is guaranteed to work every time, in finite time.
""The Youtube algorithm"", for example, is a poor use of the word,
since it does not solve a well-defined problem. If you study
algorithms, you will see that things called algorithms, for
example ""Dijkstra's algorithm"", have these properties.)

System design is about putting a lot of parts together into a
big system without making an unmaintainable mess. It's all about
eliminating complexity. What is complexity? It's when the parts
or aspects of something are intertwined (or complected) such
that they are not independent. Let me give you an example.
Imagine you want to buy 5 eggs. But at the store they only sell
eggs in packs of 12. Now you have a problem, because you need to
buy 7 more than you wanted. This is because the product eggs has
been complected with the amount 12. I hope you see that the
problem here stems from things not being independent. And
unless you can intuit it, let me tell you that complexity always
leads to problems---it is always bad. Let me repeat something I
said earlier, but you might not have thought much about: System
design *is about eliminating complexity, nothing more*. The
SOLID principles, for example, are all special cases of
eliminating complexity. [Here is a brilliant, important talk on simplicity that
you should watch religiously.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4)

While problem solving is essential, system design is almost more
important. Why? Because most hard problems you will run into
have already been solved, like problems with text searching,
graphs, databases, network protocols, etc. If you just know the
terminology you can google your way to solutions to all hard and
reasonably common problems. But you need to be decent at problem
solving, so you can solve most of your own day-to-day problems
yourself. But a lot of people get to a decent level at problem
solving. What sets programmers apart is mostly system design,
and you can't solve system design problems as easily by
googling.

Notice that I have not said anything about memorizing a certain
language or framework. Sure, you need to know at least one
language, but that's not what programming is about. Learning a
framework is easy once you know how to program.

## How to Get Good at Programming

Getting good at programming is mostly about practice (I'll get
to the ""mostly"" part later). This should be obvious, but
apparently it is not, given the amount of posts I see here about
watching tutorials, memorizing languages and frameworks, and
people wanting to be told how to do things. But you can't learn
programming by being told how to do it, in the same way that you
can't learn to play chess well by being told how to do it.
That's why chess engines are AI programs that practice against
themselves or other AI programs; a programmer and a chess grand
master can not sit down and explain how to do it (i.e. program
it).

So as a beginner, what do you do? You learn a language from a
book or proper course (not Youtube). While learning a language
you should solve small problems and experiment yourself. The
book or course hopefully has exercises. When you have done that
you move on to projects. With projects you will practice both
problem solving and system design. If you feel stuck, there are
only two solutions you should consider (if you actually learned
the language); *think harder, or choose an easier project*.
Don't look for someone to tell you how to do it. And don't give
up too easily. You should think about your problems for at least
a few hours before giving up; maybe even days if the problem is
that you can't figure out how to begin with your first project.
Sure, if the problem you can't figure out is just a small part
of a project, you may ask for help, but you should think about
it for at least a few hours yourself first. [Here is a great
take on this from Nathan
Marz.](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/recipe-for-a-great-programmer.html)

Having said all this, it can of course be invaluable to learn
from other people. You should read books, watch conference
talks, try new paradigms, etc. (not Youtube garbage like tutorials or
""Best languages to learn in 2024""). But only a small part of your
time, say maximum 10%, should be spent on this.

I should probably say something more about tutorials. Tutorials
are fine if you are trying to learn a new library, game engine,
or something; when there is a new part of a project you are
doing that you have not done before, and you need to get
started. Written tutorials are often better than Youtube
videos, and often the best ones are just the ""Getting Started""
sections on the official websites. But don't watch tutorials for
the purpose of learning how to do everything in your project.

Finally: Think for yourself. This is general life advice, and
should be applied to programming as well. Don't do something,
for example OOP, or whatever, just because someone else told you
to. If you don't understand the reasons behind something, ignore
it or try to figure out the reasons and evaluate them.

## What Language Should I learn?

It doesn't really matter, because once you know how to program
learning new languages will be much easier. But there are a
couple of traps to look out for. Firstly, learn one thing at a
time. This is mostly a problem in the web development world,
where people feel the need to learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a
couple of frameworks all at once. Don't do this. Stick to one
thing, like JavaScript with just the very basics of HTML.
Learning a bunch of things at the same time will likely just
lead to an illusion of compentence. Secondly,
I think C++ should be avoided, because it is by far the most
complicated, complex and time-consuming language out there. You
may think that you want to learn C++ because a lot of games are
made with it, but I think it's a waste of time. [Here is a game
programmer who actually uses C++ ranting about it (Bjarne
Stroustroup, whom he talks about, is the main designer of
C++).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i4-e1okZtw) And Jonathan
Blow, a successful game programmer who made *Braid* and *The
Witness*, is making a new language because he thought C++ was
bad. Imagine that, C++ drove him to make a new language. [Here
is a short clip of him discussing
it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmBa_2_TjU). At 02:11 in
the video he says ""Let's actually do what we know is better than
this C++ thing. And there is an unending list of things that you
could do better."" Note his facial expression.

One final thing I'll say about languages is: *Don't believe a
language is good just because it is popular*. Almost the opposite
is true. And almost all popular languages are very similar to
each other. That can easily make you think that the kind of
programming that is typical in those languages (C, Java, Python,
etc.) is the only way to program, but that is not true. Try
Lisp, Smalltalk, Erlang, Prolog, etc. at least eventually. [And watch
this very important video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)",jackstawfromwitchita,1hc936v,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc936v/how_to_actually_get_good_at_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc936v/how_to_actually_get_good_at_programming/,2024-12-12 00:54:35,109,0.86,109,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hc936v

learnprogramming,How are you handling multiple browser profiles?,"I’ve been trying to get my browsing setup under control recently. I use multiple browser profiles—one for personal stuff, one for work, and sometimes even one for side projects. It’s always felt like a hassle, having a bunch of windows and bookmarks spread out everywhere. I got frustrated enough that I ended up putting together a small command-line tool in Go that lets me launch a specific browser profile and jump straight into a particular site or a set of shortcuts I’ve defined. For example, browsir personal mail just opens my personal profile and goes right to Gmail, no extra clicks. It even supports a few different browsers, which is convenient.

Here's the repo: [https://github.com/Schroedinger-Hat/browsir](https://github.com/Schroedinger-Hat/browsir)

But I’m wondering if I’m reinventing the wheel here. Are there any well-known tools that do something similar? Maybe a browser extension, a built-in browser feature I’m not taking advantage of, or another CLI tool that people here already use? I’m also curious if there’s a more standard approach to handling multiple browser profiles and quick site launches that I just haven’t discovered.

How are you managing this sort of thing?

learnprogramming,"Syntax Help - I need a ""where column &gt; 1"" somewhere and I'm not sure where","Ok, so it looked like it was ok to as this based on the FAQ and the rules.

I have a school assignment I'm working on. This is a database concept class so we are just starting in SQL. Our test database is a tutor center, I have 3 tables: tutor, which lists the tutors details, course, which lists the course details, and tutorcourse, a joining table containing the primary key of both the tutor and course tables. The tutorcourse table is the list of all courses assigned to each tutor.

What I need to do create a query that displays the total number of courses assigned to each tutor, then I need to only display the tutors with more than 1 course assigned. So far, I've gotten to the point where I can list the number of courses for each tutor, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to fit in a WHERE clause to narrow that output list down to only tutors with more than 1 class.

Here is the current query I'm working off of:

`select tutor.tutorkey, tutor.tutorfname, tutor.tutorlname, count(tutorcourse.coursekey)`  
`from tutorcourse`  
`inner join tutor on tutorcourse.tutorkey = tutor.tutorkey`  
`group by tutorcourse.tutorkey;`

I have tried putting a where clause in multiple places and it either gives me the wrong output by counting ALL the classes total, or I get an error that my syntax is wrong, or I get an error that my group by statement is invalid.

Any guidance? I'm using MySQL for this. Mostly, I want to know if I need to totally reformat the query or use a subquery instead of a join or even just knowing if I'm anywhere even close to the right idea would be great. I don't particularly want a direct answer since part of my fun with programming is this problem solving bit... my brain is just at a roadblock right now.

Thanks! Please feel free to take this down if I misunderstood the rules.

Edit: winner winner chicken dinner. I forgot and also misunderstood the purpose of the Having clause. This version of the query got me the correct output: 

  
`select tutor.tutorkey, tutor.tutorfname, tutor.tutorlname, count(tutorcourse.coursekey)`  
`from tutorcourse`  
`inner join tutor on tutorcourse.tutorkey = tutor.tutorkey`  
`group by tutorcourse.tutorkey`

learnprogramming,"Your goal isn't to understand everything, it is to develop the skills to be able to understand anything","Here's a mistake I see newbies make all the time - thinking that either a) they have to understand everything, or b) the only stuff they need to be able to understand is the stuff they're currently doing. Both are wrong.

There's too much out there for anyone to understand everything. I've been doing this for over 30 years, and I know what I know is just a drop in the bucket compared to all there is to know.

*But* I am confident that I *could* understand almost any code/library/system within a certain threshold of difficulty - there's some really really hard stuff that maybe is beyond most developers, but for everything else I know that even if I don't know it now, I could learn it if I had to. How long it'd take me to get up to speed will vary by how close it is to my existing knowledge - learning Yet Another Frontend Library I can probably do pretty fast, but getting up to speed on an ancient Cobol codebase might take me much longer since I've never touched Cobol before. But I'm dead certain I could do it even if took me awhile.

That's your end goal. You can't learn everything. This is why just memorizing code doesn't work, and why tutorial hell doesn't help you grow. The skills you need to develop are problem solving skills, learning how to learn, and how to generate abstractions in your mind.

I think a big signal that you've passed from ""learner"" to ""programmer"" is how a lot of people look at libraries. A lot of learners look at libraries and go ""this is a magic box that does things I'd never be capable of doing"", whereas after awhile...well, you'll have written a lot of libraries yourself, so you *know* you could do most of the stuff the library does you're just like ""thank god someone else already wrote this so I don't have to spend the next week/month/year/decade doing it myself"".

**You'll never be done learning** \- this is a bad field to get into if you don't enjoy constantly learning. But, if you keep hacking away at it, you will get to a point where you lose that ""Am I capable of understanding this?"" doubt and instead start asking ""Do I *have time* to understand this?"" instead and realize you just have to pick and choose where you spend your time as you learn new things.",PoMoAnachro,1hc0w8o,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc0w8o/your_goal_isnt_to_understand_everything_it_is_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc0w8o/your_goal_isnt_to_understand_everything_it_is_to/,2024-12-11 18:53:17,561,0.99,561,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hc0w8o

I think I am not seeing something obvious...

  
**Project**

The project let's players create games. I want to pretty much give an evaluation of the games, so whenever a new game comes in, I want to evaluate all the data of all the players. I added a Participant as a Player that participated in a game to save values relative to the player. So e.g. Player1 plays with Player2, then Player2 will be a Participant in the Set of Participants belonging to Player1. And that Participant will be in the teammates Map and have the values ""numGames=1, ..."".

Here are the data types

  
GameCreatedEvent = result1, result2, team1, team2

Team = ID, players: List&lt;Player&gt;  
Player = ID

Participant = ID, numberOfGames, numberOfWins, numberOfLosses, numberOfDraws

**What I want to achieve initially** \- Pseudocode, so I hope someone understands

    var teammates = Map of Player to Set&lt;Participant&gt;
    var opponents = Map of Player to Set&lt;Participant&gt;
    
    function updateMaps(event: GameCreatedEvent):
      var result1 = event.result1
      var result2 = event.result2
      var team1 = event.team1
      var team2 = event.team2
    
      for each player in (team1.players + team2.players):
        var teammates = this.teammates[player]
        var opponents = this.opponents[player]
    
        for each participant in (team1.players):
          var isTeammateOfPlayer = (...)
          var hasWonGame = (...)
    
          update values of participant relative to if isTeamMate and hasWonGame
    
        this.teammates = teammates
        this.opponents = opponents

  
**TLDR**

I have Players in a Game. After a Game is created, for every Player that was in that Game, I want to update the List of all the Players that Player has played with or against and if he won with or against them.

learnprogramming,Which route makes more sense for OO?,"# Preface

Overseer object that oversees production of *blank*. Builder object that builds a component. From my novice experience with OO and google, I think that what `Overseer` should do is tell each builder to build their component `Builder.build()` and `Overseer` doesn't care how it gets done. `Overseer` will then likely put the components together, or something else... But my issue is that *some* `Builder` objects need specifications whilst others don't.

Thinking of SOLID, and Interface Segregation amongst other things, doesn't that mean that only objects that require information have the implementation to do so? Maybe I could do this with interfaces alone, but my problem is thus: should `Builder` objects make calls to `Overseer` after being told to `.build()`?

# Example 1

* Overseer: Build this component.  `Builder.build()`
* Builder: Okay. What colour is it?
* `Overseer.order.get_colour()`
* Overseer: Blue.
* Builder: Okay. What material is it? `Overseer.order.get_material()`
* Overseer: Stone.
* Builder: Done.  `return component`

This is probably worded horribly, but I hope my point comes across.

# Example 2

* Overseer: Build this component. It needs to be blue and to be made of stone. `Builder.build(order.get_colour(), order.get_material())`
* Builder: Okay, but I don't care what colour it is.
* Builder: Done.

Which example makes more sense? I don't get OO (started in C, then Python and I'm aware that Python is not a OO language) and don't know if I'm thinking in the right way.

To me, example 1 makes sense because then `Overseer` does not care how stuff gets done, but in example 2 it would *have* to care because it would have to keep track of which `Builder` object uses what information... right?",Warmspirit,1hbvwz0,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,2024-12-11 15:25:22,0,0.5,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbvwz0

learnprogramming,Should I consider switching to C++ from Rust for learning purposes?,"So for context, I'm a college student currently specializing in cyber security and I've been into computer science for a very long time and have being studying these concepts for a decently long time now. During this time I've tried out a bunch of different languages, mostly because I got bored (which isn't the best idea but younger me was stupid). For the past year-ish I've been using rust, which has been a amazing experience for the most part. I really enjoyed working concepts of errors as values and optional types for return values, which I had seen for the first time in a language. The only complaint I've had so far is the difficulty curve with rust. For my studies, its probably a good thing to start maintaining decent ranks in competitive programming websites like LeetCode, and rust is hard to work with for these problems, at least for me at this point. I've considered trying out C++ instead, but coming from rust, C++ just feels 'rustic' to put it simply, lacking features like errors as values which I've come to adore and probably can't live without anymore. It is, however, easier to get things done in C++ since I don't have to have to wrestle with the borrow checker at every turn.

I'm quite conflicted at this point. I could either continue using Rust and hope to simply get good enough to work with it, or switch to and learn C++, which will be pain coming from rust, having to give up such amazing features that rust has.

I was hoping I could get some pointers on what I should do in this situation by people that know more about the field in general than me.

The problem is, over time, I’ve realized I’ve pretty much forgotten even the basics of DSA (data structures and algorithms). I feel like I need to revisit those and also build a much deeper understanding of concepts like algorithms, data structures, and DBMS fundamentals.

I’m looking for some solid courses to kickstart this journey. I want something that will really set a strong foundation for me. Once I get that base down, I think I’ll be able to navigate further on my own based on what interests me most.

Effectively, I have a little landing page that I am using for a handful of buttons that fire-off fetch request re: using webhooks.

What I am trying to achieve is, high-level, a user taps a button and that triggers a webhook, but without redirecting the user anywhere or opening a blank page/tab - the button should just work like a trigger/toggle.

I've tried (I think) the various combinations or HTTP and HTTPS, reverse proxy, portforward, POST vs GET, no-cors etc.

I know the webhook, link, server etc are all working as I can use the webhook link just in a browser - hit ender - and it triggers without a problem, so it's beyond me why it's so hard to achieve the same thing at button push.

I get various errors (depending on which iteration I've tried re: above) but the most common (from browser console) include

&gt;GET request failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch

&gt;at HTMLButtonElement.&lt;anonymous&gt; (&lt;anonymous&gt;:7:9)

&gt;

&gt;VM2330:7  Mixed Content: The page at 'https://HOSTING-URL' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'WEBHOOK-URL'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

Hopefully what I'm trying to do is possible! and simply, with a little tweak, but if not - just for FYI - the webhook url is https, as is the site the button will be on. The Mixed content error is just a result of my trying to find the right combination (as above), so it pops up whenever I use a miss-matched HTTP/S combination.

","Hi guys,

I’m graduating from the University of Miami this spring with a degree in **Econ** (minor in Finance), and I’ve been diving into Python over the last month. So far, I’ve worked through the **beginner, arrays, and hash tables modules** on LeetCode, and I’m also doing a **DSA course on Udemy** and a **Python for Finance course**. My plan is to eventually build something cool (maybe a financial model) for my GitHub.

Here’s where I’m at:

* **LeetCode:** I’ve finished arrays and hash tables! I’m starting to get medium problems but still struggle to solve them completely on my own.
* **Python Projects:** Trying to come up with ideas—thinking something finance-related that could help me stand out.
* **Timeline:** I’ve got about 9 months until 2025 recruiting kicks off in September. Over the summer, I want to tackle side projects or even volunteer work to build up my skills and experience.

Also, I’m 25—am I too old to be starting in tech? I’d love to hear if anyone else has been in a similar boat and how they made it work.

I’d really appreciate any advice on:

1. **What to learn next:** What should I focus on in DSA and Python to keep improving?
2. **Career path tips:** I love the mix of finance and tech—what roles or projects would make me a stronger candidate?
3. **Certifications or resume boosters:** Are there any certs or must-have skills I should add to my plan?

I know the job market is tough, but I’m trying to use this time to get myself in the best shape possible for recruiting. Any advice, ideas, or resources would mean a lot.

learnprogramming,What should I start with ? ,"I’m a first-year CS-AI student, and next semester I’ll be taking ""Programming I"" in Java. Right now, I have some free time and want to use it to learn the basics of a programming language over the next month, spending 4-5 hours a day on it. I’m thinking of starting with C++ because a senior recommended it. They said the syntax is similar to Java, so I’d be preparing for Java while also learning C++. But I’ve heard that jumping between languages without mastering one first isn’t a good idea.

Should I just start with Java since I’ll need it for my course, or is it okay to start with C++ now and come back to Java later? I’d prefer to try C++ first, but I’m not sure if that’s the best move or if it’ll just be a waste of time.

learnprogramming,Python on the web questions.,"I have written some python code that generates a few .png using matplotlib with some data I get from an API. I want to regenerate these images daily, and share them with one or more people. Currently this involves me sending an email every day. I'd rather have it hosted on the web where it's easily accessible.   
  
Two questions: 1.) Is there a photo hosting site that has an API I can automatically upload them to? If so, I assume you can program a computer to automatically run some python code at a set time each day, what would I search to learn more about this?  
  
2.) Some of the parameters are customizable, so I'd rather have a little website that allows the other person be able to adjust some parameters and generate the images on the fly. Is Django the best way to get this done? If so, should I host it on a VPS or is there a simpler place to run this web app? Theoretically, these plots/data have monetary value, so I'd eventually want to lock it behind a login as well. I know this seems like I might be biting off more than my amateur self can chew. But I am happy to learn along the way of this process. I don't care if it takes me a few weeks to make all of this work.

learnprogramming,Has reading SICP helped you improve in your day job?,"Hi everybody! So I recently started reading SICP and just finished the first chapter ([link to my exercise solutions if anyone is interested](https://github.com/iagombermudez/sicp_book)).

So far, the book has helped me to fully understand the concept of recursion and to be very comfortable using it. During my time as a comsci student I had to complete many assignments that require the use of recursion, but nothing compared to what you need to do in this book since recursion is basically your only tool to create loops.

Another concept that I think is key is the concept of abstraction, which has been repeated across the entire chapter. However, I think this might be more useful if you don't have a lot of experience programming. I think it's still a good concept to review though, and one important thing that the book reiterates is that you don't need to abstract everything (something that I tend to forget from time to time lol).

So if any of you have gotten past the first chapter and would like to give your opinion on if it's worth to read it solely from a perspective of improving as a software engineer, I would love to hear from you!

So far, I think I will continue reading it just because I find it interesting and the exercises are entertaining, but maybe I won't finish the entire book since it's very time consuming (for reference, reading the first chapter and completing all the exercises took me around 2 weeks of daily studying for around one hour and a half).",Iamabrmdz,1hbgo6d,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbgo6d/has_reading_sicp_helped_you_improve_in_your_day/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbgo6d/has_reading_sicp_helped_you_improve_in_your_day/,2024-12-11 00:21:05,3,0.67,3,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbgo6d

Once they submit the form, it will push the new event to the events page. I’ve read a bit about CMS (Content Management Systems) and think it might be the answer, but I’m not sure

If anyone has experience with this and is willing to guide a newbie, I’d be super grateful! I’m using Visual Studio Code for my development and would love any tips, resources, or guidance you can offer.

Also, I know I’m a rookie, so any feedback or help would mean a lot. If anyone is willing to personally message me to walk me through it and maybe making this website come true, I’d really appreciate it!

learnprogramming,Should I learn C++?,"Hey I'm a first year undergraduate doing a Bachelors in Computer Science. I've been programming for quite a while now and I really love it... or so I thought. I realise now that I'm not very interested in most of the hot areas like machine learning, web/app development or game development in Unity, etc. What I'm actually interested in is stuff that makes me really think like programming puzzles, or maybe making a physics engine, making an algorithm visualiser, making a compiler, etc.

And I realised that maybe C++ is a good language because it seems like most of the things I'm interested in (compilers, graphics programming, OS) are done using it. But I've also heard that it's a very complicated language and takes a long time to learn well enough to land a good job in it. But I want to be able to get a decent internship and job by the end of my degree.

So what would be the best thing for me to do?

learnprogramming,Why is stepping through in Release so fickle?,"I'm working on a project where atm it doesn't work properly in debug (not ideal, but not really within the scope of my task to resolve it). Since I can set breakpoints in Release, I just do that. But it behaves so weirdly. Like it will visually skip over code that actually *is* executing; or I can hover and see the contents of a variable that's passed to the function as an argument but I can't see the contents of a variable that was given a value within the function (and adding the variable to the watched variables also doesn't work--says ""variable is undefined"")

I don't understand why stepping through in Release behaves so inexplicably.

learnprogramming,How to get back on the right track? ,"Hey guys so I saw that post where the guy was talking about a lot of new programmers are relying on chatgpt to code.

learnprogramming,Best approach to store data values in the database from an OCR scan for a rule-based system?,"I'm using OCR to scan a document and compile all findings in a single field in a JSON-like structure (e.g. ""gender: male, age: 2, country: Yemen""). It should be noted that it is necessary to use the OCR to scan the findings, so it is expected that the scanned results will always be different/inaccurate.

The reason for compiling all in a single field is because the findings from the OCR are inconsistent or unstructured, like different amount of info/fields in every document, or different kinds of info/fields in every document. And most importantly, I'm using a rule-based system to filter records based on the findings (e.g. input:""get me all males aged 20-40 that live in Yemen""). 

Is storing all findings in a single field a good approach for a rule-based system? BTW i'm using a non-relational database (MongoDB).

learnprogramming,Merging two Arrays together in C. Why does this work?,"Hi, for learning i tried to program c code, that merges two monotonically increasing arrays into a new one inside of a function. I tried for hours, did one approach with pointers (didn't went that good) and this one. It works, but i can't wrap my head around why. Here is the code of the function (look for the comments): 

    unsigned merge(int array_1[], int array_2[], int length_1, int length_2) {
    
      int array_3[length_1 + length_2];
      int *ptr_1 = array_1;
      int *ptr_2 = array_2;
    
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length_1 + length_2; i++) {
    
        if ( i &gt; length_1 + 3) { //Why does this work?
          array_3[i] = *ptr_2++;
        } else if ( i &gt; length_2 + 3) { //Why does this work?
          array_3[i] = *ptr_1++;
        } else {
          array_3[i] = *ptr_1 &lt;= *ptr_2 ? *ptr_1++ : *ptr_2++;
        }
      }
    
      int length_3 = sizeof(array_3) / sizeof(*array_3);
    
      for (int j = 0; j &lt; length_3; j++) {
    
        printf(""[%d]: %d\n"", j, array_3[j]);
      }
    
      return length_3;
    }

I know now how to program it more readable but why does this if-condition i &gt; length + 3 work? Initially the idea behind those conditions was to stop getting values from the shorter array, when the pointer is at the end of the array. I tried several things but this + 3 made it work, but that doesn't seem to make any sense. Maybe someone can explain this to me.

I recently started doing some work where I have to ssh into a machine to run my scripts and while I can write the code locally, there's no way in PycharmCE to run a debugger onto a remote machine and see all the steps locally. I'm aware of the [remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-development-starting-page.html) from the professional edition of Pycharm, but my work does not allow for it, I can only use the community edition.

I know that VSCode has a similar option to work on a remote machine and it's free, so I could switch to that, but my muscle memory is so tied to the Pycharm workflow that switching to VSCode is going to affect my productivity for at least a few months, until I learn it all from scratch.

So, before I switch to VSCode for good, is there any workaround for using PyCharm remotely using the community edition? Oh, I can't simply install PyCharm on the remote machine because it doesn't have a graphic server (it's container stuff), so I can only use ssh.

learnprogramming,CS50 Final Project Ideas,"For anyone who has done CS50, I'm trying to think of some projects. I've thought of a few I want to attempt but I'm not sure there will be enough knowledge to implement them since I'm only on week 5 of the class.

First is either a text based of ASCII based RPG. I'd assume a text based one wouldn't be too hard. I could have a few classes and stats, but I don't know how I'd code the enemies and make it challenging enough to be able to fail. This however would probably be a project that would help me gain a ton of experience. I'm not sure if I'd be able to do this though with the level of experience gained in CS50. It may be worth doing in a language other than C.

The second idea, which is also probably complex is a minecraft skin maker. Basically a simple pixel based editor. A lot of people say to learn it, to solve a problem. However I don't have anything I can think of that needs solving. I am extremely interested in CS, but I'm not experienced enough in programming to recognize things I do on the daily.

The only other thing I could think of, that may be hard at this point in time, is to find a way to program a calendar that would be able to take the appointments and things my wife have to do from IOS and Android and consolidate it into one calendar.

learnprogramming,Web Programming project help,"Is this a good place to ask for help with web programming? I am in desperate need of assistance. I have a project due where I need to create a Blackjack game with the following functionality:



a) ""Splitting"" capability: What is splitting? If you hold two cards with the same value, like two eights or two sixes, you can split them into separate hands and play each hand individually. For this project, once the two cards are split, they should be treated as two separate hands, each with its own ""hit,"" ""stay,"" and ""split"" (if the two cards are the same) buttons. To achieve this, I need to add a button that appears only when the player holds two identical cards, and otherwise stays hidden. Once the button is clicked, the two cards should be split into two hands.



b) ""Reset"" capability: Currently, the game can only be reset by refreshing the page. I need to create a button that resets the game environment and starts a new game by clearing the scores and cards, without refreshing the page.



c) Disable ""hit"" button: When the player's total exceeds 21, the ""hit"" button should be disabled and grayed out to prevent further action, until the game is reset or a new game begins.



I’ve managed to get b) and c) working, but no matter what I try, I haven’t been able to get splitting to work. Additionally, I need to add a backlog feature that tracks matches, pauses, and records the player's progress, so users can return to their previous place in the game.

learnprogramming,Seeking Advice for Implementation,"

Hi r/learnprogramming ! 👋

I'm a Salesforce developer with a bit of experience in web development and Java from about 10 years ago. A couple of friends need a tool to help them with the logistics of serving cocktails for events which should include features for adding, editing, and deleting cocktails from a database and calculating ingredient quantities based on the number of participants.

# Project Overview:

* **Functionality**:
   * Manage a database of cocktails (name, ingredients, quantity).
   * Calculate ingredient quantities based on selected cocktails and number of participants.
   * Nice-to-have in the feature: being able to export a file with the list of ingredient, calculate the number of glasses required ect

# My Goals:

1. **Ease of Use**: The tool needs to be easy to use for someone who isn’t a developer. Ideally, it should work on someone’s personal computer without requiring any special setup.
2. **Portability**: I want to ensure that anyone can use this tool without needing to install additional software or perform complex configurations.
3. **Long-Term Maintainability**: Considering my last serious web project was nearly a decade ago, I’m seeking advice on modern best practices to ensure the project remains maintainable and can be easily improved or expanded in the future.

# Questions:

1. **Which Tech Stacks would you recommand me to base my project on?** I've thinking of maybe an local website using HTML/JS but I dont know how to easily handle the database 
2. **How can I make this project easily portable and usable on someone else's computer?** What setup steps would be needed from an end-user perspective?
3. **What are the best practices for managing a simple local database in this context?** Are there any tools or framework that I can use?

Additional Information:

1. As a Salesforce dev, I am comfortable with object programming logic (the Salesforce language is close to Java), I do JS/HTML5/CSS and SOQL

The code is as follows:

      constant_1 = ((b*b*b)*-1) / (27*(a**3)) + ((b*c) / (6*a*a)) - d/(2*a)
      constant_2 = (c/(3*a) - b**2 / (9*a*a))**3
      result_1 =  ((constant_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) + ((constant_1 - cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2)))** (1/3) - b/(3*a)
      result_2 = (-0.5 + (cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3))/2) * ((constant_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) + (-0.5 - cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3)/2) * ((constant_1 - cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) - b/(3*a)
      result_3 = (-0.5 - (cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3))/2) * ((constant_1 + cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) + (-0.5 + cmath.sqrt(-1)*cmath.sqrt(3)/2) * ((constant_1 - cmath.sqrt(constant_2 + constant_1 ** 2))**(1/3)) - b/(3*a)

learnprogramming,Something isn't working. I need advice.,"I'm a first-year undergrad studying Business. For the past year, I have been working full-stack, using React and React Native as the frontends. I loved it. I started with React, but soon realized that I should be more focused on mobile development to align myself with my goals, so I naturally went to React Native. 

I used RN for 7-8 months, and while I enjoyed coding with RN, I kept hitting limitations. Complex animations are near-impossible with RN, and theres just so many small little features, such as 'blur', that are just one line of code when programming natively for Android or iOS, but give so much headache in RN. So, I started learning Swift and SwiftUI, and have been using it exclusively for the last 2 months.

Unlike when I started with React and RN, I decided to really get myself to understand the ins and outs of Swift and follow a more established path to learning it. I read many comprehensive books and followed many tutorials on it, and I, now, have a very solid foundation, and can comfortably navigate myself through it. But I've come to realize: I hate Swift. I hate Apple.

I've always used Windows. I've always viewed MacOS negatively. Though, to program natively for iOS, you need to use a MacOS. Now, over the past 2 months, I've gotten used to using a mac, but I simply just prefer windows for everything. If I'm programming, I'll have my windows and my mac open, and I would do any research on my windows, and code on mac. If I'm designing a UI, I would do everything on my windows, but use my mac to occasionally paste svg icons from SF Symbols (which aren't available to windows, thanks Apple). I have an Iphone, I have an Apple watch, I have airpods, but I just hate macs.

But the worst part is XCode. I genuinely hate XCode with a passion. It's a good IDE, don't get me wrong, but I despise Apple's dedication to giving its developers the least amount of customization possible. With VSCode, you are able to download any extension, and customize it in basically any way you can imagine. I love the open-source community.

Alright, lets move onto Swift and SwiftUI. It feels... weird? I've had experience with JavaScript, Python, and even a little bit of C#, but Swift just feels really weird to me. It has a lot of features right out of the box, such as app storage and environmental variables, whereas with RN, I had to manually spend hours configuring Redux Toolkit and storage persistence. But, I'm realizing now that I much enjoyed writing all that boilerplate code for the external libraries to make applications using RN. I miss the feeling of taking so many open-source contributions, reading documentation on them, and then implementing them into my project. Some had really good docs, which felt amazing to see, some were more frustrating with hard-to-follow docs. I miss the feeling of having this variety. Every NPM package was a different package and you knew what each one did. In Swift, ofcourse there are packages, ofcourse there is the Swift package manager, but working with Swift just feels like you're working with one project, and everything is just supplied to you, barely any variant.

And all of this just destroys my motivation to code every time I sit down. There were, unavoidably, headaches and hardships with React and React Native, but atleast I enjoyed it. Now I just feel like I'm being forced to work with software I hate and at the same time supporting a company I hate. But I need to use Swift. I need to develop for iOS, and there is nothing that comes near to the power of Swift for iOS development.

TDLR; I hate Swift. I hate Xcode. I hate Apple. I hate Macs. How can I make myself more motivated to work with Swift.",RareDestroyer8,1ha38pa,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ha38pa/something_isnt_working_i_need_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ha38pa/something_isnt_working_i_need_advice/,2024-12-09 06:03:38,1,0.67,1,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ha38pa

in 3 months summer break ends and i will face a very feared class which involves coding an operating system and i thought that it would be a good idea to learn more about programming. 

currently i feel interested to learn how to develop an android mobile app (as i have an android) so i found an android course which uses kotlin as the language and im a bit skeptical of this as kotlin is mostly used in android mobile app dev (really specific niche, my degree focuses on more of an understanding of the entire process of the development of the product) so im a bit scared that learning kotlin which might never be useful to me. Maybe learning java would be better but i cant find any recommended course and i dont want to hop on a random course either. (Dont get me wrong, if you tell me that kotlin could be a useful language to learn aside from android development im staying with the course i found which was recommended to me).

what would you do?

EDIT: I FIXED IT WOOHOOOO!!! just in case anyone stumbles upon this which i doubt lol here is what i needed to fix : 1. i don't really know what was going wrong here but deploying using github actions didn't work so i went back to using gh-pages, which changed the issue to a failed to load resource error. which i fixed with the next steps: 2. i needed to specify where the bundled assets were being served, i.e. by adding --public-url ./ to my build script in package.json, because the default is / which neglects the fact that gh pages serves from a url containing gitusername.github.io/reponame. so the correct build script for me using parcel was  ""build"": ""parcel build --public-url ./"" 3. i needed to specify the homepage so that gh pages would request the correct file paths, i.e. by adding ""homepage"": ""https://mygitusername.github.io/reponame"" to package.json, because previously it was looking for the content at e.g. https://mygitusername.github.io/index.hash.css instead of  https://mygitusername.github.io/reponame/index.hash.css. yay i'm like so proud of you omg thank you",lanternriver,1h9yihf,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9yihf/deployed_to_github_pages_getting_syntaxerror/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9yihf/deployed_to_github_pages_getting_syntaxerror/,2024-12-09 01:37:23,3,0.81,3,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Debugging,,t3_1h9yihf

learnprogramming,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6vx,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:54,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9l6vx

learnprogramming,How to program renderer for a volumetric display?,"I'm working on a volumetric display using a 64x64 LED panel rotating at 900rpm to create a persistence of vision effect. I need help writing the software to render images for it as I'm unsure how to go about it.

My current plan is to render a 3d model like an obj file, and take individuals slices/planes at 6 degrees intervals as a plane rotates through it. These could then be stitched together with ffmpeg into a 900fps video and played on the rotating display. 60 frames per rotation, 15 rotations per second, 246k pixels.

The display should support this refresh rate as it updates the pixels 2 rows at a time at 1920hz.

My question is what's the best way to go about this, what should I program it in and how? I'm looking into python and trimesh at the moment as that has a voxelise feature which could help, and a slice feature built in. Is there already existing software that could do this for me?

I also need a way to test these videos/emulate the display, and at the moment I'm thinking I'd just put them on a spinning surface in blender and render that, but I'm open to better suggestions.",rabbitrampage198,1h9l0tm,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l0tm/how_to_program_renderer_for_a_volumetric_display/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l0tm/how_to_program_renderer_for_a_volumetric_display/,2024-12-08 15:19:58,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9l0tm
learnprogramming,libSDL3.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory,"I am trying to compile [this example code](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/examples/renderer/01-clear/clear.c) from SDL's own github. 

My ""makefile"" (actually just a bash file) looks like this: `gcc -O -Wall -W -pedantic --std=c17 -o game main.c -lSDL3 -lm`

It compiles fine, so I guess my installation of SDL3 was successful. The CMake script put it in `/usr/local/` instead of just `/usr/` where apt put SDL2.

libSDL3.so.0 is in here: 

    /usr/local/lib$ ls -a
    .   cmake       libSDL3.so.0      libSDL3_test.a  python3.10
    ..  libSDL3.so  libSDL3.so.0.1.3  pkgconfig

The weird thing though is that [libSDL3.so](http://libSDL3.so) is a link to libSDL.so.0, which in turn is a link to libSDL.so.0.1.3 which are all in the same folder... I have no idea what that is good for, but then again, I am a newb.

What should I do? I found a similar problem someone had with SDL2 back in the day, on SO, but I don't really understand that thread.

learnprogramming,What do I need to learn to solve these kinds of problems?,"Hey, I’m a cs student in my 2nd year and most tests (non college) have these kinds of logical questions on them, even a few hackathons that I've been to ask to solve these kinds of problems. I only know the basics of C and python and I cannot find the solution to such questions with my limited knowledge of loops, arrays, conditional statements, recursion, etc., especially on a time limit ( I'd need a day to solve there on my own LOL ) here's a sample question to explain what I'm referring to:



&gt;Problem Description:

You have a restaurant at a beachside which has N dining tables. Each dining table has only one chair so each table can accommodate only one person. These dining tables are along a straight line parallel to the beach at positions x1 ,...,xN.

C customers are currently queued up outside the restaurant since you have reopened the restaurant after a long time due to the pandemic. You need to assign the dining tables to the customers such that the minimum distance between any two customers is as large as possible in order to take care of the precautions considering the current pandemic situation. (Consider all C customers dine at the same time)

Find the largest minimum distance possible.


&gt;Input Description:

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and c (2 ≤ C ≤ N).
The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 1000000000) - The elements of the array W.


&gt;Output Description:

For each test case, print the answer: The largest minimum distance.

learnprogramming,Question about my website,"I am creating a website where it is possible for each user to have a kind of archive in which to store only certain types of files (.wav and .mp3).  
First I was thinking about storing the files in a database.  
Subsequently I thought that this system was not very efficient so I decided to always use the database but this time putting only a text string that points to the absolute position of the files involved (Example: D:\\Songs\\Song.wav).  
I'm not sure if this system is good; the problem is that this site will be public (rightly so), I would need a sort of protected virtual archive directly connected to the website page where it is possible to put and extrapolate the files (which on the page will appear as audio in scalar order while in the archive the files will be divided into folders and subfolders based on the name of the user and the file so as to make the collection and storage of files more orderly and efficient).  
So my questions are:  
Is there a better way I can use the database to point to folders or some other better way to store files? If my system is otherwise acceptable, could you tell me about a virtual archive service that can do what I requested?

I contacted the developers of the software and they have been able to help me with some small things (adjusting resolution / sizes for the software to accept), but there are some issues they said they can't resolve for some reason. They created a variation of one of the THEME folders for me that included a XML file and a DAT file. Normally there is just a DAT file that is gibberish and can't edit. I believe the developer made a mistake and forgot to delete the XML file after they converted it to DAT format for the software to read. The XML file contains lots of additional styling info that I should be able to tinker with. I asked the developer if they could tell me how to convert the XML file to the DAT file after I have changed some styling options. Unfortunately, they declined saying they do not want people to tinker with that kind of file. I already have the XML file that I can edit and the DAT file that shows gibberish that it was converted from.

Here is the section in question:

    SET /P FILEPATH=Please enter entire filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt: 
    ECHO 
    SET /P UNENCRYPTED=Please enter filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt, but without the final extension. For example, filepath.backup.zip.aes becomes filepath.backup.zip:

learnprogramming,[batch] Not sure why this command is crashing my game.,"if !rx%x%,ry%y%! EQU # goto backup

\^That's the command itself. As for what's going on...

Context:

I'm making a game where text characters are used for graphics- you play as a capital X, there's an enemy capital M to avoid, periods are used to mark empty spaces and the command above is my attempt at getting the game to recognize walls (marked with #).

    @echo off

    title M-Quest (test bench ver.)
    set x=2
    set y=2
    REM ^Them thar be the player coordinates. X and Y values on a grid, simple as.
    REM Disclaimer, the grid for this demo is only 2x2 spaces. The version I'm working on is 10x10. In the code below, you'll notice I have individual ""set"" commands for each pair of coordinates rather than using two ""for"" commands. Don't ask me why it runs faster this way, it just does. Trust me, I ain't happy about it either, since it makes expanding the game grid a pain. For a 2x2 grid, I only gotta set 4 variables. For 10x10, that's 100 variables that need individually set in three places- :roomGen, :screenSet, and :screen. Apologies, but limiting your play area in this demo ver saves me 288 very boring lines of code, and makes finding the VERY IMPORTANT comments coming up way friggin' easier.

    :roomGen
    set rx1,ry1=.
    set rx1,ry2=.
    set rx2,ry1=.
    set rx2,ry2=.
    REM The ""r"" in the above variable names stands for ""reference"". I'll explain why later.

    :screenSet

    set sx1,sy2=%rx1,ry1%
    set sx2,sy1=%rx1,ry1%
    set sx2,sy2=%rx1,ry1%

    echo %sx1,sy2% %sx2,sy2%
    echo %sx1,sy1% %sx2,sy1%
    REM Behold, you can see now! Note that one of the SCREEN variables gets changed- the one you're at- but the reference variables aren't touched. When you move, :screen will only show you where you currently are, but it will NOT reset the screen variables to what they should be when you're not atop of them. Without :screenSet, moving from x1,y2 to x2,y2 would cause BOTH of those screen variables to display on the screen as an X, since sx1,sy1 was never reset. TLDR, :screenSet exists to clear the screen, :roomGen exists to tell :screenSet what a clear screen even looks like, and :screen exists to draw the screen. Note that the reference values in roomGen aren't for show- changing those changes what the room actually is. If you wanted to add walls, NPCs, or items, you'd change the corresponding reference value in :roomGen to make that happen.

    goto screenSet

Anyhow, if you'll excuse me, I deleted what I *thought* was the OneDrive backup of this game from what I *thought* was OneDrive... and turned out to be my actual, on-PC documents folder.

And then Notepad live updated, clearing all text from the entire program at once. Worst part is I've gotten in the habit of shift+deleting files which means no recycle bin backup, and what I've covered in this demo doesn't include save file creation for each room, entering into new rooms, monster behavior, or basically half the rest of the game... so I gotta get to re-writing that now. Thanks in advance!

A. Returns `NA`  
B. Throws an error because 4 is not a valid position  
C. Returns 3  
D. The code will not run

Usually, MCQs would be easier because you can usually guess the closest answer, but there will always be an option where ""the code will not run"", or ""the code throws an error"" and it always messes me up because I cannot possibly remember every single functions syntax or edge cases.

learnprogramming,Is the programming dream a harsher reality?,"TLDR: did your enthusiasm for coding die or fade once you got employment, or did you find the same joy as when you were doing more independent learning challenges?

I started doing the Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python course. And I absolutely love it. I made the blackjack challenge without searching for any of my code just of what I learnt previously and it was such a cool feeling. (First small project in that course)

I’m trying to get back into it, now with a more focused approach of getting a job as a goal and learning enough to do some pretty cool projects ideas I have. But I’m scared what if I spend this 1-2 years of the young part of my life (I’m 23). What if it’s not at all like what I’ve been enjoying, to actually work as a developer. What if I just hate the actual corporate job side of it. 

Right now I love the challenge of coding and visualizing how everything works. The building blocks you need to place to connect it all in your head. I love the thought process of this. I’m just scared that it’s not going to be all that in terms of work. And that I’ll be left thinking “oh well now I learnt all this and now I’m getting a good salary I can’t just leave this”.

I guess what I’m hoping for is that I keep thinking it’s a fun puzzle and that I keep enjoying it. What I’m scared of is becoming miserable and hating my job. Should I just try my entrepreneurial ideas instead? Or should I pursue this which I feel is more tangible.

I'm basically working in R with a big dataset with about 8500 observations and 1900 variables. This is a combination of several datasets and has lots of missingness. I'm trying to run lasso to get r to tell me what the best predictor variables for a certain outcome variable are. The problem is, I'm first trying to impute my data because I keep getting this error (after the #impute missing data line):

Can anyone tell me how to solve this? Chatgpt was telling me I needed to remove variables that have too much collinearity and/or no variance, but I don't see why that's an issue in the imputation step? It might be worth mentioning, in my code I haven't explicitly done anything to make sure the binary dependent variable is not imputed (which, I don't want it to be, I only want to run lasso on variables for which the dependent variable actually exists), nor have I removed identifier variables (do I have to?) the code below is what I've been using.

learnprogramming,Teaching a short middle school class over the summer in Python. Help!,"I just taught my first high school intro course over the fall semester in Python, and for my first time I thought it went great! There were a few things I could improve, which I'll focus on in the spring semester.

The opportunity has arisen to teach a short middle school programming course over the summer. I have full control of # of weeks, how many days per week, and the curriculum. Kids can sign up on their own accord, meaning the students I have will be interested in the subject (in theory). I think it would be silly for me to pass this up, but I'm a bit intimidated by the idea of teaching middle school students code. I would like to keep it in Python, because it's the language I know best and I feel it's the easiest to learn as a first language.

What I'm looking for:

1) Any tips on how I should teach this stuff at the middle school level. I treated the format of my high school class like a college intro course, where I would alternate between lecture days &amp; lab days and have a few major projects throughout the semester. I'm not sure 50% of the time being lecture is great for middle school students who want to code.

2) This is a shot in the dark, but if anyone has curriculum they are willing to share, I would be more than thrilled to take a look.

learnprogramming,Using an IDE to learn C++,"When the question ""How to learn C++?"" shows up online, one of the top answers always seems to be something along the lines of ""get an IDE"" or ""download MS Visual Studio"".

VS was used in the college course that I followed when learning C++ and I'm relatively sure it slowed down my learning process by years. Specifying include search paths, libraries and their directories, compile options, etc. seemed all like black magic that you have to enter in the right menus.

The right way seems glaringly obvious now... To learn C++, use Linux (or WSL on Windows) and whatever combination of compiler and editor, e.g. gcc + nano.

At least during the first few weeks (or months) when learning about the basic syntax, header files, oop, templates and the STL, compile your code manually. Look at what the preprocessor produces, maybe even take a look at the created Assembly, run the linker manually. Once this gets too repetitive, switch to CMake to automate those building tasks.

Then later, If you apply for a job at a place that uses a specific IDE, take a week to get familiar with it.

* **USERS** has Id(PK), Name, Email, and password.
* **TASK** has Id(PK), Title, date, and createdBy(userId FK).
* **TASK\_USERS** relates the user Id and task Id, and has userId(FK) and taskId(FK).
* **USERS** can create 1 or many **TASK**.
* A **TASK** can only be created by 1 **USERS**.
* **USERS** can assign 1 or many **USERS** to a**TASK**.
* Many **USERS** can be assigned to many **TASK**.

This is the schema I created: [https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT](https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT), but I think it’s wrong because I believe the relationships between **USERS-TASK\_USERS** and **TASK-TASK\_USERS**, depending on how you look at it, should both be N:M, right?

Honestly, I’m confused, so if anyone could help, I’d appreciate it.",asdfrofl1,1h8qy0x,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h8qy0x/help_help_me_understand_er_diagram_of_these/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h8qy0x/help_help_me_understand_er_diagram_of_these/,2024-12-07 11:56:07,2,0.75,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h8qy0x

learnprogramming,Is it really worth it pursuing CS/SWE,"As the title says, I’m wondering if it’s really worth still pursuing a CS/SWE degree at this point. It’s almost 2025 and a lot of people have been saying that CS is the new art degree or that’s it’s nearly impossible to even get a job as a junior engineer (since many listings say you need like 2-5 YOE). 

The main thing is I’m currently a year and a half away (around summer to fall 2026) from graduating with a degree in software development. The school I’m going to doesn’t really go over much coding but more into the technical aspects of how code works instead. So, I’ve been trying to learn on my own outside of school on things such as Java and Spring Boot. But after seeing all the posts and people saying how hard it is to get a job, employers not replying back or sending rejecting letters, and applying to 100+ jobs, I’ve lost motivation to keep pursuing becoming an SWE. 

So, should I find the motivation to keep going and pursue SWE or try to find something else?",nyar000,1h8qchu,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h8qchu/is_it_really_worth_it_pursuing_csswe/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h8qchu/is_it_really_worth_it_pursuing_csswe/,2024-12-07 11:13:10,0,0.31,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h8qchu
learnprogramming,Figuring out full stack coding?,"So I’ve been researching about web development, let me just get this right, so there’s three parts 

- Desginer (Figma)
- Front end dev (html,CSS,JavaScript)
- back end dev (PHP, JavaScript)

Let me know if I got this right, the designer just makes a glorified Canva template, the figma file doesn’t actually do anything but become a blueprint (headache) for the front end dev which will guide him on where to put containers and such, the front end dev then creates the physical webpages, places the forms, buttons, containers, etc. however these can link to each other but the they don’t actually perform any function.

The back end developer has to take the website from the front end dev and pretty much connect the dots? Get data collected from forms, tell it where to place that data, establish security measures, pretty much make the website function from page to page.

That’s my understanding of everything so far but now I’m learning with code.ai you can just turn images and screenshots into figma designs using ai, and with visual copilot you can now covert figma designs into front end code in React? So if these actually work all that is needed is backend and decent knowledge of front end. Idk if I’m missing something and maybe the ai tools aren’t all that great yet but I still feel as if front end feels like a lot of work and bit excessive and I also feel as if most people could replace designers by making there own design on figma or just screenshooting a design they like and editing from there.

learnprogramming,Am I just not getting this?,"Hey guys!  


I have been learning C++ independently now for almost a month! Needless to say, I am working on a Rock, Paper, Scissors game right now and I was having an issue where I am using cin to gather a char for my  loops and functions, but I was testing it to see what kind of problems would arise if... say someone entered something greater than a single char. Problem happened obviously, and then I tried to fix the problem on my own, nothing I did would work. I then checked out a couple of stackoverflow questions and even posted one myself! (Which I'm not super happy about). The StackOverflow question I asked got me pushing in the right direction, introducing me to cin.ignore(). Plugged that into my code, still had the issue! Couldn't find the solution online anywhere... so I resorted to asking CoPilot (AI). Because of that I was able to figure out the missing parameter I needed in the cin.ignore() function. My question is... I feel like I cheated in a way because I had to ask around for help and even resorted to asking AI as well. My goal is to become a professional Software Engineer, and me having to google around and ask help from others including AI kind of gives me second thoughts as to if I can actually do something like this.

learnprogramming,Replacing a spreadsheet with a web app?,"I have a book tracker spreadsheet, specifically a Google sheet with some Google App Script and unusual functions (for a book tracker spreadsheet)

I would like to learn some coding to replace it with something easier to edit on my phone/tablet ( adding data is easy , editing on android is clunky). I'm aware basic book trackers seem to be a very common coding project and normally I'd look for something pre existing and try to tweak it but none of the existing examples I can find seem to fit what I want to do at all so I figure now is a good time to learn some ""proper"" coding.

My thoughts are to make a web app so that I can acess it across Android, Windows and Linux as I use all 3 (I already know a bit of HTML/CSS/javascript). Have the data in some kind of database that I can host locally (have a small home NAS I should be able to put it on) so I can back up CSV data in case I want to move back to a spreadsheet, and to have something else like Python to do the query, calculations and generate graphs/pie charts (I belive matplotlib should do this)

But this is where I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with info and weighing up pros and cons, I'm not a professional by any means, I just play around with things for fun so I think my lack of correct terminology is hindering me in my searches ... but I am currently  looking at either: 

Python &amp; SQLite- this seems to be the simplest option for installing and as an added bonus Calibre library management software uses Python for plugins so I might be able to get some kind of integration

Or

Django &amp; postgresSQL - Django seems to get mentioned a lot when it comes to Python as making things easier for web/server things but I can't seem to find in what ways, I've seen a lot of people say that postgreSQL is their favorite too but I'm not sure any of the advantages will apply to me as a single user 

Or

Maybe I'm just barking to the wrong tree entirely and should consider a different  approach entirely from Python?

learnprogramming,Resuming programming studies after a break,"Hello  
  
I want to get back to studying programming, which I stopped doing almost a year ago due to life circumstances. I’m not sure if I’ll end up pursuing it professionally or not, though at the time, I started with the idea of finding a job. I’m 32 years old, and I don’t know if it’s too late. Regardless, it’s something I’d like to keep learning.

I started learning on my own because I got into programming out of necessity, having to deal with scripts written in LUA without any prior knowledge. I should mention that I’ve been using computers since I was a kid, although I never focused on studying anything related to them in depth. As a result, I’m quite comfortable with computers and started teaching myself through YouTube and the internet in general. I tried an online cybersecurity course (Cisco) and also video game development with Unity. In the end, I chose web development and took a couple of free courses, not very in-depth, offered by the employment service in my country, the last one being a full-stack course with Laravel and Angular. And here come my questions.

I don’t like frontend work very much, meaning creating designs and making everything look nice. I prefer backend, databases, and those kinds of things. Although I understand that it’s important to have basic knowledge of how to create a simple frontend. So my question is, after this time and having been completely disconnected, should I continue where I left off, with JS and PHP? Would you recommend any other language or framework for building web applications? Is there something I could focus on that doesn’t require frontend work?

Any advice is appreciated

It's so hard to get a job just to be laid off a few months later.

\- Then he will be able to see data about the customer (or even fast order as last the one), edit/create new address  
\- Then he will be able to mention how many pizzas  
\- Then he will be able to apply slices amount and toppings (for example onions on 2 slices)  
\- Then he will be asked to ""pay"" (will just click continue cuz it is not real)  
\- Then the order will be move to ""in progress"" and there will be able to put ""On Delivery""

Roles:  
\- Employee - will be able to create orders, update status  
\- Manager - has everything as employee, but will be able to CRUD employee

learnprogramming,I ask 'why' too often and always end up in rabbit holes making me feel inadequate,"I am a programming student for 4 years now and i still feel like i lack basic knowledge. I made an .NET API which uses signalR for realtime communication, Docker to containerize it, and MongoDb as database. I use onion architecture to connect everything together. I feel like those things are somewhat more advanced topics, but at the same time i feel like i dont understand the depth of it. I know the abstracts and why to use them, but i wouldn't be able to create it without the use of Google.   
  
An example was creating the db connection. Those are two lines of the code i used:  
`var settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(connectionString);`

`_client = new MongoClient(settings);`  
It gets a connection string from the methods params, and creates ClientSettings. Then is creates a new MongoClient with those settings. This is when i ask 'why?' as in 'why do i need to create a settings object?', 'why do i need a MongoClient?' et cetera. The answer to those questions dont really matter for further developing. Trying to understand those 'why's' I always end up in rabbit holes to the point i just accept that this is how it has to be done. But this makes me feel inadequate because i feel like im supposed to know 'why'. 

Im not looking for an actual answer to the example above. I'm interested how others handle situations where thing become a bit more complex when you question it.   
  
I kinda have this mentality: ""To drive a car you dont need to know how a car works internally you only need to know how to use it."". Do you think this is how you should approach coding as wel?

learnprogramming,How to focus in classes,"Hi everyone,

I'm a student currently learning programming at one of the top schools in my country. I'm doing really well in my programming classes and consider myself one of the best in my group. However, I feel like classes in subjects like biology, chemistry, and geography are a waste of time for me.

The good part is that many of my teachers are pretty chill and don’t mind if I’m on my phone during class. So, I’ve been using that time to focus on programming. I think I'm pretty good in frontend development, and right now, I’m learning Java through MOOC.fi.

The problem is that I can’t focus properly while reading the course material on my phone during class. The teacher talking and the noise from other students make it hard for me to concentrate and fully understand what I’m reading.

TL;DR: How can I stay productive and better understand what I’m learning when reading programming material on my phone during noisy classes?",GladRefrigerator7285,1h7xcm9,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7xcm9/how_to_focus_in_classes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7xcm9/how_to_focus_in_classes/,2024-12-06 09:06:54,2,0.6,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h7xcm9

I have already built a Pinterest bot using the Selenium framework with Python, which uploads local images from your file path onto a Pinterest board. However, I'd like to enhance it by enabling the bot to download the latest image from an artist’s Instagram account and upload it to my Pinterest board. Ideally, I would like to keep this program running without it stopping (until a curtain issue/bug occurs). I want the program to have some sort of timestamp and check if the Instagram account has uploaded a new image.

I've applied to college for computer science, and I'm especially interested in machine learning, so I'll probably be doing cs major stats minor or something similar.

I know *how* to learn anything, so my question isn't where to start, I just want some advice on what to use my time for. I'm torn between AI-focused study like linear algebra &amp; ML, or something more broad for coing as a whole, since I'm not 100% committed to AI/ML. And I don't want to waste time self-studying something that I'll just re-learn in college, though I know for many of these things prior knowledge is very helpful. Also, I want to make sure I'm not missing any opportunities to start working today toward an early intership and strong path to a career, so any advice for the path to a job would be greately appreciated as well.

learnprogramming,Connecting to Public Databases,"I have very little coding knowledge, but I have a really interesting idea that I can’t seem to advance further.

I used chat gpt to create a basic user interface using html, css, and js. The interface is essentially a calculator, which uses a user input value and returns a list of calculated values based on other data.

Given my extremely novice knowledge on how all this shit works, I “hard coded” the other data needed for the calculations into the code. This data needs to be updated regularly for the calculations to be accurate, which is a very tedious process, but it is open source data found on the web. I understand there’s a way to automate this, but chat gpt and my online research hasn’t really helped.

Basically, I’m looking for a way to connect a public data source to my code so the most recent data will be used in the calculations. If I understand the process right, I think I need some kind of “crawling”? application to pull the data, a database to store it in, and a function within my html/css/js to call the data into the calculations. So the flow would be:

Public DB -&gt; personal DB (backend static data) -&gt; interface (front end calculated data)

Can anyone help me get started with the right services to try this out on for free?

learnprogramming,In the woods and I can't see the trees. Need some help with this CS Lab,"Hello. I've been stuck on this Lab program for my CS course for the past 2 days and I am so deep in the forest I can't see the trees around me anymore.

I was wondering if anyone could take a look and help me determine the issue in my logic for why I am returning the wrong node when I ""check an invalid tree with a right child linking to it's ancestor node.""

Missing code breakdown:

\- The ""Node.java"" file provides the Node class with access to the node value using getData, and the  left and right node values through getLeft and getRight methods.

\- The ""Main.java"" file breaks apart the input through a ""tuple-based"" representation of a binary search tree.

The input looks like this:

(50, (25, None, (60)), (75))

Here, the program would return 60, because that node violates a BST because the node 60 would be on the left side of the tree, and 60 is greater than the root node 50.

           50
       /          \
    25             75
       \
         60
    
    
    
    
    import java.util.*;
    public class BSTChecker {
    public static Node checkBSTValidity(Node rootNode) {
    // helper method with null boundaries and an empty set for ancestors
      return checkBSTHelper(rootNode, null, null, new HashSet&lt;&gt;());
    }
    
    private static Node checkBSTHelper(Node node, Integer nodeMin, Integer nodeMax, Set&lt;Node&gt; ancestors) {
    // base case: if the node is null, the subtree is valid
      if (node == null) {
        return null;
      }
    
    // if node is not null and less than min, then violation and return node
    // or
    // if node is not null and greater than max, then violation and return node
      if ((nodeMin != null &amp;&amp; node.key &lt;= nodeMin) || (nodeMax != null &amp;&amp; node.key &gt;= nodeMax)) {
        return node;
      }
    
    // check ancestor set for violation
      if (ancestors.contains(node)) {
        return node;
      }
    
    // return the current node causing the left child violation
      if (node.left != null &amp;&amp; ancestors.contains(node.left)) {
        return node;
      }
    
    // return the current node causing the right child violation
      if (node.right != null &amp;&amp; ancestors.contains(node.right)) {
        return node;
      }
    // add current node in traversal to ancestor hash set
      ancestors.add(node);
    
    // recusively check left side
      Node leftViolation = checkBSTHelper(node.left, nodeMin, node.key, ancestors);
      
      if (leftViolation != null) {
          return leftViolation;
      }
    
    // recursively check right side
      Node rightViolation = checkBSTHelper(node.right, node.key, nodeMax, ancestors);
    
      if (rightViolation != null) {
        return rightViolation;
      }
    
    // remove node once traversed
      ancestors.remove(node);
    
    // return null if no violation detected in subtree
      return null;
      }
    }

The criteria for this program:

\`\`\`Java  
A violating node X will meet one or more of the following conditions:

* X is in the left subtree of ancestor Y, but X's key is &gt; Y's key
* X is in the right subtree of ancestor Y, but X's key is &lt; Y's key
* X's left or right child references an ancestor

\`\`\`

All of my unit tests pass except # 9, where ""X's left or right child references an ancestor"" is not returning the correct node.

Here are my unit tests:

1: Input

    (10, (20), (30, (29), (31)))

Your output

    20

2: Input

    (20, (10), (30, (29), (31)))

Your output

    No violation

3: Input

    (80, (60, (40, (20, None, (50)), None), None), None)

Your output

    50

4: Valid tree with 10 nodes  
Test feedback

    BSTChecker.checkBSTValidity() correctly returned null

5: Invalid tree with right child's key less than parent's key  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

6: Invalid tree with left child's key greater than parent's key  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

7: Invalid tree with lesser key in right subtree  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

8: Invalid tree with right child linking to ancestor  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() returned a node that is not the BST rule-violating node. The node with either the left or right child pointing to an ancestor must be returned.

9: Invalid tree with left child linking to parent  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

10: Invalid tree with left child linking to ancestor  
Test feedback

checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.",FourKicks17,1h7jw3d,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7jw3d/in_the_woods_and_i_cant_see_the_trees_need_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h7jw3d/in_the_woods_and_i_cant_see_the_trees_need_some/,2024-12-05 21:08:18,7,0.82,7,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Code Review,,t3_1h7jw3d

I was very good at maths but somehow lost the track for past 4 years (failed a lot lol) , currently i want to regain my mathematical powers too. Also I forgot to mention I am in an engineering college so it's not like I am totally disconnected with maths academically . Nowwwww what I need ! , There are tons of Youtube tutorials on how one should proceed and roadmaps (afterall i have to learn from youtube right?) , the reason I am here (again , changed) is to ask what should be the best

1)source

2)roadmap

3)suggestion of language and projects

I umm do not believe there is something best which i would follow and get all einsteined!! but what i need is from y'all experts that a noob like me who can use is hibernating brain and wake it up again and get going into what he really wants. Some other questions which i want to be answered is after this AI effect and all this machine learning being a necessity what should i target from a financial point of view and some good job prospective. I stated above that cs is my passion but to say it in a more broader way about my passion I like Quants , business and shit and programming and AI are like a addon to them which i also like .  It's like years before when i was in the game i had targeted i would do sql , data science , quants and all but now after being brain rotted all these years I have no ffin clue so I am here. :)

PS: Was a fulltime reddit rot (thankfully deleted that) , one of the reasons for downfall , should've controlled . sheeshhhhh not going down the memory lane       past is past , i don't wanna look back and even if i do wanna look back it would be a moment where i think of it as a good time spent posting skibidi memes lol (still got the humor i guess , will continue but not the same way as it was)

Now I am yapping a lot sorry (There is no purpose of this post to get excessive upvotes or smtg , i just want your genuine help for a believer like me) , i think i have yapped much and framed my questions well .  Will check all yours suggestions after my sem exams are over (prolly 3 weeks at most) , old me wouldn't had did this but i don't wanna repeat the same mistake of wasting time at time of exams lol which if i utilized i would've been a mod here rather than being a mod for some brain rot meme page ( no hate , laughing is life) .

learnprogramming,How do I get started building a “tech portfolio” to show hiring companies once I feel ready? ,"
I am pretty new to all of this and starting from scratch. But quite lost when it comes to the “building my portfolio” realm. 

I am starting off with saving my homework and projects from classes I am taking for free right now. (cannot afford to pay for classes but edx.org is great for this atm.) currently just taking the mere basics: intro to CS, have done basic python, and scratch so far. Then will take intro to prog with python. I’ve done a project for HTML5 already so I’ll be adding that too. 

1) should I save the homework and projects I am doing with the classes I’m taking rn? 

2) how am I able to build a website for free? I see a lot of portfolios have their own domain… how can I do this? 

3) is a “portfolio” basically a domain where you attach all your work in there? If so, how can I make it where all my work is cohesive in there to show candidates once I do finish some classes? 

4) have any of you started from scratch, no degree in CS, but learned the skillset, got your portfolio right, and got entry level positions? 

5) would internships be applicable to me even if I am not enrolled in an institution but rather taking free classes that teaches you how to code? 

Currently using edx.org 

Professor David Malan from Harvard University is teaching these classes. Pre recorded ofc. just in case anyone needs then information. Completely free and pretty much feels like you’ve paid for the course itself. 

6) how would I go about adding these skills? In my resume? Would I be able to add the institution I took it with regardless if I paid for it but am currently enrolled  except it’s free? 

I am pretty lost in this and prob not asking the right questions but I hope I can find some clarity on here. Thank you.

COMP 171: Final Exam Study Guide

This study guide notes the topics that will be covered by the exam, and offers some breakdown of the topics into important sub-topics to keep in mind.

For all topics listed, you should be able to write code, understand/trace code, and answer open-ended questions relying on these topics (as you’ve seen on the quizzes).

Design

	•	Important components of software design:
	•	Input, Output, Examples
	•	Domain Knowledge, Algorithm
	•	Know how to write a complete design from a client request.
	•	Design as related to functions (see Testing/Designing Functions).

Creating and Using Variables

Primitive Data Types

	•	int, float, str, bool
	•	How to convert between data types.

Expressions

	•	Math operators: +, -, *, /, //, %
	•	Boolean Expressions:
	•	Getting True or False with ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=.
	•	Combining Booleans with and, or, not.
	•	Order of operations.

Control Structures

	•	if, elif, else statements, while loops.
	•	How these structures make use of Boolean Expressions.
	•	for loop:
	•	range function (1, 2, or 3 arguments).
	•	for loops vs. while loops:
	•	Why choose one over the other.
	•	How to convert between them.
	•	Nested control structures (e.g., if inside while, nested for loops, etc.).

Functions

	•	Calling functions, passing arguments, saving return values.
	•	Built-in functions: print, input, range.
	•	Defining your own functions:
	•	docstrings, parameters, returning values, side effects (see also: collections).
	•	Tracing functions:
	•	Tracing variables, arguments, parameters, return values, and side effects in programs with function calls.

Testing/Designing Functions

	•	Test Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before writing the code for the function.
	•	Tests and function stubs as designs:
	•	docstrings show input/output from functions.
	•	Tests show examples.
	•	Choosing good test cases, writing several different tests to check different behavior.

Strings as Collections

	•	Simple actions to use strings as collections:
	•	Creating, indexing, looping, concatenating.
	•	Using these simple actions to make more complex functions:
	•	find, count, slice, remove, etc.

Lists

	•	Common actions on lists:
	•	Creating, indexing, looping, appending.
	•	Searching for an item in a list (find function).
	•	Indexing to access/change items in lists.
	•	Using a for loop to:
	•	Access/change items in a list.
	•	Passing lists as parameters, and returning lists.
	•	Tracing how lists are stored differently in memory, and the results.
	•	Side effects:
	•	How/why passing lists is different than other data types.
	•	When/how side effects are possible with lists.

Here is the extracted content from the latest image:

2D Collections

	•	2D lists: Lists of lists, lists of strings.
	•	Accessing, creating, changing individual items in 2D lists.

Dictionaries

	•	Putting key-value pairs into dictionaries.
	•	Checking if a key is in a dictionary.
	•	Accessing values with a key from dictionaries.
	•	Iterating through all keys and values in a dictionary.
	•	Side effects on dictionaries.

Lists vs. Dictionaries

	•	When to use a dictionary over a list?
	•	When to use a list over a dictionary?

Reading Information from Files

	•	Opening and closing files.
	•	Getting data from text files using readlines().
	•	Cleaning up data:
	•	Changing strings into lists (split function).
	•	Removing \n.
	•	Turning strings into integers or floats.

Let me know if you’d like further clarification or additional formatting! ￼

For example, when you create a tree, which is a data structure, and then pass that into the function, the tree is effectively a data type, no? In this case, the tree is after all the type of value that you are passing in.

As another example, you could create a list forest by making a list of trees.... in this case, you effectively have a list of the data type tree, if I am understanding correctly.

learnprogramming,How can i set myself up for a job as a software dev student? also thoughts on AI?,"
Hi!

I have just finished my first year studying software development in Sydney Australia. Although i found it a bit tricky as i had never done any coding before I actually really enjoyed it and am excited to keep learning. 

My degree is 3, maybe 4 years if i do honours. I want to make sure im doing all that i can now in order to set myself up for the future and land myself a good job. I know it’s really important to do projects and get internships. I have tried starting a project but am a bit confused where to even start 😅. 

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on what i can be doing now so i’m not wasting these 3-4 years. To those who are now working what did you do to get to where you are and was there anything you wish you did?

Also, do you think with all this stuff coming up with AI, is it worth doing a double degree? I am currently doing a double degree with science but i want to drop it so i can graduate earlier and I don’t think it will be useful. Does anyone have any insights on this?

I barely managed to get through the final project (a movie database), and even then, I had to rely heavily on external resources and help from others.

I am going on holiday soon, so I would like to use some of that time to catch up on topics I should know and also learn new things that will help me going forward. How should I approach this? Should I work on basic projects, tackle coding challenges, or take free online courses? Also, when I don’t understand something, what’s the best way to approach it?

learnprogramming,Looking for insight around best practices to consider before diving into a SPA from scratch.,"I'm new to software dev and want to try my hand at my first SPA from scratch, but I wanted to ask some more senior folks what are the current industry standard best practices, a checklist of them, to run through to make sure I'm doing it the right way?

Things like efficiency, security, etc.. what do the pros do before starting a build and what do they make sure is included in their code before anything goes live?

I guess some more examples would be things like rate limiting, making sure youre in a venv etc..

again, I'm very new and have learned a lot in the past few months but just wanted to see if anyone more experienced wouldn't mind sharing their input here before I dive in.

learnprogramming,Small business using VB - Switch or let it die?,"Let me jump right in. For nearly 10 years now I've been working with my father designing/supporting niche business web apps written in VB. My father recently passed away, and now that the business is mine, I'm wondering if it's even worth continuing. I'm a little familiar with C# but I'm not looking forward to making the switch, nor do I have the funds to hire help (it's a very small business).  To be honest, I.T. is not my passion - I mainly took this job because, let's face it, the perks of working in a family business are unparalleled.

On the other hand, if I shut the business down, I feel like my qualifications for a new job in this industry are zilch at this point.  I call myself a ""kindergarten programmer"" because I'm sure they will be teaching what I do in kindergarten someday  - it's just VB, HTML and CSS. I'd have to either go back to school or change careers entirely. I'm 48.

What would you do if you were me? I know there are VB to C# converters but how much of a pain is it to do, really? Would anyone buy a business that is so small and uses such ancient technology?  Am I correct in thinking that my work experience is worth diddlysquat on the job market today?

\- I can do some problems, but the problem is that I cannot handle all the test cases, only a few of them. Some of the questions I know why I made mistakes and made mistakes, some I don't even know where I made mistakes (I even thought the test was wrong lol). This is also the most difficult thing for me because of course when taking the test I can only submit my questions once but most of the questions I don't get a full test.

\- That's the most frustrating thing for me, I feel like I'm not making any progress and just standing still, this makes me especially worried and almost lose confidence in myself.

Have any of you here gone through or are going through this stage? Have you ever felt a loss of confidence, doubted your abilities? Have you ever felt discouraged and wanted to give up?

That's probably how I feel right now, so I need some advice and sharing from you.

Rn Bro codes videos are saving my ass on the basics of coding but I'm struggling to produce any real code and it takes me too long to produce something for my classes. 

As of recent we've been having on coding alot of math functions on C, I feel so lost, I can't find any videos specifically on C discussing examples on a case basis.  For me it's best to learn things in context.

I briefly looked over the FAQ section the only thing that stood out to me that had C was the MIT course but it looks like a jargon of text, I probably go over it and see if it helps. However id really appreciate a course that goes straight to the point, as soon I'll have to write a program to pass the class fully by myself.

learnprogramming,Question for non-QWERTY-like keyboard users (e.g. AZERTY / QWERTZ),"I'm developing a programming language specifically for people who will probably never do a lot of programming. I aim to have my target audience make as few changes as possible to their daily lives, and learn as few new things as possible, in order for them to get the benefit of programming that I want them to have. One factor of that is the symbols used in the language's syntax and their accessibility on various keyboard layouts.

After some research I found that about 15-20% of people who have daily personal access to a desktop or laptop computer do not have a standard QWERTY-like layout. On those non-standard layouts, the way to type certain symbols such as \~, \^ and \\ is quite hidden. Those I could quite easily not use in my syntax. But apparently the same holds for  \[, \], { and }, which I don't see nice alternatives for. I'm trying to find out if it's worth my time to find a solution, or to what degree I alienate 15-20% of my target audience if I don't.

So my question to those without a QWERTY-like layout. When you started learning programming in a language that uses \[, \], { and } quite often, how much of a hurdle was this to learn how to type, and after learning it, how much of an annoyance is it still to type them? Secondarily, the same question but for \~, \^ and \\.",vuurdier,1h6glch,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6glch/question_for_nonqwertylike_keyboard_users_eg/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6glch/question_for_nonqwertylike_keyboard_users_eg/,2024-12-04 13:57:27,0,0.5,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6glch

learnprogramming,Best Practices for Synchronizing Supabase Auth and Local Database in a NestJS App,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I’m working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What’s the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?
* Any tips for optimizing this flow for scalability and maintaining clean code?",Aymsep,1h6f3ix,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,2024-12-04 12:43:36,0,0.5,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6f3ix
learnprogramming,need help starting a budget tracking program for beginner programming project,"Hey,  

I’ve heard that the best way to learn programming is through real-world projects, so I decided that I want to create a budget tracking app to manage my personal finances (for now on PC/CLI project). I want to build it in Go since that’s the language I’m currently learning during my internship, but I’m still a beginner and not sure if it’s the best choice.  

I planned to make it a simple command-line app to focus on learning the basics, but I keep getting stuck, even at the start. For example:  
- How do I create a “test account”?  
- How do I handle a transaction?  
- How can I track income and expenses?  

I’ve tried Googling but never found clear answers. There are YouTube tutorials for similar projects, but I feel like just copying code wouldn’t really teach me anything.  

Does anyone have advice on how to approach a project like this? How do you break it into steps when you’re stuck even at the beginning?

learnprogramming,Have a BS in Computer Science but never learned how to build a website,"I studied computer science for 5 years at university, and not one person ever decided to teach me how to build a website. The closest I got to taking a web development class was **Introduction to Web Development**, where we just reviewed development workflows like Agile and sketched out pictures of what we wanted a website to look like.

Now that I'm a full-on graduate, I’d like to make my own website, but I don’t even know where to begin. In the past, I’ve tried following tutorials or using AI to help me out, but now I actually want to understand what I’m doing. Making a responsive website feels especially intimidating—I have zero clue what the standards are for webpage layouts.

Currently, I’m working on a website that visualizes data recorded from multiple remote water monitors. These monitors fall into three categories, each recording different metrics: water detection, temperature, and turbidity. The data is sent to a relational database service running PostgreSQL on AWS.

The purpose of the website is to help environmental scientists understand and interpret the data recorded by these water monitors. Users should be able to log in securely, though I’m not exactly sure how to manage separating devices between different organizations. Right now, the remote water monitoring devices use ChirpStack and LoRaWAN to communicate with my AWS database. I use the ChirpStack network server web interface to add new monitors, but I’m not sure how I’d incorporate adding or removing monitors into the website itself.

For now, I’m focusing on creating a website that visualizes the data uploaded to my database. Handling organizational separation is a problem for another day because it’s just too much to think about, and I doubt anyone has a clear answer off the bat. I’ve probably lost most of you by now, so here’s a rough outline of what I *think* I want for this project:

# Goals for the Website:

1. **Secure login**: Users should be able to log in securely.
2. **Homepage with a dashboard**: This dashboard should display the following charts:
   * A graph showing water temperature over time.
   * A graph showing water turbidity over time.
   * A table indicating whether water was detected (T/F).
3. **Chart controls**: Users should be able to toggle between displaying data for all monitors or selecting data from a specific monitor.
4. **Data export**: Users should be able to download data as a CSV or Excel file. They should also be able to select the range of data they want to export.
5. **Statistical summaries**: I’d like users to see some key statistics, such as the highest average temperature per day across a week, month, or year. There are probably more useful statistics to include, but this is the only one I’ve thought of so far. I’m not sure where these stats should appear on the website, but they should be somewhere.
6. **Responsive design**: The website should look good and function well on any screen size (mobile, tablet, or desktop).

This post is both a cry for help and a way to dump all the thoughts I have about this project. I wish I had more knowledge about how to make a user-friendly website, but I’m so lost. This project might take me years to complete unless I get help from someone who knows what they’re doing. I’d love any suggestions on where to learn this stuff. I’m sure there are tons of resources out there, but I just don’t know where to begin.

learnprogramming,Writing a text editor. what's best solution to syntax parser/lexer nowadays?,"First, some word definitions (correct me if i'm wrong)
- lexer: tokenizes text for syntax highlighting but does not analyze syntax structure.
- syntax parser / parser: parses code into a syntax tree (AST). basically, lexer + structure

So far, i've found 3+1 viable solutions:
- Tree sitter (parser)
- Scintilla (lexer)
- Clang
- Custom parser/lexer

So, my assumptions/observations is that:

    1. tree sitter generates an accurate AST (abstract syntax tree), 
        - is advertised to run asynchronously and parse ""incrementally""
        - Seems to takes more cpu/ram
    
    2. scintilla parses flat list of tokens, 
    e.g. recognizes if the token is type, variable, data, function declaration, etc. 
        - is NOT advertised to run asynchronously, but i see no reason why it couldn't do that. 
        - i don't know if it parses ""incrementally"". 
        - Seems to take less cpu/ram.

    3. Clang bascially is supposed to be more acurate tree sitter, it's litteraly the compiler.
        - Only c/c++
        - The api will probably be complex &amp; hard to use.

Another note: one feature I like from editor called ""Geany"" - it uses information prased by lexer to do syntax highlighting (obviously), as well as code navigation.

I don't understand why so many editors do tedious task of syntax highlighting a document, only for an lsp to do the SAME TASK again. it does parsing the same document TWICE. That's one of the reason why i'm writing a text editor btw.",dirty-sock-coder-64,1h68jqd,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h68jqd/writing_a_text_editor_whats_best_solution_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h68jqd/writing_a_text_editor_whats_best_solution_to/,2024-12-04 05:15:12,2,0.75,2,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h68jqd

learnprogramming,The gap between the learning environment and the real cases,"I'm really confused by the environment when learning programming. They are always command line, shell, console or whatever, with bulks of similar concepts come up like module, library, framework. And the only usage of it seems to be that you can see the output on the screen when run it.

However, what you actually use or see everyday is softwares in desktop or apps in smartphone that are much more vivid and touchable. There is **HUGE GAP** between the environment and the actual cases. And what's worse is that no one try to make it clear and the beginners have to keep the confusion unresolved by patience until they walk through the path nearly till the end, or they just give up which might the most cases.

As for me, I tried to learn programming at least 8 times in the past 20 years, ranging from BASIC, C, VB, VBA, ActionScript, Javascript, R, SQL, Python. All were abandoned(except for SQL as it has to be used in daily work) following the same route:  passionate, make a little progress, confused(no resolved), boring, give up, till the next passionate period come.

Sometimes I was thinking that if there were any method that could motivate the niwbie by bridging the gap when I was caught up in the confusion, I would have arrived the learning curve's final end safely in the first time.

I can still remember how disappointed and discouraged I was when I was taught to test my toy code in the Turbo-C blue screen when learning C language. At that time you had been already  surrounded by the fabulous and splendid websites and mulimedia, whereas you are still learning the basics in an ancient environment which makes the question always pops up: is this really the staff build the product?

Many years ago I've heard a solo developer of one popular music player said the player was written by VC6(seems to be a quite old programming language). I was wondering 'How could that be?'. I mean, how could the boring text statements print, def, if else, for while ... become the final apps/softwares we've seen and used?

I had the confusion then, and it seems still the same for beginners now, because no lessons fill this confusion gap. All of them just teach how to print, how to define a variable/list/function, how to loop, etc., in front of a black text-based screen.

How much time is left to see the real power of programming to build real things?

learnprogramming,Which Programming Languages Do LLMs Understand Best? ,"
I’ve been wondering if there’s any research or data about which programming languages large language models (LLMs) have the most context and understanding of.

It seems logical that LLMs would perform better with certain languages, likely because those languages are more widely used or have a larger amount of online data available for training. For example, if we compare Dart and Flutter (a relatively young language and framework, still evolving with frequent major updates) to Java and the Spring Framework (a long-standing and stable language and framework with extensive documentation and enterprise adoption), I’d expect LLMs to perform better with the latter.

This makes sense: Java and Spring have been around for decades, are widely adopted, and likely have more documentation, examples, and discussions available online. This probably means LLMs were trained on more comprehensive datasets for these technologies.

But how much does this actually affect the quality of the code generated by LLMs? Does it impact how well they can assist programmers in building projects or learning certain languages/frameworks?

I’m particularly curious about how this plays out for developers who rely on AI for daily coding tasks. Does the maturity and stability of a language or framework make a noticeable difference in the ease of use, or does AI bridge that gap? If anyone has insights, research, or anecdotes, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

learnprogramming,What I wish I knew when so I could’ve escaped tutorial hell earlier.,"""Stop spending so much time watching tutorials and start building projects."" You've heard this advice a lot but you ask yourself, ""Am I ready?"" The answer is probably yes.


As a beginner, particularly in web dev, you should know: 
- Basics of HTML and CSS 
- Basic JS syntax - variables, arrays, loops, data types, objects, operators, conditionals, functions, etc.
 - Also try to get a firm understanding of async/await and promises. This will be crucial for working on web apps.


After this, begin learning about the web. Get an overview to understand how the frontend, backend and databases interact with each other.


Learn about Git/Github and why source control (aka saving your code) is important and learn a few commands such as changing directory, listing files and making a new directory.


From here, choose a frontend framework such as React and/or Next.js, a backend framework such as Express and SQL for either Postgres or MySQL.


Learn the basics of these, including how to build a page with basic interface on the frontend and make API calls, learn how to create an API endpoint/routes on the backend, how to connect to a database of your choice and how to query it.  


Now stop! 


Congratulations, you're now equipped to start building projects. Notice how I didn't tell you to spend hours upon hours watching YouTube tutorials. Or how I didn't tell you to learn all the advanced topics of each language and framework.


The main point is that you don’t need to know everything. You don't need to be an ""expert"". You can learn the rest along the way using Google, YouTube, Stack Overflow and AI. Building projects will speed up your learning x10.

learnprogramming,Where to start? TOP?,"Hi All,

I'm currently working as an IT Support technician based in the UK but want to get into programming as a possible career.

Where would people recommend to start? Seen a few mentions of The Odin Project. I don't really want to design websites but imagine basic HTML and CSS knowledge would help if I go down the Javascript route. 

I was also looking at Team Treehouse as it looks like they offer a bit of everything which may help in my decision making of which programming route to go down.

learnprogramming,Starting Over with a BSCS degree,"So I have my B.S. Computer Science degree in about 2 weeks, and honestly I do not like to say it, but I feel like my brain has been in a bit of a mush especially with regard to my CS degree. I know that while I have coded extensively in the past, as well as the first 2 years of my college career essentially being focused on coding at the more fundamental levels, the higher level courses for my last 2 has mainly been theory and mathematics based, and while I enjoy certain aspect of it, I also have taken two minors in addition that may have adjusted courses in my brain, and now I don't really know where I can start. I haven't coded much of any substantial especially in the past 24 months, as majority of my time has been spent on interview, essays, work, and so forth. 

Now starting in 2025, I want to get back and dip my toe into programming again. I have built a 3D printer that is not working for some reason and I also want to splurge on a few new hardwares starting in 2025 specifically to focus on streaming, video editing, blender rendering, and of course coding. I do plan on buying a leetcode subscription and I already have a Neetcode subscription as well. 

I also want to venture out and do actual projects, and not the cookie cutter ReactJS stuffs but actual projects that can generate me some viable users. I do know that there are several avenues I could take with this route, but I primarily want to focus on video game development.

I also am aware that I need to hold myself accountable, but I don't really know how other than to meet certain metrics (get this X part of Y done by next week, get the game engine functioning in 4 weeks, etc). I don't really know how else to venture this topic, but I do plan on also interviewing and hopefully visiting the city I want to live in as well as continue my current part-time job and turn it into full-time as well if nothing else goes right, but it really comes down to what I can do at the moment, which is 5 whole days of free time usually.

learnprogramming,PRNG in X: Getting used to a new language's essential syntax.,"Hi there! I'm mostly a C and x86\_64 assembly dev who's been dabbling in Rust, but I had a random idea - write a very small project which I'm very familiar with, an LCG PRNG, once in a bunch of different languages.

A PRNG, if you don't know already, is a pseudo-random number generator, and is essentially a group of algorithms which define how computers generate ""random"" numbers. Note the quotes and the word *pseudo* because they aren't really random - they start with a seed value, which is often the time, then generate the next random number based on that, the next one based on that previous one, and so on. LCG, or linear congruential generator, is a very very simple algorithm for PRNGs (see the wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_congruential\_generator).

My concept is this: A very very simple program, a PRNG, implemented in various different languages (so far: x86\_64 NASM assembly, C, C++, Rust, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Python), which makes for a very easy way to learn the syntax. No heavy commenting besides one at the start of the file and at the start of each function, no huge explanation, no complicated concepts of the language. Just the essential syntax.

Hopefully this is useful to at least one person. **Please note** that I am not an expert at all these languages, and as I've said near the start, most of my knowledge is in C and Assembly, meaning that some of the implementations in other languages may not be perfect. If you see something wrong, feel free to leave a comment or open a pull request.

learnprogramming,is it possible to create DATA STRUCTURE CONCEPTS from scratch without prior knowledge?,"# conclusion

Edit2: I've worded many parts of this post in a bad way, so now this is basically my conclusion/decision to hopefully clear up my question.  
\--How should I go about creating my own implementations of ""data structures, methods, and algorithms""  
before learning them?--  
the main purpose of my post was to figure what I wanted. I thought I wanted to learn basic functions in C to try recreate data structures.  
I've now come to realize that I only want to create my own implementations of existing data structs, algorithms, and methods.  
I've decided to roughly to follow idea 2, and along with some suggestions/guides from others.

**Yapp** (this is just me yapping)  
honestly the rest of my post from here has become a mess and confusion to anyone trying to read and know what I'm asking. I'm considering restructuring the whole thing to clean it up but that will probably make it worse.  
I have my answer now and my post is \[**SOLVED**\] so I will just leave it alone.  
thanks to everyone for the help, and suggestions. my wishes have been fulfilled and my gratitude shall be.., for as long as I remember.  
\---

Edit1: After reading some of the replies I have a better idea of my question  
\-what fundamentals (in C or other lang) like **pointers, memory allocation, etc..**  
do I need to know to try create my own implementations of common **data structures.**

I will be learning them in my own time I would just like a rough list of which functions and concepts are used to make the data structures without learning the data structures themselves.

# original question:

I know what I want but I don't know the right question but basically..

I want to try and create data structures (in C),  
Without learning them or following a tutorial.

so no prior knowledge on how to make them but I know generally what they are (lists, arrays, dicts, ...) and the basic methods (append, insert, delete, etc..).

Sort of like re-inventing the wheel,, maybe?(idk).

If anyone (that's learnt data structures and such) thinks this is a fools errand and has an alternative suggestion they think is better please write. I'm open to suggestions and not absolutely set on this path.

# Disclaimer

I will be searching for materials and thinking of ways to do this. I'm just posting in here because it will be a lot easier for someone who already knows the structure and insights of data structures to tell me what is needed **before** I learn the data structures.

# Idea 1

My first idea of navigating this is to learn the things you need to know to make/write data structures..  
(pointers, the stack, and functions that work with those)  
*I don't know much of the things (functions, structures, etc) needed to write them,*  
*because learning about those would probably include learning a data structure which I want to try*  
*create myself without prior knowledge.*

*I will do some searching for those after this post.*  
\- then choose a data structure and see what it does on the surface, basic input and output  
and try to recreate the 'inner' code for the data struct and then the methods for that struct

# Idea 2

edit1()  
learn 1 or two of the basic data structures then look at a 3rd one and how it works but not how to implement it.  
and create my own implementation  
~~and what it does from a surface level perspective and try to recreate the inner workings~~ .

# --

\-some may think it's 'better' (more efficient) to just learn them and focus on how to utilise them. But this is just something I think will be fun..

If anyone would be so kind to humor me. I would be much obliged. ;)

**side notes**

programming is a hobby for me. I've briefly learned the basics of python3, and have done a handful of scripting projects(AHKv2). So I'm not really worried about trouble learning the fundamentals of C but more-so focused on knowing what I need to learn.

I am considering to do the same with sorting-algorithms and the like. if anyone has any comment on that but I think I'll save that for another time/post.",xtyzii,1h5jpot,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h5jpot/is_it_possible_to_create_data_structure_concepts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h5jpot/is_it_possible_to_create_data_structure_concepts/,2024-12-03 09:32:53,3,1.0,3,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h5jpot

I have an opportunity now to develop these skills before I go back in the workforce, but I do not know where to start. Any suggestions would be much appreciated, and any other experiences from iOS developers out there that might help. Thank you. 

p.s. is it normal now for juniors not get much help from the seniors? I thought that was the point of being a junior.. a little mentorship. They told me those days are done..

learnprogramming,Where are these weird numbers coming from? (simple C adding program),"Hi all

So I'm just beginning to dip my toes into C here, and after my obligatory Hello World program I decided to try something a little more ambitious using `scanf` and a simple function. Well, after a frustrating couple of hours of weeding the syntax errors out of an ostensibly stupid simple add-two-numbers program (that I came up with *without* referring to a tutorial) I got something that successfully compiled. I'm sure I did everything wrong anyway, but the results are particularly peculiar. Here's the program:

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int sum (int a, int b, int answer);
    int main ()
    {
        int a;
        int b;
        int answer;
        printf (""Enter two numbers dammit: "");
        scanf (""%d, %d"", &amp;a, &amp;b);
        printf (""The two numbers are: %d, %d"", a, b);
        printf (""The answer is: %d"", answer);
        printf (""\n"");
        return 0;
    }
    int sum (int a, int b, int answer)
    {
        answer = a + b;
        return answer;
    }

And here is what I get:

    Enter two numbers dammit: 3 5
    The two numbers are: 3, 708928112The answer is: 32766

Wtf?

I'm guessing it has to do with either a poorly written function or something having to do with `scanf` . Specifically something about the variables and the `&amp;a / &amp;b` variables vs `a / b` as I understand that the &amp; signifies that they're pointers to the actual variable values. I still don't understand a lot of that stuff, so please feel free to pick this piece of crud apart and tell me where I screwed up, I'd be most appreciative.

I’m creating a simple menu with a button, but I keep running into the following errors:

1. **Non-nullable field 'myButton' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider adding the 'required' modifier or declaring the field as nullable.**
2. **Non-nullable field 'menuCanvas' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider adding the 'required' modifier or declaring the field as nullable.**
3. **Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'UnityAction' because it is not a delegate type.**

Here is the code I’m working with:

using MelonLoader;

using UnityEngine;

using UnityEngine.UI;

namespace Menu

{

public class Class1 : MelonMod

{

private GameObject menuCanvas;

private Button myButton;

private bool menuVisible = false;

public override void OnInitializeMelon()

{

}

public override void OnUpdate()

{

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.F1)) 

{

menuVisible = !menuVisible;

menuCanvas.SetActive(menuVisible);

}

}

private void CreateMenu()

{



menuCanvas = new GameObject(""ModMenuCanvas"");

Canvas canvas = menuCanvas.AddComponent&lt;Canvas&gt;();

canvas.renderMode = RenderMode.WorldSpace;

RectTransform rectTransform = menuCanvas.GetComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();

rectTransform.sizeDelta = new Vector2(300, 200);

menuCanvas.transform.position = new Vector3(0, 2, 5);



GameObject buttonObject = new GameObject(""MyButton"");

buttonObject.transform.SetParent(menuCanvas.transform);

RectTransform buttonRect = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();

buttonRect.sizeDelta = new Vector2(100, 50);

buttonRect.localPosition = [Vector3.zero](http://Vector3.zero);

myButton = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;Button&gt;();

Text buttonText = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;Text&gt;();

buttonText.text = ""Click Me!"";

buttonText.font = Resources.GetBuiltinResource&lt;Font&gt;(""Arial.ttf"");

buttonText.color = [Color.black](http://Color.black);



myButton.onClick.AddListener(() =&gt; OnButtonClick());

}

private void OnButtonClick()

{

MelonLogger.Msg(""Button Clicked!"");

}

}

}

**The errors I am encountering:**

1. **Non-nullable field 'myButton' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor.** This seems to be related to the fact that I'm declaring `myButton` as non-nullable, but it's not getting assigned before the constructor ends. I thought that adding it in `CreateMenu()` would fix this, but it still throws the error.
2. **Non-nullable field 'menuCanvas' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor.** Similar issue with `menuCanvas`. It is declared non-nullable, but the assignment happens later in the `CreateMenu()` method.
3. **Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'UnityAction' because it is not a delegate type.** I am using a lambda expression to handle the button click (`myButton.onClick.AddListener(() =&gt; OnButtonClick());`). This causes an error, and I can't figure out how to fix it.

1)From my understanding, there is a white square (0000) to indicate the end of the message for the reader to know the difference between the data and the error correction code, but I think that this indicator is not always here, does it depend on the QR code version or the generator used?

learnprogramming,Are these string formats in scanf function in C language same or different [EXCERSISE],"There is an excersise in the book ""C programming A modern approach"" second edition by K.N King in chapter 3.

For each of the following pairs of **scanf** format strings,indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent.If they're not,show how they can be distinguished.

a) ""**%d**""               versus          "" **%d**""

b)""**%d-%d-%d**""   versus     ""**%d -%d -%d**""

c)""**%f**""                 versus     ""**%f** ""

d)""**%f,%f**""           versus      ""**%f, %f**""

Ok,I am sure that first two are equal,because scanf will ignore spaces in format string.

I am sure that in c) they are not the same,because scanf will not terminate unless you input non spaces charachters when you leave white space at the end of string formating.

I think that in b) they are not the same.Yes the format string ignore spaces but if the input string is for example ""3 -2 -1"" scanf will read 3 in %d then it will try to match - charachter with white space and scanf will terminate where scanf(""%d -%d -%d"") will read it successfully.

I think d) format strings are the same ,because or charachters match and white space is ignored.

Am I right or wrong?",Impossible_Visit2810,1h54b5o,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h54b5o/are_these_string_formats_in_scanf_function_in_c/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h54b5o/are_these_string_formats_in_scanf_function_in_c/,2024-12-02 20:05:57,1,0.67,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,excersise,,t3_1h54b5o

learnprogramming,From Tutorial Hell to Subscription Hell to AI Hell: My Journey of Learning Nothing,"They said: ""Leave YouTube tutorials and learn from well-structured paid courses."" So, I left tutorial hell and felt relieved—finally, some direction! However, I soon found myself in a new trap: subscription hell. These courses were indeed well-structured but offered no practical or real-life projects. Tic-Tac-Toe, calculators, hangman games—basic syntax and logic, but nothing that felt like genuine progress.

Frustrated, I sought out more serious and professional paid subscriptions, believing they would provide profound and comprehensive knowledge. Yet, I was met with courses spanning 80 hours of videos (seriously?) and still no meaningful success. Desperate for progress, I turned to platforms like DataCamp, only to find their content too shallow and overly simplistic. Real-life problems are vastly different from what these resources cover.

Seeing no progress and feeling increasingly unmotivated, I found myself drowning in an endless sea of YouTube tutorials, paid subscriptions, and shallow content. Then came ChatGPT. At first, it felt like a breakthrough—it solved my problems on demand. But even then, I found myself struggling to truly understand the code or grasp the deeper concepts. It felt like I was forgetting what programming was even supposed to be.

Now, I’m still determined to learn programming but plagued by confusion. Should I start with Java and then move to Python? Or begin with Python because it's supposedly easy and ubiquitous? And yet, Python's syntax feels clunky and unbearable to me. Why am I stuck in this endless cycle of `if`, `else`, and first-class syntax?

Am I missing something? Why can’t I break out of this loop?",Prestigious_Flow_465,1h51yoc,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h51yoc/from_tutorial_hell_to_subscription_hell_to_ai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h51yoc/from_tutorial_hell_to_subscription_hell_to_ai/,2024-12-02 18:30:45,125,0.89,125,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1h51yoc
learnprogramming,I kinda need to learn programming ASAP....,"(Warning, a lot of yapping in the beginnng, but I promise I actually get on track about program-related topic in the end! Just takes some time since there is a LOT of side information that is pretty important to note!)

Hi! I don't know how else to formulate this, but the title kind of sums it up. I'm a 16 year old girl (turning 17) in 2nd year of videregående (Norwegian high school). A little bit irrelevant, but I switched schools to one in a bigger city and I am now living alone, trying to figure out the stress between finding a job, living with other people in a shared house and all the frustrating things that come with that (which there obviously is a lot of surprisingly from college students that live in the same house and the fact that we're 6 people), the stress with having a lot of tests at the same time, struggling with taking physics and the fact that I'm pretty much on my way to failing math. 😅 so there is a lot of baggage.

That's just a small ""backstory"", per se, not that it's way too relevant. Earlier this year I had chemistry, which wasn't for me at all. I couldn't understand anything, a lot because I couldn't really pay attention due to how boring it was and also problem with sleep due to noisy roommates and such, and just frequently waking up at night and never being quite comfortable. This was a new thing for me, always having slept pretty good at other people's houses for sleepovers and of course at home. This lead to me failing the first chemistry test in the end of October with a nice ""1"", which is the failing grade in Norway, 2 being barely passing. Not even a plus or anything, just a simple 1. To try to save my grade, I had to take a test in-person with the two teachers, face to face with what i could only explain as almost as an interrogation to force some information out of it. I tried my best, studied a lot although it wouldn't sit and it was still not enough, and I still failed.

Now here comes the programming part. School in Norway start in August, and we were now in the beginning or middle of November, which nearing the end of the semester, really. Chemistry was a chosen subject, but it was almost way too far in for me to switch. But I knew I kind of had to, so I asked if I could. Between the choices of geoscience and biology, neither of them really interested me, but those were kind of my options. Chosen subjects are sorted into these ""blocks"" in Norway, where you can choose subjects from each block, and you have 4 blocks to fill out. In the block I had Chemistry in, I saw there was also IT 1, or ""Informasjonsteknologi"". Simply, it's just a subject that learns you web design and coding. The school advisor was kind of like ""Straight out, I would tell people just no"", which wasn't a good sign at all. There was a lot almost straight up begging and convincing because of the fact ""at least let me fail in something I would find slightly interesting at least"". My boyfriend was also with me kind of trying to convince, due to the fact he is in the last year (grade 3), and has IT 2, and actually is a grade 6 (highest grade) student in the subject. I got sent to advisor for my grade level, and through there again to the teacher that has IT.

Miraculously I actually managed to get into the class. But now, close to the end of the semester I kind of have to learn coding pretty quickly. I can feel that I can understand coding if I learn it properly and that I have the skills to actually get good at it if I get far enough, but everyone is so far behind me and it's a lot trying to keep track of schoolwork and final tests of this semester that is the same time, learning the same coding my peers are learning while also not even truly even knowing the most standard of standard of coding. I've gotten this ""Arbeidskrav"" that everyone else got where we were going to make a simple website that honestly looked like straight from the 2000s or something, and I got quite frustrated because I felt like it was my boyfriend doing all the work for me instead of me because I had so much trouble with it and couldn't even make a simple website. I also had the same test that the other students had for for 4 classes at the same time as them, but I won't get a grade on it since I started not long ago, just to test my skills, and I could see people actually managing to make a website, while I couldn't even get anything to show on the website, even cheating a lot by asking my boyfriend for help and seeing I made such a stupid mistake of changing where ""Document"" was on one of the side things (&lt;&gt; those things) by accident and not even seeing it myself. The website turned absolute ass, of course (excuse my language), but this is all so frustrating.

I want to learn programming, and I don't want to leech of my boyfriend, at all. I want to learn it by myself and I just get angry at both myself and him when I have to ask for help all the time, although he is happy to help. It won't help in tests, and I'm ashamed I cheated on the last one even if it wasn't graded for me (although it was graded for everyone else). I just have difficulties on how to learn coding quickly? There was one problem, which was, how will I get a grade without no assignments? Well, that I got answered today. We are going to make websites for companies in the local community for free (real companies this is), and everyone is doing it individually, except for me and another guy that is also new. We will be collaborating with someone else that has been in the class since day one, or in other words, leeching off of the work of someone else. Although I'm grateful that my grade won't be ruined, I still want to contribute and not just leech of others, as I am expected to also work on the website of course. But how can I contribute not knowing anything? This is why I want to learn it quickly, so that I can truly actually be a helping hand instead of a burden for the team. This is a lot of text, and I'm sorry for that, but is there any help with starting?

learnprogramming,How much programming experience do I need to make game in Godot? Resource recommendations?,"I'm an experienced game designer/artist, but for whatever reason has never bothered to pick up programming. Now that I have some time, I am thinking of finally picking it up.  
  
I am thinking of using Godot, which to my understanding is even easier than Unity (but harder than gamemaker). I am also making smaller 2D indie games, so it should suffice. However, I don't know anything about code, not even visual scripting. Function, syntax, etc are all alien languages to me. So I guess **my question is - How much programming knowledge do I need, and if anyone would have some good recommendation/suggestion for me to start?**

Here are some resources I've gathered so far

I am open to paying for the courses and thought [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) looks particularly interesting. But **I am not sure if it is worth the time diving into Python?** Or should I just follow Godot tutorials and muscle things through. Any advises would be appreciated!

I am thinking of starting small, with a snake or tetris project, follow by some Slay the Spire like card games which I think might be a reasonable scale. I also assume that it would be an easier gate way into learning programming, which is why I didn't choose Unity and C# which I read is much harder?

learnprogramming,How to approach learning programming from books,"How to approach learning programming from books?

Pick any classic programming book (say, a book from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)). Chances are the book has many pages and many exercises.

If you decide to read through the book and solve all the exercises, that's easily hundreds of hours of work.

Now lets say you lead a normal life with private and professional obligations, but you manage to block 16 h per week for reading and working through exercises of a book.

Lets be optimistic and say that it takes you just 200 h to read the book and do all the exercises. 200 / 16 = 12.5 weeks = 87.5 days \~ almost 3 months.

Is this the best time invested to learn the techniques in the book?

Suppose you're looking for a (new) programming job. Will you put solutions to those exercises in you portfolio? Would that be valuable to your potential employer?

Ideally, you would do all the exercises, than make a project using all the techniques from the book. But if this is not possible due to huge time investment involved, what is the best bang for buck approach?",TopDownView,1h4ybxb,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4ybxb/how_to_approach_learning_programming_from_books/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4ybxb/how_to_approach_learning_programming_from_books/,2024-12-02 16:03:24,0,0.5,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h4ybxb

learnprogramming,🏎✏ Dotrace game in Js,"After 4 months of development, I'm delighted to present my DotRace game!

This strategic racing game is inspired by the classic game of racing with a pencil on a small sheet of paper (moving points with inertia)... yes, I drew trajectories for a good part of my childhood!

It can be played online at this address: [http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/](http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/)

Some technical information:

* Choice of game mode :
   * Time Attack: Beat the AI
   * Race: Single race
   * Championship: Several races in a row
* Choice of tracks :
   * Pre-integrated tracks (well-known F1 circuits, spirals, bizarre shapes, etc.)
   * Random track generator with choice (min, max) of total track length, width and length of road sections, angles...
* Player configuration :
   * Up to 4 human players (on the same screen)
   * Opponents with configurable AI level
   * 8 players in tracks
   * Button assistance options (best choice)
* Screen configuration :
   * Quick glance to see the entire track
   * Full screen mode
   * Camera follows player
   * Speed-dependent widening of the view (to “see further”)
* Sound configuration :
   * Choice of 3 sound themes:
      * Sound of marker pen on a sheet of paper
      * Sound of my car (A-Class 250, yes, I'm a 50-year-old)
      * The sound of a spaceship
   * Choice of sound volume for opponents
   * Speed of movement...
* Main path-finding algorithm
   * The main principle of my algorithm is that it doesn't know the arrival points, it just tries to go as far as possible in as few moves as possible. A nice recursive function calculates all possible paths and determines the best one.
   * The “AI level” (variable from 2 to 8 for each player) corresponds to the depth of this recursive search for the best path.
   * The position of opponents is not taken into account when calculating the path, which can lead to accidents and run-offs when the width of the track is reduced and several players covet the same point.
* About 4,000 lines of javascript typed with my old fingers...

My question concerns the possibility of simply running the same code in an android apk? for free?

I am also interested in your suggestions for improving my game.

Thank you.

learnprogramming, Beginner Project: The God Protocol – Looking for Feedback and Advice,"Hi everyone!

I’m new to programming (just about a month in) and have been experimenting with an idea I’m calling *The God Protocol*. This project started as a way for me to learn and explore data compression and encoding, but it’s turning into something I feel might be worth sharing for feedback.

The basic idea is to compress and encode data in a way that speeds up how AI systems, humans, and machines share and process information. While I’m new to all this, I’ve done some testing and wanted to share what I’ve observed so far:

# What I’ve Found So Far:

* **Faster Processing:**
   * Compared to traditional formats, the protocol handles large datasets much faster.
   * Example:
      * RDF/XML: 2.97 seconds for 78 KB.
      * Standard JSON: 0.52 seconds for 8 MB.
      * My approach: 0.31 seconds, and combining it with binary encoding brought it down to 0.003 seconds.
* **Works with Any File Format:**
   * The encoded data seems flexible—it works across binary, CSV, JSON, etc., while staying compact and fast.
* **Scales Well:**
   * Even as datasets grow, the framework holds up with low processing times and flexibility.
* **AI-Centric Design:**
   * The setup seems to help AI systems, allowing for smaller, faster models without extra processing overhead.

# Why I’m Sharing This:

I’m still very new to programming, so I’m sure there are things I’m missing. I wanted to ask this community for thoughts and advice because I’m not sure if this is practical or if there are blind spots I’m overlooking. Specifically:

1. Does this seem like a useful or valuable approach to improving how we handle data?
2. Are there areas I should research further to improve my understanding?
3. How might this compare to tools like Protobuf, MessagePack, or Avro?

# Note:

I’m not revealing the exact methods just yet since I want to refine my understanding first. But I’m happy to share more general details if that helps clarify anything!

Thanks in advance for your time and feedback. I’m still learning and want to grow from this experience, so any advice is greatly appreciated!",SHIR0___0,1h4r19h,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r19h/beginner_project_the_god_protocol_looking_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h4r19h/beginner_project_the_god_protocol_looking_for/,2024-12-02 09:14:17,1,0.67,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Code Review,,t3_1h4r19h

learnprogramming,Can someone explain the output of this code for me? (C Language),"I'm studying Computer Programming. There is a code in a question in one of my exams. The solution say that the correct answer is ""The last letter of the output is ""I"""".

I got ""T"" as the last letter. I got confused so I tried run the code with AI and it also say that the last letter is ""I"" so I got even more confused.  The code is:

    int i = 2;
    char text[] = ""ALGORITHM"";
    while (i &lt; 8) {
        printf(""%c"", text[i]);
        i += 2;
    }

* When `i = 2`, `text[2]` is 'G'.
* When `i = 4`, `text[4]` is 'R'.
* When `i = 6`, `text[6]` is 'I'.
* When `i = 8`, the loop condition `i &lt; 8` fails, so the loop stops.

So, the output of this code will be:

    GRI

\[The output is from AI\]

So, from what my little brain understands, the text\[2\] which is the third letter in ""ALGORITHM"" is ""G"".  
text\[4\] which is the fifth letter is ""R"". Understandable.

But the text\[6\] which ""should be"" the seventh letter which is ""T"" but it appears to be ""I""

I've been stunned by this for a couple of hours now, someone please explain this to me please.

Edit: The output I got is from AI though and correct answer to this question also is ""The last letter of the output is ""I"" ""

learnprogramming,Is programming a good field to go into if you don’t do well in a 9-5?,"Title. I’m currently working a typical 40hr per week job, but I don’t think I’m the type of person who can do that long term? I have lots of social issues and often feel ostracized, I’m trans but I don’t pass and not being referred to as my chosen gender is really really hard on me, I also just have a soup of mental illnesses that make it hard to deal with a ridged schedule, etc. I wouldn’t even need a job that pays all that much, I’m able to support myself and my cats with $15 per hour as long as I am stringent.

learnprogramming,"Having trouble sticking to any one thing, advice? (ADHD may be relevant)","note: I wrote this somewhat out of order so excuse if I've repeated myself.

Background: I'm in my early twenties and this year got diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, recently I was able to get on medication, which has been a good help, and it's why I'm choosing now to try to tackle this.

I'm not a CS student, nor do I want to be. I'm not pursuing a career in CS or anything related to it. I just have a significant interest in programming, and see it as a hobby and creative outlet.

I got my first computer at 12 and I've been using Linux since I was about 13. So I'm pretty competent at using Bash, writing shell scripts for friends to solve little tasks, and writing ebuilds for my Gentoo install.

In high-school I took an intro to programming class, where I learned some basic Python and Java. The most complicated of things that I made were some terminal based games, and a couple of basic GUI games with some Java game engine.

But outside of the classroom environment, I've really struggled with adding some depth to my knowledge with self-learning. I've basically forgot all the Python and Java I learned after I finished the class, and the only thing I'm able to retain is a fair bit of Bash since I use it daily in the shell.

I've had a lot of fun in the past messing with different languages and started a handful of projects.

* Didn't love C
* Stuck with Haskell for awhile before I started to feel like I was wasting my time as a hobbyist
* Stuck with Scheme and Racket, for SICP and HtDP2, but again felt like I was wasting time
* Stuck with Go probably the longest out of anything since high-school, never really had a reason to stop, but I broke my streak of using it, and never started back up
* Thought C++ was cool
* More recently wrote some simple Rust, thought it was very productive, but kinda funky feeling? Starting to get a little embarrassed at how many attempts at learning and stopping I've made, and this isn't even all of them, so I'll cut it short here

I'd say at the moment, maybe it's just recency bias, but I'm most interested in C++ and Rust. There's something I particularly like about compiled languages, that I can't really explain, just makes my brain happy I guess. I have a preference for languages with a good book to read. And I have enough experience I feel, that I don't need to restart with a beginner to programming book like, one that might teach you to use Python to program a magic 8 ball or something.

I'm very much rambling at this point that I don't think I've stayed on topic, and instead just dumped a mishmash of details about myself here, so a tl;dr is in order...

***tl;dr:*** I have ADHD, recently got on medication. Despite taking a high-school programming class, I've forgotten everything except some Bash. I don't want a CS career or education, just a hobby that might be useful at times. Any advice on how to stay focused on a project/language long enough for the snowball to keep rolling? And where might be a good place to pick back up, as someone with a little experience?

Would ""Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++"" or ""The Rust Book"" be a good fit?

learnprogramming,How to become faster at coding and completing tasks at work? ,"Hey everyone,  

I’ve read a lot of posts about people feeling slow at work, but most focus on productivity or focus issues. That’s not my case—I work my full 8 hours non-stop, sometimes even skipping lunch to get more done. On some occasions, I even work overtime when I get at home (without my team knowing) just to speed things up.  

The problem is that my lead thinks I’m slow. He’s generally a chill and cool person, and he doesn’t put a lot of pressure on me, but he often seems disappointed with my progress. I frequently hear comments like, *“Oh, you’re still working on that? Don’t you think it’s taking too long?”*  

I’ve reflected on this, and I admit that compared to the other member on the team, I am slower. But here’s the frustrating part: I’m genuinely putting in the effort. I work nonstop, put in overtime, and still struggle to keep up. It’s not that I don’t know what I’m doing—I do. I make progress, sure sometimes i get stuck but most of the time I'm not stuck i am progressing but still slow

Honestly, this is starting to get to me. I’m not offended by the comments, but I’m frustrated with myself because I feel like I’m failing to meet expectations, no matter how hard I try.  

It’s worth mentioning that this is my first job. I’m five months in, and before this, I use to work as a freelancer for years. This is my first experience in a company setting.  

Have any of you faced similar challenges? Is there some things that we can do to become more fast at coding? I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

But I feel like if I code it while looking at hers even though I understand it I'm robbing myself of the opportunity to come up w it myself. But I can't come up w it myself.

learnprogramming,How to write Pseudocode in an efficient way?,"I have to learn pseudocode for some exams and I really feel like it's harder than simply writing programming-code. Since we can't use a specific language, I always end up writing everything way more verbosely, because it feels like pseudocode is meant to still be very exact and also easy to understand for non-programmers.

I like programming for the clear structure and rules. So I basically want the same for pseudocode.

I mainly program in Java und Kotlin, but also know some Python. Python seems quite well-suited for pseudocode. So I might want to basically write Python with some Kotlin, where Python is less expressive (e.g. fun instead of def for functions).

Do you have tipps and rules for efficient and readable pseudocode, that doesn't take an eternity to think about or write down?

**Examples with Python + Kotlin for Pseudocode**

Write a function that takes two numbers from the user and prints out the sum of those.

    fun add():
      set x = input
      set y = input
    
      print(x + y)

learnprogramming,How to Efficiently Convert a 250MB CSV File with 1 Million Rows to XLSX in AWS S3,"# Problem:

I'm working on a project where I need to **convert large CSV files (250MB, with 1 million+ rows)** to **XLSX format** and save them back to **AWS S3**. The CSV is stored in an S3 bucket, and I’m trying to do the conversion directly from S3 without downloading the file locally due to its large size.

However, I’m facing performance issues, as processing and converting these large files takes a lot of time. My current approach is based on **Node.js**, using libraries like `xlsx`, `fast-csv`, and **AWS SDK** for reading and writing to S3.

# What I’ve Tried:

1. **Streaming the CSV file**: I’ve tried using `fast-csv` to stream the file and process it in chunks. However, I still face memory and performance bottlenecks when writing the data to XLSX, especially with large files.
2. **Worker Threads**: I’ve attempted to parallelize processing by using **worker threads** to handle chunks of the CSV data. This doesn’t seem to improve the performance significantly.
3. **Buffering Issues**: I am encountering issues related to **buffers**, **memory consumption**, and **XLSX formatting**, as writing each row to the workbook one by one leads to significant delays, particularly with over a million rows.
4. // Example of my approach to processing CSV and converting to XLSX
5. const { S3Client, GetObjectCommand, PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');

learnprogramming,I got this question in an OA 1 months back.,"I am unable to get all permutations of the string that is divided into m parts.  
Joe has organized a party for M guests and has planned a party game. In the game, Joe gives everyone a string S and explains to them the rules to play the game. The rules to play the game are as follows The string S needs to be distributed among the M guests, and each guest must get at least one character. The smallest lexicographical distribution of the string S among the M guests must be stored. Out of all the stored smallest lexicographical distributions, the largest lexicographical string must be found for distributing ""good"" and the number of guests are 3. Here are all possible ways in which you can distribute the string among 3 guests: ((o, o, dg), (oo, d, g), (o, do, g), (o, d, go), (o, d, og), (o, gd, o), (o, od, g)\] Now, the lexicographically smallest strings among all these distributions are   
(o, o, dg)-dg  
(oo, d, g)-d  
(o, d, go)-d   
(o, d, og)-d   
(o, gd, o)-gd   
(o, od, g)-g   
After comparing all the lexicographically smallest strings of every distribution, ""gd"" is the lexicographically strongest string. Hence, gd is returned as the output.

learnprogramming,best next baby step for someone that has a very specific project but lacks focus when learning. ,"So I have a project I'm working on, not thinking about working on, as steely dan would say ""I've already bought the dream"" so its too late to change direction. what I need help with is; whats the next step in learning for a guy in my position with my project? The project is a C++ based touch screen OS for a raspberry pi that can:  
   
A: be a radio, USB storage stereo and bluetooth stereo while outputting audio to an amplifier.   
B: accept 0-5v input from sensors for referencing fuel+boost pressure and manifold pressure to precisely change motor speed via PWM to correct fuel pressure as required.   
C: have a settings page.   
D: run a second display with a gauge cluster.   
E: control HVAC via a second smaller touch screen. 

The reasons I'm not using openauto for this are as follows:

A: as far as I know open auto requires an ECU to communicate with, this is a mechanical fuel system with electronic monitoring and pressure regulation.   
B: I want the HVAC system to be separate because I hope to make it a product available to the public on it's own some day. its an open source mini mostly 3d-printable(heater core housing should really be metal) HVAC system for racecars. sounds corny but there's a lot of local interest.   
C: I need to write, model and come up with all my own original code in order to avoid being sued or to avoid gigantic licensing fees.

learnprogramming,What are the job opportunities for a bachelor’s in CIT,"I’m a high school senior currently in the process of applying for college. I’ve always wanted to do something with computer since I was a child, and though I am by no means a programming expert, I would like a programming heavy job. 

I’m currently torn between two degrees.
Computer Science (CS) and Computer and Information Technology (CIT). I know that CS is the more “advanced” degree, and the bare minimum requirement for most software engineering, but I’m terrible at math and don’t know how I’d handle the calculus classes required to earn the degree. 

That’s why I’m looking at CIT as an alternative. The classes my local university offers seem specifically tailored to different areas, including web design, video game development, and mobile app development. It seems like a good alternative, but I’m also not entirely sure what programming jobs I can get with it. IT looks temping but I know i wouldn’t be doing a lot of actual programming. 

Should I just bite the bullet and major in CS and hope the math classes don’t turn me off, or is CIT still a viable option for someone looking for a programming centric job?

learnprogramming,Coding  a native application to find lyrics in music files,"Hi everyone!

Yes, I read the FAQ, yes I've researched the topic for a while and still haven't reached a conclusive answer. Maybe my search terms are wrong, maybe I am not good at this. Anyhow...

I'm starting a personal project to build a native application (for Linux, ideally) that can determine if a song has lyrics. I find music helpful to focus, but lyrics can be distracting.

Currently my solution is just listening to bits and pieces of the songs and sorting them efficiently, but manually using a bash script.

I'm hoping to create a program that can analyze audio files and identify whether or not they contain significant amounts of vocal content (lyrics). Ideally, the program would analyse the whole library and write a commentary in the metadata of each track.

However, I'm stuck on the technical side. I'm not sure what technologies would be best suited for this task. Does anyone have experience with developing programs that analyze audio for vocal content? Are there established libraries or frameworks I should be looking into? Is this even feasible?  
I'm particularly interested in:

Possible technologies: e.g., libraries for audio analysis

Existing solutions: if any already exist and I just haven't stumbled upon them. Proprietary and even expensive programs might be worth it, but it has to be processed locally.
