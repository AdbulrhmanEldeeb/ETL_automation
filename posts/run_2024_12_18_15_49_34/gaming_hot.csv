gaming,Your taste in games changes as you get older,"I see a lot of memes on the internet about how “games aren’t good anymore” or how the same dopamine doesn’t hit anymore.

It can easily be playing too many video games, but what I see a lot more of is that nobody wants to break the pattern of the games they play. Listen, if you had told me as a kid that I’d love a game more than halo 3 and that I’d think there was a game better than it, I would’ve told you you’re absolutely insane. For the next 15 years, my favorite game was still halo even as the series got worse (I mean I still play halo infinite with the boys, but it’s not my go-to game anymore).

“I like FPS and I’m not good at other games” I told myself

Wrong. The peak of gaming to me is Rimworld now and I’ve gotten pretty good at grand strategy 4x games. I enjoy them a lot now. FPS is still fun every now and then, but it’s not what it was for me before. Is it because of the FPS games made today? Well how could it be? Hero shooters like valorant and overwatch exist. CS:GO got an update and seems stronger than ever. 

My point is that there are more great video games than ever, the indie industry is in a golden age, and the best video games are literally free. If you think “games aren’t good anymore”, it’s not the games that aren’t good anymore, it’s the game you’re playing isn’t good to you anymore.

From what I understand, they began to gradually make more games in house that appealed more to the west with games like Shadow of Rome and Dead Rising. Though later (around 2009) they really doubled down on it and outsourced more of their projects to western developers. Though I recall by that time there was at least one executive who noted that this push was not going as well as they hoped and would only get worse.

gaming, Predict We're on the Verge of a Boom in Video Game Adaptations to Live Action,"I predict that in the next decade, we're going to see way more video game adaptations to live action. Sure, there have been a few here and there over the years, but this time, I think we’re on the verge of a real boom.

In my lifetime, I’ve seen different genres take over for a while. Slashers had their heyday with franchises like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Then came the zombie craze with The Walking Dead and World War Z. Vampires and werewolves took the spotlight with Twilight and The Vampire Diaries. YA dystopian films had their moment too, with The Hunger Games and Divergent. And of course, superheroes have been dominating for over a decade now, with Marvel and DC cranking out movies left and right.

Now, I think video games are about to be next. Modern games already feel like interactive movies with their incredible stories, well-developed characters, and massive, detailed worlds. We’ve already started to see some success, like The Last of Us, Arcane, and Fallout. Studios are clearly realizing just how much potential this space has, and I think they’re going to go all in.

If this trend continues, I wouldn’t be surprised if video game adaptations become the next big thing, just like superheroes ruled the last decade.

gaming,Games that were solid but changed dramatically through the years,"Anyone else has problems getting back to *(online)* games that were fun and solid to play, but through the years changed their core identity so much that you just can't be bothered to go back? There aren't many ""Call of Duty 2"" games around anymore where you could jump back in a game several years later and not much has changed, if anything.

My example would be Rainbow Six Siege. The first two years I really enjoyed this game with friends. Rainbow Six had already strayed from their more hardcore R6 games *(Raven Shield being the last one)*, which I enjoyed too, but that is besides the point. I am refering to the core identity of a single game at release. I do not recognise Siege anymore. I stopped playing it after the second year. It has turned from a relatively grounded game into an imbalanced skinfest. The number of operators have gone through the roof and the number of different gimmicks are impossible to keep track of.

I don't mind gameplay changes, as long as it is either about improving balance, fixing bugs or relatively minor additions that make sense and feel like natural extensions. Turning a game into a skinfest where the end number of operators is not in sight, is definitely not what I had hoped for.

Another example would be Europa Universalis IV, although to a different extent. I've been guilty of buying every DLC since its release in 2013, but that is because I adore grand strategy games and I mostly kept track of the gameplay. However I can clearly see that the gameplay mechanics are either very different or way more complicated and convuluted now compared to release. It's almost impossible for a new player to get an understanding of that game with all the DLC's and their convoluted additions to an outdated engine. I used to play this game with friends regularly. However at some point we didn't play that much, and in that time the number of gameplay changes were huge. It is increasingly harder for my friends to get back into it.

At this point we're better of waiting for EU5 so we can start from scratch together.  Concerning R6 Siege, I wish they had an old school classic mode that is well balanced with fewer operators, and without the skinfest.",Geo_NL,1hgdsu2,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgdsu2/games_that_were_solid_but_changed_dramatically/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgdsu2/games_that_were_solid_but_changed_dramatically/,2024-12-17 16:01:12,0,0.39,0,0,56,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgdsu2

gaming,"As Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet locks comments on its trailer, Baldur's Gate 3 publishing lead says 2025 and beyond will be an ""extremely tough time to ship a game"" | GamesRadar+","He's right.  Gaming has become divided so much nowadays with politics creeping into our hobby and everyone retreating to their own echo chamber.  

The woke vs anti-woke argument is particularly horrid at the moment with the anti-woke mob *claiming* the don't want politics in their game, but failing to realise that they are going exactly that by bringing it up over and over and over again like political zealots.  While the extreme woke mob are kicking them back making the situation only worse.

The *real gamers* out there just want to play games and don't give shit about their politics or positions.  But with the YouTube and Google algorithms throwing in our faces, we just can't escape this bullshit.

And then there's the developers who have to deal with this shit, just wanting to make games, but having to navigate the minefield of brigading from all sides.  Honestly, I would want to be them for quids, m and have every sympathy.

FFS, even the new Indiana Jones game has been a target of the mob.  There is nothing there to get upset about.  It a perfectly good game.

Personally, I don't give a damn about their gender politics.  Either side ... woke or anti-woke!  Who cares if the protagonist is woman, coloured, gay or whatever. I couldn't give a flying fart. If the game has a good gameplay, interesting characters, good story and an interesting setting, I'll be all over it.  They're the games I wat to play.  Horizon, The Witcher, CP2077 ... those are the games I want to play (yeah .. so I'm into Open World story based games, but YMMV).

Anyway, Devs are going to have to deal with this shit.  And it's going to get worse before it gets better.

Axiom Verge

Golden Light

R-Type

Angel's Gear

SMT games, they have a lot of influence here sometimes

Wizardry Dimguil, it's more dark fantasy than the others with some INSANE creature designs

Phantasy Star, FF final bosses, Contra, anything Berserk/FromSoft

gaming,What Sony/Guerrilla doesnt get about Horizon ,"Sony doesnt understand what made Horizon Zero Dawn great, and that wasnt the plot. Thats why Forbidden West didnt perform well (***edit: nvm I guess it did, I assumed because I heard way less about it on release than I did about ZD that it didnt***) and the lego game is also failing. The Horizon characters/setting/plot arent all that great (***edit: I dont hate the plot, its decent with a few good twists***) the *franchise* isnt what is good about this series, its the *gameplay* (***edit: specifically combat, not open world stuff***)

The thing Sony and Guerrilla Games should be focusing on is the phenomenal combat and body targetting system that HZD has. They should adapt the HZD system into other games. Imagine taking that system where you have to target, break, disable different body parts and applying it to something like Shadow of the Colossus, or Monster Hunter or Mecha game or even a racing/car combat game. Think of fighting a dragon and having to tear its wings to bring it down and then to strategically rip its scales off to target its heart, or shattering the stone armor of a 20 ft tall golem. Almost every enemy in HZD had a unique challenge, almost puzzles to solve, it was a very fun game.

HZD has terrific action gameplay, I'd like them to expand on that into other genres. Specifically it is the *Horizon* part of it thats failing.

gaming,Gaming with Gemini: Have any of you tried it?,"Just got done trying out sharing my screen with Gemini 2.0 while gaming. I played Forza Motorsport, Madden 25, and Rocket League. It's really neat being able to get near real-time feedback on what's going on in your game while playing. Though it's not always accurate.

  
Forza Motorsport: 

\+ It gave me information about the telemetry on screen and explained them in detail if I asked. 

\+ Explained what's happening during race when asked. It explained what penalty I got and why (specifically telling me which car I collided with)

\+ Suggested the next race to pick

\- Inaccurate fairly often. Got what place I was in wrong a couple of times and a couple of other information was wrong

  
Madden 25:

\+ Can provide a logical play call for specific scenarios. Suggested I call a run play at the end of the game while I was winning.

\+ Can read the defense (zone or man)

\+ Can tell you what route is likely to be open

\+ I got it to do some play-by-play commentary for a little bit. But it was too slow and sometimes inaccurate on what actually happened at times.

\- Often inaccurate with information.

gaming,"I quit playing PvP games, recommend me pve stuff. ","Won’t go into immense details but I quit playing PvP games due to a couple factors, I got older and have less time, i have some health issues (mainly digestive issues where I need to be able to stop at any point and in PvP games you can’t just pause), and honestly they just aren’t the same or fun for me anymore.

Recommend me some pve/pvm stuff where I can play solo, play at my own pace without having deadlines (like battle passes I need to complete, fomo content and not feeling like I’ll miss out on stuff that I’ll never be able to get again if I don’t finish it in x amount of time). And a big part is something kind of open ended where I can pause or stop whenever I need to without ruining the match for others or having to go afk leaving people down a player. 

I was thinking about palworld, or maybe monster hunter world, but does anyone have other suggestions for me for nice long soloable games?

My brother used to enjoy playing video games (mainly GTA Vice City, CoD and Brothers in Arms) but suffered a stroke 10 or so years ago.

He's recently been mentioning that he'd like to get back into gaming, so I've bought him an Xbox Series X for Christmas. Just wondering which games people could recommend for someone who suffers from video motion sickness? I doubt he'd be into games like Stardew Valley or Unpacking, so looking for some options with a bit more excitement but not as intense or fast paced as modern day CoD, if any titles exist!

Venom himself is exceptional in the game, WAY better than Hardy's version and he's actually sinister and intimidating and Tony Todd (rest in peace) did an exceptional job with the voice.

My only real complaint is that it seems like we will not get any more with this Venom in this franchise and.......the fact that we only got a little bit to play as Venom to escape and kill Kraven......I wish there was a lot more time in the game to play as Venom.

The last game in the series I played was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which was 15 years ago.

When I saw that a temporary trial of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer was available on PSN, I decided to give it a try and... was extremely disappointed. At first, I was unpleasantly surprised by the overloaded interface and background videos while waiting for the game, where they show close-ups of the operators. The wait seemed quite long for such a popular game. The cosmetic sets seemed completely garish, awkward and tasteless.

gaming,What is the best combat system in an action game?,"I was just thinking about Assassin's Creed 2, a game I haven't played in a very long time. But I do remember that it was from before when the explicit indicators that someone was about to attack you was introduced. So it was on YOU to watch the enemies actions and predict their attacks. Time didn't slow down or anything and the enemies weren't slow. Their attacks could be quick and difficult to predict. So I remember having a really fun time with the combat in that game and I don't really know why AC2 and ACB aren't talked about for their fun, challenging, and well balanced combat.

There's also another game that I haven't played in a very long time. People used to talk all about how the Arkham games had the best combat system but I thought it paled in comparison to the most fun and fluid yet still challenging combat system, the best combat system in a game I have ever seen, the combat system of Sleeping Dogs. Now maybe I am remembering the combat too fondly since it was so long ago that I played it. And practically every single other thing in the game was done better by Rockstar in their GTA games. But the combat tho..... that shit was to die for🥵. Like, who would have thought that you could implement Kung Fu into a video game and not make an absolute clusterfuck of a system, but also actually make it good??? Fun, fluid, and challenging. A simplistic fundamental system that anyone can pick up yet made complex by the numerous combos you could learn as you progress in experience. The story, the money, the outfits, the cars..... everything in that game was just an excuse to facilitate a game that centres around what it was *really* made for; hand to hand combat by means of Kung Fu.

Like am I wrong about that? Because I don't hear people mention the combat in that game. Am I just fondly remembering a game that I played when I was a dumb incompetent kid? Or does it still hold up as an adult? And what other games had brilliant, renowned *or* underrated?",techscc,1hfjjgl,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hfjjgl/what_is_the_best_combat_system_in_an_action_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hfjjgl/what_is_the_best_combat_system_in_an_action_game/,2024-12-16 13:52:10,0,0.32,0,0,82,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfjjgl

gaming,What would be a good setting for a new Assassin's Creed game?,"It's true, we complain a lot about Assassins Creed. Whether its the fact that Ubisoft likes money (gasp), the games are historically inaccurate (true), or that certain demographics are forced (that is a subjective argument that I'd like to ignore for this topic.

That being said, the settings of the previous AC's have several things in common: a land with a prolonged conflict, between classes, ethnicities or religion. Neither party has control over the whole map and fighting occurs sporadically and locally. Usually the map involves different cities and the newer games involve naval battles. You also meet up and coming scientists and philosophers and new technologies become available. That being said, I hereby present my idea:

The Netherlands during the 80 years' war 1568-1648).

Hear me out. During this period the Dutch had their ""golden age"", mastering the seas, even though they had a war of independence with Spain. The Dutch were protestant, Spain catholic, which lead to regional warfare where the occupied south practiced Catholicism and the north Protestantism. Several cities were sieged with new inventions, like the Dutch using pumps to drain water protecting the besieged cities. With regards to art, science and philosophy; Jheronimus Bosch and Leeghwater come to mind and also the fact that the VOC was founded, the first publicly owned company with a very dubious past. It was also a time when many of the amazing buildings we are still mesmerising over were being built and when ""the new world"" was still new (the Dutch founded New York in 1624).

That being said, it would help if Ubisoft would try to not make all the Dutch people speak Gernan.

[https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/](https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/)

From Famitsu:

**--Even though there is an online main mode, why did you include the single mode ""Old Amasia Investigation""?**

**Futami**　I didn't want to make a game that would become unplayable if online play were to become unavailable in the future, so I prepared a single mode. Of course, we intend to continue the service, and I don't want it to be taken in a negative sense, but I wanted players to feel reassured that this is not a game that they will no longer be able to play. I also wanted to draw a contrast as a story. In the main story, the player and their own Magus will depict the drama of each player. However, it is not conveyed from within the game how the player interacts with other Magus. So, by looking at the relationship between Alba and Ada, I wanted players to be aware of the relationship between themselves and their own Magus.

**--It has increased a little recently, but most online games cannot be played again once the service ends, so that is a nice consideration.**

**Futami**　Of course, we want to continue the service, but we wanted to get rid of the feeling that the game would become unplayable once the service ends.

**--Will it be possible to play the game completely offline from the beginning?**

**Futami**　No, the introduction to online play is absolutely necessary, and it is unlocked once you have progressed to a certain extent. It is a mode that can be played even after the service ends, but it is not set to be playable completely offline from the time of release.

　Of course, we are considering how to deal with that situation, but we are only making it possible to deal with it, and we do not want to change our stance that it is basically a ""mode that is useful for online play,"" so at this time online play is also required.

From GamerNE:

\--This game is an online-only title, but I think it's quite rare for an online-only title to be sold as a one-time purchase.

Futami: That's right... I think what everyone is worried about on that point is, ""Will I no longer be able to play the game once the service ends?""

However, I would like to make it clear that even if the online service ends, the game will still be playable.

\--What do you mean?

Futami: It's true that currently, online play is required to play this game, but we've already prepared a way to make it possible to play offline. The reason it's required to be online is because we don't want to store data locally to prevent so-called cheating.

Of course, since the game is primarily online, there will be limitations to what you can play, but please rest assured that the packages and games you purchase will not be completely wasted.",JaSonic2199,1heahcu,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,2024-12-14 19:32:43,41,0.77,41,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heahcu

Our art has been dressed down into an industry,and this industry has been pilfered by corrupt executives, by the vulgar profiteering of corporate bodies moving like leviathans in the dark, burning human fuel in their insatiable lust for money.

It is not pencil-pushers and moneylenders who make games. It is the relentless passion of the workers that creates an art form capable of saying something true.

  
As creators and game makers, we have too long been led away from the truth, away from the right to define ourselves as artists in service of the definitive art form of the future, one that has made us dream since we were children.

Instead, the disposability culture operating at the ruthless core of this industry wants us to think of ourselves as cogs in the machine: rudimentary craftsmen, disposable career workers, inert producers of made-to-order marketing-driven ""content"" — empty calories leaving the soul hungry.

The Profiteer knows that by keeping your dignity low, he will keep you crawling on the treadmill of passion until he lays you off for the sake of the red number in his book.

We make games because we have to. It is our calling. Because we have no choice but to see the transformative potential of this youngest medium of human interaction. You can't turn away once you've seen the light,Or it will always feel like everyone else in the world is doing something without you, there in the light you try to abandon but can't, because — oh, the horror — it comes from inside you.

All art is communication — dialogue across time, space and thought. In its rawest, it is one mind’s ability to provoke emotion in another.Large language models— simulacra, cold comfort, real-doll pocket-pussy, cyberspace freezer of an abandoned IM-chat — which are today passed off for “artificial intelligence”,will never be able to offer a dialogue with the vision of another human being.

Machine-generated works will never satisfy or substitute the human desire for art, as our desire for art is in its core a desire for communication with another,with a talent who speaks to us across worlds and ages to remind us of our all-encompassing human universality. There is no one to connect to in a large language model. The phone line is open but there’s no one on the other side.

The peddlers who aim to get rich quick from this scheme will always PLAY THE FOOL to any ethical or artistic argument. This is why we must push back against Big Tech's encroachment on the territory of our art,against increasing corporatization and alienation of game creators from their work, against the robbery of rights from workers, performers, artists and all contributors to this complicated and MULTI-FACETED medium.

Our mission is to unite world-class artists and creatives in a truly independent game studio which will always prioritize artistic integrity over personal comfort, profit margin, short term interests and Big Tech profit-bubbles.

There we will be able to embark on that treacherous road of building a cultural megaproject, a Role Playing Game with complexity and ambition worthy to rival our wretched and wonderful world.

In this we are committed to pursue the highest caliber of literary quality.

Here we stand, bound by our love for games and devotion to our craft, ready to bleed and weep and ride the cavalry into machine gun fire one more time.

For this we will need all the support and help from you, our readers, colleagues and future visionaries. Come walk the desert with us.

We will not take any of your support for granted.We have seen the suffering wrought by the hunger for power, the terror of greed and envy, the complicity of the averted eye. We have also seen the triumph of the human spirit, of solidarity in the striving, of making something never before seen and seeing its miracle unfold in the world. We have seen poverty, and we have seen plenty. We will make mistakes, we will win and we will fail, but we will never forget what we are doing this for.  
  
Yours in every season,

gaming,is there a stigma against older gamers?," We all know gaming is dominated by young people, teens mostly. I'm 43, I grew up in the 90's but I didn't really get into gaming until  about 2014. I talk about games a lot, but I always try to hide the fact that I'm ""old"", I just don't want to feel judged , I had enough of that in  school.  I think gamers would feel weird talking to  me if they knew how much older I am then them, so I ask you guys, is this  a real  thing or is my imagination  just  making this up out of nothing?

gaming,"[MEGAPOST] [City Builder, Simulators, Space RPGs] Games I'd Like To Know About","There are several niches I have that are unfulfilled, and I've spent a considerable time looking every which way but haven't found much. Maybe there are undiscovered gems you can enlighten me with?

Dystopian Builder - I know about Dystopika, and I know you can get close with heavily modded City Skylines and/or modded Prison Architect, but is there anything more concrete? Tropico kinda counts, and Frostpunk doesn't really, since it's about making life better, in a way. I wanna make 1984, be the Big Brother

Nukes and Reactors - I know about Reactor Tech2, but it's so isosteric and not purely about Nuclear Reactors. And on the topic of Nukes, I know Planetary Annihilation: TITANS, which is the best fitting title to date. ICBM and DEFCON kinda don't count, since they don't really let you get up-close and see the mushroom

Police Sims - I know about LSPDFR, Police Sim: Patrol Officers, Flashing Lights and Ready or Not, just kinda wondering if there are any more little-known gems

Space RPGs - Recently beat Outer Worlds, and I'm sorta torn if I should play Starfield. Ik Starsector, might give it a shot again soon.

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - was anyone disappointed by the game’s last act?,"So, I’ll open up by saying I really loved the game. I wasn’t expecting to like (or even play) this one, but I’m very glad that did. 

Still, I felt like the later areas lacked a lot of the polish of the first half of the game. 

&gt;! Vatican City and Gizeh were both so fun to play through. By the time I got to Siam, though, the game felt much less polished. I encountered a number of pretty rough bugs - one game breaking, most just annoying.!&lt;

Did anyone else find the number of bugs increasing in the final few zones? Did anyone else feel like those parts of the game felt less polished or more rushed?

Just curious how others felt. This was a game that was almost a 10/10 for me — and one that really surprised me mechanically, since I don’t really like any of the gameplay elements in other games/on their own — but the friction as I got later on really pulled things down.

gaming,The Souls-like genre is becoming oversaturated - agree or disagree?,"The souls-like genre has really blown up over the past 5 years or so. Before then it was mostly Fromsoft games (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, etc), with a few lower quality imitators (The Surge, Lords of the Fallen, Mortal Shell, etc).

There are a lot of souls-likes now. Like, too many maybe, to the point of oversaturation. The soulslike genre is starting to feel like how the rhythm genre felt a decade ago, before it imploded on itself and died. It’s not unexpected for developers to shift towards making games in this genre, especially after Elden Ring was so successful, and it’s not even that the games themselves are low quality like before. Titles like Lies of P, Black Myth Wukong, and Thiasma are genuinely excellent games.

I think it becomes an issue of innovation and repetition. The genre seems to be nearing its peak in terms of mechanics and innovation, or at least as far as devs are willing to take it. Most games in the genre play like Dark Souls 3, a game that came out nearly a decade ago. The most innovation the genre has seen is incorporating deflects like in Sekiro and Lies of P. Even Elden Ring, which many would consider to be the peak of the genre, other than the open world, is mechanically identical to DS3. I don’t think anyone can deny that these games aren’t high quality and fantastic, but they all play very similarly, and it seems like it’s going to be difficult to advance the genre further than where it’s at. 

And yet, because the genre is successful, games are likely going to be pumped out until the genre dies. Unlike shooters or sports games, I don’t think this genre can survive long term while recycling its own mechanics and ideas over and over again. Fromsoft, who are undeniably the top of the food chain in this genre, even seem to be running out of ideas for actual gameplay innovation, and are pushing the enemies difficulty further in bizarre ways such as delayed hits, leading to controversial bosses like the final boss of the Elden Ring DLC and quite a few others from that game.

Maybe it’s burnout on my part. I’ve been playing these games for over a decade, since Demon’s Souls on PS3. I was able to see the genre advance to where it is now, and to me, it’s been stagnant for at least the last 5 years. I wasn’t even able to finish the Elden Ring DLC as it felt so samey to everything else that’s come out in the last few years, and by the time I beat the final boss, I just shelved the game and had no drive to explore the rest of the DLC or to start up a new run with the new builds introduced in the DLC, which would be unheard of just a few years ago. 

I don’t expect that this topic will be well received given how popular the genre is right now, and again, it’s not like the games coming out are bad by any means (and indeed, are routinely game of the year contenders now). But I also would not be surprised if the genre has mostly died out by 2030, particularly if innovation isn’t ramped up. But I wouldn’t even know how to suggest innovation, the genre has potentially reached a peak in that regard. Anyways, interested to see what others have to say on the subject.

gaming,Tell me about The Outer Wilds. Sell me on it even.,"Yes I'm currently playing some games and yes I've got an extensive backlog. But like most gamers, I'm always craving new and more experiences. And while I've heard nothing but praise about The Outer Wilds I virtually know nothing about it. I see that it's available in the Xbox store for $24.99 so I watched the trailer and revealed very little.

So tell me about this game please. What genre is it? What style is it? What is it's length and can it be played in short spurts along with other games or should one give their time fully to it? Are there any other titles that TOW might be comparable to? And what are you some aspects of the game that you feel really make it stand out.

gaming,Microsoft's $100B Acquisitions: Apparently the New-Original IPs are staying Xbox-Exclusive (for now),"**Note:** As of now I only own PS5 and may setup (budget issues, lol) a PC in next couple of years if non-PS games really become attractive to me. Even though I'll get downvoted but I personally feel that there should be some exclusives attached to a brand if a brand is targeting a platform/hardware system. Since MS has spent 100B on acquiring studios, its simply not possible to keep everything exclusive as PS is the moneymaker in software as well. But I observed a very cool thing. I've seen that apart from few exceptions (Hellblade 2 &amp; Licensed IPs), Xbox hasn't announced new-owned IPs for Playstation, YET. Yes, lots of games 1st party games are announced for PS but those were already the games which had their previous parts released on PS and weren't closely associated with Xbox brand. Saying that, following is what I've observed. \[*I'm excluding PC and Nintendo from this discussion as Nintendo seems to be on another plane while PC has been adopted by even Sony*\]

* **New Original IPs:** Exclusive to Xbox for now
   1. Starfield
   2. Avowed
   3. Perfect Dark
   4. South of Midnight
   5. Clockwork Revolution
   6. Everwild
   7. Redfall
* **Signature IPs:** Have always been associated with Xbox (or MS in case of Flight Simulator)
   1. Halo Infinite
   2. Forza Horizon 5
   3. Forza Motorsport 2023
   4. State of Decay 3
   5. Fable 2025
   6. Gears E-Day
   7. MS Flight Simulator 2020 &amp; 2024
* **Owned IPs:** Announced or released for PS
   * COD: Black Ops 6
   * Diablo 4
   * Doom: The Dark Ages
   * The Outer Worlds 2
   * Sea of Thieves
   * Deathloop
   * Ghostwire: Tokyo
* Exceptions
   * Hellblade 2 - Still seems to be exclusive even though part 1 was released on PS, so it's a bit difficult to associate this brand with Xbox. May become multi platform
   * Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle - Licensed IP. Would have been nice for a good xbox game to be exclusive but since branding is the main thing so it may not have much of an impact.
   * Blade - May become multi-platform. It's a Marvel brand so no point of pushing it to become Xbox's brand
* State of Xbox - Rumors/Confirmations/Observations
   * GamePass seems to be the core brand for MS Gaming and future
   * Pushing for everything to be ""This is an Xbox"".
   * There's still one more console that they'll release as per Sarah Bond

I think having these 14-15 big exclusive IPs can still be realistic to manage and will also add prestige to xbox brand just like PS has God of War, Uncharted, LOU, Intergalactic, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, Infamous, Astrobot, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Resistance, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Returnal, Days Gone and many others.",blinkyretard,1heqz2v,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,2024-12-15 11:46:20,0,0.24,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heqz2v

gaming,Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - PS5 vs PC comparison,"Lighting and Shadows
The PC version significantly improves lighting. Characters’ faces appear more lifelike with balanced illumination, and the shadows are sharper with better depth, making scenes with Aerith and Cloud stand out even more.

Background Details
The environments look much clearer and more refined. Effects like the glowing bokeh in Aerith’s scene appear smoother, while Cloud’s surroundings benefit from sharper textures and greater detail.

Texture Quality
The PC version enhances textures across the board. Aerith’s hair shows individual strands, and Cloud’s outfit looks crisper and more detailed, making the characters feel even more realistic.

Color Grading
Colors on PC are richer and more vibrant, with improved contrast. It avoids the slightly washed-out look seen on PS5, resulting in a more visually dynamic presentation.

Ambient Occlusion &amp; Effects
Small details, like shading in clothing folds and subtle creases, are much more refined.

gaming,A Fjord I made in Minecraft,"This Inlet is part of major fjord I have been developing in my Minecraft world called Sky Pixel. The fjord itself is called the ""Lullaby Fjord"" it is surrounded by large tidewater glaciers I have been making for quite some time now. 

This world is also already released on my Patreon (Sky Pixel) for users to experience and download.

Much of my builds can also be seen on my YT channel @elijahjones as well. 

This build is a small section of my world that I have been developing since 2014. Which includes many cities and landscapes. 

This glacier itself is called the ""Porter Glacier"" it's part of a series of glaciers that run near it such as the ""Harlette, Kusuah, Ellie, Jacie, Rezjvik, Lunaska, and Sathomko glaciers"" amongst others. 

This area I have been developing in my world is inspired by the Pacific Northwest landscapes. I've been doing a ton of developing similar to these landscapes because I was born and raised in the PNW. This area in particular is mostly focused on areas of British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska. I have already developed much of areas within the Cascades and Coast Mountains already. Just making my way up the line. And almost done with this region in my world.

gaming,Vr gaming advice ,"So, I have no experience when it comes to vr. I’m looking into getting a headset and literally have no idea how to start. 

I would’ve asked the VRgaming Reddit but their rules forbid that and their pinned post is dead.

I have a PC that’s capable of running most games at decent settings, a PS5 and Xbox series X. 

I’ve heard some headsets are stand alone and all that you need to play. 

Generally I’m just asking for advice on what I should get to, to get into vr gaming.

And as the original paragraph said, I’m entirely clueless. Any help is appreciated.

gaming,"6 Decades of gaming, 6 Decades of Male Main Characters","Gaming as a whole has been oddly male oriented for decades, even after the gaming census a couple years ago and all data collected showing nearly 48% of ""gamers"" are women, men still seem to be the vocal majority. Recently during the game awards and this year, we've seen a bunch of trailers with females as the main protagonist (which i have absolutely no issue with, considering Lora Croft paved the way for some badass characters).

The vocal minority of social media trolls immediately jumping on the 30 second-5 minute trailers as "" woke "" or "" agenda driven "" has really made me wonder why are we so oddly angry about this now?  Take Witcher 4 for an idea, all i see is comments about people being angry that the STORY DRIVEN narrative is now Cersi's perspective even though that's the only direction it should have went. 

Some incredible games have came with female leads

Tomb Raider

Horizon Zero Dawn

The Last of Us

Cyberpunk 2077 (V is canonically female)

Bayonetta

Yet the gaming community is so wrapped up in this toxic understanding that gaming companies are pushing any sort of agenda. Of course companies have the right to produce anything they like, and the fact that most of these misogynistic apelike men masturbated to Lora Croft growing up in their miserable bedrooms, and most likely still do, what is it about now that makes you so unnecessarily loud. We pride companies on following their own values.

Just irritated how video games have fallen into this absolutely abysmal state because everyone is sucked into the abyss of politics they have NO idea about. 

Get excited for games again, give games a chance, and stop immedietly jumping on the bandwagon of "" this game sucks."" without even a second of gameplay available.

And Venom in this game is actually intimidating with a badass voice, with a sinister vibe compared to the over the top goofy tone that's in the movies.
