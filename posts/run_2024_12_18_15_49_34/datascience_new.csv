datascience,What's it like building models in the Fraud space? Is it a growing domain? ,"I'm interviewing for a Fraud DS role in a smaller bank that's in the F100. At each step of the process, they've mentioned that they're building a Fraud DS team and that there's a lot of opportunity in the space, but also that banks are being paralyzed by fraud losses.

I'm not too interested in classification models. But it pays more than what I currently make. I'm a little worried that there'll be a lot of compliance/MRM things compared to other industries - is that true?

Only reason why I'm hesitant is that I've been focusing on LLM work for a while and it doesn't seem like that's what the Fraud space does.

To sum it up:

1. Is there a ton of red tape/compliance/MRM work with Fraud models?
2. With an increase of Fraud losses every year, is this an area that'll be a hot commodity/good to get experience with?
3. Can you really do LLM work in this space? The VP I interviewed with said that the space was going to do GenAI in a few years, but when I asked him questions on what that meant to him, he had no clue but wanted to get into it
4. Is real-time data used to decline transactions instead of just detection?

EDIT: Definitely came to the conclusion that I want to apply to other banking companies. And that there's  a lot to learn in regards to 3 and 4.

datascience,Asking for help solving a work problem (population health industry),"Struggling with a problem at work. My company is a population health management company. Patients voluntarily enroll in the program through one of two channels. A variety of services and interventions are offered, including in-person specialist care, telehealth, drug prescribing, peer support, and housing assistance. Patients range from high-risk with complex medical and social needs, to lower risk with a specific social or medical need. Patient engagement varies greatly in terms of length, intensity, and type of interventions. Patients may interact with one or many care team staff members.

My goal is to identify what ‚Äúworks‚Äù to reduce major health outcomes (hospitalizations, drug overdoses, emergency dept visits, etc). I‚Äôm interested in identifying interventions and patient characteristics that tend to be linked with improved outcomes.

I have a sample of 1,000 patients who enrolled over a recent 6-month timeframe. For each patient, I have baseline risk scores (well-calibrated), interventions (binary), patient characteristics (demographics, diagnoses), prior healthcare utilization, care team members, and outcomes captured in the 6 months post-enrollment. Roughly 20-30% are generally considered high risk.

My current approach involves fitting a logistic regression model using baseline risk scores, enrollment channel, patient characteristics, and interventions as independent variables. My outcome is hospitalization (binary 0/1). I know that baseline risk and enrollment channel have significant influence on the outcome, so I‚Äôve baked in many interaction terms involving these. My main effects and interaction effects are all over the map, showing little consistency and very few coefficients that indicate positive impact on risk reduction. 

I‚Äôm a bit outside of my comfort zone.

datascience,"Sales Forecasting for optimizing resource allocation (minimize waste, maximize sales)","Hi All,

To break up the monotony of ""muh job market bad"" (I sympathize don't worry), I wanted to get some input from people here about a problem we come across a lot where I work.  Curious what some advice would be.

So I work for a client that has lots of transactions of low value.  We have TONS of data going back more than a decade for the client and we've recenlty solved some major organizational challenges which means we can do some really interesting stuff with it.

They really want to improve their forecasting but one challenge I noted was that the data we would be training our algorithms on is affected by their attempts to control and optimize, which were often based on voodoo.  Their stock becomes waste pretty quickly if its not distributed properly.  So the data doesn't really reflect how much profit could have been made, because of the clients own attempts to optimize their profits.  Demand is being estimated poorly in other words so the actual sales are of questionable value for training if I were to just use mean squared error, median squared error, because just matching the dynamics of previous sales cycles does not actually optimize the problem.

I have a couple solutions to this and I want the communities opinion.

  
**1) Build a novel optimization algorithm that incorporates waste as a penalty.**    
I am wondering if this already exists somewhere, or 

  
**2) Smooth the data temporally enough and maximize on profit not sales.**

Rather than optimizing on sales daily, we could for instance predict week by week, this would be a more reasonable approach because stock has to be sent out on a particular day in anticipation of being sold.  

  
**3) Use reinforcement learning here, or generative adversarial networks.**

I was thinking of having a network trained to minimize waste, and another designed to maximize sales and have them ""compete"" in a game to find the best actions.  Minimizing waste would involve making it negative.

  
**4) Should I cluster the stores beforehand and train models to predict based on the subclusters, this could weed out bias in the data.**

I was considering that for store-level predictions it may be useful to have an unbiased sample.  This would mean training on data that has been down sampled or up-sampled to for certain outlet types 

  
**Lastly any advice on particular ML approaches would be helpful, was currently considering MAMBA for this as it seems to be fairly computationally efficient and highly accurate.  Explain ability is not really a concern for this task.**

**I look forward to your thoughts a criticism, please share resources (papers, videos, etc) that may be relevant.**

datascience,Fine-tuning &amp; synthetic data example: creating 9 fine tuned models from scratch in 18 minutes,"**TL;DR:** I built [Kiln](https://getkiln.ai), a new free tool that makes fine-tuning LLMs easy. In this example, I create 9 fine-tuned models (including Llama 3.x, Mixtral, and GPT-4o-mini) in just 18 minutes for less than $6 total cost. This is completely from scratch, and includes task definition, synthetic dataset generation, and model deployment.

The codebase is all on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln).

# Walkthrough

For the example I created 9 models in 18 minutes of work (not including waiting for training/data-gen). There's a walkthrough of each step in the [fine-tuning guide](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/blob/main/guides/Fine%20Tuning%20LLM%20Models%20Guide.md), but the summary is:

* \[2 mins\]: Define task, goals, and schema
* \[9 mins\]: Synthetic data generation: create 920 high-quality examples using topic trees, large models, chain of thought, and interactive UI
* \[5 mins\]: dispatch 9 fine tuning jobs: Fireworks (Llama 3.2 1b/3b/11b, Llama 3.1 8b/70b, Mixtral 8x7b), OpenAI (GPT 4o-mini &amp; 4o), and Unsloth (Llama 3.2 1b/3b)
* \[2 mins\]: deploy models and test they work

# Results

The result was small models that worked quite well, when the base models previously failed to produce the correct style and structure. The overall cost was less than $6 (excluding GPT 4o, which was $16, and probably wasn‚Äôt necessary). The smallest model (Llama 3.2 1B) is about 10x faster and 150x cheaper than the models we used during synthetic data generation. 

# Guide

I wrote a [detailed fine-tuning guide](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/blob/main/guides/Fine%20Tuning%20LLM%20Models%20Guide.md), covering more details around deployment, running fully locally with Unsloth/Ollama, exporting to GGUF, data strategies, and next steps like evals.

# Feedback Please!

I‚Äôd love feedback on the tooling, UX and idea! And any suggestions for what to add next (RAG? More models? Images? Eval tools?). Feel free to DM if you have any questions.

I'm starting to work on the evals portion of the tool so if folks have requests I'm eager to hear it.

So it felt natural to me that these topics were brought up in interviews.

However, someone recently asked me a question that I hadn‚Äôt given much thought to before: what‚Äôs the point of testing machine learning model knowledge during interviews for non-research data science roles?

Interview questions about model knowledge often include the following, especially if a candidate claims to have experience with these models:-

* what's the difference between bagging and boosting? 
* whether LightGBM uses leaf-wise splitting or level-wise splitting?
* what's the underlying assumptions of linear regression?

I learned these concepts because I‚Äôm genuinely interested in understanding how models work. But, coming back to the question: How important is it to have deep technical knowledge of machine learning models for someone who isn‚Äôt in a research position and primarily uses these tools to solve business problems?

From my experience, knowing how models learn from data has occasionally helped me identify issues during the model training process more quickly. But I couldn‚Äôt come up with a convincing argument to justify why it is fair to test this knowledge, other than ‚Äúthe candidate should know it if they are using it.‚Äù

datascience,Help with clustering over time,"I'm dealing with a clustering over time issue.
Our company is a sort of PayPal. We are trying to implement an antifraud process to trigger alerts when a client makes excessive payments compared to its historical behavior.
To do so, I've come up with seven clustering features which are all 365-day-long moving averages of different KPIs (payment frequency, payment amount, etc.). So it goes without saying that, from one day to another, these indicators evolve very slowly. I have about 15k clients, several years of data.
I get rid of outliers (99-percentile of each date, basically) and put them in a cluster-0 by default.
Then, the idea is, for each date, to come up with 8 clusters. I've used a Gaussian Mixture clustering (GMM) but, weirdly enough, the clusters of my clients vary wildly from one day to another.
I have tried to plant the previous mean of my centroids, using the previous day centroid of a client to sort of seed the next day's clustering of a client, but the results still vary a lot.

datascience,"How do you track your models while prototyping? Sharing Skore, your scikit-learn companion.","Hello everyone! üëã

In my work as a data scientist, I‚Äôve often found it challenging to compare models and track them over time. This led me to contribute to a recent open-source library called [**Skore**](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore), an initiative led by Probabl, a startup with a team comprising of many of the core scikit-learn maintainers.

Our goal is to help data scientists use scikit-learn more effectively, provide the necessary tooling to track metrics and models, and visualize them effectively. Right now, it mostly includes support for model validation. We plan to extend the features to more phases of the ML workflow, such as model analysis and selection.

I‚Äôm curious: how do you currently manage your workflow? More specifically, how do you track the evolution of metrics? Have you found something that worked well, or was missing?

I‚Äôll try to keep this short because I‚Äôm terrible at being concise.



I came from a different world‚Äîoperations and sales. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to realize that I wanted to move away from... well, salespeople. I applied for a dev job at my company and got rejected, but they saw potential in my knowledge and experience with machine learning, deep learning, and some other rogue projects I had been working on.



They asked if I could develop a proof of concept (POC) to present to our board of directors. The company had previously attempted to work with three external teams, but none of those efforts were successful. I presented the POC, and it went exceptionally well. We secured funding and created a junior data science position specifically for me. Previously, the company had no such role or anything similar. While the IT team is very strong, they haven‚Äôt had the capacity to handle initiatives like this.



Since then, I‚Äôve been obsessed‚Äîreading everything I can and taking stats classes for a certificate program at MIT (with plans to continue my education). I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve been driving my wife and friends crazy because I love talking about this stuff. I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about it!



That said, I still have so much to learn and need to overcome my imposter syndrome.

- I enjoy interpreting that data to determine the root cause of an issue  
- In terms of scripting, I like making quick and dirty scripts that help my team automate something for us (this doesn't including writing large complicated scripts for other teams)

datascience,Classification threshold cost optimisation,"Say you‚Äôve selected the best classifier for a particular problem, using threshold invariant metrics such as AUROC, Brier score, or log loss. 

It‚Äôs now time to choose the classification threshold. This will clearly depend on the use case and the cost/ benefits associated with true positives, false positives, etc. 

Often I see people advising to choose a threshold by looking at metrics such precision and recall. 

What I don‚Äôt see very often is people explicitly defining relative (or absolute, if possible) costs/ benefits of each cell in the confusion matrix (or more precisely the action that will be taken as a result). For example a true positive is worth $1000, a false positive -$500 and the other cells $0. 

You then optimise the threshold based on maximum benefit using a cost-threshold curve. The precision and recall can also be reported, but they are secondary to the benefit optimisation and not used directly in the choice. I find this much more intuitive and is my go-to.

Hard to give away specifics as it is an extremely niche industry and I will dox myself immediately, but we need to use a Bayesian package that has primary been developed in R.   
  
Issue is, from my perspective, the package is poorly developed. No unit tests. poor/non-existent documentation, plus practically impossible to understand unless you have a PhD in Statistics along with a deep understanding of the niche industry I am in. Also, the values provided have to be ""correct""... lawyers await us if not...  
  
While I am okay with statistics / maths, I am not at the level of the people that created this package, nor do I know anyone that would be in my immediate circle. The tested JAGS and untested STAN models are freely provided along with their papers.

It is either I refactor the R package myself to allow for easier documentation / unit testing / maintainability, or I recreate it in Python (I am more confident with Python), or just utilise the package as is and pray to Thomas Bays for (probable) luck.

On the other hand, when it comes to the actual data science aspect of the project, I would need information on songs that I haven't listened to, in order to classify them. Does anybody know how I could get my hands on a list of spotify URIs in order to fetch data from their API?

Moreover, does anybody know of any open source datasets that would lend themselves well to this kind of project?  Kaggle data often seems too perfect and can't be used for a real-time project / tool, which is the bar nowadays.

1. Classifying crop diseases, but I'm not sure if there is open data, and labelled data on that?

2. Predicting probability your roof is suitable for solar panel installation based on address and Google satellite API combined with an LLM and prompt engineering - I don't think I could use a logistics regression for this since there isn't labelled data I'm aware of

Currently, my main focus has been to get into data science (product side), then maybe in the future decide to become a PM or stay in DS, depending on the role and company I get. Recently, I came across a company hiring for a Sales Engineer position. The company is a SaaS for data science, so I researched the role and felt I would like it. I do enjoy working with people, presenting things, and public speaking if required. I‚Äôve heard the pay is pretty good in sales engineering too.

I do like the data science field as I‚Äôm curious about finding insights, solving problems, and on the product side, improving user experiences and creating new features. I‚Äôve been looking for an opportunity since last year and haven‚Äôt been able to land a job, not even as an analyst. So my fear is if I get into sales engineering (I‚Äôm only interested in this particular firm for this role), would it be hard to get back into the industry? I‚Äôm currently working as a volunteer data science to maintain visa, so not like I will be leaving actual DS job. Also, I don‚Äôt know if I will get the role for SE as well, but wanted to decide as I have someone who will refer me and i feared that it would look bad when I ask them for referral for data science role (in future as they don‚Äôt have any open role now for DS).

datascience,Why hasn't forecasting evolved as far as LLMs have?,"Forecasting is still very clumsy and very painful. Even the models built by major companies -- Meta's Prophet and Google's Causal Impact come to mind -- don't really succeed as one-step, plug-and-play forecasting tools. They miss a lot of seasonality, overreact to outliers, and need a lot of tweaking to get right.

It's an area of data science where the models that I build on my own tend to work better than the models I can find.

LLMs, on the other hand, have reached incredible versatility and usability. ChatGPT and its clones aren't necessarily perfect yet, but they're definitely way beyond what I can do. Any time I have a language processing challenge, I know I'm going to get a better result leveraging somebody else's model than I will trying to build my own solution.

Why is that? After all the time we as data scientists have put into forecasting, why haven't we created something that outperforms what an individual data scientist can create?

Or -- if I'm wrong, and that does exist -- what tool does that?",takenorinvalid,1h5z7w7,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5z7w7/why_hasnt_forecasting_evolved_as_far_as_llms_have/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5z7w7/why_hasnt_forecasting_evolved_as_far_as_llms_have/,2024-12-03 21:49:24,206,0.9,206,0,101,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5z7w7
datascience,Peaking too early with my job title,"I was given the title of Director of Data  after only 3 years of being a Data Analyst.

I am a one-man department in a company of ~30 employees with ~$6-7 million in revenue/yr. I only recently hired a direct report part-time to assist with some of the more mundane tasks.

I was given the title because I routinely deal with executives. The management at my company wants them to view me more as an equal rather than reaching out to them and they just forward to me anyways to complete the data request.

While I enjoy the pay bump and increase in autonomy, my goal is to work as an individual contributor at a high level (DA or DS) as I do not want to deal with direct reports if possible. Especially not ones that have to be micromanaged. 

I've noticed since my title change ~2 years ago recruiters reach out to me asking me to hire candidates rather than approaching me as a candidate. This makes me think this job title may be too early as I am not even 30 yet and I am not ready to settle into a management role long-term.

Has anyone else had a similar experience and how did you deal with it? I am in a situation where my employer would be willing to essentially give me whatever title I want if I left on good terms when  a company calls for a reference.

Edit: for any new comments, I do not claim to be a Data Scientist. My role is a mix of data analyst and data engineer as I do both Ad Hoc analysis and manage our SQL database.

Because I'm already getting paid around 120k, I would likely need to move into a Senior Data Analyst or entry level Data Scientist role to maintain my salary. And I likely could only enter a DS role after I finish my Masters in Data Science as my Bachelors is in Finance and my Python skills are still in the early stages.",Inception952,1h5yiul,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5yiul/peaking_too_early_with_my_job_title/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5yiul/peaking_too_early_with_my_job_title/,2024-12-03 21:20:43,201,0.91,201,0,75,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5yiul

My relationship with my stakeholders are great. They love me and consequently I am not able to move back to my old role as it will leave a void in the current role. My skip level boss is the same and wouldn't allow it.

datascience,Need your perspective to land an entry level job,"Looking at the current market trends, what skills do you think one should focus on to land an entry level data analyst/data science job in 8-9 months? 

Portfolio building, networking and preparing for interviews is already assumed but ...

Our time is limited. We cannot learn and focus on everything. What skills might be best spend on to land a job within this timeframe.

My educational background: 

1. Bachelor of Computing in Information Systems 

2. Currently persuing Msc Data Science and Computational Intelligence. (9 months left to graduate). All courses are finished, just the thesis left.

My professional background:

Have experience as a content writer, content editor, technical writer etc.

Have done an 8 week Software Engineering internship (focused on fullstack JS/TS stack.)

Have done 2 months Internship as a ""Data Science intern"" but it was focused on web scraping, cleaning data obtained through an API to generate market leads, building proof of concept LLM applications using Langchain and Google Gemini/OpenAI API keys.

1. I'm from a 3rd world country. I cannot offer you any financial compensation for your detailed guided response even if I really want to (unless it is in Nrs). So, please ignore this post, it you are looking for monetary reward for you high quality response.

2. Please don't ask me to look at job postings, ask ChatGPT, Google. I've done those things. Job descriptions are like wishlists. If I read a JD, I come up with an impression that I need to have 10 year internship experience with almost every technology imaginable just to land an entry level job.  Provide me with your personal perspective.

datascience,PowerBI is making me think about jumping ship,"As my work for the coming year is coming into focus, there is a heavy emphasis on building customer-facing ETL pipelines and dashboards. My team has chosen PowerBI as its dashboarding application of choice. Compared to building a web-app based dashboard with plotly dash or the like, making PowerBI dashboards is AGONIZING. I'm able to do most data transformations with SQL beforehand, but having to use powerquery or god forbid DAX for a viz-specific transformation feels like getting a root canal. I can't stand having to click around Microsoft's shitty UI to create plots that I could whip up in a few lines of code. 

I'm strongly considering looking for a new opportunity and jumping ship solely to avoid having to work with PowerBI. I'm also genuinely concerned about my technical skills decaying while other folks on my team get to continue working on production models and genAI hotness.

Anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

datascience,Is any of you doing actual ML work here?,"I'm really passionate and i love the mathematics of machine learning, especially the one in deep learning. I do have experience with training DL models, genetic algo hyperparameter tuning, distribution based models/clustering (KL div, EM), combining models or building them from scratch, implementing complex ones in C from zero, signal analysis, visualizations, and other things.

I work in a FAANG, but most of the work is actually data engineering and statistics. At first I was given the chance to work on a bit of ML, but that was just for me to have the motivation to learn the already existing systems, because no one in the entire department does any ML, and now I'm only getting engineering/statistics projects.

I had jobs in the past at startups where the CEO would tell me to hard code IFs instead of training a decision tree for different tasks.

They all just want ""the simplest solution"", and I fully agree with the approach, except that the simplest possible approach is not an actual solution some of the time. We may need to add in some complexity to solve different tasks, but most managers/bosses I've encountered have been terrified by any actual ML/mathematics. I agree that explainable and low risk high reward are the best approaches, but not if your ""low risk"" solution is hardcoding hundred of if statements instead of a decision tree, man.

Is it because I'm from Europe and not US? I've been told by HR that we're inferior and that ideas only come from the US and to keep my head down more instead of proposing projects before.

datascience,Daily averaged time series comparison -Linking plankton and aerosols emissions?,"Hi everyone, so we have this dataset of daily averaged pytoplankton time series over a full year; coccolithophores, chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, phaecocystis, zooplankton.  
Then we have atmospheric measurements on the same time intervals of a few aerosols species; Methanesulphonic acid, carboxylic acids, aliphatics, sulphates, ammonium, nitrates etc...  
Our goal is to establish all the possible links between plankton types and aerosols, we want to find out which planktons matter the most for a given aerosols species.

So here is my question; Which mathematical tools would you use to build a model with these (nonlinear) time series? Random Forest, cross-wavelets, transfer entropy, fractals analysis, chaos theory, Bayesian statistics? The thing that puzzle me most is that we know there is a lag between the plankton bloom and aerosols eventually forming in the atmosphere, it can take weeks for a bloom to trigger aerosols formation, so far many studies have just used lagged Pearson¬¥s correlation, which I am not too happy with as correlation really isn¬¥t reliable, would you know of any advanced methods to find out the optimal lag? What would be the best approach in your opinion?

datascience,"Large scale video processing help
","I want to extract CLIP embeddings from 40k videos at a certain frame rate. To do this there are three main things I need to do, which are to first read the video to extract frames, preprocess the frames using the CLIP Image processor and use CLIP itself to extract the embeddings. The first two operations are cpu heavy and the last one is gpu heavy.

One option to do this would be to use Spark with a cluster of T4 machines, with more cores and RAM, that reads a chunk of the video, preprocesses it and encodes it using CLIP. But if I was to do that sometimes the GPU would be idle and sometimes the CPU would not be used to it's full potential.

What would be the best way to solve this issue? Note that if I was to split this into two tasks I would need to store the preprocessed video frames and that seems overkill because it be around 100 TB of storage (yeah, mp4 really compresses videos well). Is there a way to do this processing using two different kinds of machines on the same cluster? One that is CPU and RAM heavy and one that has a GPU?

I'm sure this could be achieves with Kubernetes, but that seems overkill for this task. Is there an easy way to do this with Spark? Should this even be done with Spark?

\- previously, if Plotly received non-pandas input, it would convert it to pandas and then continue

\- now, you can also pass in Polars DataFrame / PyArrow Table / cudf DataFrame and computation will happen natively on the input object without conversion to pandas. If you pass in a DuckDBPyRelation, then after some pruning, it'll convert it to PyArrow Table. This cross-dataframe support is achieved via [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals)

For plots which involve grouping by columns (e.g. \`color='symbol', size='market'\`) then performance is often 2-3x faster when starting with non-pandas inputs. For pandas inputs, performance is about the same as before (it should be backwards-compatible)

I‚Äôm new to data science and considering freelancing. I‚Äôm fine working for as low as $15/hour, so earnings aren‚Äôt a big concern for me. I‚Äôve gone through past Reddit posts, but they mostly discuss freelancing from the perspective of income. My main concern is whether freelancing in data science is practical for someone like me, given its unique challenges.

A bit about my background: I‚Äôve completed 3-4 real-world data science projects, not on toy datasets, but actual data (involving data scraping, cleaning, visualization, modeling, deployment, and documentation). I‚Äôve also worked as an intern in the NLP domain.

Some issues I‚Äôve been thinking about:

1. Domain Knowledge and Context: How hard is it to deliver results without deep understanding of a client‚Äôs business?


2. Resource Limitations: Do freelancers struggle with accessing data, computing power, or other tools required for advanced projects?


3. Collaboration Needs: Data science often requires working with teams. Can freelancers integrate effectively with cross-functional groups?


4. Iterative and Long-Term Nature: Many projects require ongoing updates and monitoring. Is this feasible for freelancers?


5. Trust and Accountability: How do freelancers convince clients to trust them with sensitive or business-critical work?


6. Client Expectations: Do clients expect too much for too little, especially at low wages?

datascience,Math Question on logistic regression and boundary classification from Andrew Ngs Coursera course,"I'm following Andrew Ngs Machine Learning specialisation on Coursera, FYI.

If the value of the sigmoid function is greater than 0.5, the classification model would predict y\_hat = 1 or ""true"".

However, when using more complex functions inside of the sigmoid function, e.g. an ellipse:

1 / (1 + e^(-z)) where z = x1^(2)/a^(2)   \+   x2^(2)/b^(2)   \-1

in order to define the classification boundary, Andrew says that the model would predict y\_hat = 1 for points inside of the boundary. However, based on my understanding of the lecture, as long as the threshold is 0.5, and you're predicting y\_hat = 1 for any points where the sigmoid function evaluates to &gt;= 0.5 then it should be points **outside** the boundary.

More specifically, it's proven that g(z) &gt;= 0.5 when z &gt;= 0, therefore if z is an ellipse, g(z) &gt;= 0.5 would imply that x1^(2)/a^(2)   \+   x2^(2)/b^(2) \&gt;= 1, i.e. outside the boundary

datascience,OGI - An Open Source Framework for General Intelligence ,"Dan and I often found ourselves deep in conversation about the future of artificial intelligence, particularly how we could create a system that mimics human cognition. Our discussions revolved around the limitations of current AI models, which often operate in silos and lack the flexibility of human thought. 

From these chats, we conceptualized the **Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework**, which aims to integrate various processing modules that can dynamically adjust based on the task at hand. We drew inspiration from how the human brain processes information‚Äîusing interconnected modules that specialize in different functions while still working together seamlessly.

Our brainstorming sessions were filled with ideas about creating a more adaptable AI that could handle multiple data types and switch between cognitive processes effortlessly. This collaborative effort not only sparked innovative concepts but also solidified our vision for a more intelligent and reliable AI system.

I wrote a guide on discrete-event simulation with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to help you learn how to build simulations using Python. Kind of like the official documentation but on steroids.

I have used SimPy personally in my own career for over a decade, it was central in helping me build a [pretty successful engineering career](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1gh8at0/my_13_year_nontraditional_meche_career_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling real world industrial systems such as factories, mines, railways, etc.

My latest venture is teaching others all about this.

I have to build an optimization algorithm on a domain I have not worked in before (price sensitivity based, revenue optimization) 

Well, instead of googling around, I asked ChatGPT which we do have available at work. And it was eye opening. 

I am sure tomorrow when I review all my notes I‚Äôll find errors. However, I have key concepts and definitions outlined with formulas. I have SQL/Jinja/ DBT and Python code examples to get me started on writing my solution - one that fits my data structure and complexities of my use case. 

Again. Tomorrow is about cross checking the output vs more reliable sources. But I got so much knowledge transfered to me. I am within a day so far in defining the problem. 

Unless every single thing in that output is completely wrong, I am definitely a convert.

datascience,Doubts on credit scorecard devlopment ,"So I had a few questions when I was learning about score cards and how how they are made etc, and I came accross a few questions that I would like to discuss on.


1). Why do we have Policy as a critical part of underwriting when Scorecard can technically address all aspects related to credit risk (e.g., if Ag&lt;18 is a decline as per lender policy, we can put a very low score for Age&lt;18 and it would automatically be declined. Hence, Scorecard can cover Policy parameters also.)? Do we really need to have Policy? What purpose does it serve?

2. One lender (a client of a credit bureau) uses Personal Loan scorecard with very high Gini. However, the client experienced very high default rate on low-income customers who had high custom score. Under what circumstance is it possible? Or it is not a possibility?

3. Should Fraud be checked as top of funnel in underwriting or should it be done at the end of the underwriting funnel?


My answers are as follows :-
Ans 1) even if I give a very low score to applicants under 18, it is still possible for that applicant to score high on other parameters and come accross as a good customer contradictory to my policy which states that I have to reject him.

Ans2)I think the answer to this is that the model is overfitting,Maybe the score card when being developed did not have enough data on low income customer so the model is not able to discriminate between the low income and other income levels of customer so it's overfitting when it is validated.

Ans3)fraud must be checked as early as possible so that , fraudulent customers are rejected outright to avoid wasting resourcess on those customers.

This is my take on the questions, I would love to hear yours.

Also if you guys know any resources (books,videos etc) that goes in the detail about scorecard devlopment etc.


Thanks In advance.


Thanks for your replies, I am still having a hard time understanding some of the answers , so I will elaborate a bit more as maybe I didn't frame my questions properly.

Q1) let's say I don't want to provide loans to people in certain regions..let's say a war torn country, but the individuals of the region have a good credit history and they seem to pay back their loans. But I have a policy that says I can't operate in this region , can I not price this risk accordingly in my scorecard?so does this undermine the need for policy.

Q2)For the second question, what I wanted to ask was is as follows  let's say I have built a model with a high gini , but let's say that for a lot of low income individuals for whom my scorecard gave a high custom score , turned out to be defaulters. Is this possible and if so, why does this happen? Was the income relationship too complex to capture? Is my model overfitting? 

Q3)what is the loan underwriting process ? What is fraud risk and credit risk ? As per my understanding fraud risk eventually becomes credit risk , hence checking fraud must be the first thing to do when underwriting.

datascience,Question about setting up training set,"I have a question how how to structure my training set for a churn model. Let‚Äôs say I have customers on a subscription based service and at any given time they could cancel their subscription. I want to predict the clients that may go lost in the next month and for that I will use a classification model. Now for my training set, I was thinking of using customer data from the past 12-months. In that twelve months, I will have customers that have churned in that time and customers that have not. Since I am looking to predict churns in the next month, should my training set consist of lost client and non-lost customers in each month for the past twelve month where if a customers has not churned at all in the past year, I would have 12 records for that same customer and the features about that customer as of the given month? Or would I only have one record for the customer that has not churned and remained active and the features for that client would be as of the last month in my twelve month window?

After countless applications and rejections, I‚Äôve finally received two offers but seeing my luck they came two days apart, and I‚Äôm unsure which to choose.

1/ AI Engineer (Fully Remote): This role focuses on building large language models (LLMs). It's more of a technical role.

2/ Marketing Scientist (Office-based): This involves applying data analytics to marketing-related problems focusing on regression models. It's more of a client facing role.

While my background is in statistics, I‚Äôve done several internships and projects in data science. I‚Äôm leaning toward the AI engineer role mainly because the title and experience seem to offer better future growth opportunities. However, I‚Äôm concerned about the fully remote aspect because i'm young and value in-person interactions, like building relationships with colleagues and being part of a workplace community.

Does anyone have experience in similar roles or faced a similar dilemma? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

datascience,"Does anyone function more as a ""applied scientist"" but have no research background?","**TLDR: DS profile is shifting to be more ML heavy, but lack research experience to compete with ML specialists.**

I've been a DS for several years, mostly in jack-of-all-trades functions: large-scale pipeline building, ad-hoc/bespoke statistical modeling for various stakeholders, ML applications, etc. More recently, I've started on a lot more GenAI/LLM work alongside applied scientists. Leaving aside the negativity on LLM hype, most of the AS folks have heavy research backgrounds: either PhDs or publications, attendance at conferences like ICLR, CVPR, NeurIPS, etc. I don't have any research experience except for a short stint in a lab during grad school but was never published. Luckily my AS peers have treated me as their own, which is good from credibility perspective.

That said, when I look at the market, DS jobs are either heavy on product analytics (hypothesis testing, experimentation, product sense, etc.) or DA/BI (dashboards, reporting, vis, etc.). The ones that are ML-heavier generally want much more research experience and involvement. I can explain the theory behind transformers, attention, decoders vs. encoders, etc. but I have zero publications and wouldn't stand a chance against people with much deeper ML research experience.

I guess what I'm looking for is an applied/ML scientist-adjacent role, but still gives opportunity to flex to occasionally support other functions, like TPM'ing, DE, MLOps, etc. Aside from startups, there doesn't seem to be much out there.

datascience,How do you mange the full DS/ML lifecycle ?,"Hi guys! I‚Äôve been pondering with a specific question/idea that I would like to pose as a discussion, it concerns the idea of more quickly going from idea to production with regards to ML/AI apps.

My experience in building ML apps and whilst talking to friends and colleagues has been something along the lines of you get data, that tends to be really crappy, so you spend about 80% of your time cleaning this, performing EDA, then some feature engineering including dimension reduction etc. All this mostly in notebooks using various packages depending on the goal. During this phase there are couple of tools that one tends to use to manage and version data e.g DVC etc

Thereafter one typically connects an experiment tracker such as MLFlow when conducting model building for various metric evaluations. Then once consensus has been reached on the optimal model, the Jupyter Notebook code usually has to be converted to pure python code and wrapped around some API or other means of serving the model. Then there is a whole operational component with various tools to ensure the model gets to production and amongst a couple of things it‚Äôs monitored for various data and model drift.

Now the ecosystem is full of tools for various stages of this lifecycle which is great but can prove challenging to¬†**operationalize**¬†and as we all know sometimes the results we get when adopting ML can be supar :(

I‚Äôve been playing around with various platforms that have the ability for an end-to-end flow from cloud provider platforms such as AWS SageMaker, Vertex , Azure ML. Popular opensource frameworks like MetaFlow and even tried DagsHub. With the cloud providers it always feels like a jungle, clunky and sometimes overkill e.g maintenance. Furthermore when asking for platforms or tools that can really help one explore, test and investigate without too much setup it just feels lacking, as people tend to recommend tools that are great but only have one part of the puzzle. The best I have found so far is Lightning AI, although when it came to experiment tracking it was lacking.

So I‚Äôve been playing with the idea of a truly out-of-the-box end-to-end platform, the idea is not to to re-invent the wheel but combine many of the good tools in an end-to-end flow powered by collaborative AI agents to help speed up the workflow across the ML lifecycle for faster prototyping and iterations.

If one has only 15% non nulls, let‚Äôs say, using a regression model to predict the remaining 85% seems unreasonable. But at 80-20 it seems fine. So my question: at what level can one still impute missing values to a column that is sparse?

datascience, The Multi-Modal Revolution: Push The Envelope,"Fellow AI researchers - let's be real. We're stuck in a rut.

**Problems:**
- Single modality is dead. Real intelligence isn't just text/image/audio in isolation
- Another day, another LLM with 0.1% better benchmarks. Yawn
- Where's the novel architecture? All I see is parameter tuning
- Transfer learning still sucks
- Real-time adaptation? More like real-time hallucination

**The Challenge:**
1. Build systems that handle 3+ modalities in real-time. No more stitching modules together
2. Create models that learn from raw sensory input without massive pre-training
3. Push beyond transformers. What's the next paradigm shift?
4. Make models that can actually explain cross-modal reasoning
5. Solve spatial reasoning without brute force

**Bonus Points:**
- Few-shot learning that actually works
- Sublinear scaling with task complexity
- Physical world interaction that isn't a joke

I was on statascratch a few days ago, and I noticed that they added a section for Polars. Based on what I know, Polars is essentially a better and more intuitive version of Pandas (correct me if I'm wrong!). 

With the addition of Polars, does that mean Pandas will be phased out in the coming years?

You try to assign to a column of a df2 = df1[df1['A']&gt; 1] you get a ""setting with copy warning"".

accidentally assign a column of length 69 to a data frame with 420 rows and it will eat it like it's nothing, if only index is partially matching.

You df.groupby? Sure, let me drop nulls by default for you, nothing interesting to see there!

You df.groupby.agg? Let me create not one, not two, but THREE levels of column name that no one remembers how to flatten.

Df.query? Let me by default name a new column resulting from aggregation to 0 and make it impossible to access in the query method even using a backtick.

Concatenating something? Let's silently create a mixed type object for something that used to be a date. You will realize it the hard way 100 transformations later.

Df.rename({0: 'count'})? Sure, let's rename row zero to count. It's fine if it doesn't exist too.

However, I‚Äôm also considering applying to a handful of online masters programs (ranging from applied statistics, to data science, to analytics).

My reasoning is that:

a) I can keep my options open. Assuming I‚Äôm unable to land an internship or job, I would have a masters program for fall 2025 to attend. 

b) During an online masters I can continue applying to jobs and internships. I can decide whether I am a full time or part time student. If full time, most programs can be done in 12 months.

c) I feel like there‚Äôs no better time than now to get a masters. It‚Äôs hard to break into the field with a bachelors as is (or that‚Äôs how it seems to me) so an MS would make it easier. There‚Äôs also no job tying me down. 

d) I am not sure whether I wish to pursue a PhD. A masters would be good preparation for one if I do decide to do one.

datascience,Non-Data Science Teams Going It Alone on DS Projects - what to do?,"My organization's DS shop is relatively small and lives entirely in the Analytics department. With myself, and my manager, being the only ones with the experience to take on DS oriented work.  Other teams have a growing appetite for DS solutions (running experiments, building predictive models, etc.) giving us some justification to grow our team. Overall, this is a positive development compared to a few years ago when much of this work was done through vendors/consultants.

However, we have noticed that some teams appear to be employing their own DS solution without any initial input from us. In some cases we have been pinged asking for guidance (like asking for a Power analysis or a more complicated Data pull), but in other cases we are brought on when something has gone wrong (like poorly randomized A/B testing or inability to conduct significance testing). My boss hasn't really pushed back on any of this opting to take a a wait and see approach as we ramp up our team; however, I am concerned this will lead to either a fractured DS culture or worse a shift of responsibility to another team. One thing I saw recently was one of these teams recruiting for a Sr. Data Scientist in all but title.

Personally, this is also a concern for me as it limits my ability to advance into a more Senior position. It also leaves our team leaving credit on the table. We are critical to these projects, but none of them have our ""label"" on it.

Is my boss right to take a reactive approach as we ramp up or is this a sign of a future inefficient Data Science culture at my org?

datascience,I built a full stack ai app as a Data scientist - Is Future Data science going to just be Full stack engineering?,"I recently built a SaaS web app that combines several AI capabilities: story generation using LLMs, image generation for each scene, and voice-over creation - all combined into a final video with subtitles. 

While this is technically an AI/Data Science project, building it required significant full-stack engineering skills. The tech stack includes: 

\- Frontend: Nextjs with Tailwind, shadcn, redux toolkit 

\- Backend: Django (DRF) 

\- Database: Postgres

  
After years in the field, I'm seeing Data Science and Software Engineering increasingly overlap. Companies like AWS already expect their developers to own products end-to-end. For modern AI projects like this one, you simply need both skill sets to deliver value.

The reality is, Data Scientists need to expand beyond just models and notebooks. Understanding API development, UI/UX principles, and web development isn't optional anymore - it's becoming a core part of delivering AI solutions at scale.

Some on this subreddit have gone ahead and called Data Scientists 'Cheap Software Engineers' - but the truth is, we're evolving into specialized full-stack developers who can build end-to-end AI products, not just write models in notebooks. That's where the value is at for most companies.

This is not to say that this is true for all companies, but for a good number, yes.

datascience,How to effectively use a data science team?,"Hi all! The situation is as follows: I have 5 data scientists in my team, and 5 business analysts. The team has grown from 4 to 10 people (ex. Manager) over the year and I think we're ready to take things to the next level.

We are part of the business, and the data scientists have different expertises besides statistics etc., for example data engineering, DevOps, web development, but also more soft skills such as presenting and networking.
Not unimportantly: data is available, and there a opportunities to get more data available if needed (e.g. automated extract from systems for easy use in other work)

Currently many of the dashboarding requests were dropped om the DS plate, but i want to push that workload go the business analists to make room for more interesting (and valuable) DS projects. 

For context, there are many other disciplines 'nearby' in the organisation, meaning its possible to get a project team with a process expert (when new/updated processes are needed), business analysts or system experts.

TL;DR: What's the best use of a data science team, that's part of a business team?

Edit: to clarify: there's plenty of business driven backlog, and I'm not the team's manager. However I am curious to hear about ideas coming from outside, hence this post.

datascience,The coding issues data teams encounter are truly intriguing,"Hi, over the past 9 months, we have been working on Upsonic and have obtained some outputs from the discussions we've had. I would like to share these with you as well. If there are any points you disagree with, please feel free to write them down, I would be very happy about thatüôèüèª

We conducted more than 300 interviews with data teams. During these conversations, we noticed that across different projects, around 30-40% of the code in their notebooks is repetitive and reusable.

The development-related problems of data teams are not clearly understood, and the problems also vary by location. It's like they are in a fog, and it's very hard to find a solution. We discovered these 3 main reasons for this problem in data teams:

1- The product for data teams is the output they get from the data, not the code. But in development, code is the product. There are best practices in the coding world, so if you are writing code, you need to adhere to these best practices as much as possible, regardless of your purpose. However, these practices and tools are developed for developers. That's why data teams struggle with using these tools in their development processes. Moreover, these tools are not compatible enough, and not everyone in the team is equally proficient with them.

2- While doing data exploration in Jupyter, they can't directly push the code to Git to share it. There is a diff issue between Git and Python/Jupyter. That's why they struggle with collaborative work.

3- Data scientists have many reusable components and things they can share, but the individual work culture affects the collaborative work culture. The same things are repeatedly done for the company.



After discovering these problems and their reasons, we built a function hub to facilitate collaborative work. We provide 3 key features that data teams need:

1- We allow teams to share their functions with teammates with a single command from within their notebooks. Other team members can pull the same function with a single command. 

2- We document everything that is pushed to the function hub, including the functions, commits, and release notes, so teams can understand each other's code. 

3- We use AI to read Jupyter files, find the reusable components, and send them to the platform. This way, even if the code quality is low, it can be refactored into a function and made available for the team to use.

Since there is no one with extensive DS experience in our team, we conducted 300 interviews. We are still continuing our research. I would love to hear your feedback.

1. **Company A**: I made it to the final round, and the hiring manager explicitly said I was their top candidate, mentioning that my background fit their needs perfectly. My take-home assignment was positively reviewed, especially since I went above and beyond the requirements. The final interview also went well, and I was told to expect a decision within two weeks unless delays arose. However, after three weeks of no communication, I reached out to the hiring manager (my main contact), but received no reply.

datascience,Unlocking the full potential of data scientists ,"Eric Colson wrote a long [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-skills-unlocking-the-full-potential-of-data-scientists-90696226cfae) on how most data scientists are being underutilized by just focusing on technical tasks instead of driving  insights and business outcomes.

He also summarizes bluntly in a footnote why the issue might not be exclusively on the stakeholder's side:
""If you are reading this and find yourself skeptical that your data scientist who spends his time dutifully responding to Jira tickets is capable of coming up with a good business idea, you are likely not wrong. Those comfortable taking tickets are probably not innovators or have been so inculcated to a support role that they have lost the will to innovate""

Based on your experience, what helps data scientists focus on business outcomes rather than purely technical skills? And how can a sense of innovation be reignited in data scientists who feel stuck in a support-oriented mindset?

datascience,Should I go for a CS degree with a Stats Minor or an Honours in CS for Data Science/ML?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a CS student trying to figure out the best route for a career in data science and machine learning, and I could really use some advice.

I‚Äôm debating between two options:

1. **CS with a Minor in Statistics**¬†‚Äì This would let me dive deep into the stats side of things, covering areas like probability, regression, and advanced statistical analysis. I feel like this could be super useful for data science, especially when it comes to understanding the math behind the models.
2. **Honours in CS**¬†‚Äì This option would allow me to take a few extra advanced CS courses and do a research project with a professor. I think the hands-on research experience might be really valuable, especially if I ever want to go more into the theoretical side of ML.

If my main goal is to get into data science and machine learning, which route do you think would give me a better foundation?

datascience,Luxxify Makeup Recommender,"# [Luxxify Makeup Recommender](https://luxxify.streamlit.app/)

Hey everyone,

I(F23), am a master's student who recently designed a makeup recommender system. I created the Luxxify Makeup Recommender to generate personalized product suggestions tailored to individual profiles based on skin tone, type, age, makeup coverage preference, and specific skin concerns. The recommendation system uses a RandomForest with Linear Programming, trained on a custom dataset I gathered using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4. The project is deployed on a scalable Streamlit app.

To use the Luxxify Makeup Recommender click on this link: [https://luxxify.streamlit.app/](https://luxxify.streamlit.app/)

Custom Created Dataset via WebScraping: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zarasarkar/makeup-insights-customer-reviews/data)

Feel free to use the dataset I created for your own projects!

# Technical Details

* **Web Scraping:** Product and review data are scraped from [Ulta](https://www.ulta.com/), which is a popular e-commerce site for cosmetics. This raw data serves as the foundation for a robust recommendation engine, with a custom scraper built using requests, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup4. Selenium was used to perform button click and scroll interactions on the Ulta site to dynamically load data. I then used requests to access specific URLs from XHR GET requests. Finally, I used BeautifulSoup4 for scraping static text data.
* **Leveraging PostgreSQL UDFs For Feature Extraction**: For data management, I chose [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for its scalability and efficient storage capabilities. This allowed me to leverage Postgres querying to unroll complex JSON data. I also coded Python PostgreSQL UDFs to make feature engineering more scalable. I cached the computed word embedding vectors to speed up similarity calculations for repeated queries.
* **NLP and Feature Engineering:** I extracted Key features using Word2Vec word embeddings from Reddit makeup discussions (https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/). I did this to incorporate makeup domain knowledge directly into the model. Another reason I did this is to avoid using LLM models which are very expensive. I compared the text to pre-selected phrases using cosine distance. For example, I have one feature that compares reviews and products to the phrase ""glowy dewey skin"". This is a useful feature for makeup recommendation because it indicates that a customer may want products that have moisturizing properties. This allowed me to tap into consumer insights and user preferences across various demographics, focusing on features highly relevant to makeup selection.

These are my feature importances. To select this features, I performed a manual management along with stepwise selection. The features that contain the \_review suffix are all from consumer reviews. The remaining features are from the product details.

[Graph of Feature Importances](https://preview.redd.it/9zblqwmz8b0e1.png?width=2036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61ee1d186f9e53f209e010d107caa12b442d616f)

* **Cross Validation and Sampling:** I employed a Random Forest model because it's a good all-around model, though I might re-visit this. Any other model suggestions are welcome!! Due to the class imbalance with many reviews being five-stars, I utilized a mixed over-sampling and under-sampling strategy to balance class diversity. This allowed me to improve F1 scores across different product categories, especially those with lower initial representation. I also randomly sampled mutually exclusive product sets for train/test splits. This helped me avoid data leakage.
* **Linear Programming for Constraints:** I used linear programming (OrTools) to add budget and category level constraints. This allowed me to add a rule based layer on top of the RandomForest. I included domain knowledge based rules to help with product category selection.

# Future Improvements

* **Enhanced NLP Features:** I want to experiment with more advanced NLP models like BERT or other transformers to capture deeper insights from beauty reviews. I am currently using bag-of-words for everything.
* **User Feedback Integration:** I want to allow users to rate recommendations, creating a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.
* **Add Causal Discrete Choice Model:** I also want to add a causal discrete choice model to capture choices across the competitive landscape and causally determine why customers select certain products. I am thinking about using a nested logit model and ensemble it with our existing model. I think nested logit will help with products being in a hierarchy due to their categorization. It also lets me account for implied based a consumer choosing not to buy a specific product. I would love suggestions on this!!
* **Implement Computer Vision Based Features:** I want to extract CV based features from image and video review data. This will allow me to extract more fine grained demographic information.

datascience,"Company has DS team, but keeps hiring external DS consultants","TL;DR: How do I convince my hire-ups that our project proposals are good and our team can deliver when they constantly hire external DS contractors?

Hi all,

I'll soon be joining a team of data scientists at our parent company. I've had lots of contact with my future team, so I know what they're going through. The company is not tech (insurance), but is building a portfolio of data scientists. Despite skill and the potential existing in the team, the company keeps hiring consultants to come in and build solutions while ignoring their employees' opinions and project proposals. Some of these contractors are good, some laughably bad.

External developers and DS are given lots of leeway and trust. They can build in whatever tech stack they propose while ignoring any and all process and our eng team then has to pick up the pieces.

Our teams are often criticized for not delivering quickly enough, while contractors are said to iterate rapidly. I work in an industry with *a lot* of red tape. These contractors are often allowed to circumvent this. In turn, the internal DS team cannot gather enough experience to compete.

I guess my question is: how do I change this? I don't necessarily want to switch companies again so soon and I really do want to empower my (future) team to make their ideas and proposals heard.",Morpheyz,1gorxj3,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gorxj3/company_has_ds_team_but_keeps_hiring_external_ds/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gorxj3/company_has_ds_team_but_keeps_hiring_external_ds/,2024-11-11 13:16:12,151,0.96,151,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Projects,self,t3_1gorxj3

datascience,Is a Data Science or Stats Master's worth it with 2 YOE as a Data Scientist?,"Hello everyone! I am a 22 years old Data Scientist and recently graduated with my B.S in Data Science from a lesser-known state school. My job has been going pretty well, I find the work interesting although I am mostly doing data analysis tasks rather than ML/DS, and I make a comfortable salary in a HCOL city. I'm not sure if I want to be a Data Scientist forever, but recently I have been thinking more about my career path/future plans.

My parents also work in tech (program manager and software developer) and have been pressuring me about getting a Master's as soon as I got my first job. They claim that it is the new Bachelor's, it is necessary for career progression, and if I don't get one soon I will fall behind in my career. They also want me to start doing some DS certifications to be more competitive for my next job but I'm not sure if this would be a very valuable use of my time or make any meaningful impact.

But I'm getting overwhelmed and confused about what sorts of roles to look for.

A quick google search for ""types of roles in data science"" and you'll find dozens of pages filled with SEO-driven buzzwords (possibly AI-generated), but these only give the most surface-level and generic descriptions of common titles like data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, etc. This isn't really what I'm looking for though lol.

Also, so many roles today seem to just be focused on shoving the latest LLM stack (RAG, langchain, etc) into the problem even if the use case for the company is slim or marginal at best. This isn't really what I'm interested in cause I like operations data science more.

What I'm looking for is a more specific, tailored advice relevant to specific types of industries/specializations. For example

* I really like building models that heavily rely on functional programming, and may make use of very niche or specific libraries depending on the use case. I enjoy Project Euler type problems for example
* I understand ML is a core part of data science, but I enjoy projects where ML isn't exclusive to the problem. A lot of other models can be solved by more functional programming and tailored computational science type work
* I guess my background right now is mostly focused on business/operations/economics, so I don't have a specific engineering or hard science background, but I'm open to any area that invovles applied mathematics.

As the title alluded, are there methods and/or processes to do reverse-embedding that perhaps are currently being researched?

However, perhaps some of you might know some literature that might've gone into that direction, even if at theoretical or rudimentary level and it'd be greatly appreciated if you can point me to those resources. You're also welcome to share your thoughts and theories as well.

Expanding from reverse-embedding, is it possible to go beyond the range of the embedding vectors/tensors so as to reverse-embed said embedding vectors/tensors and then retrieve the resulting text, image, etc. from them?

datascience,Sharing my experience,"Hey all. I'm a bit stuck in my career because I made some bad assumptions early on, and also been quite lazy. I'd love to share my experience and get some advice on how to proceed further.

My background: I'm 27, from a small Eastern Europe country, 6 yoe, working in a local FAANG at the moment, been really good at math in school, won many local contests, and went to a place where many of my colleagues continued to MIT/Oxford/etc. abroad, but I chose to stay home because of family issues, lack of money, and lack of courage. My expectation was that if I self study a lot and get really really good in terms of skill, after working locally for some years, I would be able to find a good position abroad. That was an extremely bad assumption.

The first reason is that I did not even begin to fathom how bad the work environment would be around here. Well, across my yoe I mostly did my entire work in a few hours each week and focused a lot on studying and personal projects the rest of the time.

The second reason is that my experience here does not count at all when applying abroad. When entering the FAANG some time ago, they gave me an intern project, while I was a senior in my previous job... and they treated me like training a linear regression is completely outside of my skillset, while having experience with much more complex models and having implemented l.r. in C from scratch for fun in the past... When applying to thousands of jobs abroad I got zero callbacks (before the faang stamp).

I did come up with prototypes, presented at internal conferences within the FAANG, but they refuse to help me publish externally because I don't have a PhD and because papers don't come from eastern europe... And mostly because I don't keep my head down like the rest of my colleagues who behave as if US folks are superior.

When working with a German startup, I was invited to come there for a few weeks and work together. They kept saying that they don't have much money, and when I said that's fine, I just want to build something together and be treated as an equal, they looked at me like I was insane. They expected to pay me scrap and didn't even know that the economy in my country was quite similar to the German one on the programming side.

I got around 5 total research projects that can be turned into publications, done at various companies.

I really want to move west now, and into a research oriented role, as the engineering side does not appeal to me that much anymore (except as a tool for research), but I don't know how to do that, as I'm completely ghosted by all applications I make.

My options would be:

Write papers on all previous projects I did, then send them across the world to top journals and PhD programs

Message hundreds of professors/researchers in look of a mentor

Message people in my local FAANG and try looking for mentorship / publishing opportunity

Get back in local academia (which is a total shitshow) and try to reach out from there, maybe some professors have connections to US/big journals

datascience,Announcing Plotlars 0.7.1: We‚Äôre Back with Deep Refactoring and Exciting New Features! ü¶Ä‚ú®üìä,"Hello Data Scientists!

After a long hiatus, I‚Äôm thrilled to announce that **Plotlars 0.7.1** is now released!

I‚Äôve resumed the project with a deep refactoring. I believe Rust can be a great candidate for data science, but we have a long journey ahead to achieve it. This crate aims to reduce the complexity when making plots, making data visualization in Rust more accessible and straightforward.

üöÄ New Features

1. **Heat Maps**: We‚Äôve added support for heat maps, enabling you to create color-coded representations of data matrices. Heat maps are perfect for visualizing data density, correlations, and patterns across two dimensions, making it easier to identify trends and anomalies in your datasets.
2. **Scatter 3D Plots**: Introducing 3D scatter plots to Plotlars! Now you can visualize your data in three dimensions, providing a new perspective on relationships and clusters within your data. Rotate and zoom into your plots for an immersive data exploration experience.

A huge thank you to all of you for your continued support, contributions, and feedback. Your enthusiasm drives this project forward.

Explore the [updated documentation](https://docs.rs/plotlars/0.7.1) and head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alceal/plotlars) to see the new features in action. If you enjoy using Plotlars, **consider leaving a star ‚≠êÔ∏è on GitHub to help others discover the project** and support its ongoing development.

  
**This project is a breakthrough that‚Äôs set to transform the field ‚Äì share it to be part of the change!**

datascience,Data Science vs. the Interruption Culture,"I really enjoy modeling and visualizations.   Hell, even data cleaning can be kind of satisfying.   I'm a little sad how little time I get to focus on what I do best.

I know everybody reading this probably gets a hundred emails a day, and spends more time in meetings than they'd like.   The last year dramatically accelerated for me for a several reasons.  First, my main project has attracted a lot of attention, all the way up to the CIO, and now five levels of management wants regular updates, and wants to tinker with things like variable importance.  Second, I'm having to work with the sales department, who have a pretty toxic culture, and, like management, think of time in small chunks.   DS requires good chunks of focused time, and has longer term goals, and it doesn't work well with people who expect immediate responses to short-term ""emergencies"".   Finally, Microsoft Teams has been widely adopted throughout the company, so I have to listen to that PING! from messages dozens of times an hour.

Her are some of my tricks in dealing with this, and hope others will share theirs:

\*) You don't have to go to every meeting you get invited to.  My calendar accelerated this year, and I sometimes have as many as three simultaneous meetings.  There's one guy who schedules these pointless meetings for as long as 9 hours.  Yes, I'm not kidding.  Now that it's literally impossible for me to go to every meeting.....people will think I'm at  different meetings, when I'm really getting actual work done.

\*) Schedule made-up meetings.  The worst offenders don't care whether I already have something down, but I'll regularly put two hour ""status update"" meetings for my team where we can get work done and Outlook will say we're unavailable.

\*) I just ignore demands for ""status reports"" and ""a few slides"" from people who aren't in my immediate chain of command.

\*) Divvy up the nonsense.   Most meetings invite my entire team.   Take a few minutes in the morning and decide, if anybody goes, who that one person is who has to waste their time.

\*) PowerPoint is a pox upon the working man, and has become the end product for some people.   When a deck gets to a certain point, nobody knows what's in it, so don't contribute.  The main deck for my project is now at 177 slides.

\*) Presenting any results with anything more complicated than a lift chart is asking for trouble.  Explaining variable importance is asking for trouble.    When describing data, use percentages or rough figures (\~1.1m instead of a specific) because there are people who literally add up numbers and want to know why the figures on slide 68 don't match the ones on slide 47.

\*) Finally, turn down the volume on your computer.   It's WAY less stressful if you don't get that ""ping"" dozens of times an hour.  I also sometimes ""attend"" meetings by putting the Zoom on the little monitor, and keeping the volume off until I see a slide that looks like it might related to what I'm working on.

datascience,Long-term Forecasting Bias in Prophet Model,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm using Prophet for a time series model to forecast sales. The model performs really well for short-term forecasts, but as the forecast horizon extends, it consistently underestimates. Essentially, the bias becomes increasingly negative as the forecast horizon grows, which means residuals get more negative over time.

What I‚Äôve Tried:
I‚Äôve already tuned the main Prophet parameters, and while this has slightly adjusted the degree of underestimation, the overall pattern persists.

My Perspective:
In theory, I feel the model should ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from these long-term errors and self-correct. I‚Äôve thought about modeling the residuals and applying a regression adjustment to the forecasts, but it feels like a workaround rather than an elegant solution. Another thought was using an ensemble boosting approach, where a secondary model learns from the residuals of the first. However, I‚Äôm concerned this may impact interpretability, which is one of Prophet‚Äôs strong suits and a key requirement for this project.

Would anyone have insights on how to better handle this? Or any suggestions on best practices to approach long-term bias correction in Prophet without losing interpretability?

datascience,How do you handle version control at a high level?,"I do a lot of project-oriented work, and I've been thinking about how to make my repo structures work better for me. I'm curious what others do and in what contexts.

For me, it goes something like this:

1. Academic projects. These are the easiest. It's generally one repo per paper, and then I have some infrastructure projects (e.g., packages, persistent datasets) that have their own.
1. Consulting. This is probably the most challenging area, in part because it's a smaller side thing. In a typical engagement, I'll have datasets, prototypes (Python and R), exploratory work (notebooks), deliverables (notebooks or quarto docs; and then usually with a pile of supporting data and outputs), slides, and internal docs (meeting notes, timesheets, invoices). They can last years, and I would often have multiple devcontainer setups, sometimes Python and R but more often creating ones with newer package versions over time.

I've generally used smaller repos, but it becomes a hassle to manage all of them, and be sure I'm in the right one. I know that monorepos are popular in some settings, though I don't have experience with them.

After a lot of discussions with the engineering team at my company, we have decided to use Java for inference. We have models trained with TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and MLX. The chosen Java framework candidates are [DeepLearning4J (DL4J)](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j) and [DeepJavaLibrary (DJL)](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl).

**DL4J:**

* Direct support for TensorFlow/Keras models.
* Support for PyTorch models when exporting to ONNX.
* Many forks and stars on GitHub.

**DJL:**

* Direct support for TensorFlow/Keras models.
* Direct support for TorchScript.
* Developed by the AWS team.
* Engine-agnostic, which could mean potential support for MLX in the future.
* Seems to be less commonly used in the industry.

Has anyone tested either of these frameworks (or both)? Any recommendations?

* **GPU Acceleration**: From up to 50x to 500x faster graph analytics using NVIDIA GPUs vs. NetworkX on CPU, depending on the algorithm.
* **Zero code change**: NetworkX code does not need to change, simply enable the cuGraph backend for NetworkX to run with GPU acceleration.
* **Scalability**:¬† GPU acceleration allows NetworkX to scale to graphs much larger than 100k nodes and 1M edges without the performance degradation associated with NetworkX on CPU.
* **Rich Algorithm Library**: Includes community detection, shortest path, and centrality algorithms (about 60 graph algorithms supported)

datascience,"Taking my first steps on recommender systems, would love some thoughts on the following","Hey guys,

Just for full disclosure, I know *very* little of recommender systems (RS) and I want to try my hands at them, and learn more from these technologies. The issue is that, from the little I have read so far, it seems that, more or less, all the approaches I've read about so far, they all rely on having *some* form of info on the interactions of users with the products to recommend. This is intuitive and I understand why, but I run into a problem quite quickly: how do I go about recommending items for *new* users based on what users similar to them like? I am not talking about ""similar"" in the sense of tastes for the product (which would mean the user is not new and I have already collected data on what these users have bought or read, for example), but similar in terms of other attributes (e.g. demographics, or shops at other stores).

My situation is as follows: 

- I have data for millions of users, and have access to demographic attributes (e.g. gender, age) and also to their shopping baskets at Store A. 

- I want to create a recommender system for new users walking into Store B, with products you have in store B (that I know for a fact that are not part of Store A, so item-item collaboration is out of the question for the moment), for which I have little to no info because that's their situation: they're new to Store B.

My first instinct is to create a clustering algorithm that creates some personas for members using the demographics and shopping behaviour for Store A, and then depending on where the new users fall into cluster-wise I can recommend products from Store B that popular within the cluster (from info from the older users).

The only issue with that approach is that I am not sure where it falls within the spectrum of algorithms from libraries such as `scikit-surprise`, and I am therefore not sure if it will behave as a ""recommender system"" so to speak.

Do you guys have any thoughts you could spare on this situation?

datascience,How does a random forest make predictions on ‚Äúunseen‚Äù data ,"I think I have a fairly solid grasp now of what a random forest is and how it works in practice, but I am still unsure as to exactly how a random forest makes predictions on data it hasn‚Äôt seen before. Let me explain what I mean.

When you fit something like a logistic regression model, you train/fit it (I.e. find the model coefficients which minimise prediction error) on some data, and evaluate how that model performs *using* those coefficients on unseen data.

When you do this for a decision tree, a similar logic applies, except instead of finding coefficients, you‚Äôre finding ‚Äúsplits‚Äù which likewise minimise some error. You could then evaluate the performance of this tree ‚Äúusing‚Äù those splits on unseen data. 

Now, a random forest is a collection of decision trees, and each tree is trained on a bootstrapped sample of the data with a random set of predictors considered at the splits. Say you want to train 1000 trees for your forest. Sampling dictates a scenario where for a single datapoint (row of data), you could have it appear in 300/1000 trees. And for 297/300 of those trees, it predicts (1), and for the other 3/300 it predicts (0). So the overall prediction would be a 1. Same logic follows for a regression problem except it‚Äôd be taking the arithmetic mean.

But what I can‚Äôt grasp is how you‚Äôd then use this to predict on unseen data? What are the values I obtained from fitting the random forest model, I.e. what splits is the random forest using? Is it some sort of average split of all the trees trained during the model? 

Or, am I missing the point? I.e. is a new data point actually put through all 1000 trees of the forest?",JLane1996,1ghc7xh,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ghc7xh/how_does_a_random_forest_make_predictions_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ghc7xh/how_does_a_random_forest_make_predictions_on/,2024-11-01 18:24:08,61,0.89,61,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,ML,self,t3_1ghc7xh
datascience,A delicate situation ,"I just joined a company that is premature when it comes to DS. All codes are in notebooks. No version control on data, code, or model. There are some model documentations. But these documents are quite sparse and more of a business memo than a technical document. 

The good part is that my manager wants to improve the DS workflow. The devops team also want to improve the implementations and they are quite collaborating. The issue are the product owners. 

I recently did a task for one of them. This was to update one of their models. The model lacked a proper technical document, half-ass code on git (just a model dump on s3), even the labels were partly incorrect, no performance monitoring, ... You just guess the rest. 

After working on it for a few weeks, I realized that the product owner only expects a document as my efforts outcome. A document exactly like their business memos that half of the numbers are cherry-picked and the other half are rather either meaningless data tables or some other info that are downright wrong. He also insists that the graphs to be preserved. Graph that lack basic attributes such as axis labels, proper font size, having graphs overlaid to allow easy comparison. He single argument is that ""customer like it this way"". Which, if true, is quite a valid argument.

datascience,You do pricing using....,"Hi guys, recently I've been collaborating on automated pricing, we built a model based on demand elasticity for e-commerce products, all statistical methods, even the price elasticity of demand function is assuming a linear relationship between demand and margins.

So far, it's doing ""good"" but not ""good enough"".

The thing is here, the elasticity is considering the trendline of the product alone, which is not the case, what if that product was a complement to another product/s or if it was a substitute?

I managed to tackle that partially with cross-elasticity, it did give good estimations, but still..

There's too much room for improvement, my manager is planning on converting a lot of the structure of the model to RL, in the model, we're actually mimicing the behaviour of RL, where there's an achievement function that we're trying to optimize and it works with the estimated PED.
but I find RL really hard to make it practical, And I read in many articles and discussions that this problem many companies tackled with deep learning, because it can exhibit and absorb many complex patterns in the data so I decided to give it a shot and started learning deep learning from a hands-on deep learning book and a youtube course.

I'll change our exact use case for privacy reasons. But basically let's say I am predicting whether a cab driver will accept an ride request. Some of the features we are using for this is the driver's historical data for all of his rides (like his overall acceptance rate). Now, for the training dataset, I am obviously calculating the drivers history over the training data only. However, for the test dataset, I have computed the driver history features over the entire dataset. The reason is that each driver's historical data would also be available during inference time in prod. Also, a lot of drivers won't have any historical data if we calculate it just on the test set. Note that my train test split is time based. The entire test set lies in the future to the train set.

datascience,Double Machine Learning in Data Science,"With experimentation being a major focus at a lot of tech companies, there is a demand for understanding the causal effect of interventions.

Traditional causal inference techniques have been used quite a bit, propensity score matching, diff n diff, instrumental variables etc, but these generally are harder to implement in practice with modern datasets.

A lot of the traditional causal inference techniques are grounded in regression, and while regression is very great, in modern datasets the functional forms are more complicated than a linear model, or even a linear model with interactions.

Failing to capture the true functional form can result in bias in causal effect estimates. Hence, one would be interested in finding a way to accurately do this with more complicated machine learning algorithms which can capture the complex functional forms in large datasets.

datascience,Who here uses PCA and feels like it gives real lift to model performance?,"I‚Äôve never used it myself, but from what I understand about it I can‚Äôt think of what situation it would realistically be useful for. It‚Äôs a feature engineering technique to reduce many features down into a smaller space that supposedly has much less covariance. But in models ML this doesn‚Äôt seem very useful to me because:
1. Reducing features comes with information loss, and modern ML techniques like XGB are very robust to huge feature spaces. Plus you can get similarity embeddings to add information or replace features and they‚Äôd probably be much more powerful.
2. Correlation and covariance imo are not substantial problems in the field anymore again due to the robustness of modern non-linear modeling so this just isn‚Äôt a huge benefit of PCA to me.
3. I can see value in it if I were using linear or logistic regression, but I‚Äôd only use those models if it was an extremely simple problem or if determinism and explain ability are critical to my use case.

datascience,Senior DS laid off and trying to get out of product analytics. How can I pivot to a more quantitative position?,"**EDIT: I‚Äôm ignoring all messages and chat requests not directly related to my question.  If you have a separate question about getting into industry, interview prep, etc., please post it in its own thread or in the appropriate master topic.**

(I figured this is specific enough to warrant its own post instead of posting in the weekly Entering and Transition thread, as I already have a lot of industry experience.)

**TL;DR: How can an unemployed, experienced analytics-focused data scientist get out of analytics and pivot to a more quantitative position?**

I'm a data scientist with a Master's in Statistics and nine years of experience in a tech city.  I've had the title Senior Data Scientist for two of them.  I was laid off from my job of four years in June and have been dealing with what some would call a ""first world problem"" in the current market.

**I get callbacks from many recruiters, but almost all of them are for analytics positions.**  This makes sense because (as I'll explain below) I've been repeatedly pushed into analytics roles at my past jobs.  I have roughly 8 years of analytics experience, and was promoted to a senior position because I did well on a few analytics projects.  My resume that most of my work is analytics, as most of my accomplishments are along the lines of ""designed a big metric"" or ""was the main DS who drove X internal initiative"".  I've been blowing away every A/B testing interview and get feedback indicating that I clearly have a lot of experience in that area.  I've also been told in performance reviews and in interview loops that I write very good code in Python, R, and SQL.

However, **I don't like analytics.**  I don't like that it's almost all very basic A/B testing on product changes.  More importantly, I've found that most companies have a terrible experimentation culture.  When I prod in interviews, they often indicate that their A/B testing platform is underdeveloped to the point where many tests are analyzed offline, or that they only test things that are likely to be a certain win.  They ignore network effects, don't use holdout groups or meta-analysis, and insist that tests designed to answer a very specific question should also be used to answer a ton of other things.  It is - more often than not - [Potemkin Data Science](https://mcorrell.medium.com/potemkin-data-science-fba2b5ba5cc6).  I'm also frustrated because I have a graduate degree in statistics and enjoy heavily quantitative work a lot, but rarely get to do interesting quantitative work in product analytics.

Additionally, I have mild autism, so I would prefer to do something that requires *less* communication with stakeholders.  While I'm aware that every job is going to require stakeholder communication to some degree, the amount of time that I spent politicking to convince stakeholders to do experimentation correctly led to a ton of stress.

**I've been trying to find a job more focused on at least one of causal inference, explanatory statistical modeling, Bayesian statistics, and ML on tabular data (i.e. not LLMs, but like fraud prediction).**  I've never once gotten a callback for an ML Engineer position, which makes sense because I have minimal ML experience and don't have a CS degree.  I've had a few HR calls for companies doing ML in areas like identity validation and fraud prediction, but the initial recruiting call is always followed up with ""we're sorry, but we decided to go with someone with more ML experience.""

**My experience with the above areas is as follows.**  These were approaches that I tried but ended up having no impact, except for the first one, which I didn't get to finish.  Additionally, note that I currently do not have experience working with traditional CS data structures and algorithms, but have worked with scipy sparse matrices and other DS-specific data structures:

* Designed requirements for a regression ML model.  Did a ton of internal research, then learned SparkSQL and wrote code to pull and extract the features.  However, after this, I was told to design experiments for the model rather than writing the actual code to train it.  Another data scientist on my team did the model training with people on another team that claimed ownership.  My manager heavily implied this was due to upper management and had nothing to do with my skills.

* Used a causal inference approach to match treatment group users to control group users for an experiment where we were expecting the two groups to be very different due to selection bias.  However, the selection bias ended up being a non-issue.

* Did clustering on time-dependent data in order to identify potential subgroups of users to target.  Despite it taking about two days to do, I was criticized for not doing something simpler and less statistical.  (Also, in hindsight, the results didn't replicate when I slightly changed the data, which is very much my fault for not checking.)

* Discussed an internal fraud model with stakeholders.  Recognized that a dead simple feature wasn't in it, learned a bit of the internal ML platform, and added it myself.  The feature boosted recall at 99% precision by like 40%.  However, even after my repeated prodding, the production model was never updated due to lack of engineering support and because the author of the proprietary ML framework quit.

* During a particularly dead month, I spent time building a Bayesian model for an internal calculation in Stan.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it to scale, and ran into major computational issues that - in hindsight - likely indicated an issue with the model formulation in the paper I tried to implement.

* Rewrote a teammate's prototype recommendation model and built a front end explorer for it.  In a nutshell, I took a bunch of spaghetti code and turned it into a maintainable Python library that used Scipy sparse matrices for calculations, which sped it up considerably.  This model was never productionized because it was tested in prod and didn't do well.

At the time I was laid off I had about six months of expenses saved up, plus fairly generous severance and unemployment.  I can go about another four months without running out of savings. 
 **How should I proceed to get one of these more technical positions?**  Some ideas I have:

* List the above projects on my resume even though they failed.  However, that's inevitably going to come up in an interview.

* I could work on a personal project focused on Bayesian statistics or causal inference.  However, I've noticed that the longer I'm unemployed, the fewer callbacks and LinkedIn messages I get, so I'm worried about being unemployed even longer.

* Take an analytics job and wait for a more quantitative opening at a different company to occur.  Someone fairly big in my city's DS community that knows I can handle more technical work said he'd refer me and probably be able to skip most of the interview process, but his company currently has no open DS positions and he said he doesn't know when more will open up.

* Take a 3 or 6-month contract position focused on my interests from one of the random third party recruiters on LinkedIn.  It'll probably suck, but give me experience I can use for a new job.

* Drill Leetcode and try to get an entry-level software engineer position.  However this would obviously be a huge downgrade in responsibility and pay, preparation would drain my savings, and there‚Äôs no guarantee I could pivot back to DS if it doesn‚Äôt work out.


Additionally, **here's a summary of my work experience**:

* Company 1 (roughly 200 employees).  First job out of grad school.  I was there for a year and was laid off because there ""wasn't a lot of DS work"".  I had a great manager who constantly advocated for me, but couldn't convince upper management to do anything beyond basic summary statistics.  For example, he pitched a cluster analysis and they said it sounded hard.

* Company 2 (roughly 200 employees).  I was there for two years. 
 **Shortly after joining I started an ML project, but was moved to analytics due to organizational priorities.**  Got a phenomenal performance review, asked if I could take on some ML work, and was given an unambiguous no.  Did various analytics tasks (mostly dashboarding and making demos) and mini-projects on public data sources due to lack of internal data (long story).  Spent a full year searching for a more modeling-focused position because a lot of the DS was smoke and mirrors and we weren't getting any new data.  After that year, I quit and ended up at Company 3.

* Company 3 (roughly 30000 employees).  I was there for six years.  I joined because my future manager (Manager #1) told me I'd get to pick my team and would get to do modeling.  Instead, after I did a trial run on two teams over three months, **I was told that a reorg meant I would no longer get to pick my team and ended up on a team that needed drastic help with experimentation.**  Although my manager (Manager #2) had some modeling work in mind for me, she eventually quit.  Manager #3 repeatedly threw me to the wolves and had me constantly working on analyzing experiments for big initiatives while excluding me from *planning* said experiments, which led to obvious implementation issues.  He also gave me no support when I tried to push back against unrealistic stakeholder demands, and insisted I work on projects that I didn't think would have long-term impact due to organizational factors.  However, I gained a lot of experience with messy data.  I told his skip during a 1:1 that I wanted to do more modeling, and he insisted I keep pushing him for those opportunities, to no avail.

    Manager #3 drove me to transfer to another team, which was a much better experience.  Manager #4 was the best manager I ever had and got me promoted, but also didn't help me find modeling opportunities.  **Manager #5 was generally great and found me a modeling project to work on after I explained that lack of modeling work was causing burnout.  It was a great project at first, but he eventually pushed me to work only on the experimental aspects of that modeling project.**  I never got to do any actual modeling for this project even though I did all the preparation for it (e.g. feature extraction, gathering requirements), and another team took it over.  Shortly after this project completed, I was laid off.",dspivothelp,1gc524p,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gc524p/senior_ds_laid_off_and_trying_to_get_out_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gc524p/senior_ds_laid_off_and_trying_to_get_out_of/,2024-10-25 21:19:41,99,0.88,99,0,68,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Career | US,self,t3_1gc524p

datascience,Handling behavioral scores with mixed scales: best practices for encoding and ordering ranks,"Problem Description:

I‚Äôm working on a data processing pipeline that involves handling behavioral survey data from multiple scales (e.g., Likert scales, frequency scores, and categorical data). My goal is to encode these mixed scales properly while maintaining the correct rank/order (for instance, ensuring that higher Likert scores indicate stronger agreement).

However, I‚Äôve run into several issues with encoding and rank preservation.

Question:

What are some robust methods or best practices for:

Encoding behavioral scales with mixed types (e.g., Likert, categorical, frequency scores) while maintaining the order and rank.
Handling inconsistent answer sets across different surveys (e.g., 5-point vs. 7-point scales).
Dynamically encoding ordinal and categorical variables in a way that respects the natural order.
Dealing with missing values and inconsistent responses within the encoding process.
Tools I‚Äôm Using:

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) Streamlit (for visualization and reporting)

Any suggestions for tools, workflows, or algorithms to dynamically and effectively encode behavioral data will be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôd also love to know if anyone has encountered similar challenges and found solutions that work across varied datasets. I'm relatively new to this data pipeline stuff. Thank you in advance!

Below are the approaches I‚Äôve tried so far, but none have provided a robust, generalizable solution:

Hard-coding mappings for categories and ordinal features, like:

{'Never': 0, 'Rarely': 1, 'Sometimes': 2, 'Often': 3, 'Always': 4} This became unmanageable across multiple datasets with slightly different answer sets (e.g., some surveys use 5-point scales, others use 7-point).

LightGBM encoding: I used LightGBM to encode categorical features dynamically. While it works well for feature importance, it didn‚Äôt seem to capture or maintain the ordinal nature of all scales.

Clustering methods to find patterns within responses ‚Äì but this approach failed to respect the natural ordering of some ordinal scales.

One-hot encoding: This lost the rank structure entirely, making it unsuitable for certain analyses.

Ordinal encoding: I also tried OrdinalEncoder from sklearn, but it didn‚Äôt encode the columns properly (in some cases, the results didn‚Äôt align with the expected order or meaning).",[deleted],1gb7yot,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gb7yot/handling_behavioral_scores_with_mixed_scales_best/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gb7yot/handling_behavioral_scores_with_mixed_scales_best/,2024-10-24 17:17:22,5,0.86,5,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gb7yot

Not all customer transactions are recorded.

My experience is something of a quagmire. I had been working in fintech for seven years within the realm of data science. I cut my teeth on R. I managed a decision engine in R and refactored it in an OOP style. It was a thing of beauty (still runs today, but they're finally refactoring it to Python). I've managed small data teams of analysts, engineers, and scientists. I, along with said teams, have built bespoke ETL pipelines and data models without any enterprise tooling. Took it one step away from making a deployable package with configurations.

Despite all of that, I cannot find a company willing to take me in. I admit that part of it is lack of the enterprise tooling. I recently became intermediate with Python, Databricks, Pyspark, dbt, and Airflow. Another area I lack in (and in my eyes it's critical) is machine learning. I know how to use and integrate models, but not build them. I'm going back to school for stats and calc to shore that up.

I've applied to over 500 positions up and down the ladder and across industries with no luck. I'm just not sure what to do. I hear some folks tell me it'll get better after the new year.

datascience,Why Most Companies Prefer Python Over R for Data Processing?,"I‚Äôve noticed that many companies opt for Python, particularly using the Pandas library, for data manipulation tasks on structured data. However, from my experience, Pandas is significantly slower compared to R‚Äôs¬†`data.table`¬†(also based on benchmarks¬†https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/). Additionally,¬†`data.table`¬†often requires much less code to achieve the same results.

For instance, consider a simple task of finding the third largest value of¬†`Col1`¬†and the mean of¬†`Col2`¬†for each category of¬†`Col3`¬†of¬†`df1`¬†data frame. In¬†`data.table`, the code would look like this:

    df1[order(-Col1), .(Col1[3], mean(Col2)), by = .(Col3)]

In Pandas, the equivalent code is more verbose. No matter what data manipulation operation one provides, ""data.table"" can be shown to be syntactically succinct, and faster compared to pandas imo. Despite this, Python remains the dominant choice. Why is that?

While there are faster alternatives to pandas in Python, like Polars, they lack the compatibility with the broader Python ecosystem that¬†`data.table`¬†enjoys in R. Besides, I haven't seen many Python projects that don't use Pandas and so I made the comparison between Pandas and datatable...

datascience,Andrew Ng course still make a difference(! or ?),"**Hey everyone,**  


Not sure if you guys have completed the Andrew Ng classic course, but I would love to share some thoughts about two junior data scientists ‚Äì same level ‚Äì I hired. Naturally, I will not reveal details, but one completed the whole course, and the other one chose another approach to learn modeling (such as Kaggle and experimenting with hyperparameters).  


I've been coaching them, and I've noticed a huge difference related to fundamentals. Sometimes, I felt that one of the data scientists was just guessing at hyperparameters with no idea of what was going on behind the scenes, even for simple concepts (such as the type of regularization or the choice of lambda).  


At the same time, I remember a lot of people in our area saying that the Andrew Ng course could not prepare anyone for the industry, due to focusing too much on the math. But wait! It wasn‚Äôt about the math! It was about the concepts ‚Äì which are crucial when modeling! I'm okay if you don't know the cost function of logistic regression by heart, but I'm glad to know you have an idea that it needs to be minimized at the end of the day.  


I've seen a lot of previous posts recommending the first steps for data scientists, but after many years in the field, I just can't imagine a data scientist not taking the Andrew Ng course as a first step.

Every time I check wikipedia I feel stupid. I spent yesterday evening coming up with a story that‚Äôs helped me remember. It seems to have worked so hope it helps you too.

A lake has been infiltrated by giant terrifying piranhas and they are eating all the funky pufferfish. You have been employed as a Data (wr)Angler to get rid of the piranhas but keep the pufferfish.

You start with your Precision speargun. This is great as you are pretty good at only shooting terrifying piranhas. The trouble is that you have left a lot of piranhas still in the lake.

It‚Äôs time to get out the Recall Trawler with super Sensitive sonar. This boat has a big old net that scrapes the lake and the sonar lets you know exactly where the terrifying piranhas are. This is great as it looks like you‚Äôve caught all the piranhas!

The problem is that your net has caught all the pufferfish too, it‚Äôs not very Specific.

Luckily you can buy a Specific Funky Pufferfish Friendly net that has holes just the right size to keep the Piranhas in and the Pufferfish out.

Now you have all the benefits of the Precision Speargun (you only get terrifying piranhas) plus you Recall the entire shoal using your Sensitive sonar and your Specific net leaves all the funky pufferfish in the Lake !

datascience,"WTF with ""Online Assesments"" recently.","Today, I was contacted by a ""well-known"" car company regarding a Data Science AI position. I fulfilled all the requirements, and the HR representative sent me a HackerRank assessment. Since my current job involves checking coding games and conducting interviews, I was very confident about this coding assessment.

I entered the HackerRank page and saw it was a 1-hour long Python coding test. I thought to myself, ""Well, if it's 60 minutes long, there are going to be at least 3-4 questions,"" since the assessments we do are 2.5 hours long and still nobody takes all that time.

Oh boy, was I wrong. It was just one exercise where you were supposed to prepare the data for analysis, clean it, modify it for feature engineering, encode categorical features, etc., and also design a modeling pipeline to predict the outcome, aaaand finally assess the model. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. That wasn't a ""1-hour"" assessment. I would have believed it if it were a ""take-home assessment,"" where you might not have 24 hours, but at least 2 or 3. It took me 10-15 minutes to read the whole explanation, see what was asked, and assess the data presented (including schemas).

Are coding assessments like this nowadays? Again, my current job also includes evaluating assessments from coding challenges for interviews. I interview candidates for upper junior to associate positions. I consider myself an Associate Data Scientist, and maybe I could have finished this assessment, but not in 1 hour. Do they expect people who practice constantly on HackerRank, LeetCode, and Strata?

datascience,From Type A to Type B DS,"Anyone here who recently did the move from Type A (Analysis) to Type B (Building) DS? What worked for you in making the transition?

Curious to also hear how have the titles changed for Type B. It seems the DS title is used less nowadays compared to MLE, Applied Scientist, Research/AI Engineer. Also ML roles seems to be rolling under software eng category.

--Edit: Adding some context below and source blog post with the distinction Type A and Type B [here](https://www.conordewey.com/blog/an-ode-to-the-type-a-data-scientist/)

Type A Data Scientist: The A is for Analysis. This type is primarily concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) but knows all the practical details of working with data that aren‚Äôt taught in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very large data sets, visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, writing well about data, and so on.

Type B Data Scientist: The B is for Building. Type B Data Scientists share some statistical background with Type A, but they are also very strong coders and may be trained software engineers. The Type B Data Scientist is mainly interested in using data ‚Äúin production.‚Äù They build models which interact with users, often serving recommendations (products, people you may know, ads, movies, search results).",ergodym,1g3rk24,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1g3rk24/from_type_a_to_type_b_ds/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1g3rk24/from_type_a_to_type_b_ds/,2024-10-14 21:39:18,55,0.8,55,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1g3rk24

Today, I'm writing this post to share that the [book will be open-source](https://github.com/NannyML/The-Little-Book-of-ML-Metrics)!

That means hundreds of people can review it, contribute, and help us improve it before it's finished! This also means that everyone will have free access to the digital version! Meanwhile, the high-quality printed edition will be available for purchase as it has been for a while :)

datascience,"Are AI models increasingly becoming more akin to a ""managed"" service like the cloud?","I am curious if anyone else has noticed this, but it seems that the business model of AI is becoming more similar to the cloud. What I mean is this. Before the cloud, companies needed to buy their own servers, databases and setup/manage everything in-house. When cloud came along, you have companies like Amazon and Microsoft do everything for you, to the point that you now have completely serverless services like Lambda where you only pay for compute time.

With AI models, it looks like you have companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc. train (or manage) the models for you, and all we the customers need to do is some prompt engineering or some small finetuning. Like the cloud, using models from the customers/developers perspective seems like it's becoming as simple as just an API call, as in you just call an API to get access to some of the most powerful models rather than gathering your own data, training your own, etc. Even the business model of OpenAI is based on tokens used in an API call.

So is this the future of data science and AI? Are models becoming a managed service like the cloud, where you have big companies that does all the model development/training for you and data scientists build everything on top of an API call?

datascience,Robust estimators for lavaan::cfa fails to converge (data strongly violates multivariate normality),"**Problem Introduction**¬†  
  
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm working with a clean dataset of N = 724 participants who completed a personality test based on the HEXACO model. The test is designed to measure 24 sub-components that combine into 6 main personality traits, with around 15-16 questions per sub-component.

I'm performing a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to validate the constructs, but I‚Äôve encountered a significant issue: my data strongly deviates from multivariate normality (HZ = 1.000, p &lt; 0.001). This deviation suggests that a standard CFA approach won‚Äôt work, so I need an estimator that can handle non-normal data. I‚Äôm using lavaan::cfa() in R for the analysis.

From my research, I found that Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Robustness (MLR) is often recommended for such cases. However, since I‚Äôm new to this, I‚Äôd appreciate any advice on whether MLR is the best option or if there are better alternatives. Additionally, my model has trouble converging, which makes me wonder if I need a different estimator or if there‚Äôs another issue with my approach.

**Data details**¬†The response scale ranges from -5 to 5. Although ordinal data (like Likert scales) is usually treated as non-continuous, I‚Äôve read that when the range is wider (e.g., -5 to 5), treating it as continuous is sometimes appropriate. I‚Äôd like to confirm if this is valid for my data.

During data cleaning, I removed participants who displayed extreme response styles (e.g., more than 50% of their answers were at the scale‚Äôs extremes or at the midpoint).

**In summary, I have two questions:**

* Is MLR the best estimator for CFA when the data violates multivariate normality, or are there better alternatives?
* Given the -5 to 5 scale, should I treat my data as continuous, or would it be more appropriate to handle it as ordinal?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

Once again, I‚Äôm running a CFA using lavaan::cfa() with estimator = ""MLR"", but the model has convergence issues.

**Model Call**¬†The model call:

    first_order_fit &lt;- cfa(first_order_model, 
                           data = final_model_data, 
                           estimator = ""MLR"", 
                           verbose = TRUE)
    

**Model Syntax**¬†The syntax for the ""first\_order\_model"" follows the lavaan style definition:

**Note**¬†I did not assign any starting value or fixed any of the covariances.

**Convergence Status**¬†The relative convergence (4) status indicates that after 4 attempts (2439 iterations), the model reached a solution but it was not stable. In my case, the model keeps processing endlessly:

    set.seed(123)
    
    n_participants &lt;- 200
    n_questions &lt;- 100
    
    sample_data &lt;- data.frame(
        matrix(
            sample(-5:5, n_participants * n_questions, replace = TRUE), 
            nrow = n_participants, 
            ncol = n_questions
        )
    )
    
    colnames(sample_data) &lt;- paste0(""Q"", 183:282)
    

**Assumption of multivariate normality**

To test for multivariate normality, I used:

datascience,Continuous monitoring in customer segmentation,"Hello everyone! I'm looking for advice on how to effectively track changes in user segmentation and maintain the integrity of the segmentation meaning when updating data. We currently have around 30,000 users and want to understand how their distribution within segments evolves over time.

Here are some questions I have:

1. Should we create a new segmentation based on updated data?
2. How can we establish an observation window to monitor changes in user segmentation?
3. How can we ensure that the meaning of segmentation remains consistent when creating a new segmentation with updated data?

Any insights or suggestions on these topics would be greatly appreciated!

I am working on a forecasting project and after two restarts , I am getting some weird vibes from my business SPOC.

Not only he is not giving me enough business side details to expand on my features, he is dictating what models to use. For .e.g. I got an email from him saying to use MLR, DT, RF, XGB, LGBM, CatBoost for forecasting using ML. Also, he wants me to use ARIMA/SARIMAX for certain classes of SKUs.

The problem seems to be that there is no quantitative KPI for stopping the experimentation. Just the visual analysis of results.

For e.g my last experiment got rejected because 3 rows of forecasts were off the mark (by hundreds) out of 10K rows generated in the forecast table. Since the forecast was for highly irregular and volatile SKUs, my model was forecasting within what seemed to be an acceptable error range. If actual sales were 100, my model was showing 92 or 112 etc.

datascience,Product Incremental ity/Cannibalisation Analysis,"My team at work regularly get asked to run incrementally/ Cannibalisation analyses on certain products or product lines to understand if they are (net) additive to our portfolio of products or not, and then of course, quantify the impacts.

The approach my team has traditionally used has been to model this with **log-log regression** to get the elasticity between sales of one product group and the product/product group in question.

We'll often try account for other factors within this regression model, such as count of products in each product line, marketing spend, distribution etc.

So we might end up with a model like:

Log(sales_lineA) ~ Log(sales_lineB) + #products_lineA + #products_lineB + other factors + seasonality components 


I'm having difficulties with this approach because the models produced are so unstable, adding/removing additional factors often causes wild fluctuations in coefficients, significance etc. As a result, I don't really have any confidence in the outputs.

Is there an established approach for how to deal with this kind of problem?

datascience,I asked ChatGPT to estimate how long it would take to complete the take-home assessment I got.

I've never had a take-home before, so I didn't know exactly what to expect, but right away it seemed too much. I know it's an employer's market right now, but even so, the assignment looked too long. There were several questions and each would take me a few hours to work through, so we're talking days here. 

Then I thought, maybe the assignment is not that long and I'm just not a very good data scientist.

datascience,A guide to passing the A/B test interview question in tech companies,"Hey all,

I'm a Sr. Analytics Data Scientist at a large tech firm (not FAANG) and I conduct about \~3 interviews per week. I wanted to share my advice on how to pass A/B test interview questions as this is an area I commonly see candidates get dinged. Hope it helps.

Product analytics and data scientist interviews at tech companies often include an A/B testing component. Here is my framework on how to answer A/B testing interview questions. Please note that this is not necessarily a guide to design a good A/B test. Rather, it is a guide to help you convince an interviewer that you know how to design A/B tests.

**A/B Test Interview Framework**

Imagine during the interview that you get asked ‚ÄúWalk me through how you would A/B test this new feature?‚Äù. This framework will help you pass these types of questions.

**Phase 1: Set the context for the experiment. Why do we want to AB test, what is our goal, what do we want to measure?**

1. The first step is to clarify the purpose and value of the experiment with the interviewer. Is it even worth running an A/B test? Interviewers want to know that the candidate can tie experiments to business goals.
2. Specify what exactly is the treatment, and what hypothesis are we testing? Too often I see candidates fail to specify what the treatment is, and what is the hypothesis that they want to test. It‚Äôs important to spell this out for your interviewer.¬†
3. After specifying the treatment and the hypothesis, you need to define the metrics that you will track and measure.
   * Success metrics: Identify at least 2-3 candidate success metrics. Then narrow it down to one and propose it to the interviewer to get their thoughts.
   * Guardrail metrics: Guardrail metrics are metrics that you do not want to harm. You don‚Äôt necessarily want to improve them, but you definitely don‚Äôt want to harm them. Come up with 2-4 of these.
   * Tracking metrics: Tracking metrics help explain the movement in the success metrics. Come up with 1-4 of these.

**Phase 2: How do we design the experiment to measure what we want to measure?**

1. Now that you have your treatment, hypothesis, and metrics, the next step is to determine the unit of randomization for the experiment, and when each unit will enter the experiment. You should pick a unit of randomization such that you can measure success your metrics, avoid interference and network effects, and consider user experience.
   * As a simple example, let‚Äôs say you want to test a treatment that changes the color of the checkout button on an ecommerce website from blue to green. How would you randomize this? You could randomize at the user level and say that every person that visits your website will be randomized into the treatment or control group. Another way would be to randomize at the session level, or even at the checkout page level.¬†
   * When each unit will enter the experiment is also important. Using the example above, you could have a person enter the experiment as soon as they visit the website. However, many users will not get all the way to the checkout page so you will end up with a lot of users who never even got a chance to see your treatment, which will dilute your experiment. In this case, it might make sense to have a person enter the experiment once they reach the checkout page. You want to choose your unit of randomization and when they will enter the experiment such that you have minimal dilution. In a perfect world, every unit would have the chance to be exposed to your treatment.
2. Next, you need to determine which statistical test(s) you will use to analyze the results. Is a simple t-test sufficient, or do you need quasi-experimental techniques like difference in differences? Do you require heteroskedastic robust standard errors or clustered standard errors?
   * The t-test and z-test of proportions are two of the most common tests.
3. The next step is to conduct a power analysis to determine the number of observations required and how long to run the experiment. You can either state that you would conduct a power analysis using an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, or ask the interviewer if the company has standards you should use.
   * I‚Äôm not going to go into how to calculate power here, but know that in any AB¬† test interview question, you will have to mention power. For some companies, and in junior roles, just mentioning this will be good enough. Other companies, especially for more senior roles, might ask you more specifics about how to calculate power.¬†
4. Final considerations for the experiment design:¬†
   * Are you testing multiple metrics? If so, account for that in your analysis. A really common academic answer is the Bonferonni correction. I've never seen anyone use it in real life though, because it is too conservative. A more common way is to control the False Discovery Rate. You can google this. Alternatively, the book [Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments](https://amzn.to/4dzXyZP) by Ron Kohavi discusses how to do this (note: this is an affiliate link).¬†
   * Do any stakeholders need to be informed about the experiment?¬†
   * Are there any novelty effects or change aversion that could impact interpretation?
5. If your unit of randomization is larger than your analysis unit, you may need to adjust how you calculate your standard errors.
6. You might be thinking ‚Äúwhy would I need to use difference-in-difference in an AB test‚Äù? In my experience, this is common when doing a geography based randomization on a relatively small sample size. Let‚Äôs say that you want to randomize by city in the state of California. It‚Äôs likely that even though you are randomizing which cities are in the treatment and control groups, that your two groups will have pre-existing biases. A common solution is to use difference-in-difference. I‚Äôm not saying this is right or wrong, but it‚Äôs a common solution that I have seen in tech companies.

**Phase 3:** **The experiment is over. Now what?**

1. After you ‚Äúrun‚Äù the A/B test, you now have some data. Consider what recommendations you can make from them. What insights can you derive to take actionable steps for the business? Speaking to this will earn you brownie points with the interviewer.
   * For example, can you think of some useful ways to segment your experiment data to determine whether there were heterogeneous treatment effects?

**Common follow-up questions, or ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù**

These are common questions that interviewers will ask to see if you really understand A/B testing.

* Let‚Äôs say that you are mid-way through running your A/B test and the performance starts to get worse. It had a strong start but now your success metric is degrading. Why do you think this could be?
   * A common answer is novelty effect
* Let‚Äôs say that your AB test is concluded and your chosen p-value cutoff is 0.05. However, your success metric has a p-value of 0.06. What do you do?
   * Some options are: Extend the experiment. Run the experiment again.
   * You can also say that you would discuss the risk of a false positive with your business stakeholders. It may be that the treatment doesn‚Äôt have much downside, so the company is OK with rolling out the feature, even if there is no true improvement. However, this is a discussion that needs to be had with all relevant stakeholders and as a data scientist or product analyst, you need to help quantify the risk of rolling out a false positive treatment.
* Your success metric was stat sig positive, but one of your guardrail metrics was harmed. What do you do?
   * Investigate the cause of the guardrail metric dropping. Once the cause is identified, work with the product manager or business stakeholders to update the treatment such that hopefully the guardrail will not be harmed, and run the experiment again.
   * Alternatively, see if there is a segment of the population where the guardrail metric was not harmed. Release the treatment to only this population segment.
* Your success metric ended up being stat sig negative. How would you diagnose this?¬†

datascience,Is this workload realistic or unrealistic as an analyst? ,"I am job searching to leave my current company as I feel the culture is churn and burn and I cannot keep up with my work load in the sales operations analyst role. I am able to process claims, orders, and monthly reports. However, I keep getting assigned work last minute with short turnaround times. My last assignment was 20 min last week to pull data, and each last minute report has a deadline that usually spans from 1-6 hours. I originally came aboard as a first year analyst, but unfortunately it has become expected I should have been up and running 6 months in a complex foodservice company. I asked for more training on understanding what last minute tasks could come up, but the response was that it would be hard to train since anything could come up. More last minute tasks are expected my way soon, and I'm already working 30min to 1 hr late of the 8-5.

datascience,Talk to me about nearest neighbors,"Hey - this is for work. 

20 years into my DS career ... I am being asked to tackle a geospatial problem. In short - I need to organize data with lat long and then based on ""nearby points"" make recommendations (in v1 likely simple averages). 

The kicker is that I have multiple data points per geo-point, and about 1M geo-points. So I am worried about calculating this efficiently. (v1 will be hourly data for each point, so 24M rows (and then I'll be adding even more)

**What advice do you have about best approaching this? And at this scale?**   
  
Where I am after a few days of looking around   
- calculate KDtree
- Possibly segment this tree where possible (e.g. by region)  
- get nearest neighbors  
  
I am not sure whether this is still the best, or just the easiest to find because it's the classic (if outmoded) option. Can I get this done on data my size? Can KDTree scale into multidimensional ""distance"" tress (add features beyond geo distance itself)?   
  
If doing KDTrees - where should I do the compute? I can delegate to Snowflake/SQL or take it to Python. In python I see scipy and SKLearn  has packages for it (anyone else?) - any major differences? Is one way way faster?

datascience,Run Code in the Cloud from Your Local Notebook,"I want to share a new Python library we built that lets you write code on a low-powered laptop and run the code on servers in the cloud.

# How does it work?

When you run a notebook cell, the code executes on another machine in the cloud instead of your laptop.¬†

The logs from the remote machine get streamed back to your notebook. It feels like the code is still running in your local notebook, but it‚Äôs actually running on a server in the cloud.

# Benefits¬†

**You can develop on the cloud without using a cloud notebook.**¬†

If you‚Äôve ever used a cloud notebook, you‚Äôve probably had your cloud notebook crash and lost your work.¬†

This lets you develop on a local, low-powered system, while streaming the computation to the cloud.

**Local files automatically sync with the cloud runtime**¬†

You can use files from your local machine in your remote function executions. No need to upload and download weights from Google drive or S3.¬†

**You can mix-and-match compute across cells**¬†¬†

Does your training code need the same hardware as your inference code? Probably not. This lets you customize the hardware used in your notebook, function-by-function.¬†

We‚Äôd be happy if you gave this a try! Let us know if you have any feature ideas or suggestions.¬†

datascience,We are not only model builders! Stop with that!,"I would like to share some thoughts I‚Äôve been having. I‚Äôve been looking into different industries to understand what they expect from data scientists, and I‚Äôm concerned about how many job descriptions focus solely on machine learning frameworks and model development.

I started in the data science field ten years ago, and I remember when exploratory data analysis (EDA) was a critical and challenging deliverable from the ""data guys."" It began with a business perspective, raising hypotheses about problems, identifying variables that could explain them, and highlighting missing data that wasn‚Äôt being tracked yet‚Äîvaluable input for engineering. We were bringing value to the table right from the first step.

I‚Äôm part of the group that believes data scientists should be the business team's best friends. As long as we understand what kind of decision is being made, we can help. Today, data science is often treated as a purely technical function, and I‚Äôm not sure this is the right approach. We shouldn‚Äôt just receive tasks in JIRA like we're simply developing features. The business team shouldn't be the ones deciding how and when we create a model, for example. After all, do you go to the doctor and ask for surgery right away?

I remember when building models was really hard, and we all agree that, in the future, it could be as simple as a drag-and-drop tool that anyone can use (isn‚Äôt it already like that?). Are we satisfied with reducing our job description to just that? To me, a data scientist is someone who helps make decisions. Data is just the type of evidence we use. This means we should emphasize EDA, causal inference, A/B testing, econometrics, operational research, and so on.

During some recruitment processes, I‚Äôve encountered people with a development background who struggle with methodology (from data leakage to selecting the right metrics to evaluate models). On the other hand, I‚Äôve met people without a development background who have trouble with coding, limiting their ability to scale their impact. The solution I‚Äôve found is to pair a tech-savvy person with a ‚Äòtrue data scientist‚Äô to empower both. I understand we‚Äôll never find someone who excels at everything, but I feel we‚Äôre getting worse in this regard.",EducationalUse9983,1fy9jfq,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fy9jfq/we_are_not_only_model_builders_stop_with_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fy9jfq/we_are_not_only_model_builders_stop_with_that/,2024-10-07 14:51:47,183,0.96,183,0,36,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1fy9jfq

Now that I'm writing about AI I've been wanting to explore the topic in one of my articles. However, one of the prerequisites of a topic is that there's a compelling use for whatever I'm talking about, and I am not aware of a ""great resounding din"" for GAs.

datascience,Visual data processing tool for ad-hoc and reproducable data research (NOT data visualization!),"I work in an organisation with medical researchers who work on medical datasets and clinical trials. Previously we had a custom made tool with a simple GUI to select and filter data, and it could also do (limited) grouping and pivoting of data. However the datasets have outgrown the scope of our tool, so currently we just provide the datasets as SQL databases, together with basic SPSS and Rstudio scripts to select all data and add metadata (labels, codes+labels etc). A typical required workflow for our reseach users is like this:

* open 3 datasets, for example patient treatments, medicine-use, labresults
* filter the patient treatments on a specific treatment
* join with medicine-use
* separately join patient treatments with labresults with patients
* filter labresults on certain types, for example Ht, Hb, Crea
* filter labresults on single result closest to patient treatments date
* pivot labresults from ""long format"" to ""wide format"" (i.e. one column per resultvalue of type Ht/Hb/Crea)

Part of our problem is that the data and queries are almost always different, due to the ad hoc nature of research, so we can't provide standard scripts. The example is labresults and medicine, but other times it could be medicalprocedures. questionnaires, height/weight, ECG data, lung spirometer, eye exams etc etc anything really, you name it.

Also there's high turnover among our users because of PhD students, short project contracts, parttime researchers etc. so while they do have some training with SPSS and Rstudio they're mostly non-technical users with limited coding skills.

All this to say; getting our users to write basic filter and join-scripts takes quite some effort, let alone the more ""advanced"" stuff like grouping or row-to-column pivoting. So I was wondering:

* Is there a tool or app that supports the workflow above in an intuitive/visual way? So not just writing code in R-studio or SPSS.

To be clear, I don't mean a data visualization tool for creating graphs. I mean like maybe the datasets are displayed as spreadsheet and then users do the filtering and joining using easy-to-use widgets. Or maybe all the operations are put together using visual blocks, similar to [Scratch programming](https://www.google.com/search?q=programming+scratch).

datascience,"Colleague codes in Google Docs and Sheets and does not believe in source control, causing conflict. Requesting advice.","Now that I have your attention, let me give a bit of context.

My team is responsible for validating a data migration. The schemas in the source and target systems are different and there are some other complicating factors, so the whole project is quite intricate. Team member 1 (T1) was responsible for writing a script to carry out part of this validation automatically. They were writing this script based on consultations with the data engineers and software engineers working on the migration.


Then the department head announced a big reorganization. T1 would be moved to another team under the same department, while two people from another team (T2 and T3) would join my team. T1 said they would finish their script before leaving the team, and train myself, T2, and T3 on how to run it and interpret the results.


However, things did not go so smoothly. As we began the training sessions, T1 told us that they hadn't been able to finish the script in time, and that they would explain to us how it works and how to finish it. T1 would do some parts, while T2, T3, and myself would handle other parts.


The first issue was that it was very difficult to follow the training sessions. T1 is just not good at explaining things. They are verbose and unclear, and so is their documentation. Their code is also very difficult to follow. The other issue is that a lot of the details of the migration only exist in T1's head. Their justification for this or that is often ""well I had a conversation with this engineer about it."" So it's hard to ascertain the reasoning behind many parts of the script, which then makes it impossible to finish it. T2, T3, and other colleagues have agreed with me on these points.


As the training sessions continued day after day, T1 would get increasingly snippy and passive aggressive with us when we asked questions. Put simply: it was not a positive learning environment.


Things really came to a head on Friday though. T1 has an unusual approach to developing their script. T1 keeps a master copy of the script on several tabs in a Google Sheet. When part of the script needs to be changed, T1 copies that part out into a Google Doc interspersed with instructions (the instructions aren't code or comments). Then T1 reviews the Google Docs, tests the code from them, copies chunk by chunk around the instructions, and pastes them back into the Google Sheet. T1 was having us follow this method to finish the script.


I think this approach is absolutely nuts. It's not reasonable to have 4 people working on a program without some form of version control in place, and Google Docs/Sheets are not good places for writing code. I copied the code from the Sheet into a GitHub repo and added T2 and T3 to it. 


I reached out to T1 and explained my position. T1 asked to talk to T2 and I on the phone. T1's view is that source control isn't appropriate for creating new code, only for maintaining existing code, and that it would only slow us down. ""I know what source control is. Check in, check out... yeah that's going to take forever.""


T1 also doesn't see an issue with coding in Google Docs/Sheets. I disagreed. T1 then got super passive aggressive and basically said they were going to stop helping to finish the script completely and focus on their new job.


I brought this up with my manager and explained everything. They agreed with me and are escalating to the department head. At this point I really don't want to work with T1 anymore. I would rather they finish the script on their own, or me, T2, and T3 do it on our own. The issue with the latter option is that the code is so difficult to follow, and so much of the knowledge to finish it only exists in T1's head, that I think we would have to start from scratch.

datascience,How do you diplomatically convince people with a causal modeling background that predictive modeling requires a different mindset?,"Context: I'm working with a team that has extensive experience with causal modeling, but now is working on a project focused on predicting/forecasting outcomes for future events. I've worked extensively on various forecasting and prediction projects, and I've noticed that several people seem to approach prediction with a causal modeling mindset.

Example: Weather impacts the outcomes we are trying to predict, but we need to predict several days ahead, so of course we don't know what the actual weather during the event will be. So what someone has done is create a model that is using historical weather data (actual, not forecasts) for training, but then when it comes to inference/prediction time, use the n-day ahead weather forecast as a substitute. I've tried to explain that it would make more sense to use historical weather forecast data, which we also have, to train the model as well, but have received pushback (""it's the actual weather that impacts our events, not the forecasts"").

How do I convince them that they need to think differently about predictive modeling than they are used to?",sowenga,1fwkupo,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fwkupo/how_do_you_diplomatically_convince_people_with_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fwkupo/how_do_you_diplomatically_convince_people_with_a/,2024-10-05 07:18:30,210,0.93,210,0,91,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1fwkupo
datascience,Ways of volunteering to teach stats? [Q],"


Hello, after my masters in stats I took up a job in data science. While it‚Äôs been fun working and the work is really interesting, part of me still craves keeping up with the stuff I learned in school. I currently do this by reading topics in statistics I never learned in school to keep my knowledge base wide, and revise old topics if need be (sometimes they come up in work).

But I feel if I was able to teach this material to someone, I‚Äôd be able to keep myself accountable to know it deeply. Like, yes I know the theory of the linear model reasonably well or I know hypothesis testing or time series well, but if I had to teach this to someone, I feel as though I‚Äôd be able to actually make sure I retain it for long term memory, because it‚Äôs not always where I‚Äôm actually thinking about this stuff at work.

One of the ways I thought of was volunteering to teach math to students. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd do this but I want a way to actually volunteer my time to do this, whether it be for some kind of cause, or just for someone who‚Äôs learning it. Also a way to kill time on the weekends. 

Anyone know of good ways to do this ?",AdFew4357,1fwd33p,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fwd33p/ways_of_volunteering_to_teach_stats_q/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fwd33p/ways_of_volunteering_to_teach_stats_q/,2024-10-04 23:37:07,9,0.8,9,0,35,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1fwd33p
datascience,Advanced LLM parsing is the key to advanced AI applications.,"In my experience, when people consider applying LLMs to a project they often fall into two camps:

1. they turn the project into a chat bot
2. they use an LLM for some key feature in a larger application, resulting in an error prone mess

there's tremendous power in using LLMs to power specific features within larger applications, but LLMs inconsistency in output structure makes it difficult to use their output within a programmatic system. You might ask an llm to output JSON data, for instance, and the LLM decides it's appropriate to wrap the data in a `\`\`\`json \`\`\`` markdown format. you might ask an LLM to output a list of values, and it responds with something like this:

    here's your list
    [1,2,3,4]

There's an infinite number of ways LLM output can go wrong, which is why output parsing is a thing.

I've had the best luck, personally, with LangChain in this regard. [LangChain's pydantic parser](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/output_parser_structured/) allows one to define an object which is either constructed from the LLMs output, or an error gets thrown. They essentially use a clever prompting system paired with the user's defined structure to coax the model into a consistent output.

That's not fool proof either, which is why it's a common practice to either re-try or re-prompt. You can either just re-prompt on a failure, or pass the response which failed to parse to the LLM again and ask the LLM to correct it's mistake. For robust LLMs this works consistently enough where it's actually viable in applications (assuming proper error handling). I made a post about [LangGraph](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fknbyi/langgraph_allows_you_to_make_falsifiable_testable/) recently, this can also be used to construct complex loops/decisions which can be useful for adding a level of robustness into LLM responses.

If you can learn how to consistently turn an LLMs output into JSON, there's a whole world of possible applications.

I'm curious what LLM parsing tricks you employ, and what you've seen the most success with!",Daniel-Warfield,1fw5k23,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fw5k23/advanced_llm_parsing_is_the_key_to_advanced_ai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fw5k23/advanced_llm_parsing_is_the_key_to_advanced_ai/,2024-10-04 18:01:29,36,0.81,36,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1fw5k23

datascience,Feeling Stuck in My Current Data Scientist Role,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently working as a Senior Data Scientist in Germany. I hold a PhD in Physics with a very high GPA, have completed all the relevant Coursera courses, and I‚Äôm in my mid-30s.

So far, things have been going well, but my job mainly involves visualizing data in Tableau and writing lengthy SQL queries. Recently, I‚Äôve been lucky to work on some GenAI projects, but that's still new territory for me.

I initially took this job because I was going through a tough time and needed an ""easy"" role. However, I‚Äôm now eager to change my job and take on more challenging opportunities. In my region, interesting job positions only become available every few months at most, which makes the search even more competitive and frustrating.

When applying for new positions, I sometimes get invited to interviews for high-skill roles that seem like a good fit. However, I struggle to talk about exciting achievements from my last three years. The GenAI/NLP projects I‚Äôve been involved in are quite recent (only about three months), and our team is limited by resources‚Äîsmall GPU, not enough data‚Äîso we can‚Äôt do things like training LoRA adapters for different use cases.

I feel stuck in underwhelming roles, and high-skill positions feel out of reach, even though I believe I could contribute effectively.

Additionally, I often find myself being too honest during interviews. When asked questions like what percentage of my daily job involves coding or about my expertise in NLP, I tend to share the full truth, highlighting my limitations.

**Has anyone experienced something similar or have tips on how to better present my skills and experiences during interviews without underselling myself?**

datascience,Any chance of salvaging this interview ?,"Had my 3rd round interview today which was a technical based. I guess it went ‚Ä¶ bad. It was with the vp of the company. It seemed like he had already made up his mind right at the beginning and felt like i was at an uphil battle. He didnt even know if I had any interviews before this and I told him i spoke to guy1(principal data engineer) and guy2(senior data engineer) Been working as data analyst for past 3 years and this is a data analyst/engineer position at a startup(which is quite big now) and the role is amazing int terms of growth opportunity, pay, culture, every aspect and I can thrive in it too imo.

He asked me about my resume then asked what is categorical data. I said in a diff tables categorised for diff information like student tsble, prof table. Then asked was I correct ? He said not quite. Its diff categories of prof tables . He then going thru resume and stuff was like this seems to be a mismatch for the role(it was not!) i said i had discussions eith guy1 and guy2 and role is 80-90% sql which ive been using past few years. He then shared a coderdata link to do a query. He could see what i type, but i couldnt run or test queries. I was trying to talk through my thought process through but he seemed uninterested. I did the query by the end when time ran out and he said i have to hop off. but whole time there was *less than smooth* communication. It was so frustrating.

Im thinking to reach out to recruiter and share my experience and if any possibility of another attempt. I dont have much hopes but might as well. This is disheartening as I shouldve been able to clear this smoothly but I was so forward to looking progress but its depressing bcs market is already so competitive and brutal.

I have grouped the data by date and merged them together. I chose to find the average survey score for each question to group by.

datascience,Best infrastructure architecture and stack for a small DS team,"Hi, I'm interested in your opinion regarding what is the best infra setup and stack for a small DS team (up to 5 seats). If you also had a ballpark number for the infrastructure costs, it'd be great, but let's say cost is not a constraint if it is within reason.

The requirements are:

* To store our repos. We can't use Github.
* To be able to code in Python and R
* To have the capability to access computing power when needed to run the ML models. There are some models we have that can't be run in laptops. At the moment, the heavy workloads are run in a Linux server running RStudio Server, which basically gives us an IDE contained in the server to execute Python or R scripts.
* Connect to corporate MS SQL or Azure SQL databases. How a solution with Azure might look like? Do we need to use Snowflake or Datababricks on top of Azure or would Azure ML be enough?
* Nice to have: to able to share bussiness apps, such as dashboards, with the business stakeholders.  How would you recommend to deploy these Shiny, streamlit apps? Docker containers using Azure or Posit Connect? How can Alteryx be used to deploy these apps?

datascience,What's the best way of keeping Miniforge up to date?,"I know this question hast been asked a lot and you are probably annoyed by it. But what is the best way of keeping Miniforge up to date?

The command I read mostly nowadays is:
```
mamba update --all
```

But there is also:
```
mamba update mamba
mamba update --all
```

Earlier there was:
```
(conda update conda)
conda update --all)
```

1. I guess the outcome of the `conda` command would be equivalent to the `mamba` command, am I correct?
2. But what is the use of updating `mamba` or `conda`, before updating `--all`?

Besides that there is also the `-u` flag of the installer:
```
-u           update an existing installation
```

3. What's the use of that and what are the differences in outcome of updating using the installer?

I always do a fresh reinstall after uninstalling once in a while, but that's always a little time consuming since I also have to do all the config stuff. This is of course doable, but it would be nice, if there was one official way of keeping conda up to date.

Also for this I have some questions:

4. What would be the difference in outcome of a fresh reinstall vs. the `-u` way vs. the `mamba update --all` way?
5. And what is the preferred way?

I also feel it would be great, if the one official way would be mentioned in the docs.

This question arose because Copilot worked surprisingly well for a problem involving large PDF documents, specifically finding information in a particular section that could be located anywhere in the document.

Given that Copilot doesn't have a public API, I'm considering using an open-source model like Llama for a similar task. My current approach would be to:

1. Convert the PDF to Markdown format
2. Process the content in sections or chunks
3. Alternatively, use a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach:
   * Separate the content into chunks
   * Vectorize these chunks
   * Use similarity matching with the prompt to pass relevant context to the LLM

However, I'm also wondering if Copilot simply has an extremely large context window, making these approaches unnecessary.",ImGallo,1fquxk7,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fquxk7/how_does_microsoft_copilot_analyze_pdfs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fquxk7/how_does_microsoft_copilot_analyze_pdfs/,2024-09-27 18:43:49,15,0.86,15,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,AI,self,t3_1fquxk7

These document sets consisted of documents which answered the same questions posed to the RAG systems, but also contained an increasing number of erroneous documents which were not relevant to the questions being asked. We tested 1k, 10k, 50k, and 100k pages and found some RAG systems can be upwards of 10% less performant on the same questions when exposed to an increased quantity of irrelevant pages.

Within this study there seemed to be a major disparity in vector search vs more traditional textual search systems. While these results are preliminary, they suggest that vector search is particularly susceptible to a degradation in performance with larger document sets, while search with ngrams, hierarchical search, and other classical strategies seem to experience much less performance degradation.

datascience,Ever run across someone who had never heard of benchmarking?,"This happened yesterday. I wrote an internal report for my company on the effectiveness of tool use for different large language models using tools we commonly utilize. I created a challenging set of questions to benchmark them and measured accuracy, latency, and cost. I sent these insights to our infrastructure teams to give them a heads up, but I also posted in a LLM support channel with a summary of my findings and linked the paper to show them my results.

A lot of people thanked me for the report and said this was great information‚Ä¶ but one guy, who looked like he was in his 50s or 60s even, started going off about how I needed to learn Python and write my own functions‚Ä¶ despite the fact that I gave everyone access to my repo ‚Ä¶ that was written in Python lol. His takeaway was also that‚Ä¶ we should never use tools and instead just write our own functions and ask the model which tool to use‚Ä¶ which is basically the same thing. He clearly didn‚Äôt read the 6 page report I posted. I responded as nicely as I could that while some models had worse accuracy than others, I didn‚Äôt think the data indicated we should abandon tool usage. I also tried to explain that tool use != agents, and thought maybe that was his point?

I explained again this was a benchmark, but he ‚Ä¶ just could not understand the concept and kept trying to offer me help on how to change my prompting and how he had tons of experience with different customers. I kept trying to explain, I‚Äôm not struggling with a use case, I‚Äôm trying to benchmark a capability. I even tried to say, if you think your approach is better, document it and test it. To which he responded, I‚Äôm a practitioner, and talked about his experience again‚Ä¶ after which I just gave up.

Anyway, not sure there is a point to this, just wanted to rant about people confidently giving you advice‚Ä¶ while not actually reading what you wrote lol.

datascience,Speculative Sampling/Decoding is Cool and More People Should Be Talking About it.,"Speculative sampling is the idea of using multiple models to generate output faster, less expensively than with a single large model, and with literally equivalent output as if you were using only a large model.

The idea leverages a quirk of LLMs that's derived from the way they're trained. Most folks know LLMs output text autoregressively, meaning LLMs predict the next word iteratively until they've generated an entire sequence. recurrent strategies like LSTMs also used to output text autoregressively, but they were incredibly slow to train because the model needed to be exposed to a sequence numerous times to learn from that sequence.  
  
Transformer style LLMs use masked multi-headed self-attention to speed up training significantly by allowing the model to predict every word in a sequence as if future words did not exist. During training an LLM predicts the first, second, third, fourth, and all other tokens in the output sequence as if it were, currently, ""the next token"".

Because they're trained doing this ""predict every word as the next word"" thing, they also do it during inference. There are tricks people do to modify this process to gain on efficiency, but generally speaking when an LLM generates a token at inference it also generates all tokens as if future tokens did not exist, we just usually only care about the last one.

With speculative sampling/decoding (simultaneously proposed in two different papers, hence two names), you use a small LLM called the ""draft model"" to generate a sequence of a few tokens, then you pass that sequence to a large LLM called the ""target model"". The target model will predict the next token in the sequence but also, because it will predict every next tokens as if future tokens didn't exist, it will also either agree or disagree with the draft model throughout the sequence. You can simply find the first spot where the target model disagrees with the draft model, and keep what the target model predicted.

By doing this you can sometimes generate seven or more tokens for every run of the target model. Because the draft model is significantly less expensive and significantly faster, this can allow for significant cost and time savings. Of course, the target model could always disagree with the draft model. If that's the case, the output will be identical to if only the target model was being run. The only difference would be a small cost and time penalty.

I'm curious if you've heard of this approach, what you think about it, and where you think it exists in utility relative to other approaches.",Daniel-Warfield,1fpyd6r,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fpyd6r/speculative_samplingdecoding_is_cool_and_more/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fpyd6r/speculative_samplingdecoding_is_cool_and_more/,2024-09-26 15:04:13,11,0.82,11,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1fpyd6r

datascience,I know a lot struggle with getting jobs. My experience is that AWS/GCP ML certs are more in-demand than anything else and framing yourself as a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù person is much better than ‚Äútech‚Äù,"Stats, amazing. Math, amazing. Comp sci, amazing. But companies want problem solvers, meaning you can‚Äôt get jobs based off of what you learn in college. Regardless of your degree, gpa, or ‚Äúprojects‚Äù. 

You need to speak ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù when selling yourself. Talk about problems you can solve, not tech or theory.

Think of it as a foundation. Knowing the tech and fundamentals sets you up to ‚Äúsolve problems‚Äù but the person interviewing you (or the higher up making the final call) typically only cares about the output. Frame yourself in a business context, not an academic one. 

The reason I bring up certs from the big companies is that they typically teach implementation not theory. 

That and were on the trail end of most ‚Äúmigrations‚Äù where companies moved to the cloud a few years ago. They still have a few legacy on-prem solutions which they need people to shift over. Being knowledgeable in cloud platforms is indispensable in this era where companies hate on-prem. 

IMO most people in tech need to learn the cloud.

datascience,"So, what it the future of AI Engineering for business GenAI use cases with features such as content embedding, RAG and fine tuning ?","I'm quite interested by the current trends about no code / low code GenAI :

* Models are becoming more versatile and multimodal = They can ingest almost any type of content / data
* Auto-embedding and Auto-RAG features are becoming better and more accessible (GPT Builder, ""Projects"" from Anthropic...), reducing the need for AI engineering, and with less and less limitations on the type and quantity of content that can be added
* Fine-tuning can be done directly by myself, the meta-prompts is added to the ""AI assistant"" with standard features

At the same time, I feel a lot of companies are still organizing their ""GenAI Engineering"" capabilities , still upskilling, trying not to get outrun by the fast pace of innovation &amp; the obsolescence of some products or approaches, and with the growing demand from the users, the bottleneck is getting bigger.

datascience,ML for understanding - train and test set split,"I have a set (\~250) of broken units and I want to understand why they broke down. Technical experts in my company have come up with hypotheses of why, e.g. ""the units were subjected to too high or too low temperatures"", ""units were subjected to too high currents"" etc. I have extracted a set of features capturing these events in a time period before the the units broke down, e.g. ""number of times the temperature was too high in the preceding N days"" etc. I also have these features for a control group, in which the units did not break down.

My plan is to create a set of (ML) models that predicts the target variable ""broke\_down"" from the features, and then study the variable importance (VIP) of the underlying features of the model with the best predictive capabilities. I will not use the model(s) for predicting if so far working units will break down. I will only use my model for getting closer to the root cause and then tell the technical guys to fix the design.

For selecting the best method, my plan is to split the data into test and training set and select the model with the best performance (e.g. AUC) on the test set. 

My question though is, should I analyze the VIP for this model, or should I retrain a model on all the data and use the VIP of this? 

As my data is quite small (\~250 broken, 500 control), I want to use as much data as possible, but I do not want to risk overfitting either. What do you think?

I'm building a model where my historical data that will be used in training is in a different resolution between actuals and forecasts. For example, I have hourly forecasted Light Rainfall, Moderate Rainfall, and Heavy Rainfall. During this same time period, I have actuals only in total rainfall amount.

Couple of questions:

- Has anyone ever used historical forecast data rather than actuals as training data and built a successful model out on that? We would be removed one layer from truth, but my actuals are in a different resolution. I can't say much about my analysis,but there is merit in taking into account the kind of rainfall.

- Would it just be better if I trained model on actuals and then feed in as inputs the sum of my forecasted values (Light/Med/Heavy)?

datascience,Classification problem with 1:3000 ratio imbalance in classes.,"I'm trying to predict if a user is going to convert or not. I've used Xgboost model, augmented data for minority class using samples from previous dates so model can learn. The ratio right now is at 1:700. I also used scale_pos_weight to make model learn better. Now, the model achieves 90% recall for majority class and 80% recall for minority class on validation set. Precision for minority class is 1% because 10% false positives overwhelm it. False positives have high engagement rate just like true positives but they don't convert easily that's what I've found using EDA (FPs can be nurtured given they built habit with us so I don't see it as too bad of a thing ) 

1. My philosophy is that model although not perfect has reduced the search space to 10% of total users so we're saving resources. 
2. FPs can be nurtured as they have good engagement with us. 

Do you think I should try any other approach? If so suggest me one or else tell me how do I convince manager that this is what I can get from model given the data.

datascience,Learning resources for clustering / segmentation,"Newbie to data analysis here. I have been learning python and various data wrangling techniques for the last 4 or 5 years. I am finally getting around to clustering, and am having trouble deciding which to use as my go to method between the various types. The methods I have researched so far:
- k means
- dbscan
- optics
- pca with svd
- ica

I like understanding something fully before implementing it, and the concept of hierarchical clustering is intriguing to me. But the math behind it, and with clustering methods in general (eg, distancing method for optics) I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around.

Are there any resources / short classes / YouTube videos etc that can break this down in simple terms, or is really all research papers that can explain what these techniques do and when to use em?

My problem is them not being ethical.

datascience,M1 Max 64 gb vs M3 Max 48 gb for data science work,"I'm in a bit of a pickle (admittedly, a total luxury problem) and could use some community wisdom. I work as a data scientist, and I often work with large local datasets, primarily in R, and I'm facing a decision about my work machine. I  recognize this is a privilege to even consider, but I'd still really appreciate your insights.

**Current Setup:**

* MacBook Pro M1 Max with 64GB RAM, 10 CPU and 32 GPU cores
* I do most of my modeling locally
* Often deal with very large datasets

**Potential Upgrade:**

* Work is offering to upgrade me to a MacBook Pro M3 Max
* It comes with 48GB RAM, 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores
* We're a small company, and circumstances are such that this specific upgrade is available now. It's either this or wait an undetermined time for the next update.

**Current Usage:**

* Activity Monitor shows I'm using about 30-42GB out of 64GB RAM
* R session is using about 2.4-10GB
* Memory pressure is green (efficient use)
* I have about 20GB free memory

**My Concerns:**

1. Will losing 16GB RAM impact my ability to handle large datasets?
2. Is the performance boost of M3 worth the RAM trade-off?
3. How future-proof is 48GB for data science work?

I'm torn because the M3 is newer and faster, but I'm somewhat concerned about the RAM reduction. I'd prefer not to sacrifice the ability to work with large datasets or run multiple intensive processes. That said, I really like the idea of that shiny new M3 Max.

For those of you working with big data on Macs:

* How much RAM do you typically use?
* Have you faced similar upgrade dilemmas?
* Any experiences moving from higher to lower RAM in newer models?

Any insights, experiences, or advice would be greatly appreciated.

datascience,"LangGraph allows you to make falsifiable, testable agents that are actually useful.","I recently had a conversation with the founder of Arize, an AI testing and observability platform. he said something interesting which I'll paraphrase:

""ReAct agents aren't successful in production because they're too vague. More constrained agents, like graph based agents, have been doing much better"". - [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N59Z7uJ8DDA&amp;list=PLPaLTf0W0L_P8p5GmJFBSwEIr0PinWPpH&amp;index=2)

talking about agents with a company focused in AI observability and testing was a breath of fresh air, and had me thinking of agents in a new and radical way: Like they're software which needs to be testable.

For those of you who don't know, LangGraph is a new set of tooling by LangChain which allows you to structure an agent as a directed graph. There are nodes which allow you to do operations, edges which allow you to chain operations together, and decision edges which allow you to make a decision based on some criteria. I think there are a few ways to actually make these graphs, but I'm only familiar with the ""state graph"", which allows you to define some state object (which is a dictionary with a bunch of default values) that gets passed around throughout the graph. This allows you to do things like:

* Keep track of the conversational flow
* Keep track of key parsed data
* Keep track of explicit application logic
* Work with stateless API setups, presumably, because the state is atomic and serializable
* Employ explicit programmatic steps in the conversation/process seamlessly.

Here's an example of a conversation with a graph based agent I created. Notice how well it marries strict programatic rules and strange conversational edge cases: something more loosely defined agents like ReAct struggle with.

The fact that this conversation is, under the hood, structured as a directed graph allows me to modify key points in the conversation explicitly, rather than contend with a single massive prompt which governs the whole conversation.

datascience,Polars + Nvidia GPUs = Hardware accelerated dataframes.,"I was recently in a secret demo run by the Cuda and Polars team. They passed me through a metal detector, put a bag over my head, and drove me to a shack in the woods of rural France. They took my phone, wallet, and passport to ensure I wouldn‚Äôt spill the beans before finally showing off what they‚Äôve been working on.

Or, that‚Äôs what it felt like. In reality it was a zoom meeting where they politely asked me not to say anything until a specified time, but as a tech writer the mystery had me feeling a little like James Bond.

The tech they unveiled was something a lot of data scientists have been waiting for: Dataframes with GPU acceleration capable of real time interactive data exploration on 100+GBs of data. Basically, all you have to do is specify the GPU as the preferred execution engine when calling .collect() on a lazy frame, and GPU acceleration will happen automagically under the hood. I saw execution times that took around 20% the time as CPU computation in my testing, with room for even more significant speed increases in some workloads.

datascience,"My path into Data/Product Analytics in big tech (with salary progression), and my thoughts on how to nail a tech product analytics interview","Hey folks,

I'm a Sr. Analytics Data Scientist at a large tech firm (not FAANG) and I conduct about \~3 interviews per week. I wanted to share my¬†transition to data science in case it helps other folks, as well as share my advice for how to nail the product analytics interviews. I also want to raise awareness that Product Analytics is a very viable and lucrative data science path. I'm not going to get into the distinction between analytics and data science/machine learning here. Just know that I don't do any predictive modeling, and instead do primarily AB testing, causal inference, and dashboarding/reporting. I do want to make one thing clear: This advice is primarily applicable to analytics roles in tech. It is probably not applicable for ML or Applied Scientist roles, or for fields other than tech. Analytics roles can be very lucrative, and the barrier to entry is lower than that for Machine Learning roles. The bar for coding and math is relatively low (you basically only need to know SQL, undergraduate statistics, and maybe beginner/intermediate Python). For ML and Applied Scientist roles, the bar for coding and math is much higher.¬†

Here is my path into analytics. Just FYI, I live in a HCOL city in the US.

**Path to Data/Product Analytics**

* 2014-2017 - Deloitte Consulting
   * Role: Business Analyst, promoted to Consultant after 2 years
   * Pay: Started at a base salary of $73k no bonus, ended at $89k no bonus.
* 2017-2018: Non-FAANG tech company
   * Role: Strategy Manager
   * Pay: Base salary of $105k, 10% annual bonus. No equity
* 2018-2020: Small start-up (\~300 people)
   * Role: Data Analyst. At the previous non-FAANG tech company, I worked a lot with the data analytics team. I realized that I couldn't do my job as a ""Strategy Manager"" without the data team because without them, I couldn't get any data. At this point, I realized that I wanted to move into a data role.
   * Pay: Base salary of $100k. No bonus, paper money equity. Ended at $115k.
   * Other: To get this role, I studied SQL on the side.
* 2020-2022: Mid-sized start-up in the logistics space (\~1000 people).
   * Role: Business Intelligence Analyst II. Work was done using mainly SQL and Tableau
   * Pay: Started at $100k base salary, ended at $150k through a series of one promotion to Data Scientist, Analytics and two ""market rate adjustments"". No bonus, paper equity.
   * Also during this time, I completed a part time masters degree in Data Science. However, for ""analytics data science"" roles, in hindsight, the masters was unnecessary. The masters degree focused heavily on machine learning, but analytics roles in tech do very little ML.
* 2022-current: Large tech company, not FAANG
   * Role: Sr. Analytics Data Scientist
   * Pay (RSUs numbers are based on the time I was given the RSUs): Started at $210k base salary with annual RSUs worth $110k. Total comp of $320k. Currently at $240k base salary, plus additional RSUs totaling to $270k per year. Total comp of $510k.
   * I will mention that this comp is on the high end. I interviewed a bunch in 2022 and received 6 full-time offers for Sr. analytics roles and this was the second highest offer. The lowest was $185k base salary at a startup with paper equity.

**How to pass tech analytics interviews**

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have much advice on how to get an interview. What I‚Äôll say is to emphasize the following skills on your resume:

* SQL
* AB testing
* Using data to influence decisions
* Building dashboards/reports

And de-emphasize model building. I have worked with Sr. Analytics folks in big tech that don't even know what a model is. The only models I build are the occasional linear regression for inference purposes.

Assuming you get the interview, here is my advice on how to pass an analytics interview in tech.

* **You have to be able to pass the SQL screen**. My current company, as well as other large companies such as Meta and Amazon, literally only test SQL as for as technical coding goes. This is pass/fail. You have to pass this. We get so many candidates that look great on paper and all say they are expert in SQL, but can't pass the SQL screen. Grind SQL interview questions until you can answer easy questions in &lt;4 minutes, medium questions in &lt;5 minutes, and hard questions in &lt;7 minutes. This should let you pass 95% of SQL interviews for tech analytics roles.
* You will likely be asked some case study type questions. To pass this, you‚Äôll likely need to know AB testing and have strong product sense, and maybe causal inference for senior/principal level roles.¬†[This article by Interviewquery](https://www.interviewquery.com/p/data-science-case-study-interview-questions#data-analytics-case-study-questions)¬†provides a lot of case question examples, although it doesn‚Äôt provide sample answers (I have no affiliation with Interviewquery). All of them are relevant for tech analytics role case interviews except the Modeling and Machine Learning section.

**Final notes**  
It's really that simple (although not easy). In the past 2.5 years, I passed 11 out of 12 SQL screens by grinding 10-20 SQL questions per day for 2 weeks. I also practiced a bunch of product sense case questions, brushed up on my AB testing, and learned common causal inference techniques. As a result, I landed 6 offers out of 8 final round interviews. Please note that my above advice is not necessarily what is needed to be successful in tech analytics. It is advice for how to pass the tech analytics interviews.

If anybody is interested in learning more about tech product analytics, or wants help on passing the tech analytics interview, just DM me. I wrote up a guide on how to pass analytics interviews because a lot of my classmates had asked me for advice. I don't think the sub-rules allow me to link it though, so DM me and I'll send it to you. I also have a Youtube channel where I solve mock SQL interview questions live. Thanks, I hope this is helpful.

datascience,UK job market coming from the USA?,"I may find myself in the position of moving from the USA to the UK in less than a year's time as my spouse is an academic who's going on the European (mostly UK) job market for academia.

I effectively have the equivalent of a 1st in both my undergrad (including a STEM major) and my MS (data science), as well as 2 years of non-DS experience and 1 year of DS experience. I'm not sure about the visa situation‚Äîeither HPI or some sort of arrangement as my partner's spouse‚Äîbut assuming I can secure some kind of working visa, I've no clue about the UK job market. 

I've searched this sub but there aren't many results. I've had a few random conversations here and there with UK pals and other people who say the market is overall better in the UK than in the US. Obviously that comes with a variety of caveats regarding quality of life, salary, etc., which I'm aware of so not worried about that. I've taken a peek at Linkedin UK and most jobs are naturally centred around London with a variety of remote/hybrid/on-site. Unless my partner somehow manages a good post in London, though, I expect we'll be living in the midlands or north to get away from the London cost of living...

Is the UK job market ""better"" than the USA in terms of time from first application to offer? I imagine part of the paradigm is that there are less candidates in competition as many are drawn to the USA's relatively fat checks.

datascience,Data Career Standstill - Which Path Would You Follow?,"Note - I live in Canada, we just don‚Äôt have a flair for that. 

Hello all,

I have an annual review in a little over a week and I'm feeling like my career path lacks direction. 

I've worked at my company for 3.5 years as a Data Migration Analyst, and was promoted to a Senior Data Migration Analyst about 8 months ago. My day-to-day generally involves:

* Migrating customer data to our software (working with SQL and JSON files)
* Attending daily Dev-Ops meetings and doing tasks in that area (ie. shell scripting, database management) on both AWS and Azure, although we are moving exclusively to AWS shortly 
* Lead a team of 3 other Data Migration Analysts
* Doing custom requests on customer DB's (SQL scripting for their large updates)
* Handle miscellaneous requests for other departments

I did my undergraduate degree in Data Analytics &amp; Finance, with minors in CS and IT. I also have a Masters in Data Science. 

My dilemma is that I feel that I am a master of none. I have a lot of general skills, such as SQL, Cloud Technologies and Database Management, but I'm not an expert. I also have a strong background in stats, ML and python/r programming from my undergrad/graduate degrees - all of which are not being used. 

I enjoy what I do, but I want to follow a path where I'll make more money and have hard skills that contribute to a strong resume. More importantly, I want a job that has strong prospects in the future as well. 

I'm currently trying to weigh my options:

1. Deep dive into cloud technologies and become an expert in cloud engineering or something along those lines
2. Improve my python programming skills and focus in data engineering
3.

datascience,Vagueness of job descriptions and data analyst/scientist roles.,"I imagine this is a question that depends massively on the industry, but I've been getting a lot of starkly conflicting advice lately.  A couple of people have absolutely shut down my suggestion that I go for data analyst type jobs fresh out of my PhD, saying that it's a sure-fire way to get stuck there. Others have said that getting an analyst job and taking on data science type tasks is the best route for someone with a more academic background.



The heavy overlap I'm seeing in job descriptions for analyst/data scientist roles is leaving me a little unsure what is the appropriate route to take.  I'm curious how people doing the hiring weigh the relative importance of skills like the ability to plan and execute a series of experiments, vs having experience in a big boy job that isn't academia.  Do you prefer someone who's had analyst roles first to prove they can actually work in a professional environment?

datascience,what are the best characteristics / behaviours in a manager that you know or have worked for (or even hypothetically you would like to see) in the data space,"So I have 6 years management experience but about to go into a role where I manage a LOT of people and management will be my main task (i.e. will be off the tools) so looking at being focused on being the best manager I can be. Have posted this in another (corporate) community but primarily interested in what the responses are from data scientists. FWIW Im not necessarily a DS have worked majority of the time in greenfield data teams where my role has been to set up nascent data teams that work across everything in the data continuum re Reporting/ dashboarding, analytics / insights (massively underrated and my favorite component tbh) and  data science / advanced analytics with the former and latter being project based and set and forget and analytics being a day to day function where we work closely with the business. Anyway that is just to say that Im a jack of all trades master of none and happy to be moving away from the programming side (which I think would be a minority view on this sub)



Anyway, personally my best manager was never there, gave us massive amounts of credit for work that we did (usually in a open forum) and autonomy to do the work as we wished. They were very good at their job I imagine as they would always drop in from time to time and ask good questions but were generally not really directly involved in the team in the traditional sense. Never really gave you work or delegated it but rather suggested what should be done or what would be 'cool' if it existed and hinted at it that way. Had a very intense manner about them but were also very passive as mentioned before. Also were very innovative in all aspects of their work and this extended to how they managed people. Two cool things that they implemented that were not related to work per se but for some reason really resonated and made it feel like the team was all about development and growth (which it was) were:

a) established an in-team book club whereby we would read a book per month and discuss over lunch

b) had about 20 direct reports but regardless of seniority set up a mentorship program for their DRs whereby he matched them with snr people that he had worked with in the past (think head of and above) and basically encouraged us to pick their brains etc.

Basically managed as if he wanted everyone to get promoted and replace him and even though my we worked in a technical area , he emphaisised the importance of soft skills, personal branding etc and always put people in a position to showcase themselves etc. Otherwise as mentioned was present at about 10% of our stand ups and I generally would not have been surprised if he was at the pub a decent chunk of the time, or working on presenting at various external showcases etc . Seems he was attendant at a lot of the day to day meetings between heads of to make the big decisions and was very much present for the team when it was needed that someone take the blame (which he himself wore).

I could imagine some people may find things like the book club cringe but they were done in such a way that showed that they were interested in our growth beyond work, and this made most of the team want to run through a wall for him.

Not only can I eventually deploy my ETL pipeline in EC2 in full, apparently it is cheaper to host a postgres database in EC2 compared to RDS.

I already know how to ssh into my EC2 instance from VS Code, but I need some pointers on best practices to set up my environment. 

EC2 instances come with Python 3.9 by default, but my personal project uses 3.12. After installing git on the EC2 instance, what is your workflow for setting up Python when you need a different version than the default? Based on my research, I have three options:
1. Manually install python and pip from yum, then create my virtual environment accordingly.
2. Install miniconda, then create my conda env accordingly.
3. Use docker, which I‚Äôve never used before.",tjcc99,1fd9xyh,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fd9xyh/to_aws_users_what_is_your_workflow_for_preparing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fd9xyh/to_aws_users_what_is_your_workflow_for_preparing/,2024-09-10 04:51:16,23,0.97,23,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Tools,self,t3_1fd9xyh
datascience,Suggest some youtube channels for videos during commuting ,"Hi. I am thinking of utilising 60mins of my daily commute for watching YouTube videos that teach - maths, analytics, data science, ml, ai, decision science, computer science etc. Maybe also some topics on big data, mlops, software development paradigms etc. 

Context - I've been working in this space for past 4+ years. These videos are going to serve the purpose of refresher material for me. So fun and engaging videos are preferred.

I've already shortlisted 3Blue1Brown playlists on calculus, linear algebra and neural nets.

datascience,"Is there a go-to Interview Prep for Data Science, preferably a mock Interview site?","I currently work as a data scientist and have an interview coming up at a company I really want to work at. I made it to the third round, which is basically 3 interviews back to back. 2 of them are technical, one of them is a coding interview. If I nail this, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll get the job and it would be life changing for me if I get this role. The problem is I‚Äôve been working in a niche area of data science for a few years and I‚Äôm not as quick with remembering some of the easy stuff as I did in the past that got me the job I have now. It‚Äôs all there though, I just need some feedback to remember what I‚Äôm missing, or what I would have said fresh out of school during an interview.

I‚Äôm pretty sure they will ask some of these questions for this interview because it seems to be a more traditional DS role than my current one. I just need someone to do a mock interview with. If there is a site that offers these services, I would be willing to pay to use it assuming the price is reasonable. Is there a site any of you have had good experiences with?

datascience,"Advanced Analytics for Stock Analysis? (AR-ARCH, Monte Carlo Simulation, etc.)","Many people say stock prices cannot be predicted, and I tend to agree. Still, I wonder if systematic strategies using advanced analytics methods can outperform a global portfolio (like an MSCI All-World ETF). Personally, I use a set of statistical methods to estimate stock returns, including Monte Carlo simulations, spline regression, and autoregressive models like AR-ARCH. I haven't become rich yet, though! üôÉ

I'd love to hear about any promising, potentially non-mainstream approaches within the realm of Data Science.

\*\* Update \*\*

Thanks for all the inputs! 

I think the Monte Carlo part needs a bit more clarification. I sample from the last few years of returns and apply them to a starting value of 100 across 100 iterations. I repeat this process many times to generate a distribution of returns. From that, I calculate metrics like the win-loss ratio and the expected value, which I use to compare stocks. In that sense, I do consider it a form of prediction, though it's more focused on assessing potential outcomes.

I also wanted to share that I don't believe there's one dominant method for predicting stock prices. Instead, I strongly believe that a combination of approaches‚Äîboth data-driven and others‚Äîis essential for performing well in the market.",aendien,1fbzoj2,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fbzoj2/advanced_analytics_for_stock_analysis_ararch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fbzoj2/advanced_analytics_for_stock_analysis_ararch/,2024-09-08 14:55:46,37,0.85,37,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1fbzoj2
