Physics,AI math ,"Hello I am working on a project and just curious if anyone knows how reliable AI engines like Chat GPT 4o or o1 are at calculating complex physics problems. If you gave them a theoretical framework, would you trust their ability to derive mathematical formulations based off said framework accurately or are these AI engines still too far behind in mathematics to take seriously. Thank you in advance, any input helps.
