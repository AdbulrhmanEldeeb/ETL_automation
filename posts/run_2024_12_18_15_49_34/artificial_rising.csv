artificial,AI and the climate: Why the evidence is flawed,"https://theconversation.com/will-ai-save-the-planet-why-the-evidence-is-flawed-240133

""Meanwhile, we should avoid lumping all kinds of AI together.

There are in fact diverse forms of AI: big, small, discriminative, generative, machine learning, symbolic and more. I can be excited about an AI that excels at counting carrots, and helps farmers to plant them more effectively, without offering a blanket endorsement of all AI systems.

There are different types of climate action too. Climate mitigation is about getting carbon emissions down to net zero to stop global warming. Climate adaptation is about learning to live and thrive in a warmer world. We need both.

AI for climate adaptation is very welcome indeed (say, helping us to increase carrot yields, despite more volatile weather). But it doesnâ€™t simply offset the carbon cost of AI. It would be like comparing apples with oranges (or carrots). Itâ€™s a tricky calculation to make, one with political and ethical dimensions.""",franciscrot,1hgxye8,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hgxye8/ai_and_the_climate_why_the_evidence_is_flawed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hgxye8/ai_and_the_climate_why_the_evidence_is_flawed/,2024-12-18 09:22:32,0,0.33,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1hgxye8
artificial,"Llama 3.3 better than 4o, o1","I have started myself to shift from ChatGPT models because now they have started to go out of context for no reason.

You ask them to make a summary of what we have discussed on this chat so far and it fails to note the important points.

And if the chat is pretty lengthy, it just dismisses and gets bizarre info out of it.

I think I smell the commercialness of it spreading across the room.
