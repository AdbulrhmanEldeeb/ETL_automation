webdev,Need your opinion ,"I've been tasked with creating a single-page website for a musician to showcase their music. As a developer, my focus lies more in building and coding than in intricate design.
In the past, I considered using a WordPress theme, customizing it to fit the musician's needs. However, recent concerns regarding WordPress's stability and maintenance have made me reconsider this approach.

I'm seeking recommendations for alternative platforms that offer a more manageable backend and CMS-like features. Ideally, I'm looking for a solution that simplifies the process of uploading and managing music files while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

My previous post didn't include the text (I switched from the Text to the Image tab while making a new post without checking to readd the text) so I'm making a new one to fix it! 

Sorry for all the inconveniences that I've caused!

I'm currently making a typing test website.

The words to be typed are formatted as a string of words in a box. I want to it so that when the user finishes typing a line, that line moves up, leaving space for the next lines.

I am currently using -webkit-line-clamp and overflow: hidden to force only 3 lines of text to show but I don't know how to detect when the user finishes typing a line.

I am thinking about whenever the user submits a word with ""Spacebar"", I check if the next word can fit into current line; if not, do the logic.

But I don't know where to start tackling this technically.

Any help is appreciated!

webdev,How much should I be paying my web developer?,"I am currently working on a cooking website, which is an online recipe book which hosts a variety of recipes, each with a video tutorial on how to make it. There will be around 300 recipes. The webdev is thinking of using Supabase for the backend, nextjs for the front end and an external video host like Vimeo for the videos.

But more importantly how long would this be expected to take?

Edit - I’m Leaning away from Wordpress since I see this as more of a SaaS web app compared to a static blog that hosts recipes. It’s more of an educational site where users learn specific skills in cooking through recipes which range through easy to hard. It won’t be completely static in the sense that it will be interactive through giving the user the ability to filter recipe difficulty, type, cuisine etc. So like a hybrid cooking course style site but much less structured.

A quick search shows they use react and redux. But so does the rest of the world, so I don't think the technology is to blame.

Where's the team located that maintains seller central? I hope someone notices this and gets their act together. This has to be one of the worst performing webapps I've used in a while.

I'm part of multiple Amazon seller groups, and so many people complain about this.

If anyone here works on this webapp, maybe you can share some insider scoop about why/how this application became like this. Sometimes it's hasty tech migration, sometimes spaghetti code, or bad practices, or lack of testing, or even political reasons like outsourcing to the wrong team,.... often more than one factor.

- free
- basic
- pro

Basically, when an SVG doesn't have a defined width and height, it will be drawn differently based on browser.


I reported this to OpenLayers ( [#16485](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/issues/16485) ) and they responded:



&gt; The svg is missing width and height properties. Browsers handle things differently when those are missing. This is not something we can influence in the library.

webdev,Why does using a styled component break the menu anchor?,"Hello, I am new to Material UI (MUI) and Styled Components and I am can't figure out why the following is happening.

**The Problem**

I have this very basic menu in my navbar basically copied from the MUI docs:

    &lt;div style={{ display: ""inline"", 
                  textAlign: ""right"", 
                  float: ""right"", 
                  padding: ""3px 0 0 0"" }}
    &gt;
        &lt;Button
          style={{ padding: 0, color: ""white"" }}
          id=""basic-button""
          aria-controls={open ? 'basic-menu' : undefined}
          aria-haspopup=""true""
          aria-expanded={open ? 'true' : undefined}
          onClick={handleClick}
        &gt;
          Welcome {props.firstName} {props.lastName}
          &lt;ArrowDropDownIcon style={{ paddingBottom: ""1px"" }} /&gt;
        &lt;/Button&gt;
        &lt;Menu
          id=""basic-menu""
          anchorEl={anchorEl}
          open={open}
          onClose={handleClose}
          MenuListProps={{'aria-labelledby': 'basic-button'}}
        &gt;
          &lt;MenuItem onClick={handleClose}&gt;User Profile&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
          &lt;MenuItem onClick={handleClose}&gt;Logout&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
        &lt;/Menu&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

This works exactly as you'd expect it to. Clicking on the button opens the menu and the menu is anchored to the bottom of the button.

But by changing this to a styled div, as follows:

        const StyledContainer = styled('div')({
            display: ""inline"", 
            textAlign: ""right"", 
            float: ""right"", 
            padding: ""3px 0 0 0""
        });

    &lt;StyledContainer&gt;
        &lt;Button
          style={{ padding: 0, color: ""white"" }}
          id=""basic-button""
          aria-controls={open ? 'basic-menu' : undefined}
          aria-haspopup=""true""
          aria-expanded={open ? 'true' : undefined}
          onClick={handleClick}
        &gt;
          Welcome {props.firstName} {props.lastName}
          &lt;ArrowDropDownIcon style={{ paddingBottom: ""1px"" }} /&gt;
        &lt;/Button&gt;
        &lt;Menu
          id=""basic-menu""
          anchorEl={anchorEl}
          open={open}
          onClose={handleClose}
          MenuListProps={{'aria-labelledby': 'basic-button'}}
        &gt;
          &lt;MenuItem onClick={handleClose}&gt;User Profile&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
          &lt;MenuItem onClick={handleClose}&gt;Logout&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
        &lt;/Menu&gt;
    &lt;/StyledContainer&gt;

This change now causes the menu to open on the far left of the screen when clicking the button (the button is on the far right of the screen). I have tried to look in the MUI docs and have searched Stack Overflow for why this might be happening but I can't figure it out.
