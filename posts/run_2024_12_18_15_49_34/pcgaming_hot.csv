pcgaming,"I just launched the demo for my base-builder, Final Outpost: Definitive Edition - run your town and defend it from hordes of zombies outside...","Hi everyone,

I started working on this hobby project in 2018, which I released as a super bare-bones MVP on the App Store in 2020. It kind of popped off (at least compared to my expectations). Since then while finishing university I have been working on the game during holidays with my brother and a couple of friends. We made a bunch of huge updates to the game and brought it to Android.

I decided to go full-time on the project with my brother last October and we've really increased the quality of the game since then so that it feels like a really polished professional project. That game has now reached 1M downloads on mobile.

But the thing is, it really feels like a game more suited to the PC audience. It never had gatcha mechanics, just a 'support the devs' selection of optional items to buy. The game was always fully playable for free. It's depth and complexity has now also reached the level where we feel like it's a game worthy of Steam.

So since June, we've been working on a new version with a bunch of new content, features and mechanics, including a trading system and a card-based meta progression. This new game is called Final Outpost: Definitive Edition and I just released the free demo on our Steam page.

Demo here! [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066310/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066310/)

Synopsis:

Final Outpost is a survival strategy base-builder where you lead the last survivors of the apocalypse. Build your Outpost, manage your citizens and defend against hordes of zombies. How many days can you survive?

pcgaming,1440p vs 4k - My experience,"I just wanted to give you my perspective on the 1440p vs. 4k debate. For reference, my build has a 3080 and a 5800X3D. This is pretty comprehensive of my experience and is long. TLDR at the end.

**Context:**  
So, I have been playing on a 27-inch 1440p 240hz (IPS) for years. I was an early adopter, and that spec cost me 700 bucks 4 years ago (just after I got my 3080), whereas on Black Friday this year, you could find it for 200 bucks. Recently, I decided to purchase one of the new 4k OLED panels - specifically trying both QD-OLED and WOLED tech, both of which are at 32-inch 4k 240hz, and with the WOLED panel having a dual-mode to turn into a 1080p 480hz panel (albeit a bit blurrier than proper 1080p due to a lack of integer scaling). I ended up settling on the WOLED as the QD-OLED panel scratched and smudged too easily, and I am moving in a few months. I do wish the WOLED was more glossy, but that's a topic for another time. I am using the WOLED 4k panel to evaluate the following categories.

**Image Quality:**  
For reference, with my 1440p monitor, if I were to outstretch my arm with a closed fist, it would touch the monitor, and with this 4k panel, I typically sit 1-2"" further. This is roughly 30""

When it comes to use outside of gaming, whether web browsing or general productivity, it is night and day. This is the first resolution I have used where you can't see jaggedness/pixelation to the mouse cursor. Curves in letters/numbers are noticeably clearer, and the image is overall much easier on the eye. Things like the curves in the volume indicator are clear and curved, with no visible pixel steps. 4k is a huge step up for productivity, and funny enough, the whole reason I wanted to upgrade was over the summer at my internship, our client had 4k monitors for their office setup and I immediately noticed the difference and wanted to try it for my at-home setup. If you code or are an Excel monkey, 4k is SO much better.

As for gaming, the image quality bump is substantial, but not quite as game-changing as it is with text and productivity use. My most played games in 2024 were Overwatch and Baldur's Gate 3, so I will be using those as my point of reference. In 1440p, I had to use DLDSR to downscale from 4k to 1440p in BG3 to get what I considered acceptable image quality, and figured that since I was doing that I might as well jump to 4k, so that's exactly what I did. Frankly, once you realize how blurry both native TAA and DLAA are on 1080p/1440p, you will never want to play that again. Of course, older games don't have this blur but in turn, look quite jagged. The pixel density of 4k serves as an AA all on its own. DLDSR is a cool tech but inconsistent in terms of implementation with different games, and you have a \~6% performance loss versus just playing at 4k due to DSR overhead.

I do want to note here that image quality is a lot more than just PPI. While 32"" 4k is only 25%-ish more ppi than 27"" 1440p, the added pixel count brings out a lot of details in games. In particular, foliage and hair rendering get WAY better with the added pixels.

**Performance:**  
It is no secret that 4k is harder to run than 1440p. However, the system requirements are drastically lower than people talk about online here. I see plenty of comments about how you need at least a 4080 to run 4k, and I think that is not the case. I am on a 3080 (10GB) and so far, my experience has been great. Now, I do think 3080/4070 performance on the Nvidia side is what I would consider the recommended minimum, a lot of which is due to VRAM constraints. On the AMD side, VRAM tends to not be an issue but I would go one tier above the 3080/4070 since FSR is significantly worse and needs a higher internal res to look good. Now, I know upscaling is controversial online, but hear me out: 4k@DLSS performance looks better than 1440p native or with DLAA. That runs a bit worse than something like 1440p w/ DLSS quality as it is a 1080p internal res as opposed to 960p, on top of the higher output res (A quick CP2077 benchmark shows 4k w/ DLSS balanced (EDIT:performance) at 77.42 fps whereas 1440p @ DLSSQ gives 89.42). Effectively, a 14% loss in fps for a MUCH clearer image. If you simply refuse to use DLSS, this is a different story. However, given how good DLSS is at 4k nowadays, I view it as a waste.

As far as competitive titles go, it depends on the game. I have played competitive OW for years and picked up CS2 recently. I am ok at OW (dps rank 341 and 334 in season 12/13 end of season, NA), and absolute trash at CS2 (premier peak 11k currently at 9k). I have recently moved to using Gsync with a system-level fps cap in all titles, as opposed to uncapped fps. Don't want to get into the weeds of that here but I do think that is the way to go if you have anything \~180hz or higher, though I admittedly haven't played at a refresh rate that low in years. CS2 can't quite do a consistent 225 fps (the cap reflex chooses when using gsync) at 4k with the graphics settings I have enabled, but it does get me very close, and honestly, if I turned model detail down it would be fine but I gotta have the high res skins. In OW2 with everything but shadows and texture quality/filtering at low, I easily get to the 230fps cap I have set. That being said, in OW I choose to use the 1080p high refresh mode at 450fps, whereas visibility isn't good enough in CS2 to do that. Not sure how some of those pros play on 768p, but I digress. At 1080p my 5800x3d can't put above \~360hz on CS2 anyways, so I play at 4k for the eye candy.

240hz to 480hz is absolutely and immediately noticeable. However, I think past 240hz (OLED, not LCD), you aren't boosting your competitive edge. If I was being completely honest, I would steamroll my way to GM in OW at 60hz after an adjustment period, and I would be stuck at 10k elo in CS2 if I had a 1000hz monitor. But, if you have a high budget and you don't do a lot of work on your PC and put a LOT of time into something like OW or CS, may as well get one of the new 1440p 480hz monitors. However, I would say that if over 25% of your gaming time is casual/single-player stuff, or over half of your time is spent working, go 4k.

**Price/Value**  
Look, this is the main hurdle more than anything. 4k 240hz is better if you can afford it, but if you don't see yourself moving from something like a 3060ti anytime soon for money reasons, don't! 1440p is still LEAGUES ahead of 1080p and can be had very cheaply now. Even after black Friday deals are done, you can find 1440p 240hz for under $250. By contrast, 4k 160hz costs about $320, and the LCD 4k Dual mode from Asus costs 430. My WOLED 4k 240hz was 920 after tax. While I think the GPU requirements are overblown as DLSS is really good, the price of having a ""Do-it-all"" monitor is quite high. I was willing to shell out for it, as this is my primary hobby and I play lots of twitch games and relaxed games alike, but not everyone is in the same financial position nor may not have the same passion for the hobby. Plus, if you have glasses, you could just take them off and bam, 4k and 1440p are identical.

**TLDR:**  
4k is awesome, and a big leap over 1440p. Text, web use, and productivity are way, way, way better on a 4k monitor, whereas for gaming it is just way better. I would say that to make the jump to 4k you would want a card with at least 10GB of VRAM, and with about a \~3080 in terms of performance. DLSS is a game changer, and even DLSS Performance at 4k looks better than 1440p native in modern games. For FSR you would probably want to use Balanced.

If you are still on 1080p, please, please upgrade. If you have 1440p but can't justify the $ to jump to 4k, try DLDSR at 2.25x render for your games. Looks way better, and can serve as an interim resolution for you, assuming your card can handle it.

pcgaming,What do you think the unique value proposition is going to be for the NVIDIA 5000 series?,"So it's pretty clear so far that the 5080 will have 16GB VRAM, with the 5070 going for 12GB VRAM.

I don't think NVIDIA will make any changes to these numbers.

So my question is what's the unique value proposition here? Some kind of DLSS 4 FG 2.0 which will be exclusive to the 5000 series?

I say this because the way communications have been going it seems like the best way to proceed as a consumer is as follows:

* Buy a 4050-up to-4080/4080super if you're buying into new gen GPUs/upgrading
* Buy a 4090 instead of a 5080 because the 5080 will probably not have that big of a difference and you get more VRAM with the 4090. Or wait for the 5080ti since that'll obviously have 24GB VRAM. At least I hope so.
* Buy a 5090 only if you are upgrading from a 4090 and want the best GPUs.

I'm gonna get a lotta hate but seeing arc b580 benchmarks with 9800x3d pisses me off. *Yes I know* it is done to find the absolute maximum performance of a gpu, so why does everyone do it?

pcgaming,Swen Vincke's (Baldur's Gate 3 Director) TGAs speech was remarkable,"Last night at The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, the director of Baldur's Gate 3 gave a shocking speech that put's many things into perspective about the video game industry.

This is what he said:

""The Oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by a studio, a studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage. It's stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost. Studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves. They created it because it hadn't been created before.

They didn't make it to increase market share. They didn't make it to serve as a brand. They didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if they didn't meet those targets.

And furthermore, the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design. They didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet. They didn't treat their players as users to exploit. And they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics.

They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow. They were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun. And they realized that if the developers didn't have fun, nobody was going to have any fun. They understood the value of respect, that if they treated their developers and players well, those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned. But above all, they cared about their game because they loved games. It's really that simple, said the Oracle.""

ü§î This reminds me of a quote I heard from David Brevik, the creator of Diablo, many years ago, that stuck with me forever, in which he said that he did that game because it was the game he wanted to play, but nobody had made it.

‚ùå He was rejected by many publishers because the market was terrible for CRPGs at the time, until Blizzard, being a young company led by gamers, decided to take the project in. Rest is history!

‚úÖ If anybody has updated insight on how to make a game described in that speech, it is Swen.

I played valorant, I played PUBG,I even played Blox fruits on roblox etc etc. But now i just cannot enjoy them anymore.  
I tried new games like fortnite and rocket league and league of legends, but there are already too many sweats in this game, and i dont want to contribute a sh\*t load of my time trying to also be a sweat.. i tried gta v, but it feels like everything is pre-decided here.. feels more like im watching a m0vie than playing a game.. I tried genshin impact but i dont even know what i am supposed to do, and the story doesn't enter my brain i dont know why.. I feel like every game is boring..  
Maybe im not the type of guy cut out for gaming?  
maybe im viewing things from a different angle?  
maybe i haven't tried some actually better games?

i don't even know what im expecting from this post.. but there's that.. im posting it now..",Brilliant_Warning_1,1hf8r7a,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hf8r7a/why_is_gaming_not_fun_anymore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hf8r7a/why_is_gaming_not_fun_anymore/,2024-12-16 02:15:35,0,0.17,0,0,58,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hf8r7a

pcgaming,Beware ordering items from Max Gaming (international reseller),"Hi all,

Like many, I was intrigued by the appearance of new lightweight high performance mice that have cropped up recently.

I was building a new PC, so ordered a Santali S1-O from [Maxgaming.com](https://us.maxgaming.com/)

Despite having a US prefix on their website URL, they are in fact based in Sweden, and will ship any orders internationally.

So far, everything seems fine, right? The internet is international, and borders are such a 20th century conceit.

However, the problem arose when things did not work according to plan.

According to the carrier (DHL Express), the package was delivered to my mailbox on Monday.

However, my mailbox was empty when I checked it, and neither my condo office nor the package locker had any packages in my name.

When I contacted Maxgaming, their response was that since the package was shipped internationally, and the carrier reported it as 'Delivered', there was nothing for them to do.

No refund, no resend, not even an attempt to contact the carrier to confirm receipt of delivery.

I was just supposed to eat up the item and delivery charge and have nothing to show for it, like a chump (my words, not theirs).

It's not egregious to describe this situation as 'Extremely Unprofessional'. A legitimate business should have the means to ensure safe delivery of purchased items to the consumer, and to resolve disputes with the carrier if things go south on delivery. ""Tough luck, you're SOL"" is not an acceptable means of doing business, especially in the long term. 

Consumer Protection Laws in the US protect me from being charged for items I have paid for but did not receive.

I have filed a dispute claim with Paypal and with my bank, and hopefully they will b able to resolve matters on my behalf.

But in the meantime, a cautionary tale to people who may be tempted by the low prices and deals at maxgaming. You get what you pay for, and sometimes, you don't.

pcgaming,Did PC gaming use to not be very popular in some parts of the world?,"Hello everyone. I am Polish. I have been playing on PC since I was a kid. It seems to me that Poland is predominantly a country that games on PC. I have always believed that PC gaming IS the default way to game.

However, it appears to me that this probably hasn't been the case in other countries?

As an example, Americans pretty much only refer to games made between 2000 and 2011 as, ""a PS2 game"" or ""an Xbox 360 game"" even if said game had a PC release. Most of the discourse regarding gaming around that time revolves around the PS2, the 360, the GameCube, etc.

Also, most Americans seem to know console games like Ocarina of Time (which I will admit I have no clue what that game even is) but they probably have no idea what games like Baldur's Gate or Baldur's Gate 2 are, because they released on PC.

pcgaming,Our World War II airbase builder got a new demo with new major features,"Hello r/pcgaming, my team and I are making a base builder set on World War II military airfields, called [Ground of Aces](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/). In this game, you build your own air base, manage your ground crew and aircraft, and send your pilots out on missions.

And we just released a **major update for our**[ **demo on Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/) with new features and content.

The key updates are:

* Four new aircraft: Avro Lancaster, Bristol Blenheim, Bristol Beaufighter, Gloster Gladiator
* Expanded mission systems with new missions and mission types
* Plane maintenance system, incl. fuel as a new resource, multi seat plane logic and pilot class and task system
* New metal building blocks for hangars, fences, fuel tanks
* Gardening system that lets you grow plants and harvest your own food
* and many more improvements

Play the demo here:[ https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground\_of\_Aces/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/)

Here is an overview video of the new Alpha 3 features:[ https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R](https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R)

As a big fan of base building games like Rimworld and as a World War II aviation nerd, this is a passion project for me. Almost 10 years ago, I had the idea of a base builder game set on World War II airbases, and it feels unreal to see this idea coming to life now and have people play this alpha version of the game.

We are in the alpha phase of development, so everything is still a work in progress. It would be **great to hear your opinion and feedback about the demo**. Is it satisfying to collect resources and build your first structures? How long did you play and how big did your air base get? Anything in particular you like/dislike about the experience? Getting early feedback helps the ongoing development and will make the game better for everyone.

pcgaming,"Ubisoft, Why Do Your Games Stop Working After a Year?","I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm absolutely done with Ubisoft. Over the years, I‚Äôve spent hundreds‚Äîprobably thousands‚Äîof dollars on their games. I‚Äôve built a library of some of their best franchises: *Assassin‚Äôs Creed*, *Far Cry*, *Watch Dogs*. These are games I *wanted* to love, games I poured hours of my life into. But what‚Äôs the point of owning them when they just stop working after a year?

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve dealt with repeatedly:

* **Ubisoft Connect**: More like Ubisoft *Disconnect*. Every other update breaks something. Games that ran fine one day refuse to launch the next, and troubleshooting is like banging your head against a wall.
* **DRM Nonsense**: I‚Äôve paid for these games‚Äîfull price in most cases‚Äîand yet they can‚Äôt verify licenses? How does that even happen? Why do I feel like a pirate for trying to play games I legally own?
* **Servers, Servers, Servers**: Why does every Ubisoft game, even the single-player ones, seem to rely on servers? And when those servers inevitably go down or get shut off, good luck trying to access your progress or even start the game.
* **Updates That Break Everything**: Instead of fixing bugs, updates sometimes *add* new ones. Or they tank performance, making games unplayable. I shouldn‚Äôt have to *fear* clicking ""Update.""

And just when I thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse, in the past month alone, I‚Äôve lost access to *Ghost Recon Breakpoint*, *For Honor*, and even *Battlefield 1* and *Battlefield 2042*. That‚Äôs FOUR games I can no longer launch no matter what I try. At this point, it feels like a ticking time bomb before the few games I still have that work also join the pile of dozens that don‚Äôt.

Speaking of Battlefield, let me throw EA into the mix, too. Their games are plagued by the *same* issues: DRM problems, launcher headaches, server reliance, and updates that break what didn‚Äôt need fixing. It feels like these companies are competing to see who can frustrate their customers more.

And what‚Äôs with the unnecessary third-party launchers? If I bought a game on Steam, I should be able to launch it *from Steam*. Why do I need Ubisoft Connect or EA Play or whatever other launcher shoved down my throat? It‚Äôs clunky, unreliable, and adds yet another layer of potential failure. Enough is enough!

It‚Äôs not just their old games, either. Ubisoft‚Äôs new games have been circling the drain in terms of quality. Remember when their titles felt groundbreaking and polished? Now it feels like every new release is rushed, bloated with microtransactions, or half-baked. They‚Äôre more focused on squeezing money out of players than creating games that work reliably or stand the test of time.

I‚Äôm tired of wasting my time, energy, and money trying to keep Ubisoft games functional. Gaming is supposed to be fun‚Äînot a second job where I‚Äôm troubleshooting errors or waiting on forums for a patch that may never come.

At this point, I‚Äôve made up my mind: I‚Äôm not buying another Ubisoft or EA game. Not now, not ever. What‚Äôs the point of owning their games if I can‚Äôt trust them to work a year down the line? Why should I invest my money in companies that clearly don‚Äôt care about their customers once they‚Äôve made the sale?

And I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.

* Have you had your games just stop working randomly?
* How do you deal with DRM, launcher issues, and server reliance?
* Do you feel like these companies are prioritizing cash grabs over long-term quality and support?

Honestly, Ubisoft (and EA), get your act together. You‚Äôre making incredible games‚Äîwhy are you ruining them with this garbage? You‚Äôre alienating loyal customers like me who actually *want* to support you.

I‚Äôm fed up, and I‚Äôd love to hear from others who‚Äôve been through the same thing. Is it just me, or are these companies actively driving away their fanbase with these problems?

Thanks for reading. I needed to vent.

  
**Edit:** 

Hey everyone, thanks for contributing to this discussion I want to make a few things clear. After reading through the comments it's became apparent that a lot of people haven't experienced the same kind of issues I have in relation to games completely not working. I'd like to say that it was not my belief that this issue was common to many people however in my mind that still does not throw out the other points that I do believe are common issues that have always plagued the gaming landscape, however I felt that specifically Ubisoft and EA tend to have the most issues. 

I understand that I may have upset many people by posting this which was not my intention. It's hard to see this as anything other than rage bait or farming karma since I provided no real solutions to any of the problems I listed. I've also aggravated some people who noticed that this wasn't my own original words and that I used ChatGPT to generate a lot of this content. These are all true and I can not deny them, however despite my shortcomings I still believe in everything I posted here and I hope one day things will change. 

I could have done a better job at putting more effort and time into this post, but at the time I was simply fed up with having the same experience over and over again. I've kept my mouth shut about this and figured it had been beaten to death already, but for some reason I finally felt enough of a push to post about it. 

Even if this hasn't changed any bodies perspectives, I'm glad to see I'm not the only person who's had terrible experiences with these game companies. 

And again thanks to everyone who contributed to this discussion, no matter the side taken.

pcgaming,Did I just get older or have things changed?,"I'm sure my experience mirrors others. When I was a kid, I trusted the Ubisoft logo. Prince of Persia, Hawx 2, Blazing Angels, and Just Dance, to name a couple of the ones i played on the family Wii. Granted, i was a child and not the best judge of games, but I had fun with all of those and that's what games are for. Nowadays that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Skull and Bones, which i thankfully avoided buying altogether when reviews were less than stellar. Shame the tailers made it seem like exactly my type of game, i LOVED Sea of Thieves. 

Most of the recent Assassin's Creed games selling permanent double money and experience points (imo should not have even been offered, if the feedback you get from testers is that progression is too slow, it's scummy to sell a solution). Did the fact that they sell those boosters spoil my enjoyment of Oddysey/Valhalla? Mostly no, but I was far more conscious of the fact I COULD be progressing faster like my friend who bought them. We would play the game on a voice call, share loot locations and strats, it became frustrating hearing the things I couldn't access because of my low level. 

Games like Call of duty seem to be slowing the progression of the battle passes to get you to play their game and ONLY their game if you want to reach the top tier within the time limit. Could be just placebo, unsure how true this is.

As I said above, I'm not alone in feeling this way. A few of my friends share my sentiment. It's not only Ubisoft that does this, they're just a prime example. Create a problem and sell a solution is a great business move, but shitty for consumers.",dadodavedude,1h9z4hz,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,2024-12-09 02:09:27,0,0.24,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9z4hz

pcgaming,Bad optimization vs poor optimization the real reason.,"This is not asking for tech support or providing it, please don't auto delete this mods :-)



There's this age old argument of whether games are optimized well or not by developers and I think I have the simple answer that I don't see being talked about. It maybe so obvious that it doesn't need mentioning, but then again it may be so obvious that no one sees it.

Since the PS3/360 generation of gaming fidelity became more important to developers than fluidity and response time. If optimized well 30 frames per second (33.3ms) 6ft from your TV with a wireless controller could be satisfying and to those new to gaming that generation is was just normal. In the PS3/360 era, PC gaming was just a drop in the bucket of the market share too. Every generation there's a leap in fidelity potential and despite the demand for 60fps on consoles it was always an after thought until this generation. Now it's kind of a frustrating joke.

Because games are still being made with a render bandwidth of 33.3ms at the base level, that's where the majority of games start. For those who don't understand, developers know at 30fps they have 33.3ms to render a frame which is double the amount of time (bandwidth) to render 60fps (16.6ms.) So they design and optimize the game around the flexibility that 33.3ms provides. If a game like that sticks to a solid 30fps it is actually optimized well and functioning as intended.

But enter performance mode though... All modern performance modes are doing is trying to scale back the fidelity on a surface level usually just by cutting back on the resolution and level of detail. But with games full of lighting, Ray Tracing and effects based around using all 33.3ms of render time your CPU has available 60fps is just not possible for most CPUs.

Some games however are designed to run within a 16.6ms render time on console, usually less graphically intensive games. But sometimes we get standout games like the new Indiana Jones, CoD (I don't like CoD but it performs very well,) Hogwarts Legacy (had some PC issues at launch, but super optimized for a UE4 game,) Dragon Age 4, Helldivers 2, Evil West, Stellar Blade (proof will be in the PC launch,) and Resident Evil 4 Remake to name a few.

The list of games that run a 30fps well and not 60fps is much longer, but there's a few games that have issues that don't even stay at 30fps.

We also have the new standard emerging that is 40FPS/25ms which feels so much better than 30fps but not at good at 60fps. Maybe that's a new baseline we should hope for going forward? But it only works if you have a 120Hz display. But if they target 25ms render time it provides a potential Frame Interpolation (Frame Generation) target of 80fps/12.5ms which can feel like 60fps. I could live with that instead of being stuck at using FG to go from 30fps to 60fps on PC. But I'd prefer if developers would push the limits and figure out how to best utilize 60fps/16.6ms.

I believe poor optimization is when games crash and or can't hit their intended target framerate (which is rarely 60fps) and bad optimization is the unwillingness to give gamers what we've wanted for 3 console generations now which is 60fps. I honestly don't care about 4K, render to a super clean 1080p or 1440p and bilinearly upscale with the GPU - go play TLOU Remastered on a PS5 and tell me if you can really see a difference between performance or fidelity modes. Poor PC port though, that was just a botched/rushed job. But this 4K and faux 4K (FSR - looking at you) is stealing precious render time that could be spent making the game more stable.

pcgaming,is it common to lose interest in a game after completing the main storyline?,"I'm honestly new to playing modern AAA games, I used to watch gameplay videos a lot but now that I have somewhat of a proper rig to game on, I noticed that I lose interest in games after the main story. when the main story is still ongoing I do the side missions and stuff a lot, I like it then but once the story concludes I don't want to do the side missions anymore, maybe I feel like there are too many other good games to dive into to waste my time on side missions after the main game ends? Also, I feel a bit sad when the main story ends, which is of course a common thing for everyone when something they like comes to an end.

I recently played Arkham Knight and I haven't seen the knight fall protocol in action yet as I lost interest after the identity reveal. And I just finished Spiderman 1, it's 70 completed and now I'm downloading the Miles Morales one. I really liked the Spiderman game maybe even more so than Arkham Knight.

pcgaming,Ink. - All that glitters is not gold - Just got its first big update releasing Chapter 3 on Steam!,"Hi! I'm one of the (two) developers of Ink. a colorful roguelike singleplayer/coop adventure, and I just wanted to announce that today our game just got its first big update after the early access launch on Steam. I am still actively developing the game, but everything is in a really solid state currently.

**To make it short, what is Ink. ?**  
Ink. is the story of a little boy named Liam. Liam lives in a small country house with his grandfather. His parents separated some time ago, due to his father's violent behavior. Liam often misses his mother, since she works as a stewardess for an airline. Liam spends his days drawing in a book, the Ink. book that his mother gave him for Christmas some time ago, together with a stuffed cat named Spok, the protagonist of his drawn adventures.

In Ink. you will face various chapters, in which there are many different enemies and bosses to defeat. During your adventure you will collect cards and powers that can synergize with each other creating combinations of unique effects.  
The peculiarity of this game is precisely the ink: the drops that you can collect will be your lifeblood, and the same can be used to strengthen yourself, but putting you at risk, or as a bargaining chip with other characters that you will meet during your adventure.

We've been working on this for almost 3 years now, and there's truly so much to discover in this game, all the details that makes every game unique. I hope you find some time to check it out and let us know your impressions.  
In the future you can expect regular updates of new chapters (there are 9 planned in total, some of them are almost already completed) and many enemies, cards, effects but also original soundtracks and if the interest is high even a cartoon for the intro (it costs a lot to do this, unfortunately).

Thank you for your attention, I'll leave you with some links:

**Tips to get the best suggestions**

* Be detailed! If you're looking for a roguelike, say that. If your game must include zombies, you should probably mention that. The more detailed you are the better the recommendations will be.
* Are you limited by PC specifications or a budget? That's all good stuff to include.
