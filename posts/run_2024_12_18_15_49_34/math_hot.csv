math,US vs EU (Bonn) graduate progams,"I've been looking at the course offerings for the first two 'masters' years of a standard US maths PhD and comparing them to courses offered at a top European university, specifically the University of Bonn. I'm a prospective maths grad student.

It looks to me that there are significantly more courses and many more advanced courses, at Bonn when compared to US universities. Here is the [course handbook of Bonn](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/studium/medienordner-studium-1/dateien/po-modulhandbuch/mscmath-modulhandbuch.pdf). Finding course schedules for US schools is a bit more difficult, but generally I see fewer options.

Is this an accurate representation of the difference in course offerings of top math graduate schools in the EU vs US? Is Bonn an outlier for this?

math,Learning advice,"Hi all. 

I’m 32 years old, mechanical engineering student. The last time I study math was probably 12 years before committing to the course in September this year. This is the first year and I have huge doubts if I’m capable of making it. 

I never been good at math, poor teaching, poor resources etc., and at some point I gave up even trying.

I have big math test tomorrow that I know I fail. There is no doubt about it. There will be one last chance in May, but other than that, that’s it. 

The test tomorrow will cover subjects such as functions, vectors, complex numbers, matrices, differation, integration and statistics. 

I’m fairly comfortable with matrices, statistics and vectors. 

It just feels from the begging of the course like I’m lacking basic knowledge to even progress further, and that demotivating feeling of failure keeps me company from the very start. 

Fact that I’m study in English, not being native English speaker probably makes things more complicated as well. 

I’m seriously considering withdrawing or switching to the different course because of that, actually this is one of the many reasons but weights the most. 

How would you recommend approaching this? Should I give up on test tomorrow and take a huge step back?

math,Noether normalization lemma proof (Nagata),"I think I understand the statement at an intuitive level now.  Let me know if this is the right way to think about it!

For a field k, a k-algebra on n generators A = k\[x\_1,...,x\_n\] can be ""factored"" into a two-stage extension of k, with each stage having a finiteness property:

1. By extending k as a ring to B = k\[x\_1',...,x\_m'\] \\cong k\[X\_1,...,X\_m\] for a finite collection x\_i \\in A for some 0 \\leq m \\leq n, and then 

2. By extending B as a module to get A (i.e., there's a finite collection y\_1,...,y\_r \\in A such that every element of A can be written as \\sum b\_iy\_i for b\_i \\in B.

It's like the dimensionality of A is m, but you can add a ""fudge factor"" of this module-finite extension on top of that.

It seems like a really natural statement, but the standard proof by Nagata is horrendous.  I'm reading it in Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, and he has a way of brushing details under the rug, but even then, it's a complicated construction.  

I roughly understand that it's doing a change-of-variables and I learned that there's a nice geometric interpretation of getting ""m-dimensional"" affine varieties in A\^n to project to A\^m with finite fibers by changing the coordinate axes.

Can someone explain where the intuition of the Nagata proof comes from?  The proof makes it look like an ugly ""technical lemma"", even though the statement seems to be fundamentally important for algebraic geometry.  Are there cleaner proofs?

math,Post-Baccalaureate Mathematics Programs. Looking at Brandeis &amp; Tufts; looking for more good options?,"I'm interested in quantitatively oriented master's and PhD programs, but I've only taken Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Intro to Proofs in undergrad. Some programs I'm interested in have additional prerequisites such as Probability, Differential Equations, and/or Real Analysis. If not, I understand that I'm at a disadvantage to Math Majors and minors for my regular coursework that relies on advanced mathematical concepts if they've seen the material before. 

Most masters' have few electives, or the math would be too spread out for me to take advantage of them early in a program, so I'm very interested in getting as much math out of the way beforehand as possible.

  
I'm aware of Brandeis and Tufts math post-bacc programs, which appear to be fairly reasonable on cost. I can also get 4-6 courses done in 1-2 semesters and/or summer which is preferable so I could potentially still do a fall entry next year for a quant masters program (Brandeis looks like it's probably out for this plan). 

I'm interested in thoughts on these programs if you've done them/reviews, or whether you were able to find better options, since I'm really looking for the best bang for my buck on this program since it's not going to be my last educational program, but I also want to be strongly qualified and comfortable with math for my masters degree. 

I strongly prefer in person since I've been out of school for several years and want access to TAs/professors. I'm interested in hearing if online coursework has worked for you all, and if you would have done it again or differently/how many courses you took online at the same time.

math,Intuition behind the definition of MCD as the sum of ideals in principal ideal domains.,"In my Algebra/Number theory course we have defined the MCD (only in PIDs) as the generator of the sum of ideals, meaning: 
MCD(a,b) = M  &lt;=&gt; (a)+(b) = (M),

where MCD means maximum common divisor and parenthesis denote the ideal generated by that element. 
I don't understand how this definition relates to the MCD in integers. If I take ax+by, why should that be a multiple of the MCD?? We have then used this for Bezout's identity and to solve diophantine equations in PIDs so it's pretty crucial.  

I also don't completely get why the mcm (minimum common multiple) is the intersection of ideals, in particular the inclusion (a)∩(b) ⊆ (m), where m = mcm(a,b).
If a number is a multiple of both a and b, why should it be a multiple of their mcm??

math,Math puzzle: Move the tower,"French mathematician Édouard Lucas was born in Amiens in 1842 and died in Paris 49 years later. He wrote the four-volume work *Recréations Mathématiques*, which became a classic of recreational mathematics. In 1883, under the pseudonym “N. Claus de Siam” (an anagram of “Lucas d’Amiens”), he marketed a solitaire game that he called the Tower of Hanoi.

He claimed that the game was a simplified version of the so-called Tower of Brahma. In this supposed legend, monks had to move a tower made of 64 golden disks in a great temple. Before they could complete this task, however, the temple would crumble to dust, and the end of the world would arrive.

The Tower of Hanoi consists of a small board on which three identical cylindrical rods are mounted. On the left rod there are five disks of different sizes with a hole in the middle. They are ordered by size, with the largest disk at the bottom. The goal of the game is to move all the disks from the left rod to the right rod in as few moves as possible. In each move, only one disk can be taken from one rod and placed on another rod, and a larger disk can never be placed on a smaller disk. How many and which moves are necessary to transport the disks?

math,Proof by induction in algebra,"Is it just me or is proof by induction the single most common proof technique used in abstract algebra, at least at the late undergrad/early grad level?

I saw it quite a bit when I was teaching myself Galois theory, where I often saw the trick of applying the induction hypothesis to a number's (e.g., the degree of a splitting field) proper factors.  

Now, as I'm learning commutative algebra, it seems like every other theorem has a proof by induction.  I'm spending the afternoon learning the proof of the Noether normalization lemma, and of course, it's another inductive proof.

I never realized that induction was such an important proof technique.  But maybe it's because of the ""discreteness"" of algebra compared to analysis?  Come to think of it, I can't think of many proofs in analysis where induction plays a big role.  One that I could remember was the proof in Rudin that nonempty perfect sets are uncountable, which has an inductive construction, but I'm not sure if that strictly counts as a proof by induction.",WMe6,1hf2wss,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf2wss/proof_by_induction_in_algebra/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf2wss/proof_by_induction_in_algebra/,2024-12-15 21:30:26,71,0.96,71,0,22,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hf2wss
math,How logic is the use of Hom(C) to refer all the morphisms defining a Category.,"I'm studying Category Theory and one of the starting issues is the notation. The several objects inside a category C are referred to jointly as obj(C), which is just nice. Now, the morphisms of the same category (for ""historical reasons"" and similarity to ""abstract algebra"") are referred to by Hom(C), something that I really hate will all my hearth as the morphisms are (themselve) DEFINING the structure. They are not ""preserving or being homologue"" to anything..they are defining the thing. When the term homomorphism is applied to functor, I find it perfectly logical, but when MANY authors simply use Home(C) for referring all morphisms at once, is feel they are ""smuggling"" homo-structural claim that I feel are too ""early"". How can one be ""homo-logue"" to something while the thing is being just created and receiving and identity JUST there with the morphisms. It's like saying ""a brick preserves the structure of a wall""...well, no..what wall... a ""brick is composing the wall itself"" not preserving any structure of any other magical wall, it is creating the structure.

I’m just a simple person who enjoys mathematics in my free time, and I’d like to share my two-part video series (with more planned) where I talk about the world of finite calculus, focusing on understanding the essence of the subject and its visualization.

In this series, you’ll learn about various sequence sums and the connections between them, as well as the relationship between finite calculus and classical calculus—particularly in the second part of the series.

To tell you a bit about myself, I didn’t even know this branch of mathematics existed until I rediscovered it on my own. Most of the ideas I’ve arrived at were already discovered before me, but there are still a few things I haven’t found anywhere on the internet. So, I believe my videos will help you see calculus from a fresh perspective.

Of course there are plenty of functions that can do this on an infinite set (such as any order 2 polynomial w/ integer coefficients can do it from its vertex to either side of the number line), but I can’t seem to think of a good way to do it on a bounded set. If there are any good terms to look up or anything like that it would be very much appreciated!

math,What is the point of looking at very long proofs?/ How do you handle them?,"I am studying maths quite a while now, and i enjoy it. But there is something i wonder: why do we look at proofs in the lecture that are multiple pages long, and take a whole lecture to complete?

I dont not feel that i learn much from them. 

My usual way of learning is to write anki-cards and learn them, because i am a very forgetfull person, and if the proof is longer than a few senteces i will otherwise never fully understand the proof, because at the end of it i will have already forgotten how it started. That is why i am fine with a vague understanding of the contents when i am sitting in the lecture, since i know that i will get a better understanding over time by learning these cards

Sadly this now leads to a problem: Proof that are very long (multiplie pages or even multiple lecture) take ages to learn. So: is there even a point in doing it? With shorter proofd i always get a ""sense of understanding"" out of it, so i really want to learn them, but with these long proofs, i dont seem to develop the same sense of understanding.

But without learning the proofs i wil never understand them. I can ""read them through"" and check every step, but i will forget everything immideately -- so why even bother doing it?

math,Is there any kind of typology of (infinite) fields? How many types are the most relevant?,"Hi everyone! When studying algebra about fields, I remember noticing that compared to groups or rings, there is quite a limited number of fields that is closely looked on. If groups are plenty of any structure, ""size, shape"", fields seem to be pretty limited. In the basic course we usually have Q, R, C, and finite fields GF(p^k). In p-adic course one can also know of the (infinite) Q_p field.

For finite fields we know that all of them are encompassed by GF(p^k) and we can't make up anything that isn't isomorphic to one of GF(p^k). But what about infinite fields?

I think about ways to construct new fields. R and Q_p are the only variants that we can get from Q by completing it with respect to some norm. C is an algebraic extension of R that happens to be its algebraic closure. There should be some beast that is the algebragraic closure of a finite field GF(p) (which I can't imagine how it would be constructed and work). Also, having some field F, we can construct a field of rational functions with coefficients of F, that way we can construct an infinite field of the finite characteristic, if we take some GF(p^n) as our F. This rational function construction is basically an expansion by inserting some element x to the field.

So, my question is, can we categorise the infinite fields somehow regarding their structure and how many fields and field types are actually useful for mayh practise. Is it just our friends Q, R, C mostly or some exotic fields are useful as well?",kamalist,1he5jgp,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1he5jgp/is_there_any_kind_of_typology_of_infinite_fields/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1he5jgp/is_there_any_kind_of_typology_of_infinite_fields/,2024-12-14 15:42:48,7,1.0,7,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1he5jgp

math,Murphy vs Averson for C* algebras?,"I want to self study C\* algebras because of motivation from quantum mechanics and because they seem interesting in their own right. I'm not looking to be an operator algebraist or anything like that, I just want to get a good understanding of the basics, the motivation behind them, some of the big results, and how they can be applied in physics. Some things I'm looking beyond the basics are the GNS construction and representations of C\* algebras on Hilbert spaces. It would be even better if the book covers Von Neumann algebras and representations of the canonical commutation relations in physics. I have studied functional analysis but I know very little about operator algebras beyond what a Banach algebra is.

Based on the above I've narrowed it down to two books though I'm open to others as well. Averson's book seems very short and to the point, but also looks like it can be dense and does not provide a lot of hand holding. Does it leave anything important out?

math,Is there a bridge between group rings and Lie algebras?,"Lie groups can be factored into the discrete group of connected components and the connected component of the identity, so in this sense a connected Lie group corresponds to the trivial group.

This feels unsatisfying though because there are analogies between groups and **connected** Lie groups as well:

1. Group rings play the same role in the representation theory as Lie algebras,
2. One parameter subgroups are kind of like cyclic groups, e.g. abelian groups have a particularly simple structure in both cases and decompose into products of cyclic groups/one parameter subgroups,
3. There are many other almost exactly shared theorems (which isn't a big surprise of course because they're both groups).

math,Is there a way to go about parametrizing 3-manifolds?,"I’ve been having fun lately trying to find parametrizations of surfaces I think might be interesting.

I’ve been trying to think about how I would go about doing this for 3-manifolds. I suppose I start by embedding it in 4D Euclidean space. Only problem is that I can’t visualize any of this in my head nor can I draw it so I have no idea how to come up with an intrinsic coordinate system to the 3-manifold. 

I’ve searched up the parametrization of a 3-sphere but I’ve found that most of the explanations just involve saying that the coordinates squared should equal to 1.

math,Why does this not work? (Integrodifferential PDE),"I am working on an integrodifferential PDE (a coefficient in the PDE is given by the integral of the function squared over the whole domain) and I was trying to see if there are any ways of turning it into anything simpler. I came up with something that somehow seems like it cannot work, but I don't see where it fails. I'll explain it with a simple example, using a diffusion-like equation. Suppose we have

u_t = A(t) u_xx

where A(t) could be a simple time dependent function, or given by an integral of some function of u over x. The idea I had was to simply rearrange

u_t/u_xx = A(t)

And then take a partial derivative w.r.t. x so that

[u_t/u_xx]_x = 0

Developing this expression, one gets

u_xt u_xx - u_t u_xxx = 0

which can be rewritten as the simpler (?) system

v_t v_x - u_t v_xx = 0,   u_x = v

This is now a (nonlinear and higher order, but no longer integrodifferential) PDE. In particular it is first order in time derivatives so (I might be wrong) given an initial condition u(x,t=0)=u_0(x) it can be integrated forward in time, say numerically.

Obviously this can't be right, because where is all the information that was contained in A(t) gone? Even for standard diffusion, where A is a time independent constant, this doesnt make sense.

math,Will Math always require this much dedication?,"I’m an undergraduate in my last year. Currently taking Complex Analysis, will take Differential Equations next semester. Completed courses in Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Topology, Measure Theory and Graph Theory. I was doing an exercise today, and one of the questions was to prove that a sequence of curves converges uniformly to Koch’s Snowflake. This was one question out of 10, and it took me all day and a little bit of yesterday. The given definition of the sequence of curves wasn’t really rigorous (“here’s the first curve, and the nth curve is obtained by rotating and shrinking this other curve”) so most of the time I was working on it I was trying to wrap my head around getting a “formal” definition of each iteration. And again, it took me the whole day. This isn’t the first time in my studies that it takes me a lot of time to wrap my head around a question. I want to pursue a Master’s degree in pure math - mainly because I love it and I find myself thinking about whatever I learn pretty much all the time. But the amount of dedication and the time I need to invest has been so demanding, and after three years this is really starting to making me feel burned out. I still don’t want to stop, and I do wish to continue in academia. But it’s hard to juggle between the work I have to put in and my personal life.

math,I am trying to construct integer multiplication without using subtraction and simply still using the definition of the equivalence relation but nothing seems to resolve. Is it possible to do so without resorting to using subtraction which isn't defined for the natural numbers?,"The basic equivalence relationship the integers are built around is ⟨a,b⟩\~⟨c,d⟩  iff a+d=b+c.

Integer multiplication works as follows. A\_Z B\_Z=\[⟨a\_1,a\_2 ⟩\]+\[⟨b\_1,b\_2 ⟩\]=\[⟨a\_1 b\_1+a\_2 b\_2,a\_1 b\_2+a\_2 b\_1 ⟩\]

It seems problematic to me that people seem to always switch to defining multiplication as (𝑎−𝑏)⋅(𝑐−𝑑)=𝑎⋅𝑐−𝑎⋅𝑑−𝑏⋅𝑐+𝑏⋅𝑑, and then they go on to resolve the arithmetic using rules of subtraction. However, as all of these numbers are natural numbers and subtraction can't be used with natural numbers. It makes no sense to me how this is acceptable.  


It seems to me like integer multiplication has to be constructed by proving the following:

  
if ⟨a,b⟩  \~⟨c,d⟩ and ⟨v,x⟩  \~⟨y,z⟩, then ⟨a,b⟩⟨v,x⟩=⟨c,d⟩⟨y,z⟩, meaning: 

⟨av+bx,ax+bv⟩\~⟨cy+dz,cz+dy⟩↔av+bx+cz+dy=ax+bv+cy+dz. However I cannot figure out how to get anything we have already proven to resolve into this.

math,Why is there no proof of the Church-Turing thesis?,"I heard there is no proof of it, even though it seems obviously. There are proofs of Turing mahines being equivalent to various systems, but according to some people, there is no formal definition for an effective method.

I am assuming that this topic is actually important, and that someone would actually benefit from the Churing-Turing thesis being proven. If that is the case, then whoever would benefit from it must have a formal definition of what an effective method is, since they would need a formal definition just for their brain to be able to think about it. In that case, I don't see why it wouldn't be very hard.

If it's worth anything to you, I came up with an idea for a proof. Wikepedia says that ""\[A finite method\] consists of a finite number of exact, finite instructions."", so I'm assuming that means we have some f:A -&gt; B, where A and B are both finite. Turing machines work with a finite alphabet on a tape, and the alphabet can be mapped to the natrual numbers, so A and B would both be sequences of natural numbers. Since A and B are finite, even if their inner sequences are infinite, we can map them to finite sequences. Therefore, we can replace f with a function that only takes in finite sequences of numbers.

A finite sequence of numbers can be equivalently mapped to a vector. A mapping of any set of vectors to another set of vectors can be represented by a matrix, as long as we pick a mapping with vectors that have the same sizes.

My proof is therefore this:

* Turing machines are equivalent to matrices, if we only look at a specific finite slice of the tape before or after the machine halts.
* Matrices are equivalent to functions that are effectively computable.
* Therefore, turing machines can be mapped to effectively computable functions with the same inputs and outputs.",Simanalix,1hbumro,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,2024-12-11 14:26:34,44,0.77,44,0,46,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbumro
math,"A nice little generalization of the homomophism theorem I ""found""","Of course I didn't really ""find"" it, as I am certain that someone else thought about it centuries ago, but nonetheless, I'd like to present this neat little generalization of the homomophism theorem for groups.

We start with a generalization of group homs. Given two groups `X` and `Y`, we say a **group relation** `R` is a subgroup of the product `X \times Y`. By the closed graph theorem of groups, a map `f: X\rightarrow Y` is a homomorphism iff the graph `\Gamma_f=\{(x,f(x))\}` is a subgroup of `X \times Y`. Thus, group relations can be regarded as a generalization of homomorphisms. You even can compose relations in a natural way such they are mimicking homomorphisms.

Note that this notion is symetrical and more flexible than homs, e.g. it might happen that the elements of `X` are ""related"" to more than one element of `Y` or that only the neutral elements are related to each other.

Either way, for each group relation `R`, we have group homs `p_X` or `p_Y` maping from `R` to `X` or `Y` respectively. Note that since the surjective image of a normal subgroup is still normal, `p_X(ker p_Y)` is normal in `p_X(R)`.

Now to the generalization of the homomorphism theorem. In its classical form it states: ""If we, on the left side, treat elements as equals if they get mapped to the same thing and on the right side only consider the image, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short: ""`X/\ker f \isom f(X)`"".

This theorem - and this is what I ""found"" - can be generalized to the following:

""If we, on the left side, only consider the image of a relation and treat elements as equals if they are related to the same elements and do the same thing on the right, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short:

`p_X(R)/p_X(ker p_Y) \isom p_Y(R)/p_Y(ker p_X)`

If our relation is the graph of a homomorphism, this formula gives us pricisely the classical hmomorphism theorem, but is, as group relations are, more general than this. Which is quite nice.

The proof of this theorem is of course an exercise for the reader ;-) But in all seriousness, it is very much like the proof of the classical version, give it a try if you like.

If any of you have a source where this generalization is stated and there is more to read about the things I called group relations, I'd be more than happy if you'd inform us about that.

math,Divergence of a Tensor,"I have seen conflicting information about the formula for the divergence of a tensor.

For example, a rank-2 tensor, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_derivative_(continuum_mechanics)#Divergence_of_a_tensor_field) has the divergence taken with respect to the second index which agrees with some textbooks I have seen, whilst other resources I have found take the divergence with respect to the first index. 

I know it doesn't matter for a symmetric tensor, but most authors don't indicate if they are dealing with a symmetric matrix.

I tried looking at historical texts like Levi-Civita's *""Absolute Differential Calculus""* and it seems they present the divergence with respect to the second index. I also looked at Gibb's and Wilson's *""Vector Analysis""* (they treated dyadics, not tensors in general) and the divergence is w.r.t the first index.

This is confusing me, so does anyone know the correct definition, and perhaps more importantly, why it is the correct one?

math,Is there a place to learn probability theory without all the handwaving and abuse of notation?,"My biggest problem in learning probability theory is how FUCKED UP the use of language and notation is in this field. The same symbol is used for various things without being changed and you're just supposed to get it from context. I HATE it.

Is something a function? A scalar? A process? Who knows, we just call it p(x|y) and keep everyone guessing. And definitions? Who needs those? 

I yearn for the clarity of regular maths, where you define f to be a function from set X to set Y and that's all that it is. f is the function. f(x) is the value in Y that f evaluates x to.

I can understand the stuff often enough, but only AFTER I've put in the work to pick apart what the author meant by their statement. But if I wanted to do literary interpretation I would study literature and not maths. 

I honestly can't believe that throughout all of my online and university exposition to probability theory I have never once encountered someone doing it with sensible, understandable notation. It's all just quick squiggles and handwaving. I get it, I'm a lazy fuck too, but for FUCKS sake...

But one of them is an adjoint pair F, G where F(a) = p &amp; a, G(b) = p-&gt;b. Where are opposing forces here? What is in opposition with what? Their compositions are GF(a) = p-&gt;(p &amp; a) and FG(b) = p &amp; (p-&gt;b). I just don't see it.

math,"if f(f(x)) = ln(x), what is f(x)? Can such a function even be defined?","I was thinking about the idea of a function that lies halfway between x and ln(x), such that when it is composed with itself, the result is the natural logarithm function.  When trying to define this function I ran into some seeming paradoxes.

ln(1) = 0, thus f(f(1)) = 0.  Let us define c such that f(1) = c, and f(c) = 0.  

If c were 0, then f(f(c)) is undefined, as ln(0) is undefined.  But then this means that f(0) is 0, per the above definition that f(c) = 0.  Thus c cannot be zero, as this would lead to the statement that f(f(0)) = 0, i.e. ln(0) = 0, where it is actually undefined.

So, we know c cannot be zero.  Thus it must be some non-zero number such that f(c) = 0.  But then what is ln(c)?  This can be expressed as f(f(c)), or f(0).

So, thus far, we can express the results of the f being composed up to 4 times with x as 1, remembering that f^2(x) = ln(x):

f^0 (1) = 1

f^1 (1) = c

f^2 (1) = 0

f^3 (1) = ln(c)

f^4 (1) = undefined

f^5 (1) = ln(ln(c)) and undefined.

This fifth power is undefined because f(undefined) can not be defined.  But since it is also ln(ln(c)), and ln(x) is only undefined on 0, ln(c) must be 0.  Thus c must be 1.

This leads to a contradiction, though, as this means f(1) = 1.  Thus f(f(1)) is also 1, but we know it must be 0.

math,Rebuilding my dad's math library,"So my dad got his B.S. (Augustana College, Sioux Falls) and Master's (University of North Dakota) in math in the 1960s, and then he taught briefly (Minot State College). He was drafted into the Army, met my mom, got married, and went to work for the state of South Dakota where he spent his career doing statistical analysis and projections.

He kept his student textbooks as well as the freebies publishers sent him when he was teaching. At least he kept them up until he and my mom moved. At that point he chucked the books.

I was a bit disappointed by this at the time, but I didn't think too much about it. 

However, my dad passed away in February, and since I can't spend time with him anymore, I've been trying to reassemble the shelf of books he kept. At least those that I remember. It's a way of spending time with him after a fashion, or at least with his past.

I was, frankly, fascinated by these books as a little kid--I was a precocious reader, and these books suggested a whole new world to explore, if only I could figure out what all those symbols meant).

math,Inequality for angles,"Hi everyone, 

I’m working on a mathematical inequality and could really use some help. Specifically, I am investigating the following inequality: 

\\\[ \\sqrt{1 - |\\cos(\\theta\_1 \\pm \\theta\_2)|\^a} \\leq \\sqrt{1 - |\\cos(\\theta\_1)|\^a} + \\sqrt{1 - |\\cos(\\theta\_2)|\^a} \\\] 

where \\( \\theta\_1, \\theta\_2 \\) are real angles, and \\( a \\) is a positive constant. 

I’ve conducted numerical experiments and the inequality seems to hold true when \\( a \\geq 1 \\), but it doesn’t seem to hold for values of \\( a \\in (0, 1) \\). 

I’m looking for help proving whether this inequality is generally valid for \\( a \\geq 1 \\) and why it fails for \\( a \\in (0, 1) \\). Has anyone encountered a similar problem or can suggest a technique for proving or disproving this?

math,"Bashar Al-Assad's son Hafez has recently defended his doctoral thesis, can someone explain in laymans terms what exactly he did?","Given recent developments in Syria, I was surprised to learn after a bit of reading that the oldest son of now ex-president Assad is a mathematician. He studies at Lomonosov State University in Moscow.

In a bit of an ironic twist, he recently (like two weeks ago) defended his doctoral dissertation while the Syrian opposition was about to start their offense. I dug up a summary of his thesis although I can't actually find the full text. I'm not a mathematician so as I'm trying to read the translated summary, I'm still not sure what exactly he did.

The title is ""Arithmetic questions of polynomials in algebraic number fields "" and this is the summary translated from Russian:

The first topic we will consider is the representation of two rational integers as sums of three rational squares having a common square. Representations of rational integers as polynomials have always been of interest to mathematics. Many well-known theorems and results, such as Legendre's three-square theorem, Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorems, the Hilbert-Gamke problem and many others, are devoted to this issue. In particular, Legendre's three-square theorem completely solves the problem of representing a rational integer as a sum of three rational squares. For representing an integer by a homogeneous polynomial of degree two, the local-global Hasse principle reduces the problem to representability modulo all powers of primes and representability in real numbers. In 1980, D.L. Colliot-Thelen and D. Core generalized Hasse's principle to two homogeneous polynomials under certain conditions. Our study is aimed at generalizing the above-mentioned Legendre theorem, and exploits this generalization.

The second topic we consider is estimates of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. Trigonometric sums have long been of interest because of their deep connection with modular arithmetic in the residue ring modulo q. In particular, they arise in the Hardy-Littlewood-Ramanujan circle method in the form of I.M. Vinogradov's trigonometric sums for estimating the number of solutions of Diophantine equations. In particular, the solvability of a given equation is considered, first, in the real numbers, and second, modulo any rational integer q. The latter part is usually deeper and more difficult, and rational trigonometric sums play an essential role in it; they are effectively responsible for the solvability modulo q. In 1940, Hua Lo-keng found a nontrivial estimate for trigonometric sums in the field of rational numbers. Subsequent work by Chen Junrun and V. I. Nechaev improved the estimate. In 1984, Qi Mingao and Ding Ping found a constant in Hua Luo-ken's estimate. In 1949, Hua Luo-ken generalized his estimate to the case of trigonometric sums in algebraic number fields. The first part of our study on this topic is aimed at strengthening this estimate. The second part of our study on this topic is aimed at generalizing Hua Luo-ken's tree method for constructing solutions of polynomial congruences modulo a rational prime, used in solving the convergence problem of a singular series in the Prouet-Terry-Ascot problem, to the case of algebraic number fields.

The third topic we consider is the representations of Dirichlet characters. Dirichlet characters, first introduced by P. L. Dirichlet in 1837, play a central role in multiplicative number theory. They were originally used by him to prove a theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.Many important questions of the analytical number theory were developed on the basis of Dirichlet characters and the theory of Dirichlet L-functions. In the modern theory of L-functions, estimates of character sums are of great importance. A.G. Postnikov's formula, proved by him in 1955, expresses Dirichlet characters modulo a power of an odd prime number through exponentials of polynomials with rational coefficients. Thus, the problem of estimating the sums of such Dirichlet characters is reduced to I.M. Vinogradov's method of trigonometric sums. Our study on this topic is connected with the generalization of A.G. Postnikov's formula to the case of a Dirichlet character modulo a power of 2 and the application of both the original and the generalized formula of A.G. Postnikov to estimate the sums of characters in algebraic number fields.

math,Linear combination of exponentials vanishing on N vanishes on R,"I came across this exercise in Knapp's Basic Algebra, and it looks deceptively simple. Consider the family of functions defined as f_a(x) = e^ax and let F be a linear combination of (finitely many of) them. Prove that [∀k∈N, F(k)=0] implies F is identically zero.

I can easily show that the f_a's are linearly independent (which seems useful as this is intended as a linear algebra exercise). That said, I tried attacking this in a number of ways, to no avail. I feel like the intuition is that a nontrivial finite linear combination can only vanish on a finite number of points, but I have no clue how to prove it. For starters, I'm pretty sure that all the a's have to be negative, as the opposite would force lim[x-&gt;+inf] F(x) = +-inf, but I'm not even sure how to prove that. And apart from this, I'm not even sure how to use the fact that F vanishes on N. I also tried:

- fixing k∈N, considering F(k) as a homogeneous polynomial in n variables evaluated at x_i=e^(a_i)

- taking derivatives, which have to vanish if F is identically 0, but this tells me nothing relating to what I actually know about F

- taking a very linear algebra-heavy approach, taking the vecspace V=span{f_a ∀a∈R} and the evaluation functions v_k to be a subspace of V*, and noting that F belongs to the intersection of all the kernels of the v_k, but I was unable to show that they intersect trivially

- taking the derivative of F², which by analysis has to vanish on all k∈N meaning I can produce a second such F with more f_a's involved (all sums a_i+a_j) and this makes me wonder if I can reverse this process somehow to get less terms and get an infinite descent, which both seems like a possibly promising way (it's the only thing that gave me any information whatsoever) and at the same time fells like relying on too much analysis to be required in a first semester algebra book's second chapter exercise.

I feel like I'm missing something obvious, but I asked a few graduate friends and they were stumped as well. The main difficulty I'm finding is the fact that exponentials are everywhere and they aren't an algebraic/analytic/whatever object in nature, which makes me confused as to what way I should look at them in this case. Plus linear combinations with arbitrary real coefficients AND powers can really do the weirdest shit so I'm having trouble proving anything by induction on the number of terms because the complexity scales that fast.

math,Research in Galois and Field Theory,"Hi, I wanted to ask a question about active research done in algebra, more specifically in field theory.

In the math department where I study, it seems that the main research in algebra involves finding the asynptotics of the probability of a set of random polynomials  These questions are much different than the algebra courses I took (like Galois Theory and commutatice algebra)- they are more about asymptotics, bounding terms and overall much more calculation-heavy.

I was recently given a few papers to read, which also had a lot of calculations, and the results where about counting the number of polynomials that satisfy a certain condition. It didn't really interest me, and the whole thing makes me a bit hopeless about doing research in this subject- the courses I took where so beautiful, but now everything looks like it's just calculating things.

I wanted to ask if there are different areas of research in Algebra/Field Theory (I'm not talking about Group Theory in this post), which is less about calculating things and more ""beautiful"" (I know it's subjective but I don't know how else to put it), like things done in class.

* I have really not liked this course and I feel no desire to study for it. I don't understand why I feel so blah. The material is quite important and useful, but I think the material isn't particularly well-motivated, especially given that every method has been developed to solve a practical problem.
   * For example, I guess when we talk about Krylov subspace techniques, we could mention the motivation of projection methods is to efficiently solve very large sparse systems arising from finite element method.
* I don't understand why I feel so bored and unmotivated. I think it may have to do with the teaching structure, as my instructor was absent for several lectures and has been quite busy this semester. I felt really quite frustrated as I have other courses during office hours and the instructor was only able to meet during office hours, but I guess this is on par for the course for a graduate course.
* Normally I am quite happy to study in whatever spare time I have, but I feel like I've lost my passion and I struggle to want to study.
* I am constantly confused, also, and I am doing poorly in the course. It's a graduate course and I currently have a B; to me, that indicates a deficiency in my effort level and / or my understanding. Maybe my linear algebra background is too weak.

math,Math became my unexpected escape from life,"I’ve always been fascinated by math, even as a kid in elementary school. Back then, I thought I liked it simply because I was good at it. I never really considered math as something I’d study seriously in university or as a particularly “useful” pursuit—it was just there.

Long story short, I ended up pursuing the path to medicine. But often problems would get stuck in my mind, and I couldn’t seem to shake them off.

Then came linear algebra. I took it as an elective, and it was my first real exposure to proof-based math. Honestly, I struggled with the proofs a lot, but something unexpected happened. After the course ended, I realized how much happier I was during that semester. Math had completely occupied my mind—there wasn’t room for other worries to creep in. That struggle, that focus, made my brain feel calmer.

Now, I’ve decided to make math my “side quest” alongside medicine, and I feel incredibly satisfied about it. These days, I carry an abstract math book with me almost everywhere. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I’ll open it, read a few pages, and immerse myself in it. It’s like a reset button for my mind.

math,Dealing with meta-theory in research,"How important is it to understand the limitations of current techniques when coming up with new ones?

Whenever I approach a new (to me) topic in math, there always seem to be a few core standard arguments and lemmas that get repeatedly used to obtain many of the best-known results.

When approaching open problems in these areas, it often seems natural to try to try these methods to exhaustion. As these are open problems, such naive applications are almost inherently doomed to fail as they would have been discovered and published long before.


However, it usually leaves a nearly equally difficult problem of determining why such techniques don’t work—what I’m referring to as the “meta-theory”. 

Some examples of these “meta theory” arguments do include your classic peano or ZF independent statements, but they can also be more grounded in a particular approach. For instance one of the classic techniques for determining if a polynomial has nontrivial integer roots is to consider residues mod n (Hasse principle). However, the equation 3x^3+4y^3+5z^3=0 has solutions mod n for every n, but has no solutions in the integers.
Such a result shows that this elementary technique is fundamentally limited.

Another example in information theory is the existence of non-Shannon-type entropy inequalities. (entropy inequalities that can be derived solely from the non-negativity of mutual information.) 

I find these kinds of results very intriguing and yet very difficult to understand the full implications of. This is particularly because they can show that the current/basic techniques are not enough to solve certain problems. However, it they can sometimes be almost as challenging as the problems they are intended to help solve, as even formalizing what it really means to be (or not be) obtainable using a set of methods can be extremely difficult.

When mathematicians develop new tools to solve open problems, how well do they understand the limitations of the current techniques? I find it difficult to believe that people randomly stumble across new techniques without already having a pretty good sense of what a “correct” proof would have to look like, although im sure it happens rarely.

Does reasoning about the limitations of current techniques generally come before the creation of new ones?

math,Groups -- and Generators without Closure?,"I'm doing a project in music theory, and it has unexpectedly veered into Group Theory. I have been reading about it and I get the gist of it, but some of the definitions are unclear. I don't have a definitive textbook on the subject. Can you help?

Take for example the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}, which describes all the tones in the 12-TET Chromatic scale. We also define the operator of ""addition modulo 12"". I know that it is a Group because it satisfies the criteria:

* Closure
* Associativity
* Identity Element (it is 0)
* Invertibility

And this set definitely has a Generator. The generator could be 1, 5, 7, or 11 -- all the numbers that are coprime with the modulo. I've read that this is a ""generator set"", ie {1,5,7,11} is the set of all generators.

A Group with a generator is called a ""cyclic group"". And I've also read the definition ""a cyclic group has a single generator element"". Well, my Group has multiple generators. I take this to mean that we're only using one generator at a time... we aren't finding members of the Group by applying 1 or 5 or 7 any way we wish. We pick one generator, use it to generate the set, then put it back when we're done.

Furthermore, this is a ""finite cyclic set"" because of the modulo. It doesn't go on forever down the yellow brick number line.

Another definition says ""a group is cyclic if there exists an 𝑎∈𝐺 such that every element of G is a power of a. By ""power of"" I assume that means a repeated application of the operator ""addition mod 12"". By this definition, the set {1,2,3,...,11} is cyclic.

So far that all makes sense, and... if I've made any mistakes please let me know and correct me!

OK Here's where things get a bit unclear for me, and where I think I might be wandering astray.

The Major Scale is represented by a set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}. We'll use the same operator ""addition mod 12"".

This isn't a Group! It fails the Closure condition -- because we can add 4 + 2 = 6, and 6 is not in the set. It passes Associativity and Identity. But then it fails on ""Inverses"".

And yet... in the Music Theory literature there is a lot of theorizing around Generators where the Major scale is used as an example. From any tone in the set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}, you can add (or subtract) 5 or 7 enough times to find every other member of the set. Those of you who have studied music and the ""circle of fifths"" know what I'm talking about here.

But wait, forget about subtracting. We can create a path for the generator 7 if we start on the 5 and end on 11. It just can't go any further than that. According to what I've read in Group Theory, generators can't be stopped like that, but in Music Theory, they can?

Does the Major Scale fulfil the criteria ""there exists an 𝑎∈𝐺 such that every element of G is a power of a""? It almost does, but it's more like a + x\^n not a\^n 

So what's the deal here? There are sets (with the addition mod 12 operator) that are not Groups, but they are cyclic, they have a Generator, Or at least, something that behaves like a Generator, but it can't be applied forever in both directions; there is a start and end to its generation pattern. Are there words for this that I haven't learned yet? Group-like things that have a Generator, but no Closure?

I'm writing this for an advanced academic audience so it's very important that I get all the words correct, and that I'm not glossing over the mathematical details with some vague hand-waving.

math,Feeling Lost in My Math Journey: Seeking Guidance to Reignite My Passion,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics (Honors) at the University of Delhi, and I’m in my 5th semester (third year). While it’s a decent university, the curriculum and academic environment aren’t exactly top-notch (although the professors are good). In my fourth year, we’ll focus on research, but right now, I’m struggling with what I want to do after graduation.

Here’s my story: I’ve always been passionate about mathematics and video editing (I’m a tech enthusiast). I’ve always wanted to change how people perceive and approach mathematics, especially inspired by 3blue1brown’s YouTube channel. The way he explains concepts so smoothly really resonated with me, and I thought, “I want to do something like that.”

However, I feel completely lost now. I shifted my focus from mathematics and started taking a lot of video editing courses. I didn’t attend many of my classes and, as a result, my GPA has dropped to 6.5. For the past semester, I’ve been trying to rekindle my love for math, for that I participated in a national level workshop about Numerical Optimisation  but I feel like I’m failing at it. As a Gen Z student, I’m constantly on social media, which doesn’t help in staying focused. I want to dive back into mathematics, but I’m not sure how to balance everything or even what my next steps should be.

I have no clear idea about my career path after this, and I feel stuck. I genuinely want to become great at mathematics again and eventually make a difference in how mathematics is taught and managed, especially in India, where things aren’t structured in the best way.

Any advice or thoughts on how to get back on track with my passion for math, manage my time better, and figure out my career direction would be greatly appreciated!

math,"People who do research in math, did you occasionally feel like the results you discover are embarassingly trivial?","I hope the title manages to adress the question I am asking. So I am currently working on some stuff in low dimensional topology, more precisely I try to characterise a specific set of simple closed curves on surfaces by using homological considerations that are eventually needed for proving the main theorem of my work.  
  
Without getting too much into details, I am studying the behaviour of certain loops on  surfaces and I just recently finally managed to pin it down and give a full characterisation of these elements I was trying to understand for quite some time. First I witnessed some patterns by doing a bit of combinatorial considerations and once I understood what happens, I started proving what I had witnessed. The following day I noticed that everything I proved essentially comes down to basic linear algebra and now my proof is literally a few lines of nothing than very elementary linear algebra. 

To be fair, it is not entirely obvious at first glance.  The result itself is still novel in the sense that it helps me eventually prove a much more significant statement but still, once I found the proof, it felt utterly trivial all of a sudden.

I will of course discuss my results with my supervisor who can immediately tell whether or not my results are useful, but am still interested in hearing some of your experiences. Have you ever had a similar experience or feeling?

math,Building Probabilistic Intuition and Working Towards Applied Knowledge of Random Flights and Rough Paths,"**Background**

I hold a B.S. in math and CS, and recently graduated with my M.S. in CS. My day job consists of writing code for monte carlo integration and importance sampling. 

I’m looking to continue some of my M.S. research in my spare time, and pursue some new directions that I didn’t have time to build the background for in grad school. This background lies specifically in the domain of short random walks, random flights, and the theory of rough paths. 

My (formal) experience consists of:

1. Undergraduate probability theory
2. First semester real analysis
3. The first half of Durrett’s *Essentials of Stochastic Processes*
4. Two graduate topics courses in probability theory, which very loosely followed Alon &amp; Spencer, Bollobas, and Winkler’s collections of puzzles. 

I stress that since I work on the applied side of things, I’m not looking to understand results in these domains well enough to prove them myself. So while I have my own understanding of things like the pushforward measure’s usage in my own contexts, I have not yet needed to truly understand or learn the definitions for a sigma algebra. 

**In summary**
1. Given my background, what resources should I use and how should I best approach learning about random flights and rough paths?
2. What other interesting resources are availible to further my intuition about probability, stochastic processes, and related domains?

math,"Justin Clarke-Doane | Mathematics, Reality, and Morality | The Cartesian Cafe with Timothy Nguyen","Justin Clarke-Doane is a professor of philosophy at Columbia University, whose interests span metaethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of logic &amp; mathematics.   
  
In this thought provoking-discussion, Justin and I go deep into topics that are typically neglected by most mathematicians and scientists, namely the philosophy of mathematics and morality. Justin has contributed to both these areas via his book Morality and Mathematics, which takes the view that the standard position of being both a mathematical realist and moral antirealist is incoherent. Perhaps the most novel aspect of Justin's work is the treatment of the philosophy of mathematics and morality side-by-side, showing how these two topics, which are usually thought of as being unrelated, in fact have strong analogies. Along the way, we discuss many other foundational topics in epistemology and ethics, with elements of set theory, metaphysics, and logic sprinkled in.

math,Question about the Grigorchuk Group,"Hi, I'm currently reading this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607384) about the Grigorchuk Group and there is this proof I don't understand.

Lemma 7.1 says, every element g in G has all of its reduced decompositions of the same type (i), or of type (iv), or of mixed type (ii/iii).

The types are

* (i) a\*a\*...\*a
* (ii) a\*a\*...\*
* (iii) \*a\*...\*a
* (iv) \*a\*...\*

where every \* stands for one of the generators b, c or d.

The proof given in the paper is really short and honestly I don't understand it one bit. It goes like this:

The number of a's in a reduced decomposition of g is even iff. g stabilizes the vertices on the first level^(1). Thus g cannot have decomposition of type (i) and (iv) at the same time. (WHY?) The fact that decompositions of type (i) and (iv) have odd length, while those of type (ii) and (iii) have even length, implies the result.

If someone who is familiar with the Grigorchuck Group could explain this proof to me, that would be great :-)

math,Seeking Guidance: Niche in Mathematical Optimization/Programming in Finance ,"Hi there,

I am a master's student in Applied Mathematics specializing in Optimization, and I’m exploring research directions that combine mathematical programming with finance. Recently, while wandering through the library, I came across the book Optimization Methods in Finance by Gérard Cornuéjols and Reha Tütüncü. It captivated me with its focus on how different programming techniques (linear, integer, quadratic, etc.) can be applied to develop financial models.

From my understanding, the book is aimed at audiences in Computational Finance, MBA programs, and master’s courses in Finance. However, I’m particularly interested in exploring the mathematical backbone of these techniques, with a focus on deterministic programming methods rather than stochastic analysis.

To delve deeper, I checked the bibliography of the book and searched Google Scholar for related work. Surprisingly, I struggled to find a dedicated ""niche"" or group of researchers focusing exclusively on this intersection. It seems that relevant work is scattered across journals in Applied Mathematics, Finance, Optimization, and Operations Research.

So, I have a few questions for anyone working in this area or adjacent fields:

1. Why doesn’t mathematical programming in finance seem to have a dedicated niche or society, like stochastic analysis does?


2. Are deterministic programming techniques less useful compared to stochastic methods in finance, or is this a relatively newer area that hasn’t yet gained a strong foothold?


3. Can you recommend journals, conferences, or research groups that focus on applying mathematical programming (not stochastic methods) to financial problems?



I’m keen on developing a research direction that revolves around the mathematics behind such models, and understanding their practical applications. Any guidance, insights, or resources would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

For 3-dimensions, you can interpret as a sequence of matrices extending vertically in the z-directions. Higher dimensions than 3 though would not come so easily for a visual interpretation.

math,Is there a standard for classifying circular permutations? Either by complexity or some other metric,"So this ""problem"" has been on my mind and I feel like the concept probably has been explored, but I am having trouble finding literature on it or the right term to google.

Say you have a set made up of elements with a known order (e.g. 10 integers).

And say that we can define a known order for this set, for example lets call the ""base"" circular permutation is is just N mod 9 in order so 0-&gt;1...-&gt;8

We know there are (N-1)! unique circular permutations. Some of them will be ""similar"" to the base circular permutation. For example,  (0,1,2,6,7,8,3,4,5) would be largely ""similar"" to the base permutation, but has two points where it jumps to other part of the the base cycle. On the other hand, (1, 8, 3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 0, 5) seems completely random form the base permutation.

Is there a known / standard way to quantify / sort all the permutations, based on how similar they are to known ordered ""base"" circular permutation?

math,"Road to mathematical rigor, where from here?","I am at a bit of an impasse. My interest in math bloomed a bit later than it does for most kids, and while I consider that both a good and a bad thing, it has left me in a bit of a pickle.

I am in my Senior year of high school, and became ""very good"" at math only in my junior year. Now my interests have grown exponentially, and quite beyond the school curriculum. 

I have done a lot of self study, currently doing differentials (I'm trying to get a good math basis for quantum physics which is very diff-e and vector heavy). I am considered very advanced by my peers and teachers, but I don't feel like it, and I think I know the reason why.

Because I've been trying to ""catch up"" to the truly talented kids for the past 6 months, I feel like I have a good grasp on the advanced concepts I've learned myself but lack the rigorous ability to do the basic stuff.

What I mean by this is, when I do the algebra portion of a problem, like let's say an integral was already set up, all the calculus was done, and now it's only 10th grade algebra that's left, there is a 50/50 chance I'll do it right the first time and then another 50/50 chance of me spotting the error (if the solution *feels* really wrong I usually find it, and it's something insane every time). I feel like the really talented math kids who've been doing math rigorously from like age 6 have this down to muscle memory.

To make a comparison to another hobby of mine, I feel like they are really good at writing prose while I'm very good at structuring a story. The issue is, a good structure with poor prose will give you a story no one will read.

I don't know where to go from here. I feel very concentrated while doing the ""hard parts"" of a problem and then my head feels full of cotton while I'm doing basic computations. I make errors that are both ludicrous and invisible to me, for example:

Let's say we have a function f(x) = (x^2)/(x^2-x),

This function is defined if x^2-x ≠ 0

After some basic computing we get the penultimate step:

x ≠ 0

x - 1 ≠ 0

And then I'll write

x ≠ 0
x ≠ **-1**

And I guarantee you I will not spot that error. It will sabotage the entire problem, whatever might come after it, and I won't notice it unless I redo the whole thing again.

I don't know what to do. This is just not good enough, but I don't know how to fix it. I've done probably hundreds and hundreds of practice problems and the same algebra mistakes are ruining me. It has gotten to the point where I never feel confident in my calculations, nor believe I have what it takes to be truly good at math. It's like I lack some mathematical intuition that really talented people have.

I've been feeling rather demotivated because of this, specifically because I can't trust myself and my own ability. If I could at least trust that and only have missing knowledge, I'd be excited to learn. The way things are I just feel useless as a mathematician and I have no plan on how this might be resolved.",zZEpicSniper303Zz,1h6ch6h,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,2024-12-04 09:50:20,9,0.66,9,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6ch6h

math,Triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°,"I would like to share a fun exercise that I came up with.

I was thinking about which points on a square grid have integer distance, and the answer is obviously given by Pythagorean triples, which can be generated by the famous Euclid's formula. Then I wondered: What about a triangular (or hexagonal) grid? There, the possible integer distances are given by the triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°. If the sides are a, b, c, and the 120° angle is between a and b, then they satisfy a² + b² + ab = c² (by the law of cosines).

Then I wondered if I could come up with the analogous of Euclid's formula for this class of triangles, and I found that, if m and n are two integers with m &lt; n, then the triple (a, b, c) where

a = n² - m²

b = 2mn + m²

c = m² + n² + mn

satisfies our condition. Moreover, it is not difficult to prove that if m and n are coprime and not congruent modulo 3, then the triple is primitive (i.e., GCD(a,b,c) = 1). It can also be shown that all primitive triples can be obtained by this formula.

That's it, I just wanted to share this fun little exercise in number theory. I also wonder if this formula already has a name. I am not aware of it, but probably someone knows better than me.

math,Is there any intuition behind results in stochastic processes?,"I'm taking a class on probability theory and stochastic processes. So far I've been able to follow all the technical arguments but I've been uncomfortable because I can't build an intuition on any of the results.

For example the Ito integral is an L2 limit of simple processes using a subsequence argument. Since this integral isn't defined pathwise this integral clearly isn't an area of any kind so I have no idea what the random variable that is the Ito integral even represents. 

Another example is Ito's lemma. Again the quadratic variation means the ""stochastic chain rule"" has an extra term (the second derivative) compared to the ordinary chain rule but is there any intuition why it should be 1/2 the second derivative? You can make some sort of argument using Taylor series but we're able to motivate the ordinary chain rule without resorting to any expansions so this seems like a bit of a stretch. 

Stochastic differential equations are another example. A non-random ODE or PDE clearly describes the rate of change of different functions.

math,How monstrously long papers are made?,"Following the steps of a recent discussion in the community, I have read a Wiki page on the Feit–Thompson theorem. There I found the following:

*The final paper is 255 pages long. &lt;...&gt;*

*Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the proof was its length: before the Feit–Thompson paper, few arguments in group theory were more than a few pages long and most could be read in a day. Once group theorists realized that such long arguments could work, a series of papers that were several hundred pages long started to appear. Some of these dwarfed even the Feit–Thompson paper; the paper by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen D. Smith on quasithin groups was 1,221 pages long.*

How do authors come up with such long proofs? I don't believe there are brilliant insights every few pages. If there were, these gigantic papers would be valued as high as FLT proof, but they are not. I imagine there should be some machinery that produces arguments more or less mechanically, but still,  these arguments are not so standard that they could be just omitted from the paper.

But that's just my guess. If it is true, what does this machinery look like? If it is not, how are behemoth-long proofs actually made?

math,How can I know my math problem/research is novel?,"I'm now doing math research on a probability theory question I came up with. Note that I'm an undergraduate, and the problem and my approaches aren't that deep.  
First, I googled to see if somebody had already addressed it but found nothing. So I started thinking about it and made some progress. Now I wish to develop the results more and eventually write a paper, but I suddenly began to fear: *what if somebody has already written a paper on this?*

So my question is, as in the title: how can we know if a certain math problem/research is novel?

If the problem is very deep so that it lies on the frontier of mathematical knowledge, the researcher can easily confirm its novelty by checking recent papers or asking experts in the specific field. However, if the problem isn't that deep and isn't a significant puzzle in the landscape of mathematics, it becomes much harder to determine novelty. Experts in the field might not know about it due to its minority. Googling requires the correct terminology, and since possible terminologies are so broad mainly due to various notations, failing to find anything doesn't guarantee the problem is new. Posting the problem online and asking if anyone knows about it can be one approach (which I actually tried on Stack Exchange and got nothing but a few downvotes). But there’s still the possibility that some random guy in 1940s addressed it and published it in a minor journal.

math,Notion of a standardized curvature?,"It’s been a while since I studied this in undergrad so apologies for the lack of rigor and specificity.

When I was in Calc 3, I remember learning about curvature, and I believe it was denoted with “k”. We were taught that a small circle was more curvy, than a larger circle with a larger radius.

I understood at the time, why this was defined as such, **however** I felt like there should also be some notion of curvature that is standardized for the shape of the closed shape.

So that all circles have the same shape regardless of size, but we could still compare the curvature of shapes, i.e. a circle is more curvy than a triangle.

In the same way that Usain Bolt can run really fast for his size, but a Giant 50ft troll running at 30mph would be quite average, if not slow. 

Then, I’m sure we could extend this in higher dimensions, where there would probably different ways to quantify curvature when standardized for the shape of the closed N-d shape.

math,Looking for Seminar Topic Ideas in Functional Analysis with Connections to Probability and Ergodic Theory,"Hi everyone!

I’m currently taking a course in functional analysis, and for the oral exam, I need to present a 20-minute seminar on a topic related to the course. The topic should not overlap with the material already covered but still stay within the realm of functional analysis.

Some of the main areas we’ve covered include:

• Normed and Banach spaces, linear operators, and dual spaces.

• Hilbert spaces and orthogonal projections.

• Hahn-Banach theorem, topologies (weak, weak*), and convexity.

• Spectral theory for bounded operators and compact operators.

• Elements of distribution theory and spaces of sequences.

I’m particularly interested in topics that connect functional analysis to probability theory or ergodic theory, as these are fields I’d like to explore further.

Do you have any suggestions for seminar topics that fit these criteria?

Even if the pathological function is well known, it can still be interesting to see what statements they are a counterexample for. For example:

""Every removable discontinuity of a Riemann integrable function ℝ → ℝ is isolated.""

math,Names for two desired properties of classifcation schemes?,"Hello! Forgive the improper terminology. 

If you are coming up with a system of classifying some set of things, you want the system to be:

2. Unambiguous, meaning every item falls into one and only one category; no item could be said to fit into more than one category. 

I'm pretty sure there are actual mathematical terms for those two properties, but I don't know what they are. Any wisdom or me?

math,Quaternion double-cover of SO(3),"It’s clear to me why the quaternion rotation formula works. The exps commute through the parallel component, cancelling and leaving it unchanged, but they anticommute with the orthogonal part, each performing a half-rotation. And we use exp because exp of a 90-degree rotation (e.g. all unit pure quaternions) generates all rotations.

What doesn’t make sense to me is how this relates to the double-covering of SO(3) by Spin(3). I understand algebraically that the sign of the quaternion cancels in the rotation formula. I also understand that the theta/2 in the quaternion rotation formula requires you to take a 720deg path around Spin(3) to make a full loop. But I don’t understand what’s really special about a full 720deg walk. So what if we need that to take a loop around Spin(3)? What makes Spin(3) a truer group of rotations than SO(3)? I know it’s the universal cover, but why is that relevant in this case?

And of course, there’s Dirac’s belt trick. I “get” what’s going on there, but I fail to see the significance of it.

math,"In the Yoneda Lemma, in what ways can Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) fail to be naturally isomorphic? How do such failures correspond to failures in C and D being isomorphic?","The paragraph below is from [https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/](https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/) , who posted four years ago in ""Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?"", [https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is\_it\_normal\_to\_be\_struggling\_to\_get\_the\_yoneda/](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is_it_normal_to_be_struggling_to_get_the_yoneda/) . The post is archived, unfortunately, which means I can't discuss it with the original discussants. But the paragraph says exactly what I want to start from. To go further, I want to ask: in what way can Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) fail to be naturally isomorphic, and how do such failures correspond to failure in C and D being isomorphic?

&gt;One way to appreciate the Yoneda lemma is through its corollaries. There's one particular special case which I find particularly enlightening: the Yoneda embedding. The idea is that we can think of an object C as being represented by a hom functor Hom(C,-), i. e. by all its relations to other objects in the category (in the form of arrows from C). Then, an arrow from C to D corresponds exactly to a natural transformation between the corresponding hom functors (this is because the Yoneda embedding is fully faithful, courtesy of the Yoneda lemma). In particular, if Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) are naturally isomorphic then C and D are isomorphic, which essentially justifies the ""it's the arrows that are important"" perspective of category theory. Note that we could just as well look at Hom(-,C) instead of Hom(C,-).

I've never seen this discussed, but is there a concept of ""C and D are isomorphic except for these cases""? Of, as it were, defects or deformations in isomorphism? As a programmer, I find it natural (sorry!) to study such points of failure. If I could do so for Yoneda, I think it would be enlightening. Because it's easy to see how a natural transformation can fail. Some components may not be there. But what kind of damage does that do to the wanna-be isomorphism arrows between C and D?

By the way, I attach a picture of a category with objects C and D in, also X, X', X'', etc. It also shows the functors Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-), with just visible hom-sets indicating their effect on some of the X's, and a natural transformation. Maybe someone can see how to complete it to make the source of C and D's isomorphism obvious.

math,"Looking for references on ""coproduct"" of random variables","I'm trying to find what a concept is called and references to learn more about it. My best guess is to call it a coproduct of random variables, but this leads nowhere.

---

Here's a description (handwaving measure theory to keep things short):

Given two random variables x : Ω → S\_x and y : Ω → S\_y, we can form the joint random variable (x,y) : Ω → S\_x × S\_y by taking (x,y)(ω) = (x(ω), y(ω)). This is a product in the category of random variables over (Ω, Σ, μ). This raises the question: is there a coproduct?

Yes, there is. We can prove its existence using Zorn's lemma or explicitly construct it by taking the coequaliser of the maps x : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y and y : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y, i.e. the random variable x∨y : Ω → E, where E = S\_x ∪ S\_y / ~ and ~ is the smallest relation such that x(ω) ~ y(ω) for all ω.

Another characterisation of this object is that the sub-σ-algebra of Σ induced by (x∨y)^(-1) is the intersection of the sub-σ-algebras induced by x^(-1) and y^(-1).

---

Some questions:

What is x∨y called in the literature and how is it usually denoted?

Are there references discussing this construction?

What interesting results are there regarding x∨y? Can we express its distribution function nicely? Does it satisfy an entropy relation?",AseOdin,1h3rqo7,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3rqo7/looking_for_references_on_coproduct_of_random/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3rqo7/looking_for_references_on_coproduct_of_random/,2024-12-01 01:23:30,33,0.9,33,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h3rqo7

This is approximately n/ln(n) for large n, but my question is what is a good lower bound on the number of primes between n and 2n?

math,A simple but powerful map ban format for 2-player random queue games,"I have no idea what the right subreddit for this is but I wanted to share it since I feel like it might be interesting and/or useful.

**For a short description of the problem:** You are hosting a random matchmaking queue for a game where two players face off on one of multiple possible maps. Most players don't want to learn every map, so you offer map bans. But you still want to ensure that any two players will be able to find a map that neither of them has banned. What is a good way to allow your average joe to ban as many maps as possible without making things feel too complicated or too restrictive?

The format that is typically used in games (e.g. AoE2) asymptotes at a map pool size of `2n` maps if each player has to leave `n` maps unbanned.

My previously favourite format asymptotes at `4n` maps for `n` unbanned.

This new format that I just found asymptotes at `n²/2` maps for `n` unbanned.

I think the theoretical limit (Fano plane anyone) is somewhere between `n²/2` and `n²` but it seems way too unwieldy and restrictive to make that into a user-friendly system.

**So here's my new system:**

1. Arrange the available maps into a grid of `x*y` maps, where `x` is odd.
2. Any given player must select one of the `x` columns as their ""home column"". They can't ban any maps in their home column.
3. The player may then ban most of the maps in the other columns, except that every *second* column (starting from the home column and looping around) must have at least one map not banned.

If these rules are followed, three scenarios can happen when attempting to match two random players A and B:

**a)** Both players have selected the same column. In this case, any map from that column can be randomly selected and played (fully random, or prioritizing favourited maps, or something else, we don't need to care).

**b)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an odd column. Then player A has left open one of the maps in player B's home column, so that map can be played.

**c)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an even column. Then player B has left open one of the maps in player A's home column, so that map can be played.

**Example:** There are `5x4` maps in the pool (picture 1).

    A B C D E        - B - D -        - - - - E
    F G H I J        - G - - -        - G - - J
    K L M N O        K L - - -        - - - N O
    P Q R S T        - Q - - -        - - - - T

Player A's bans leave open the maps in picture 2. Player B's bans leave open the maps in picture 3.

Both players have left map **G** open, so map **G** will be played.

**EDIT:** As pointed out by u/mfb- and u/bartekltg, this system comes at the cost of reducing player choice, e.g. a grid of size `5x3` only gives the player `5*3*3=45` ways to leave 5 maps open, while a basic system with 9 maps and 4 independent bans offers `(9 choose 4) = 126` options.

By a different metric, however, grid sizes of `2k-1*k; n=2k-1` and `2k+1*k; n=2k` (with `n` maps left open) are optimal:

*There are* `n-1` *arbitrary bans; that is, for any set of* `n-1` *desired bans, a ban configuration banning all of them exists.*

**Proof:** Let `B` be a set of `n-1` desired bans. Since there are more than half as many rows as desired bans, at most one column can consist only of desired bans.

Case 1: No fully undesired column. Since there are more than `n-1` columns, at least one column remains without a desired ban. This column can be the home column, and by the case assumption, all other desired bans can be dodged.

Case 2: Exactly 1 fully undesired column. This uses up k desired bans, and the undesired column can be fully dodged by half of the other possible home columns. So in the `2k-1*k` case, there are `k-1` columns and `k-2` desired bans remaining, whereas in the `2k+1*k` case, there are `k` columns and `k-1` desired bans remaining. By pigeonhole, we can designate a home column with no desired bans from this set, and once again dodge all other desired bans.",Iwer_Sonsch,1h3dze9,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,2024-11-30 14:43:19,50,0.91,50,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h3dze9

math,Inductive definition of a set.,"I am a computer science student and have studied basic discrete maths, including set theory. I was pacing across some questions when I came across this one. It seems like the standard way of defining a set inductively. A basis clause stating that certain elements are in the set, and an inductive clause which states that if x is in the set, y is also in the set. 

  
Now the problem that I have with this definition is that for many objects, it does not specify if they are in the set or not (which are not taken into account in both of the clauses). For example in this question, I cannot tell if b is in L or not. According to me, a good definition of a set should be able to define for every object in the universe of discourse, that it belongs to the set or not. The answer here, also completely depends on this assumption. My question is, am I missing something in the way sets are defined inductively, or the question is just vague and poorly framed, or the inductive definition of sets is incomplete and there are better ways to define a set?

I'd be happy to provide any clarifications in my post. TY

I will start: Take a finite graph G, we represent the n points on some affine line (equally spaced), and if a pair of these points are incident we draw a circle around those points such that the space between the points is the diameter. Now project this line onto the real projective plane, so that the circles become ellipse. Now the pairs of incident points correspond to the foci of the ellipse.

math,More in-depth reference for matrix calculus,"There are a number of threads on this subreddit and others asking for resources for matrix calculus. There isn't much attention given to differentiating with respect to matrices. For example, there's not much of this in The Matrix Cookbook. I'm looking for this sort of info (all in numerator layout as that's what I need to use):

* $\frac{\partial (Mx+b)}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)} = x^T \otimes I$. This one I can at least get out of https://www.matrixcalculus.org
* $\frac{\partial f(Mx+b)}{\partial M} = x f'$. (This was not on Wikipedia until I added it recently.)
* This attempt to relate $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial M}$, which is a monstrosity in numerator layout: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)} = \left( \mathrm{vec} \left(\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial M}\right)^T \right) \right)^\top$
* If $dv = M\mathrm{vec}(N)$, then $\frac{\partial v}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(N)} = M$

It seems like the attractors were presented by having the x-axis measuring the value of each note *n* and the y-axis being *n*\-1, then connecting between points according to time.

math,"Roadmap for Studying Homological Mirror Symmetry: References, History, and Key Concepts. ","Hello, everyone!

I am a mathematics student with interests in Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and theoretical aspects of Physics. Recently, I’ve been exploring Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS), and I’m fascinated by its deep connections to Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, and String Theory.

I would like to ask for guidance on the following:

1. Roadmap: What is a good progression of topics or prerequisites to study before diving into HMS? For example, how much familiarity with Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, or Category Theory is required?


2. References: Could you recommend foundational textbooks, lecture notes, or papers that introduce HMS in an accessible way? Are there any must-read works by Kontsevich or others to understand the origins and formalism of the conjecture?


3. History: I’m interested in the development of HMS. How did it emerge historically from Mirror Symmetry in Physics, and what are the most significant milestones in its mathematical formulation?


4. Applications and Extensions: Where is HMS actively being applied or extended in current research? Are there particular areas or open problems that are especially exciting?



I’d love to hear from those who have studied or worked with HMS. Any advice or insights into this beautiful theory would be greatly appreciated!

math,Alternatives to Billingsley's textbook,"My goal is to cover enough measure theory that will enable me to study and understand the following 

1. Math stats graduate books like that written by Jun Shao or Keener or Bing Li.

2. Stochastic calculus books (say the one by Oksendal or the one by Shreeve and Karatzas)

FWIW, I am working towards a career in quantitative research and these are supposed to be useful (perhaps necessary).

I have studied and worked through Rudin's PMA, Topology by Mendelson, Strang's linalg book, and have worked through most of Hogg and McKean's math stats book.

For measure theory, I have glanced at (1) Capinski and Kopp's book (2) Rene Schilling's book and (3) David William's book. They don't seem as dense as Billingsley's book. But many people seem to opine that Billingsley is a must read. 

I hope this is not a redundant post. I did google search for alternatives to Billingsley's book but could not find it. All I found was a plethora of book recommendations but not specifically as an alternative to Billingsley's book. Hence this post.

So I am requesting for a book that coveres as much or more as that of Billingsley's book, is not dense, and it would be a great plus if it has a solutions manual as I am doing self study.

math,Don't feel smart enough to do really well in mathematics,"I am a math undergrad at a prestigious university (T10 world). I'm currently taking courses such as Ring Theory, Lebesgue Integration and Complex Analysis. On paper, it seems as if I have enough 'ability' to do well in mathematics - I'm the typical, did fairly well in olympiads and high school, and found math easy person.

Despite this, I'm finding it very difficult to crack into the top 10% of my cohort. It feels as if no matter how hard I study, some people just pick up material faster and have a better and deeper understanding. I just feel like I'm not smart enough. I also feel like my exam performance doesn't really reflect my ability - I tend to get very nervous and anxious and fumble hard in exams. I really do enjoy my subject and am considering further graduate study, and feel that my exam performance is going to close doors. I find this sad because I feel that exams aren't really that important in terms of real math understanding.

Does anyone have any tips, apart from just do a lot of math, that can point me in the direction of becoming really really good at math and math exams. I'm starting to feel like graduate study may not be something for me, and it's quite disheartening.

math,Can We Define 'Understanding' Between Systems Mathematically?,"Hello,

Is it possible to mathematically formalize the concept of one system ""understanding"" another? If so, are there any studies or theories that have explored this topic? I would be grateful if you could point me to any relevant work or ideas.

This question stems from the following motivations:

* By formalizing ""understanding"" between systems, I aim to identify subsets such as ""natural language"" and ""mathematical language,"" with the ultimate goal of exploring the limits of human intelligence.
* I believe that by turning the concept of ""understanding"" inward, we may gain insights into the possibility of understanding consciousness itself.
* Ideally, such a formalization would be applicable to human brains or intelligence in a relatively straightforward manner.

More specifically, I am interested in topics such as:

* Mathematical studies on ""understanding"" or ""correspondence"" between systems.
* Applications of information theory, model theory, or type theory to this concept.
* Research on abstract definitions of ""understanding"" in cognitive science or artificial intelligence.

Any suggestions, references, or insights would be greatly appreciated.

math,I’ve been reading Max Tegmark’s book “Our Mathematical Universe” which argues convincingly that we’re living in some vast mathematical structure that somehow acts as a real-life model of itself…,"This seems to render the much-reviled simulation argument moot, because it’s like we drop all pretence that it was ever anything other than a simulation in the first place. 

But anyway my question: what structure could it be?

For this I think we have to call in the model theorists.

From my limited understanding of the subject, perhaps we’re looking for a countable structure (or maybe with the cardinal it the reals?) which is homogeneous, saturated - perhaps some kind of Fraïssé limit which also has a universal interpretability quality?

A countable structure able to interpret any other countable structure, and perhaps with additional saturation properties, would be nice - bonus points if it’s locally finite. 

If one framed a rigorous definition, it seems possible that there are many structures with these properties, and one could then reasonably ask for the simplest or most easily defined. Maybe the rational numbers fit the bill, which would be almost as Delphic and useless as 42 being the answer to everything.

math,I think the formal definition of a limit in Walter Rudin’s Real Analysis text has an unexpected consequence,"This is the second of two definitions of a limit given in Walter Rudin’s *Principles of Mathematical Analysis,” which I understand to be a reliable reference text for analysis. The first definition comes before the introduction of the extended real numbers and, crucially, requires that the point A at which the limit is taken be a limit point of the domain. To cut to the chase I think this second definition allows for the following:

&gt; Let f: E = (0, 4) -&gt; R be defined by f(x)=x. Then f(t) approaches 4 as t -&gt; 5.

Given a neighborhood U of 4 in the codomain, U contains an open interval (4-e, 4+e) for some e&gt;0.
Now let us define a neighborhood of 5 in R which need not be a subset of the domain E. Let V = (4 - e, 5 + e).

We have thus met the required conditions for V: 
- V \cap E is nonempty; the intersection is (4-e, 4).
- On this intersection, we have 4-e &lt; f(t) &lt; 4+e, that is to say f(t) is in U, for every t in V \cap E

Is this an intentional consequence? If so I am curious to hear any perspective that might contextualize this property in a broader or more general topological framing.

Is it unintuitive but nevertheless appropriate because of the nature of the extended reals?

Or is it a typo of some kind that is resolved in other texts?

Or am I misunderstanding something?

math,Is there a bigger picture behind all the different operator norms on Hilbert spaces?,"One way to think of L\^p spaces is that it measures the decay of a function at infinite and its behavior at singularities. As p gets bigger singularities get worse but decay at infinity gets better. 

I noticed the operators on Hilbert spaces have a very similar definition to L\^p spaces and measurable functions. For example the equivalent of an L\^1 norm for operators is the trace class norm, the equivalent of the L\^2 norm is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, and the equivalent of the L\^infinity norm is the operator norm. Is this a coincidence or is there some big picture behind these operator norms similar to the L\^p space idea I gave above? What are these norms tell us about the operator as p increases?

Also while we're talking about this, do we still have the restriction that p &gt;= 1 for these norms like in L\^p spaces? If so why? What about for negative p?

math,Direction of the polygonal curve in the Schwarz-Christoffel integral,"https://preview.redd.it/0dm82t09bx2e1.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdbd72cb9b6b8fd5eb23eea96b32f3e3edd7e181

I am reading section 4.2 of Stein and Shakarchi's *Complex Analysis*, where the Schwarz-Christoffel integral is defined as in the image, where A1&lt;...&lt;An and all the beta's are in (0,1) and their sum is &lt;=2. The powers are defined using the branch of log which is defined everywhere except the nonpositive imaginary axis. We define a\_k=S(A\_k) for all k and define a\_∞=S(∞).

In the proof that this integral maps the upper-half plane into the polygon with vertices a1,...,a\_n,a\_∞, they note that S′(x) is real and positive when x&gt;A\_n.

I believe this should mean that when x travels from A\_n to ∞, S(x) should travel in a straight line parallel to the real axis, from left to right. Hence a\_n should be directly left of a\_∞.

However, the image shows what the textbook has drawn.

In the picture, when Σβk=2, a\_1 is to the left of a\_∞ which is to the left of a\_n. But it seems to me this should all be the other way around.

Even worse is the case when Σβk&lt;2, when the line between a\_∞ and a\_n is not even horizontal.

As well, a\_∞ is depicted as being at the top of the shape in these images, but I believe it should really be at the bottom (ie: it should have a smaller imaginary component). Since the line between a\_{n−1} and a\_n is at angle −πβn with the real axis, hence it ""points"" downwards, so a\_{n-1} is above a\_n.

So from my understanding, the polygon should have a flat bottom between points a\_n and a\_∞, where a\_n is to the left of a\_∞. And the rest of the points should be put counterclockwise around the polygon. But this is not what the picture in Stein and Shakarchi depicts, so I'm wondering if I have done something wrong.

Please let me know if my understanding is correct or if I have made a mistake somewhere.

math,"Strange Feature of the Finite Projective Plane PG(2,3)","I was playing with finite projective planes and stumbled across a phenomenon that surprised me. I've thought about it a bit, but cannot explain why it should be so.

Consider PG(2,3), the two-dimensional finite projective plane over GF(3). If we assign a numerical label to each of the thirteen points in the space then we can describe each line in the space by which points it contains. Each line contains four points, so each line can be written as a 4-tuple. So, we can characterize the thirteen lines in PG(2,3) as a 13x4 array. One example of doing so might be (taken from the La Jolla Covering Repository Tables):

|Point A|Point B|Point C|Point D|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3|5|11|
|3|4|6|12|
|4|5|7|13|
|1|5|6|8|
|2|6|7|9|
|3|7|8|10|
|4|8|9|11|
|5|9|10|12|
|6|10|11|13|
|1|7|11|12|
|2|8|12|13|
|1|3|9|13|
|1|2|4|10|

Since these labels are arbitrary, we can permute them however we want and get an equivalent description of the space.

I wondered, is there some permutation of these labels that is ""nice"" in the sense that the row sums of the corresponding array representation of the space are all equal? I've convinced myself that the answer is ""no"", but it looks like something stronger is true.

Clearly, permuting the labels won't affect the *mean* of the row sums of the array. What is surprising (to me anyway), is the fact that permuting the labels also won't affect the *variance* of the row sums of the array. No matter how you shuffle the labels, the variance of the row sums is always 42.

For example, in the array above, the row sums are \[21, 25, 29, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 31, 35, 26, 17\].

If we swap all of the 1s and 13s, however, the row sums are \[21, 25, 17, 32, 24, 28, 32, 36, 28, 43, 23, 26, 29\]

These are different multisets (notice, for example, that the second has a 43 as an element but the first does not), but both have a variance of 42.

What's going on here? It seems clear that there's something about the underlying symmetry of PG(2,3) that's is causing this, but I can't for the life of me see what could be causing the variance of the row sums to be invariant when permuting the point labels.",shdgctbei,1gy94bn,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,2024-11-23 20:33:09,17,0.86,17,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gy94bn

math,Struggling with Discrete Math Teaching Methods at My College—Is This Normal?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently taking a Discrete Math course at my college, and I’m finding the way it’s taught incredibly frustrating and borderline incomprehensible. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar or has advice for dealing with it.

Here’s what’s happening: the materials we’re given—lecture notes and problem sets—are filled with references to other questions, sentences, or formulas scattered across 400+ pages. For example, I’ll be trying to follow a proof, and it’ll say something like “According to question 28c” or “As per sentence 1.24 and question 14k.”

The problem is, I’m expected to use these earlier questions or sentences to understand the current proof, but I’m struggling to keep track of where everything is or how it all connects. If I didn’t understand question 28c, how am I supposed to use it to build a new proof? It feels like I’m being asked to construct something complex without being given a proper foundation.

I’ve talked to friends who study at other colleges, and their Discrete Math courses seem much more straightforward. They get proofs written out step-by-step in a clear way, without having to constantly refer to random questions or pages. Meanwhile, my course feels like a maze of scattered information, and it’s making me doubt my abilities.

I understand that math requires rigor and effort, but this approach feels unnecessarily convoluted. I don’t know if it’s meant to encourage independence or what, but it’s honestly just overwhelming and frustrating.

Does anyone else’s school teach Discrete Math like this? How do you deal with such a fragmented way of learning? Are there any resources or strategies you’d recommend for surviving this kind of course?

Thanks for reading—I’d really appreciate any advice or insight.

math,Is Lowenheim-Skolem just an artifact of the formalism?,"
People here, and on various math blogs,  love to point out the existence of countable models of ZFC. Seems like at least once a week, and this is stated like it has profound implications. Conclusions like ""uncountable sets are an illusion,"" ""God could count the reals,"" or ""we might live in a model where every set is countable"" are common.

But Cantor's argument shows, in a very generic way, whenever we conceive of a collection and its subcollections, there can be no one-to-one correspondence between them. The proof doesn't rely on any controversial axioms of a specific set theory. It's a basic consequence of a very general idea.

And sure, when formally studying models of a first-order set theory, some are countable from the metatheory. It's like making maps of the world. On any given map, South America will be larger than Europe, because it's larger in real life so we make maps that reflect that fact. But South America on one map might be smaller than Europe on a different map (because the whole map is smaller).

But *so what?* Why would you compare objects across models like that? It's common for diagonal arguments to relativize in this way. The halting problem: a Turing machine can't decide it's own halting, but there's always an oracle machine that can. Or the second incompleteness theorem: a theory can't prove itself consistent, but there's always a stronger theory that can.

Yet no one ever says ""incompleteness is an illusion"" or ""we might live in a model where every problem is decidable."" The fundamental ideas are reflected *within each level*, and comparisons across levels don't seem particularly important.

In physics, we encounter ""artifacts of the formalism"" sometimes. Like tachyons in special relativity, closed timelike curves in general relativity, or zero-point energy in quantum fields. Extra stuff that shows up in the math but generally isn't thought to be physically relevant.

Can we say the same about *mathematical* phenomena sometimes? Lowenheim-Skolem seems like a pretty good candidate. While the core idea behind |P(N)| &gt; |N| is reflected (in some form) in each of the models of the set theories we use, the existence of countable models feels like a technical limitation of formal systems, similar to the various paradoxes that ensue when you have to use logic to talk about logic. 

Thoughts? I'm sure there are some formalists here who disagree.

* Terry Tao launched a project for decentralized math research where anyone can contribute a piece of progress to a math problem. See his [blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/).
* Bluesky, a social media platform, is building a protocol for decentralized communication. User's data, including content and followers, is reachable from multiple interfaces. If a user does not like the policy of a platform interface, it can move to another one with her followers and content. See their [blog post](https://bsky.social/about/faq).

**Ambition.** Bluesky aims to let anyone use their decentralized protocol and build new platforms, with a genuine access to all users content and data. Researchers and entrepreneurs may innovate interaction mechanisms, beyond for-profit prediction AI that aims to manipulate people and waste their time for advertisement.

**Discussion**

* If we took the stance of Terry Tao, and started to think of collaborative mechanisms for a new kind of math research, Would the new aspired wave of decentralized internet take place?

math,When to start this Coin Flipping Game over?,"I was thinking about the following problem. Take a game where you have a fixed number of flips f and a prerequisite number of heads h you need to win.

You can start the game anew whenever you like, your headcount get's reset and you get the same number of flips again.

The goal is to win the game as soon as possible so in the least amount of total flips. When is the probability to win the ongoing game low enough that you expect to win earlier by restarting and forfitting the flips you already did.

Let's say it's 100 Flips and you need 80 heads to win. I'd wager that if you flipped 30 times and got only 15 heads you're better off to start over, since getting 75/80 heads is too unlikely and you may hope for a better Start.

I tried some calculations, but my stochastic is very rusty. I though about this in the context of speedrunning a RNG heavy game, when is the run so bad, that you shouldn't waste your time playing it out - I thought this coin flipping game breaks this down to the most basic case?

I'm now worrying that I chose a too complex subject. I'm basically trying to find a relationship between a piano note's string vibration and its sound decay. My first issue is that I don't know how to collect my data, I downloaded an app called phyphox but the ""audio amplitude"" measurement doesn't actually give me an amplitude (idk if I'm just using it wrong). My second issue is that I have no idea where to start. I am aware that this involves calculus, but Idk how to model the sound decay of a piano note. And I'm also unsure of how to model the vibration of a string.

I asked the physics teacher in my school, and he told me that the sine wave of the note will look something like this:

math,"Examples where ""taking a step backwards"" is helpful","For a project I'm looking for examples in math where it's useful to ""take a step backwards.""

Computation example: the distributive law $a(b+c) = ab + ac$, which we can interpret as a pair of rewrite rules. If we assume that distributing $a(b+c)$ -&gt; $ab + ac$ is the forward direction [1], then factoring is running the distributive law backwards. Factoring is obviously incredibly useful, e.g. in finding closed forms for (convergent) geometric series, or finding roots to polynomials.

Proof-based example: [sometimes it's easier to prove a stronger statement than a weaker statement.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1007256/examples-where-it-is-easier-to-prove-more-than-less) Considering statements / theorems as vertices in a directed graph, where a forward [2] edge from A to B means ""A implies B"", deciding to prove a stronger statement is taking a step backwards in this graph. 

What are some more examples of ""taking a step backwards?"" Computational / algebraic tricks would be the most helpful for the project, but all examples are welcome.

[1] Justification of distribution being the forward direction: computationally speaking, it's easier to match patterns of the form $a(b+c)$ modulo associativity and commutativity than patterns of the form $ab + ac$. Anecdotally, students usually can easily identify situations where they can distribute, but it's harder for them to identify situations where they can factor.

[2] Justification of implication being a forward edge: generally, it is easier to specialize a theorem to a special case than to enumerate all the more general theorems that imply it.",umop_aplsdn,1gvkbgn,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gvkbgn/examples_where_taking_a_step_backwards_is_helpful/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gvkbgn/examples_where_taking_a_step_backwards_is_helpful/,2024-11-20 07:39:58,35,0.86,35,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gvkbgn

math,Pursuing master in Applied statistics in 2025? Need advices as international student,"Hey everyone,

I’m an international student considering pursuing a Master’s in Applied Statistics to break into the analytics field. The challenge is that my background isn’t in math or STEM (I studied International Business), so I’d need about 2 years to study Calculus 1-3 and Linear Algebra just to meet the prerequisites.

I’m drawn to analytics because of the opportunities in fields like data science, finance, and tech, but I’m questioning whether this is the best path for someone in my position. Some programs seem highly technical, and I’m wondering if the effort and time would be worth it in the long run.

A few questions I’d love advice on:
	1.	Is a Master’s in Statistics a good way to pivot into analytics, or should I consider other degrees (e.g., Data Science, Business Analytics)?
	2.	Would spending 2+ years preparing for the program and then 2 years in the program itself be worth the time and money investment?
	3.	Are there any alternative ways to break into analytics in the U.S without committing to a full master’s program?

Probably you have heard of the Interesting number paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting\_number\_paradox) which states that every integer is in some way ""interesting"".

So I started digging for the smallest uninteresting integer. First I looked for facts on Wikipedia. On [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_(number)) of numbers, the 2040 seems to be the smallest integer, that is not listed.

So on the search for properties of the 2040, I went to the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org) and found almost every number I was interested in, was somewhere in their database. So I wrote a small python script that searched the OEIS for numbers, to find the smallest integer that is not on there.

It is the 20067. Of course I was not the first one to discover this. Googleing the number, I came across [this blog post](https://benwiederhake.github.io/oeis-funfacts/) by Ben Wiederhake with fun facts about the OEIS, including the 20067.

I am willing to accept that being the smallest integer not in the database of the OEIS *is* in itself an interesting fact about the 20067. Even though the number is not actually that boring. For example it's semi-prime!

So the second smallest integer not in the OEIS is the 20990. I haven't found anything interesting about it so far.

\- It's factorization is  2 \* 5 \* 2099  
\- It is unhappy  
\- It is deficient

I haven't got any good ideas on how to discover interesting properties about numbers. So far I've got just by going through online databases and now I'm a bit stuck. Almost went out to make some sort of crazy piece of art with the 20990 in it...

Maybe someone here got an idea on how to study a number for it's hidden special properties. I'd be very grateful for any help, thank you in advance! :)

I of course know about things like the Weierstrass function that prove you can have continuity without differentiability, but I wanted to know if such functions ever have real world use.  It always seemed to me like the Weierstrass function was just a contrived counter example that was unlikely to come up in applications.",Tiervexx,1gubb8i,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gubb8i/are_there_any_examples_in_applied_mathematics_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gubb8i/are_there_any_examples_in_applied_mathematics_of/,2024-11-18 18:12:52,216,0.95,216,0,69,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gubb8i
