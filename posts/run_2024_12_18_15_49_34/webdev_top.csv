webdev,How much should I be paying my web developer?,"I am currently working on a cooking website, which is an online recipe book which hosts a variety of recipes, each with a video tutorial on how to make it. There will be around 300 recipes. The webdev is thinking of using Supabase for the backend, nextjs for the front end and an external video host like Vimeo for the videos. It also needs to handle accounts and payments (stripe) as it is a membership service. He has all the UX UI wireframes already. What will be a reasonable price to ask for this to be developed? But more importantly how long would this be expected to take?

Edit - I’m Leaning away from Wordpress since I see this as more of a SaaS web app compared to a static blog that hosts recipes. It’s more of an educational site where users learn specific skills in cooking through recipes which range through easy to hard. It won’t be completely static in the sense that it will be interactive through giving the user the ability to filter recipe difficulty, type, cuisine etc. So like a hybrid cooking course style site but much less structured. I want the webdev to code a dynamic system where adding recipes is easy (apparently this is called a CMS?) so that they do not have to be entered manually each time after new content is added.

webdev,I (instructor) learned webdev to make better course content. What do I need to ask our IT for to have it hosted?,"I'm not a web developer, except by what I've taught myself over the last year or so. I am not a professional in any related fields.... I am a machinist, G-code is my main programming language. I've learned webdev to serve better content to my students, I don't know any backend and don't really care to. 

We use Canvas lms for all of our classes. It has an html editor, but only allows a very restricted set of tags... Inline styles only, no comments or whitespace, can't use &lt;style&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, or &lt;script&gt;, so why even bother? 

I can upload a file/folder with html, css, and js files to Canvas and embed the html into a course page through the rich content editor (generates an iframe). The html can access other files in the same folder using relative links, just like you'd want. Only problem is that iOS devices won't load any of that, which kills the whole idea, because the whole point is to make the content more accessible on mobile.

So, what then? I need a way to host the content so that I can embed it on Canvas, but it needs to be accessible only through Canvas (not publicly accessible), without requiring students to log in. I am actively avoiding storing any student data of any kind... I just want to deliver well presented responsive content and mini-games/interactive exercises.

Where's the team located that maintains seller central? I hope someone notices this and gets their act together. This has to be one of the worst performing webapps I've used in a while.

If anyone here works on this webapp, maybe you can share some insider scoop about why/how this application became like this.

webdev,ISO advice on hosting + security/auth?,"I'm looking for some advice on hosting + authentication schemes for some really simple hobby use web services.

Like dumb example, but say I wanted to make my own python-flask based ""web app"" with an API to control my own ""IoT"" light switch via a central server. Maybe an Android app that can talk to that server, maybe a simple HTML+JS browser UI, and a Linux box (raspberry pi for example) to serve as the IoT ""thing"".

I have enough programming experience in web front-end, backend, app development, and embedded devices to pull all that off from various professional work over the years. Like honestly, I think I could implement *most* of the business logic for it in a day or two if I were to just run it all unencrypted and unauthenticated on a local subnet.  

However... my big knowledge gap is that I have no clue where to start if I want said central server to live in the ""cloud"", or make it reasonably secure. Those have always been delegated as someone else's problem.

Are VPS'es still a good option for something like this? If so, what are some cheap-ish ones for low bandwidth/low storage/low ram applications?

What do I need to have functional HTTPS/TLS without needing to screw around with installing self-signed certs on every client?

And what are some good, proven https client auth schemes that are easy to run on top of all this? Any good all-in-one solutions that could support mobile apps, web clients, and local CLI / headless clients (more like an API key, GitHub PATs, etc), and integrate relatively painless with popular Python web frameworks on the backend?

Anything else I should be aware of?

Also to be clear, not necessarily looking for existing complete solutions for IoT service hosting. Just trying to give an example of the scale/complexity of the type of project I want to build.  

DON'T need:
- complex disturbuted data services,
- load balancing, 
- CDNs, 
- cloud based ML training or execution, 
- support for thousands of users, 
- feature rich CMS, etc.
- Automagic scalability that hits you with crazy bills if something you make accidentally goes viral... like if I exceed my compute or bandwidth caps, I'd prefer to just shut it off for the month and take it as a lesson learned to use resources more effeciently.

DO want:
- A Linux environment where I can run whatever lightweight server I want
- A reasonable level of security to protect stuff I'd rather not have unauthorized users messing with
- A persistent domain name and/or IP address.
- Something in the ballpark of 1GB RAM, 20GB storage (including Linux system partition/install) is likely more than enough.
- SSH-only access + whatever I might need to restart the whole system is fine.

I'd be tempting to try dynamic DNS and a self-hosted mini-PC/raspberry pi sort of thing, but would really rather not mess with sorting out what my ISP allows here, screwing around with router config,  or have uptime impacted by my relatively frequent ISP outages.

Any advice from real web devs appreciated!

When I was job hunting, I found it time-consuming to track jobs across multiple platforms. So I created a tool that centralizes job listings in one place and prioritizes speed — getting job alerts quickly can make a real difference in the hiring process.

How it works:

* scrapes jobs from major job boards
* diffs the list of new found jobs with the ones already ""seen""
* (optionally) filters out jobs based on user input (using ChatGPT)
* sends an alert if there are any new jobs for the user to check out

Basically, when an SVG doesn't have a defined width and height, it will be drawn differently based on browser.


I reported this to OpenLayers ( [#16485](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/issues/16485) ) and they responded:



&gt; The svg is missing width and height properties. Browsers handle things differently when those are missing. This is not something we can influence in the library.

webdev,AWS side project(s) monorepo architecture,"I'm an experienced developer (not web) looking to develop some side projects, but I need some help with architecture:

I will have several small sites, for a variety of small (disparate) business ideas. I have no idea if any of them will get traffic, but I'm assuming that some of them will. I will eventually need the ability to take payment, or make ad revenue. Some of the sites will be static, but others will have some basic user sessions and the ability for users to trigger jobs. Some of them will have somewhat complex data visualisations.

So far I have built a localhost hello world PoC. The frontend is vite, react, tailwind, shadcn, typescript. The backend is go with echo. I'm using open api codegen to generate both redux toolkit queries and the golang echo endpoints, from yaml. It seems like a balance between a lean and powerful setup.

My next step is to get cloud hello world: I want to deploy to AWS. I've used AWS a bit but I'm far from an expert.

What I would like to know is a suitable architecture for my needs. One that supports this zoo of small sites, with as small amount of cost as possible (time and money) as I will be the sole developer and I have very limited time. I want to be able to immediately set up some visibility and analytics, so that I can see traffic, gather feedback, and debug problems. Moreover, I want to get s**t done, and to easily be able to pick up the project in months/years time without being stuck in upgrade and versioning hell (and to easily remember what I was doing). I would prefer IaC and to avoid clickops or manual steps.

Please suggest me an architecture!

~~~~~~

PS

I have asked GPT and I got alternative suggestions:

1. Single EC2 instance with docker compose for each site, and nginx reverse proxy. Use Route 53 for domain routing. Certbot for certificates. Deploy manually or with a github action to ssh into the box.

2. Serve frontends from Cloudfront pointing to S3 buckets containing the site. API Gateway + Lambda for backend. Dynamo/S3 for storage. Cognito JWT for authentication. Lambda + EventBridge/SQS for jobs. CDK or Terraform. Cloudwatch and Cloudfront logs.

~~~~~~

I would also appreciate tips on aws account/credential management and how to make my dev flow as efficient as possible. I use 1Password already, I'm familiar with github actions etc

webdev,Scalable Membership Management and SSO Solution for a Multi-Platform Cannabis Community?,"Hello all of you devs more experienced than me,  
I’m building a membership-based community project that integrates various online platforms, including:

* A WordPress-based website (currently managing memberships).
* A Discourse-powered forum.
* Additional modules like an interactive map, blog a collaborative jukebox, dating module, and AI tools.

Right now, the site is running on WordPress with a free membership plugin (integrated with PayPal) and is also the SSO provider for Discourse. While this works for now, I’m concerned about scalability and integrating future modules that may use different technologies.

My main requirements are:

1. Easy integration with SSO across multiple platforms.
2. Flexible membership management.
3. Support for recurring payments (preferably PayPal).
4. Role-based access for features tied to membership tiers.

Should I stick with WordPress for memberships and SSO, or should I move to a dedicated solution? Are there better approaches I haven’t considered?

Right now, the project is in the earliest stage of designing and prototyping, so I'm happy to hear your low-budget suggestions. But I'm well aware nothing's free and as soon there will be an income, I can move to more robust, scalable solutions, so I'm happy to hear them too!

webdev,Dashboard and sub-apps question,"Hello there, I'd like to ask you for some advice.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First some intro:

We have a big Jakarte EE application, that is composed of different smaller applications or modules.  
These modules are built of backend (Java) and SPA counterparts (Svelte), both in one WAR that is redeployable as a single piece.

In our current solution, we have one Dashboard application, which handles SSO authentication and building menu according to user's privileges.  
This application renders the frame of application (menu and header) and inside it is iframe, which points to the selected application from menu.

All this works nice, but we've been told that iframes are bad practice and we should get rid of them.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here goes my question 1:

Could someone recommend me a possible non-hacky solution, that could preserve our architecture of sub-apps being consisting of backend + SPA counterparts, deployable as one piece. And one Dashboard application that would defacto handle SSO authentication and routing?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2:

What is a industry standard of handling situations like these?  
Is it monolithic SSR frontend server kept standalone alongside backend that provides it with data?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3:

Are iframes actually considered bad practice in this usecase?",fanczee,1hh1yly,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hh1yly/dashboard_and_subapps_question/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hh1yly/dashboard_and_subapps_question/,2024-12-18 13:49:15,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hh1yly
webdev,How to implement client-side encrypted data for groups?,"I would like to implement something where people can store data and files in a database from a web app.
However, the data should be stored encrypted, yet it should be possible for multiple people to access it.


So if Alice creates or modifies data in the application, Bob should also be able to read and modify it if they're working in the same team.

However, an attacker who got access to a database dump should not be able to read it.

I assume that this is something one would need to use the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto)?

Also would I need to store the encrypted data separately then for each user?
So would a team of 10 need to have it stored 10 times?

webdev,"No framework, modern web app expereince","Hey, so Ive been avoiding the big stuff like React, Vue and Angular for years. I did do course on them, made simple hobby projects, but ive always sticked to vanilla. I believe that modern JS allows for easy maintenance of web apps without too much overhead.  
It surely is something true about ""when you dont use a framework, you create one yourself, ofter worse"". But if you have a big picture of the project, you can plan ahead an actually get the stuff done.

How I do it:  
  
**API &amp; Store management**   
We decided with backend on api endpoints and openapi schemas. I then make a universal function for api calls, that uses fetch() and saves/appends/overwrites the response objects to the global Store object. This way, I can access the database data when i need them, and update them asynchronously as well. When needed, i can remove stuff from Store or append them. I can decide if its plain reflection of endpoints or with something added.

**Build process**  
I only install node modules i really need (like sass or minify) and then in package.json, i just specify the calls based on the environment:

    ""scripts"": {
      ""dev"": ""sh code/build process_dev"",
      ""stage"": ""sh code/build process_stage"",
      ""production"": ""sh code/build process_production""
    }

where build being the shell script with simple functions either calling node modules or simple coreutils programs for copying etc. like so:

    compile() {
      sass ./sass/style.scss:./public/na.css
    }
    
    minifyCSS() {
      cleancss -o ./public/na.min.css ./public/na.css
    }

**Router**  
Very simple use of history api, called on init and on calls when needed

webdev,Created yet another cover letter generator,"Hey all!

I am a full stack developer from Berlin. When applying to jobs, I found myself chatting with ChatGPT to help draft a cover letter, which became tedious, and took about 15 mins per cover letter.

I ended up creating a cover letter generator ([CoverCraft AI](https://covercraftai.com/)), which I published as open source to GitHub to show off my skills. It's free to use and has been really helpful for me. It now takes less than 5 mins to create a personalized cover letter and immediately download a PDF.

Do check it out! Looking forward to feedback :)

Cheers,

webdev,Reputable docker container brands?,"Hey, really new to docker, tried to learn it a few times but it never sticks. I'm trying to integrate it but I'm a little worried. What is a good reputable docker container maker to use?

Any recommendations?

  
Right now I'm learning about build stages so I'm building my SvelteKit app in one phase and trying to push it to another container in another phase to make the container as tiny as possible!
