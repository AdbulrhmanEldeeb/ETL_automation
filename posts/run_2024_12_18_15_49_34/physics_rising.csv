Physics,Black holes and singularities,"If it is recognized that black holes require a quantum gravitational description to understand what is going on inside them and that such description will “remove” the singularities in black holes, why do physicists still commonly refer to the singularities in black holes?  Is it the case under any potential theory that something like a singularity is still there but modified according to a new theory? Perhaps we know that quantum gravity must necessarily require that a point inside a black hole be a point in the future of any object crossing into it? (i.e. the space and time coordinates flipping roles)  

Further, if singularities either do not exist or are not point-like, could that “flip” of space and time coordinates also be in question?  Or perhaps it is instead the case that the physics of the outside no longer applies within the black hole or that what is really going on is that the entire future of anything that goes inside is now determined solely by the physics within for the rest of its lifetime?  An entire history then could ensue satisfying the condition that the object has a future in some manifold.  Could this square with the possibility of black holes being baby universes?  From the outside perspective all that we know is that anything crossing the event horizon has a future, but we don’t know that their future has relational properties that are analogous to the ones we observe in the universe at large.",No_Marsupial2851,1hh45r4,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hh45r4/black_holes_and_singularities/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hh45r4/black_holes_and_singularities/,2024-12-18 15:35:54,0,0.5,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hh45r4

Physics,Tips and resources for IGCSE physics students,"I know that many IGCSE students are struggling with the physics exam, so here I have some tips from my IGCSE experience!   
For more information, you can always take a look at the subreddit [r/IGCSESciences](/r/IGCSESciences/).

First, here are some important things to take note of.

The November 2024 season results will be announced on January 16, 2025. If you would like to check your results online that day, remember to register for a Cambridge English Online Results Service account earlier before! An email will be sent to you when the results are ready.

[https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/see-exam-results-online/](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/see-exam-results-online/)

For those who are going to sit the June 2025 season, don’t panic! Here are some tips for you.

First, remember to check and mark down the examination dates carefully. You won’t want to forget an exam!

And you really have to start organising your notes now, in my experience. Start revising as soon as you have done that.

Don’t forget to take breaks during revision, though. Study in an undisturbed environment. It can be your room, or the library studying zone.

It’s also very beneficial to do at least ten years worth of past papers, and check the answers carefully:

Do them a few more times detailedly, under a strict time limit using a real timer. Mark down the answers you got wrong and evaluate the reasons for arriving at these wrong answers. Read at the mark scheme carefully so you’ll know what to write for long questions and calculations.

Physics,Sourcing Cosmological Data - E.g. Type Ia Supernovae Spectra &amp;  CMB ,"Hello Everyone,

Not sure if this might be more suited to a more specific subreddit, but I'm sure this will one do.

I'm currently in the process of studying physics and cosmology, and as someone with some programming knowledge, I thought it would be fun to calculate the age of the universe using Python with math libraries as a way to learn more. I wish to make a calculation a fair bit more precise and in line with current cosmological understanding rather than, for example, a simpler equation that assumes a constant rate of expansion.

My goal is to approach the problem with as few assumptions as possible and to build the necessary mathematical models and equations from scratch (within reason). I'm particularly interested in using observational data to calculate the required cosmological parameters and ultimately the age of the universe. I'm relatively comfortable with mathematics, including intermediate calculus, which I assume will be sufficient.

As a rough outline, I'm hoping to begin with plotting the Hubble diagram and determining a value for the Hubble constant using the redshift magnitude, recessional velocity, and distance data related to Type Ia supernovae; determining and refining values for a mathematical model of the expansion of the universe with the lamba-CDM model and Friedmann equations; and finally using this to make an accurate calculation. This appears to be a suitable strategy.

I'm searching for sources of data that I can download and use in my calculations. I've searched [https://www.wiserep.org/search/spectra,](https://www.wiserep.org/search/spectra) which is promising but unfortunately doesn't allow me to download the data for some reason.

From what I've figured so far, I'll mainly require the following data:

* Spectroscopic Data - Type Ia Supernovae or Potentially Cepheid Variable - For determining the magnitude of redshift and the recessional velocity
* B-band Magnitude Data for Distance Modulus Calculation - For the above objects (Not sure if this would normally be included)
* Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - Data from the CMB that will assist in calculating/refining certain cosmological parameters, including particular density values, geometric properties of the universe, and others that are present in the Lambda-CDM model and the Friedmann equations.
* Any other suggestions for data to collect that might assist

I'm happy to share the results via a GitHub repo or something similar once completed if anyone is interested. If anyone knows any websites or other materials that I may find useful, please let me know. Also, if I'm potentially operating out of my depth with any of the material here, let me know, and I can change strategies to something a little more simple.

I understand this is quite an in-depth inquiry, and I don't expect a comprehensive answer (researching myself is part of the fun), but I thought I’d reach out in case anyone has any insights or advice they’d be willing to share. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, and I’m grateful for any help offered!",Illustrious-Deal9505,1hfb9c5,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hfb9c5/sourcing_cosmological_data_eg_type_ia_supernovae/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hfb9c5/sourcing_cosmological_data_eg_type_ia_supernovae/,2024-12-16 04:34:53,8,0.75,8,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfb9c5
