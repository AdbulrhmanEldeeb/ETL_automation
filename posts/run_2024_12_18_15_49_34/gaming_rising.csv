gaming,Your taste in games changes as you get older,"I see a lot of memes on the internet about how “games aren’t good anymore” or how the same dopamine doesn’t hit anymore.

It can easily be playing too many video games, but what I see a lot more of is that nobody wants to break the pattern of the games they play. Listen, if you had told me as a kid that I’d love a game more than halo 3 and that I’d think there was a game better than it, I would’ve told you you’re absolutely insane. For the next 15 years, my favorite game was still halo even as the series got worse (I mean I still play halo infinite with the boys, but it’s not my go-to game anymore).

“I like FPS and I’m not good at other games” I told myself

Wrong. The peak of gaming to me is Rimworld now and I’ve gotten pretty good at grand strategy 4x games. I enjoy them a lot now. FPS is still fun every now and then, but it’s not what it was for me before. Is it because of the FPS games made today? Well how could it be? Hero shooters like valorant and overwatch exist. CS:GO got an update and seems stronger than ever. 

My point is that there are more great video games than ever, the indie industry is in a golden age, and the best video games are literally free. If you think “games aren’t good anymore”, it’s not the games that aren’t good anymore, it’s the game you’re playing isn’t good to you anymore.
