I'm a 3rd-year CS student and have recently decided to try freelancing as a web and AI/ML developer. I’ve done a gig with my friend for cheap, but I’m essentially starting from scratch in terms of navigating the freelancing world. I've created an account on Fiverr and have some basic knowledge about other platforms like Toptal and Contra, but I’m completely new to the process of actually getting gigs or jobs.

I’m hoping to get some advice from more experienced freelancers on:

1. How to effectively pitch myself to clients.
2. What kind of projects I should start with (e.g., simple web development tasks, AI/ML mini-projects, etc.).
3. How to build a solid portfolio that attracts clients.
4. Any tips for pricing my services, especially as a student.
5. How to deal with common challenges that beginners face (e.g., low balling, competition, etc.).

If you’ve freelanced in the web or AI/ML space, I’d really appreciate any tips, resources, or personal experiences you can share!

I'm working a full time job as a welder but I'm sick of the trade and want something else so I started the Harward online cs50 course. 

My question is for you who've done it similar way, were you able to learn the basic understanding of coding from this course that then helped you to either choose your preferred language and/ or helped you to a point tak you were able to make some money on the side?

Or completely different direction, did the course help you to learn so much you were able to quit your full time job and pursue career in programming?

I'm taking this course because I can only allocate nights from 7pm-9:30pm each weekday and this course seems the most recommended and sounds quite fun and I'm just wondering if it's worth taking it and if it'll give me an actual value i can turn into profit.

Problem:
We're trying to build a regression model to predict a target variable. However, the target variable contains outliers, which are significantly different from the majority of the data points. Additionally, the predictor variables are highly correlated with each other (high multicollinearity). Despite trying various models like linear regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, along with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV, we're unable to achieve the desired R-squared score of 0.16.
Goal:
To develop a robust regression model that can effectively handle outliers and multicollinearity, and ultimately achieve the target R-squared score.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about starting a YouTube channel to share my experiences and help others in their tech journey. But honestly, I’m a bit stuck on what kind of content to create. YouTube is already packed with so many tutorials and courses, and I want to make something that stands out or at least feels helpful and fresh.

Here are some ideas I have in mind:

1. **One-shot videos for different tech stacks**: Quick, beginner-friendly overviews of various tech stacks, helping viewers understand the basics and explore further on their own.
2. **DSA-focused content**: A complete LeetCode or DSA playlist. (Although this is very common on YouTube already.)
3. **System design content**: Creating different products from scratch, like building your own version of Vercel, GitHub, or a DNS server, along with their architecture (inspired by creators like Piyush Garg and Harkirat Singh).
4. **Project-based learning**: Long, detailed tutorials for building multiple projects using different tech stacks.
5. **Language-specific playlists**: Comprehensive, long-form content for mastering a specific programming language.
6. **Daily learning vlogs**: Sharing my daily tasks, challenges, and learnings related to software development (tech-focused content only).

learnprogramming,Help me understand time in python,"I'm working through some programing exersizes and one is to create a program which counts calories for a user and returns calories burned at specific times in minutes(10,15,20,25,30). The user burns calories at a constant rate of 3.9 cal/min:

    import time as t
    
    
    def calorie_count(workout_time):
        calories_burned = CALORIES_PER_MINUTE * workout_time
        print(""you've burned "", calories_burned, "" calories in "", workout_time, "" minutes!"")

This is what I came up with that worked. I imagined something cooler and I did all the flowcharting that I needed to complete with a few functions, problem is I don't know enough about the date time module or time in python to actually implement what I ""engineered"":

What I wanted to do was create a case/switch function which would run my ""calorie\_count"" function at the specified intervals and print calories burned.

learnprogramming,Seeking Guidance to Relaunch My IT Career After an Extended Hiatus,"Hello :)

I graduated in Computer Science about 10 years ago, having spent one year of my undergraduate studies in the USA. I have advanced/fluent English and speak other languages at an intermediate level, such as Spanish, French, and Italian. During my degree, I was very dedicated—I always participated in research projects and extracurricular activities. I have a solid foundation and a strong ability to learn in programming, databases, and software engineering.

In contrast to this strong theoretical foundation and affinity for the field, unfortunately, I have little market experience. In IT, I only worked during my mandatory internship (6 months in software development) and approximately a year and a half at a BIG FOUR, which turned out to be a huge disappointment. There was zero intellectual challenge—just endless hours of repeating processes that required none of the technical knowledge I had. I would say it was practically a null experience in terms of IT.

Shortly before my time at the BIG FOUR ended, I was far along in a selection process to work in software development in central FLORIDA. However, for family reasons, I couldn’t accept the position or continue working in the field because my family needed my full-time help—and for me, family always comes first.

Well… now that my family matters are resolved, I intend to return to my IT career. In the meantime, I had some freelance experiences on platforms like UPWork and Workana, developing websites using WordPress, but nothing particularly relevant to build a strong portfolio.

In summary, I’m an IT professional with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, solid theoretical knowledge, ease of learning, and great interpersonal and communication skills. However, I have very little practical experience and have been away from the field for about eight years. I’m looking to resume my career and am open to your suggestions on where to start. I believe the ideal scenario would be a remote job that pays in dollars and is suitable for someone with little experience. I'm even willing to take an unpaid internship or get a job with a low hourly rate.

Thank you in advance for your time and attention, and I hope to also contribute to the community in some way.

learnprogramming,CloudFront is too costly for streaming—need advice on a better setup,"Hey everyone,

I’ve set up my own video streaming solution on AWS, including transcoding to generate HLS files and storing them in S3. Everything works great—except for the streaming costs, which are way higher than I expected.

I initially planned to use CloudFront, but the cost is crazy expensive. Based on my calculations:

* A 60-minute video streamed to 1,000 users costs about **$229.50/hour** using CloudFront.
   * Calculation: 0.75 MB/s \* 1000 users \* 3600 seconds = \~2700 GB/hour. At $0.085/GB, that’s $229.50/hour.

For my use case (a VOD platform for an education center), that adds up to over $1000/month just for streaming, which isn’t sustainable.

I’m exploring alternatives like Cloudflare, which seems significantly cheaper. At the same time, I’m wondering if I should reconsider Mux, even though I initially avoided it due to pricing.

Has anyone dealt with similar issues? What cost-effective streaming solutions have worked for you? I’d love to hear your experiences and suggestions!",space_dont_exist,1hgx9xc,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hgx9xc/cloudfront_is_too_costly_for_streamingneed_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hgx9xc/cloudfront_is_too_costly_for_streamingneed_advice/,2024-12-18 08:27:35,2,1.0,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hgx9xc

I’m currently in my first year of university studying Computer Science, but I already have substantial experience in programming and development. I’ve recently started preparing for GSoC 2025 and wanted to kick things off early by contributing to some projects.

I’m revisiting a few interesting projects from last year’s GSoC (2024) that align well with my tech stack, and I’m torn on the best strategy:

* Should I focus on contributing actively to *just one* project to show deeper involvement and commitment?
* Or would contributing to 2-3 projects that align with my skills be more valuable for demonstrating versatility and consistent contributions?

I want to make sure that once applications open, I’ll have some solid contributions to showcase.

If you’ve been through GSoC or have any tips, I’d greatly appreciate your advice! Any other general recommendations for preparing at this stage would be super helpful too.

learnprogramming,Bsc in Computer Science ?,"Is Starting a Computer Science BSc with an Earth Science MSc a Good Idea?

I hold an MSc in Earth Science and have been considering starting a BSc in Computer Science. My main motivation stems from the challenges of finding stable and family-friendly work in geology. The industry often involves long shifts, extensive travel, and jobs far from home, which has made me reevaluate my career path.

What excites me about computer science is the potential to combine it with my Earth Science background. Could my knowledge in geology and Earth sciences be integrated with programming, data analysis, or machine learning to create a unique skill set? For example, could I apply computer science to geospatial analysis, simulation modeling, or real-time data prediction in geological research?

On the flip side, I am concerned about the investment—both financial and time-related. Would it be worth committing to a completely new degree when I already have an advanced qualification? Would this transition be feasible and rewarding in the long run, or am I overestimating the compatibility of these two fields?

learnprogramming,Looking for fun creative/creative writing adjacent projects for my first attempts learning Python,"Hey all! I'm extremely new to programming. I have the software needed but only did a Hello World. However, I'm getting a comp sci degree and so far have learned several basic concepts via pseudocode that I know want to test out and fuck around with. Stacks, queues, lists, arrays, loops, etc, I have starting familiarity with how they work.


I originally wanted to be a writer but that doesn't pay the bills so I've shifted to combining my writing hobby with developing my software engineer skills. I frequent this sub and see pretty often that it's suggested tinkering with a project I actually care about is a good idea so I'm looking for a good starting point. 


I know there's Ren Py for visual novels but I don't know how much coding I would actually learn doing that if it's too modular - I do eventually want a job in the field. Making little games or prototypes for games seems the right path but I'm specifically looking for how to mess around with games that lean on writing in particular. Or maybe games aren't the right answer at all! 


I haven't gone far into tutorials but I don't want to get stuck in them so I wanted to point myself in the direction of a project that I can apply what I learn to and fuck around with.
