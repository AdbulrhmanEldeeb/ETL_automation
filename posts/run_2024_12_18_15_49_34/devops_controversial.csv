devops,Secret Scanning repos org-wide - Feasible?,"I'm at my 3rd company now that has no had any type of secret detection in GitHub aside from the main product repos. These aren't public, they are part of the internal org, so the blast radius is somewhat limited.

However all 3 companies have refused to get GH advanced security features which would give us secret detection. I've been thinking about coding up something as a project with other team members a scanner that would continuously scan code across the entire organization and run the yelp detect-secrets cli to detect passwords, API keys, etc. committed to git.

Are there any tools that do this already, and how feasible is this? There seem to be a million ways to detect secrets already, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipelines w/ protected branches, etc., but they can all be bypassed. pre-commit hooks are not enforced, CI/CD pipelines can have someone with write access change them, and they don't stop anything. 

The thought process is to control our repos with webhooks (configurable by owners only) that are triggered on every commit. These would send to some compute that scans the commits for secrets, then either sends an alert or pushes a commit automatically with the sensitive text deleted (i.e. api-key=1234 becomes api-key-****)",TopNo6605,1hgr8dj,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hgr8dj/secret_scanning_repos_orgwide_feasible/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hgr8dj/secret_scanning_repos_orgwide_feasible/,2024-12-18 02:10:24,1,0.57,1,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hgr8dj

devops,Deployment confusion and other concerns,"We are using AWS. I just learned about SOPS few days ago. We have 3 AWS accounts, DEV, STAGE and PRODUCTION. We also have Hashicorp Vault servers for each AWS accounts.

From what I read today from SOPS documentation, it looks like it can upload encrypted yaml or json to Vault using KMS. I hope I interpreted it right. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Currently, our users are using vault cli to update their secrets in vault. They asked about tracking of their secret keys. I mentioned SOPS to them and also mentioned that the encrypted yaml or json file can be stored in our git repository. However, that will require an automated pipeline to be created so that it can send the encrypted file to Vault. They didn't like the idea since they look like in a rush for a solution. So I mentioned they can directly upload the encrypted file to Vault using vault cli. However, they said ""***We can do that but this doesn't prevent someone from our team from making a mistake in upload a non-encrypted json file***"".

And regarding the deployment of encrypted json to different environments, do you folks have a dedicated engineer per environment that is responsible for uploading encrypted file? Don't you use CI/CD for deployments of the encrypted file?

devops,Looking for tool to produce documentation from templates files,"

I there anyone aware of any tools/frameworks for producing documentation (in MS Word or PDF format) from templated markdown files (could be multiple tools chained together)?



I have been task with rewriting and updating a lot of old ""formal""  technical documentation (think architectural, instructions, and DR documents) for systems. A lot of our systems follow the same design patterns, so currently we have a lot of generic wiki pages (in markdown) by myself, outlining the overall designs, procedures, etc.



As I been told I need to produce a document for each system (even if it copying and pasting simlar text/diagrams between documents).  I am now wounding if there any good tool to take templates (which can make use of varibles) and stich them together. I am even thinking to try and to hook it into CD pipeline so once a templates file is update, it can produce a new document and publish it. 



Unfortunately presenting this documentation on the source controlled Wiki is not a option for business - however as long as they get a word/pdf document at the end of the process they are happy.



(apologies, i know this might not be ""devops"" but I suspect this subreddit might have some suggestions on how to modernize documentation generation).
