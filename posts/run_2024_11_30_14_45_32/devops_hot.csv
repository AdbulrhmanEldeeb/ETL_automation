devops,'Getting into DevOps',"**What is DevOps?**

* [AWS has a great article](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) that outlines DevOps as a work environment where development and operations teams are no longer ""siloed"", but instead work together across the entire application lifecycle -- from development and test to deployment to operations -- and automate processes that historically have been manual and slow.

**Books to Read**

* [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/1942788290) - one of the original books to delve into DevOps culture, explained through the story of a fictional company on the brink of failure.
* [The DevOps Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1942788002) - a practical ""sequel"" to The Phoenix Project.
* [Google's Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) - Google engineers explain how they build, deploy, monitor, and maintain their systems.
* [The Site Reliability Workbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/toc/) - The practical companion to the Google's Site Reliability Engineering Book
* [The Unicorn Project](https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Project-Developers-Disruption-Thriving-ebook/dp/B07QT9QR41) - the ""sequel"" to The Phoenix Project.
* [DevOps for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Dummies-Computer-Tech-ebook/dp/B07VXMLK3J/) - don't let the name fool you.

**What Should I Learn?**

* [Emily Wood's essay](https://crate.io/a/infrastructure-as-code-part-one/) - why infrastructure as code is so important into today's world.
* [2019 DevOps Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#devops-roadmap) - one developer's ideas for which skills are needed in the DevOps world. This roadmap is controversial, as it may be too use-case specific, but serves as a good starting point for what tools are currently in use by companies.
* [This comment by /u/mdaffin](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/abcyl2/sorry_having_a_midlife_tech_crisis/eczhsu1/) - just remember, DevOps is a mindset to solving problems. It's less about the specific tools you know or the certificates you have, as it is the way you approach problem solving.
* [This comment by /u/jpswade](https://gist.github.com/jpswade/4135841363e72ece8086146bd7bb5d91) - what is DevOps and associated terminology.
* [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) - Step by step guide for DevOps or any other Operations Role

Remember: DevOps as a term and as a practice is still in flux, and is more about culture change than it is specific tooling. As such, specific skills and tool-sets are not universal, and recommendations for them should be taken only as suggestions.

devops,"How should this sub respond to reddit's api changes, part 2","We stand with the disabled users of reddit and in our community. Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy blind/visually impaired communities will be more dependent on sighted people for moderation. When Reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps for the disabled, they are not telling the full story.
TL;DR

    Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy will force blind/visually impaired communities to further depend on sighted people for moderation

    When reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps, they are not telling the full story, because Apollo, RIF, Boost, Sync, etc. are the apps r/Blind users have overwhelmingly listed as their apps of choice with better accessibility, and Reddit is not whitelisting them. Reddit has done a good job hiding this fact, by inventing the expression ""accessibility apps.""

    Forcing disabled people, especially profoundly disabled people, to stop using the app they depend on and have become accustomed to is cruel; for the most profoundly disabled people, June 30 may be the last day they will be able to access reddit communities that are important to them.

If you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks:

Reddit abruptly announced that they would be charging astronomically overpriced API fees to 3rd party apps, cutting off mod tools for NSFW subreddits (not just porn subreddits, but subreddits that deal with frank discussions about NSFW topics).

And worse, blind redditors &amp; blind mods [including mods of r/Blind and similar communities] will no longer have access to resources that are desperately needed in the disabled community.
Why does our community care about blind users?

As a mod from r/foodforthought testifies:

    I was raised by a 30-year special educator, I have a deaf mother-in-law, sister with MS, and a brother who was born disabled. None vision-impaired, but a range of other disabilities which makes it clear that corporations are all too happy to cut deals (and corners) with the cheapest/most profitable option, slap a ""handicap accessible"" label on it, and ignore the fact that their so-called ""accessible"" solution puts the onus on disabled individuals to struggle through poorly designed layouts, misleading marketing, and baffling management choices. To say it's exhausting and humiliating to struggle through a world that able-bodied people take for granted is putting it lightly.

Reddit apparently forgot that blind people exist, and forgot that Reddit's official app (which has had over 9 YEARS of development) and yet, when it comes to accessibility for vision-impaired users, Reddit’s own platforms are inconsistent and unreliable. ranging from poor but tolerable for the average user and mods doing basic maintenance tasks (Android) to almost unusable in general (iOS).
Didn't reddit whitelist some ""accessibility apps?""

The CEO of Reddit announced that they would be allowing some ""accessible"" apps free API usage: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna.

There's just one glaring problem: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna* apps have very basic functionality for vision-impaired users (text-to-voice, magnification, posting, and commenting) but none of them have full moderator functionality, which effectively means that subreddits built for vision-impaired users can't be managed entirely by vision-impaired moderators.

(If that doesn't sound so bad to you, imagine if your favorite hobby subreddit had a mod team that never engaged with that hobby, did not know the terminology for that hobby, and could not participate in that hobby -- because if they participated in that hobby, they could no longer be a moderator.)

Then Reddit tried to smooth things over with the moderators of r/blind. The results were... Messy and unsatisfying, to say the least.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/

*Special shoutout to Luna, which appears to be hustling to incorporate features that will make modding easier but will likely not have those features up and running by the July 1st deadline, when the very disability-friendly Apollo app, RIF, etc. will cease operations. We see what Luna is doing and we appreciate you, but a multimillion dollar company should not have have dumped all of their accessibility problems on what appears to be a one-man mobile app developer. RedReader and Dystopia have not made any apparent efforts to engage with the r/Blind community.

Thank you for your time &amp; your patience.

devops,Recommended Setup for a Data Project. ,"Hello All,

I’m currently working on a small data project and exploring the best AWS setup to meet my needs now and in the future. Currently I have the following setup working: 

* Large number of different CSV files stored in S3 (new files are added daily).
* I’ve used AWS Glue to map the files into tables.
* For querying, I’m using Athena.

So far, the setup has been straightforward (this is my first time using AWS), and it’s working as intended aside from a few minor bugs I managed to fix.  
  
I’m looking to build a **front-end service** where users can:

* Visually query the data without writing SQL.
* See results presented in graphs, tables, etc.

Right now, I’m querying Athena manually, but it’s not very user-friendly since you have to write SQL queries every time, and if I want to add more people to the project this can simply become unusable. Also, there are strange issues with Athena. For instance, when querying small numbers like `0.0005` or `0.00003`, Athena returns them in scientific notation, I have no idea why it does that.  

Some thoughts and considerations I have:

* As far as I understand, Athena may not be cost-effective at scale.
* I’m considering whether setting up a dedicated database to store the data (instead of querying directly from S3) might be better. 
   * New CSV files are added to S3 daily, so the database would need **daily updates**, ideally automated.
* **Speed is not a priority**, so some latency is acceptable.
* Since I’m still learning, I’d prefer tools and workflows that are **user-friendly** and straightforward to implement.

**Looking for Advice:**

* Should I move the data into a database? If so, which one would you recommend (e.g., Redshift, RDS, etc.) I've red about the different ones but I'm not sure I truly understand what's better. Not to mention this also means that I'll need to connect this to a server? Where is the 'compute power'? 
* What front-end solutions would work well for visual querying and displaying results? I've used QuickSight but I don't really think it's what I'm looking for. I've started experimenting with Next.JS and Vercel. 
* Any tips on automating daily updates from S3 to a database?

I’d appreciate any recommendations or insights, especially from those with similar experiences.   
Many Thanks!",Badger00000,1h39uax,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h39uax/recommended_setup_for_a_data_project/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h39uax/recommended_setup_for_a_data_project/,2024-11-30 10:28:09,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h39uax

It essentially allows fleet of proxies to use centralized authentication without the need for proxies to communicate with any central server directly. It works like this: some entity (e.g. API server) issues HMAC-signed token with limited validity time to the users. Users can't forge HMAC-signed token because they don't know secret key, while proxy can validate signature sent by user as credentials and decide to allow access immediately, without any need to communicate with central server or database to check user's password and status. All relevant information to allow access is already carried by users within their requests.

devops,Exploring Non-Containerized Alternatives for Faster Shell Script Testing,"Docker and Dockerfile offer fast builds because they cache each command from the Dockerfile. This caching allows the build process to skip previously successful steps when an error occurs, only re-running the steps from the point where the failure happened. This works by leveraging isolated environments. But what if I need to use the local host environment instead of containers?

Another challenge arises when writing one or more shell scripts, especially when certain steps take a long time to process. In this case, any change requires starting the entire process over from the beginning, which can be very time-consuming.

My idea is to leverage Git, .gitignore (or avoid using it entirely), a Virtual File System (other than containers), and File System Watchers. The goal would be to commit each shell script for every build step so that we don't have to re-run the successful steps. This would significantly reduce build time by skipping steps that have already succeeded.

However, there are several potential challenges with this approach. For one, managing the state of the build steps in Git could become complex, especially as the number of scripts and changes grows. Using file watchers and a virtual file system may introduce performance overhead or synchronization issues. There's also the potential for creating unnecessary complexity in handling changes that affect multiple steps, or dealing with edge cases where certain steps depend on dynamic conditions that are hard to track.

What are your thoughts on this idea? Are there any non-containerized tools that have already addressed this problem? What challenges or issues do you foresee with this approach?

devops,How do you handle VCS notifications in your team?,"Hi all, dev here.

I’ve been tasked with setting up notifications/alerts from Bitbucket into Slack. From my experience, this is usually handled by DevOps.

Our company does have a DevOps team, but there are only a few of them, and they’re currently busy with more important tasks.

So, how does your team handle notifications about pull requests, builds, or other events from your version control system? Do you use Slack or Teams for this? If so, what kind of functionality do you find most useful? Did you set it up using a pre-built integration, or did you have to build something yourself?

We’ve tried the official Bitbucket app - it’s decent, but not ideal. We have a mono repo, and multiple teams push to the repo, which leads to many non-relevant notifications.

devops,Need advice on logging setup (EMR Spark on EKS),"Hi all,

I work in the data platform team and we manage the infra for EMR Spark on EKS. Currently, the logs are sent to S3 (using fluentd sidecar container) where the users can view them. We are thinking of a way to remove console access from the developers and find a way for developers to still view the logs.

Here are some of the requirements:

\- There should be access control so that the developer of one team cannot view the logs of the other team

\- The developer should be easily able to view the logs

Some context:

In EMR spark has the concept of virtual clusters (namespaces in Kubernetes) so whenever a job is submitted 3 different types of pods are spun up (job runner, driver, executor). There can be multiple executor pods. We want the logs for all of them. We initially thought of sending logs to a central location like Splunk or Elastic Search but we want all of the logs to show up together. By this I mean all the logs of the job runner pod should be continuous as it is easy for the developer to find bugs. Since there will be multiple executor pods if they get mixed, the developer would have to learn some kind of query language to see the logs from a particular executor pod.

What I am thinking of:

I am thinking of exporting the logs to S3 using fluentbit and then building a UI on top of it which can take care of access control and show logs of different pods. This might not be the best approach and I don't want to reinvent the wheel I would love to know if there are any existing solutions that I can use. One problem with this approach is that the logs won't be real-time as I am planning to set the fluentbit flush interval to 10 minutes.

devops,Unpaid oncall.. help,"I’ve been in my role as a DevOps Lead (middle management + hands-on) for almost 2 years, with close to 10 years of experience overall. During the interview process, there was no mention of on-call duties in the job spec or discussions. However, after I joined, I was told I’d need to be part of the on-call rota. It was framed as “just in case” since the infrastructure is stable, and we rarely get alerts.

To be fair, this turned out to be true—our scaling is solid, we don’t deploy to production after 3 PM, and alerts are infrequent. Occasionally, we get RDS or ECS alerts due to poorly optimized queries or APIs, but they’re not regular.

The issue is that we’re a small team, so I’m on call every other week (Monday to Monday). Even with minimal alerts, the expectation to be ready to respond ties me to my laptop and impacts my personal life. I feel I can’t fully relax during on-call weeks, even though incidents are rare.

I’m well-compensated and the role is fully remote, but the on-call rotation wasn’t mentioned during hiring, and my salary wasn’t presented as factoring in on-call duties every other week.

Has anyone faced something similar? How would you approach this with leadership?
I want to raise it professionally, but I’m not sure how to balance acknowledging the positives of my role with expressing the impact this has on my personal time.

\- Software Compisition Analysis - SCA - Figure out vulnerabilities in packages eg. nuget, npm etc

\- Secret scanning

\- Container and Docker file Vulnerability scanning

and many others

As part of the adoption into our development team, I do not want us to be blocked by a deluge of information.

I am thinking a practical way of introducing a product like this would be

\- Do a baseline scan of the main branch of the repo, and identity the top bugs/issues and create a backlog and a plan to fix them over the next few weeks/months.

\- Enable PR gating ensuring all the above checks are run and if any new vulnerabilities/code smells get added - we get notified/alerted. It will be \*hopefully\* easier to fix something newly introduced as part of a new PR than fix all the bugs introduced over the last 12 months or so!

I am struggling a bit with a task that is overlapping a few concepts I am not super well versed in and looking to get pointed in the right direction.

We also have the certificates stored in azure key vaults per application/environment so deployments can pick them up there when needed, however this doesnt help if a cert expires between deployments and we are looking at ways to automate cert checking and deployment independently of code.

Right now we are going down the path of a ton of powershell and I feel like really over complicating the situation, ultimately we are trying to accomplish this workflow:

Automate pipeline run overnight to check web servers certificates for expired or soon to be expiring certificates ( &lt; 15 days for example). If a certificate gets flagged as expiring or expiring soon, check the associated key vault for a new version of the certificate and install it, update the binding in IIS and remove the old certificate from the server.

devops,Will management retaliate against us someway somehow in the future because all the seniors threatened to quit without notice for assigning us to be on call without extra compensation?,"
Basically the situation is we signed on more clients (DoD customers) and federal sales promised them 24/7 support for our product which was a requirement from the client. We discussed it with mgmt and we were ok with rotation on call if we get extra bump in salary to reflect the extra hours we will be working. Management said their will be no extra compensation as it will be expected duties as assigned. 

Well that didn't go well and 3 of our most senior architects who built the product quit the same day after we had a all hands call on about this. 4 more engineers put in their notice. Had an ""emergency"" meeting this morning and magically they have funds to give all of us a bump in our pay for working on call. Those 4 engineers decided to rescind their resignation. 

Only reason they can't get rid of us is because we all are Cloud, Infrastructure, SRE, Platform engineers with security clearances. They can't just off shore our jobs and can't really find qualified engineers with senior level knowledge and low-ball another candidate. 

Although they relented, I feel as though I should just quit anyways because I have a feeling management isn't just going to swallow their pride and let this go for threatening to quit. I don't know if I'm being paranoid.

Good day,

We are an R&amp;D team developing Python-based solutions, and we're gearing up to productize our first prototype. As we're relatively new to this, we want to design a scalable and maintainable system, and we're planning to leverage the Azure suite. Here's what we're aiming for:

1. **Model Training**: Ability to train machine learning models on a per-customer basis.
2. **Customer-Specific Data**: Securely store and manage customer-specific variables or parameters.
3. **Deployment**: Create a system that's easy to deploy and manage, ideally automated through CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure both horizontal (adding more nodes) and vertical (upgrading resources) scalability to meet performance demands.
5. **Standardization**: Define reusable, consistent practices for development, deployment, and scaling.
6. **DevOps Best Practices**: Establish strong DevOps workflows tailored to Python and Azure ecosystems.

We're looking for **resources** (books, online courses, blogs, etc.) to help us create this knowledge base and build a system that supports these goals. Ideally, something that focuses on:

* Azure-specific tooling (e.g., Azure ML, Azure DevOps, AKS).
* Python-based workflows.
* Best practices for CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and containerization (e.g., Docker/Kubernetes).

If you have experience with a similar setup or know of any great resources, we'd love to hear your recommendations!

devops,Experiences with Database DevOps,"So, I'm basically looking for some suggestions/experiences on managing databases from a DevOps perspective. 

We're a small company, do lots of software releases per week, and consider ourselves pretty mature from the perspective of CI/CD automation and control. 

But we're still kind of stuck with databases. We're not big enough to justify having a dedicated DBA, so most the devs have pretty free reign when it comes to DB architecture for their apps, as well as running queries when troubleshooting production. 

Deeper performance/optimisation stuff is still done by our SRE-esque people such as me.

We have a cobbled-together process for DB changes, but it's pretty manual and still error prone. Tickets have to be logged and assigned to someone with the correct access (i.e. me), etc. When devs want to run a query in production, we have insufficient guardrails to prevent them tanking app performance or even accidentally deleting data. From a compliance perspective, we don't have enough observability. 

We have a mixture of DB technologies; Mongo, MySQL, MSSQL. There is some usage of things like EntityFramework, but not for managing changes to DBs, so it's not really feasible to try and ressurect them. I'd like a standard process for all DBs.

So I'm interested to know what tools other people are using. I found [kviklet.dev](http://kviklet.dev) and as a free and simple tool it seems nice. I particularly like the ability to provide time-boxed access to run queries, along with PR-style approval for changes in production. Plus the fact that all queries against the DB are logged.

But I'm worried that it's still very Beta, the discussion on the next release has gone quiet since June, and there's been very little activity on it in general. So I don't want to bring this into our process only to find it abandoned in six months.

I've found the usuals like Liquibase and Flyway, but they don't seem to also have the functionality of ""general controlled access to run queries against databases"".

devops,Is there a catch here? Why choose DigitalOcean when Hosting*r offers so much more?,"I’ve been comparing hosting options for the early stages of a social network project. I came across two options that seem wildly different in terms of the resources they offer:

|**Specification**|**DigitalOcean Basic (2 vCPUs, 2GB)**|Hosting\*r KVM8 (8 vCPUs, 32GB)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**vCPUs**|2|8|
|**RAM**|2 GB|32 GB|
|**Disk Space**|60 GB SSD|400 GB NVMe SSD|
|**Bandwidth**|3 TB/month|32 TB/month|
|**Cost**|$18/month|$20/month|

The resources offered by Hosting&amp;r are so much higher that it seems too good to be true. I get that there’s likely a difference in quality. For example, even if Hosting&amp;r’s 32GB RAM doesn’t reach its full capacity and performs more like 10GB in real-world scenarios, it’s still 5x the RAM DigitalOcean provides. The bandwidth difference is also insane - 32TB vs. just 3TB.

Given that I’m building a social network in its early stages with about 100 users initially, is there a major reason to stick with DigitalOcean? Are there hidden trade-offs in Hosting&amp;r’s offering that I might be overlooking? Or does the sheer quantity of resources compensate for any quality differences?

devops,Why is it hard to hire good Devops Experts ? ,"
I’ve talked to so many people—team leads, managers( even from some of the top product companies who are willing to pay higher than industry average), and even startup/unicorn  founders—and there’s one complaint I hear over and over: it’s really hard to hire good DevOps people. They’re always saying things like, “It’s so tough to find someone with the right depth of skills.” What’s your take on this? Why do you think hiring DevOps experts is such a challenge? Have you faced the same issue in your own experience?

Edit 1: 
I agree while there are some who want to underpay and ask the sky, this cohort also includes a folks from some of the top product companies who  work with as part of my corporate workshops. 
The complaint is more of n the lines of depth of skills. Their say is people put 15 different skills in their resume, have certifications as well, but seem to have surface level knowledge. I have rephrased the original question accordingly. 

Edit 2 : 

I am not a recruiter. I am a corporate trainer, specialised in Devops , and ofcourse a self made Devops guy who started with his Linux/ops/tech ops career even before devops as a word was born. . The reason why I ask this is to provoke both sides, companies who want to hire but struggling ( not because of cost reasons, people who want to underpay for someone who is adding lot of value, let them suffer, and rot them in hell… ) and techies who want to make a career in devops and struggling to think about the root cause and the real problems, and come up with solutions, together.

I am doing some research on how to create a better testing environment for a project I am involved in. Currentlyt we have a very cumbersome test environment for this project, and everyone is stepping on each others toe when wanting to test.

What I would like is to automatically spin up an isolated testing environment for each developer when they want to merge their changes ( or at some other step).

devops,Time to give up on DevOps and go into business analysis or nursing?,"Hey gang.

With there being so much competition in the industry, I'm considering abandoning DevOps and retraining into either Business Analytics or Nursing, two fields I expect to be resilient against god-awful economic times.

I've just submitted resume number 1,400 and haven't even scored one single interview anywhere. Yes, **one thousand and four hundre**d job applications have been rejected thus far. This is despite building 13 different iterations of resumes and working with 2 HR professionals (one at a for-profit employment agency) who are completely bewildered with my situation.

After 9 months of unemployment, I've had to sell my house and move in with in-laws. I'm quite frankly considering throwing in the towel, but wanted others to validate my thinking that it's completely hopeless at this point.

My experience:

* One year of experience in 2019 working as a release engineer
* Three years of experience from 2020 to 2023 working as a staff SRE for a startup accelerator / venture capitalist focused on investing in FinTech ideas (not crypto); tl;dr I worked with 5 of its investment properties to improve their DORA metrics and SLIs
* Half a year of experience working as a platform engineer for a healthcare staffing agency; let go thanks to downsizing

My skills:

* I can build a k8s cluster from scratch (without kubeadm); using Kelsey Hightowers guide (""Kubernetes the Hard Way"") as inspiration, I wrote a set of taskfiles that can build an entire cluster from the ground up
* Operational day-to-day experience running a SaaS on k8s: About one year
* Do not possess CKA; Cannot afford to certify without quite literally starving myself and my family for a month
* I had AWS SA-A certification (though it expired in 2023)
* Craptons of experience with Terraform; most likely, several thousand hours worth at this point
* Hundreds to thousands of hours writing GitHub actions
* I can use git! (Apparently, this is a thing)
* Saved a data analytics organization $900k in annual spend by moving them to Snowflake
* I can code, yes: Python, Node, PHP, and some Go and C#
* OK, fine... I can code in ColdFusion too (choice of language for one solution was NOT my idea)

Notables:

* Am Canadian
* Do not possess a Bachelors degree
* I once discovered and reported a security vulnerability at 10 AM, and was told at 3 PM that half the management team had been terminated over it... oops.

A year ago, I was a senior earning six figures. Now I'd be happy with an internship making barely minimum wage.

devops,Question regarding prometheus mointoring and security measurement,"Hi Everyone, I made a post here before and I probably go with prometheus/alertmanager/grafana/several exporters for my small env (I noticed that it only have \~100 nodes which is way smaller than what I expected). Anyway.... probably life just gets easier. 

But I have several question regarding the security part. As far as I know, every target node will expose port 9100 if node\_exporter is installed and prometheus will use pull method to scrape the metrics from each target. Since the web UI for node exporter is accessible. We can set up basic auth and TLS for the communication.

For the TLS communication, prometheus will also require a cert and basic auth to communication with grafana. But for TLS  between prometheus and node\_exporter, how many cert do I need to use? Does it mean that for every target node, they need to have their own unique certificates singed by our internal CA, and how prometheus actually scrapes those metrics in an encrypted way with https. 



    for the prometheus.yml
    Do I just need to add the CA cert under the job_name?
    ```
    job_name: pls
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      ca_file: ""not sure what CA file here, is it the CA cert that signed the node_exporter cert?""
      insecure_skip_verify: true
    

Can I share the same node\_exporter TLS cert among all the target node?

  
Besides, for the resource planning, how do I determine how many samples/second or /day per nodes? is there any reference I can take for each exporters to plan the disk space to be assigned for a data retention policy of 1 year?

Currently the basic setup for the prometheus/grafana/alertmanager/node\_exporter are completed. But I need to make a security measurement on how the data flows and scrapes so that I could build a good observability in this environment. 

Hopefully I could get more recommendation from you folks!

devops,A small binary (2.2MB) to write portable scripts and replace Bash,"Hey fellow devops!

I am crossposting from the /r/golang sub because I think it might be relevant here as well. I wanted to share a solution I’ve started using that might help with scripting challenges. I repackaged [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) —a lightweight Ruby runtime for embedded systems—into a tool for writing cross-platform scripts and build pipelines.

As a developer, I often write scripts in Bash, but I’ve been burned more times than I care to admit by its limitations:

- Non-portable flags in coreutils between macOS and Linux.
- Missing data structures.
- Poor error handling and cleanup when things go wrong.
- Etc, ...

Dynamic languages like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript seemed like a better fit. However, these ecosystems are far from lightweight—they take up dozens (if not hundreds) of MB—and they aren’t self-contained. For example, if you need YAML support in Python, you have to manage, install, and source additional dependencies.

Frustrated, I started looking for an alternative. You can check out my journey in [this blog post](https://platipy.notion.site/The-quest-for-the-optimal-scripting-language-b013b3e35a5c4c6c8d5b4a7a31cb1508). Long story short, I discovered mruby and decided to repackage it into a single, self-contained binary (~2.2MB) with batteries included:

- CLI tools: Optparse for argument parsing, ANSI colors for better output.
- File system: Glob support across all platforms (including Windows).
- Data handling: Built-in YAML/JSON support.
- Networking: HTTP/HTTPS client/server capabilities.
- Task management: A simplified version of Rake.

You can even customize it to fit your specific requirements by adding or removing dependencies and repackaging the binary.

I like to think of it as the busybox for scripting—a lightweight, single binary that covers a wide range of use cases.
I now use this as a replacement for tasks where Bash or Make would have been my go-to tools. The repository includes [example scripts](https://github.com/IxDay/mruby/tree/main/examples) (e.g., using kubectl, vault, or openssl) to demonstrate its capabilities.

devops,"Switch jobs within same department, after only 5 month since starting?","I have recently been accepted at a University to work as a DevOps/Linux Applications Engineer, in the Application Operations Team. During the interviews, my now teammates (mostly older men) have warned me that the job might be not as exciting as I would expect. However the conditions of the job (salary and commute) were too good for me to pass on, and I thought I'd still be able to fill my workdays at least.  
  
I've been working here for about 5 months, but I noticed that I usually don't have enough work. I've been given one server to ""migrate"" to a newer OS, and been tasked with fixing some of the vulnerabilities that the vulnerability scanner found. However this is not nearly enough work to fill a day, as I'm usually just waiting on others (like the developer of that server) before I can continue working. Many days I reply to some emails, and then I have nothing to do for the rest of the day. I've already asked my project owner and my scrum master a couple times if there's something else that I can work at, but they fail to come up with things.  
  
Besides that, I'd love to work on more ""DevOpsy"" solutions/projects for the department, but since my team is the ""Application Operations"" team, there's only a limited amount of solutions that I can work on. The Applications are also usually quite easy to set up, static, and only need to be updated once or twice a year. So I don't see much need for my own role as DevOps Engineer.   
  
I tried to come up with some projects that would help the department as a whole, for example automating certificate management with ACME for myself and others. However, these projects progress very slowly due discussions about whether it's really my teams role to develop this, and whether I should be given access rights to the loadbalancers.  
  
Recently, I found out that another team in my department, that is more DevOps involved,  just opened a vacancy  for ""DevOps Engineer"". I also have had contact with this team and they seem more young and dynamic, contrasting with my current team. I am tempted to apply for this position, but I am worried about what management will think, since I'm only employed for 5 months so far.

Now the request was brought up by our Development team that they would like the ability to push directly to test. 

Our Workflow is the following
Currently, they are pushing to MASTER, once a merge is detected to master, a build is then kicked off in the codepipeline, and builds the application and adds the application code to the docker image, which is then pushed to ECR and ECS, and ECS dev service is then running(assuming all is good). There are no other TEST/PROD pipelines at the moment. If they want to deploy an image to TEST/PROD and are happy with what they initially pushed, I would then manually promote the image to the TEST/PROD environments, by “promoting” the docker image to the new environment. This workflow essentially forces all stages, DEV, TEST, STAGE AND PROD to be the exact same and it prevents any drift.

Upon having the conversation, essentially , i was flat out told , there is no need for DEV(from their stand-point), as they only use TEST , as it closely resembles prod. Essentially, they would push directly to TEST if they could, DEV not as much, as they could - was the feeling I got.


Question I have is,

1. Are you guys allowing your development teams to push directly to TEST? If so how are you doing so without having any drift in your environments? It is something which should be allowed?

2. Open to any suggestions on how to allow that, assuming you are in favor for this.

3.

devops,Jaws Deploy (Octopus alternative),"We are a group of developers that have been been using Octopus for a wide range of projects for many years. It has served us well, but the insane price hikes makes it impossible and totally unacceptable to continue using it.

So - a year ago we set out to build an alternative: Jaws Deploy (pun intended… sharks eat octopus).

We have had a closed trial since August 2024. There are currently one fairly large and a few medium sized organizations using it to manage deployment of \~25 C#/C++ projects to around 120 machines (Linux &amp; Windows) on all continents.

We are now ready to bring on board more trial users. We will assist all trial users with setting up deployments in Jaws, and we will build the product based on feedback. Pricewise we intend to keep it simple; Jaws will cost 50% of Octopus. We also have a free plan!

We support:

* Use Internal or External Nuget repository for builds. Or use FTP, Blob, Gitlab, Azure, TC, Jenkins etc). Push &amp; Pull supported.
* Transforming config files &amp; injecting secrets (Azure Keyvault, AWS or any other source)
* Running custom scripts (Powershell 7)
* Pre-made deployment step templates
* Streamlined installation of agents on machines (Run a script or use Octopus to deploy Jaws 🦈)
* Dashboard for keeping track of Releases, Deployments, Machines, Environments etc.

Future roadmap:

* Import projects directly from Octopus (Q1 2025)
* Bash &amp; Python Support (Q1 2025)
* More deployment step templates (Q4 2024)
* Support for Docker/Kubernetes (2025)

devops,Git branching strategy,"We are pretty small ""team"" of 2 people + sysadmin/devops. We have prod, test and dev. Idea was dev -&gt; test -&gt; prod. We pretty quickly ran into issues like me needing to deploy something to prod but the commits from the other dev would be included as well, but his wasn't approved/tested yet. So cherry picking from there. Thing is that created multiple commits with the same changes. So at the end we landed on something else.

Again we have dev, test and prod. But dev is equal to prod. So you start branch from dev, do your stuff, merge into test. When it's tested merge into prod and dev and close the branch. And it seems to be working pretty well for now. No cherry picking and stuff. Only thing that I'm questiong is every time we merge into prod/test they go in front cuz of the merge commits. That's the only thing that's concerning me with our solution isn't as good as we thought. In the future we might be 1000s of commits ahead in test/prod cuz of that. 

  
Is that okay?   
Do we need to search for a solution to that? Any propositions?

\- We are constantly spending time optimising application performance since IOPs is a challenge

I believe we can easily do that monthly just from Upwork alone but as of now our team is small AND WE DECIDED TO focus heavily on delivery rather than just sourcing new business (so we can get 5 stars and grow organically)
2. We started a fiverr offering microservices and some basic tasks with the intention for fostering connections and upsells in the future (no orders till now but clicks are increasing)
3. We are working on a devops cost savings report to use as part of lead magnet when we start targeted outbound soon to send to tech managers looking for a new hire to show them how much they can save by hiring (any agency) for a cloud migration over lets say a full time employee (factoring in 401k, dental, vision, recruitment costs, etc). Ik its not the best strategy but I firmly believe that its much better than just cold emailing people asking them ""if"" they want something.

devops,I love this profession,"Hello! First time posting here. This may off as a rant. I got started in DevOps mid-2022. Before that I self-taught and worked in junior dev/qa. I live in Canada. I work at a small (50 person) company, for 2 years I worked with a Senior DevOps. This year I am a one-man DevOps team.

Context aside, I feel like there is something special about this work. It’s always something new and interesting to work on. It’s broad, so I work with nearly every other dev team. But there is specialized work in things they otherwise don’t do well, like infra code, ci/cd, automation, cybersecurity controls. I get to incrementally make things a little more organized, or cleaner, or secure; it feels satisfying.

I like my work culture. A small group of smart people who are kind and relaxed and grant me autonomy. The pay seems low, starting at 60k and now 83k. I did try to get a job offer elsewhere this year (to find better pay), but gave that up. Hundreds of job applications over ~7 months, a couple interviews, no offers. I believe there seems to be an over-abundance of unemployed IT people in Canada (multiplied immigration rate the past few years?). That said, it feels more like a fluke that I could get where I am. I could so easily have been stuck unemployed, lacking experience, or intellectual purpose.

devops,[HELP] Python Developer Struggling with JupyterLab Extension Setup - Can't Get Past Installation Stage,"Hi Devops community! I'm primarily a Python/data analysis developer trying to create my first JupyterLab extension. I'm stuck at a really frustrating stage and could use some guidance.

**What I'm Trying to Build:**
A JupyterLab extension that shows tooltips of Python function content when hovering over markdown links in Jupyter notebooks. For example, if I have a function:
```python
def my_function():
    """"""
    My docstring
    """"""
    return ""Hello""
```
And a markdown link `[Click here](#my_function)`, hovering over it should show the function content.

**My Current Setup:**
- JupyterLab 4.2.6
- Python 3.10
- Using virtual environment
- Project structured following JupyterLab extension template
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Warren8824/jupyter-hover-tooltip.git

**The Problem:**
Even though I'm just trying to get the basic extension recognized before implementing Python functionality:

1. The extension builds without errors:
```bash
   npm run build  # Succeeds
   pip install -e .  # Succeeds
   jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite  # Succeeds 
```

2. Server logs show it's loading:

```
   jupyter_hover_tooltip | extension was successfully loaded
```

3. But the extension is invisible in:
   - `jupyter labextension list` output
   - JupyterLab's Extension Manager UI

**Key Files in Place:**
- setup.py with proper Python packaging
- package.json with JupyterLab extension metadata
- __init__.py with proper extension registration
- webpack.config.js for building JavaScript components

**What's Confusing Me:**
1. I understand Python packaging but this hybrid Python/JavaScript setup is new to me
2. Everything seems to build correctly but JupyterLab won't recognize the extension
3. I had it working once before but can't reproduce that success
4. Can't even get to testing the actual Python functionality because I'm stuck at setup

**Questions:**
1. Is this a Python packaging issue or a JupyterLab configuration problem?
2. Are there specific Python-side debugging steps I should take?
3. How can I verify if my Python package is correctly registering with JupyterLab?

I've spent over a day just trying to get past this setup stage. As someone who usually works with pure Python, I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about how Python packages interact with JupyterLab's extension system.

All code is in the GitHub repo. Any help, especially from Python developers who have experience with JupyterLab extensions, would be greatly appreciated!

devops,Hybrid cloud - azure arc agent and IMDSv2 from AWS,"Hey guys! 👋🏻 I don’t know if I should put this question here but got no answer so far on azure forum.

I’m talking about an hybrid cloud environment. On my work, we have aws ec2 instances running which have azure arc agent installed on them. For now we have been using IMDSv1 which allows for calls to instance metadata service with or without token. I’m changing that, so I have updated all our scripts to use tokens to get the info they need from IMDS.

Now, here is my question. What about azure arc agent? It seems we are having some requests without tokens coming from the arc agent. What I was told was that azure arc agent would adapt once I enforced IMDSv2 and would start making requests with tokens for the authentication.

I tried to look into Microsoft documentation to try and get information to support this claim. But since I’m new I’m still not sure if I’m looking into the correct place. 

Can you help me guide to the correct piece of information or explain me better this scenario?

devops,Database Gateway for Controlled Query Access,"Hey DevOps,

I’ve built a [database gateway](https://github.com/kazhuravlev/database-gateway) to provide controlled access to production databases with fine-grained permissions and secure query execution. 

Key Features:

* **Role-Based ACLs**: Define access rules at the instance, table, and column levels.
* **OIDC Authentication**: Users log in through OpenID Connect.
* **Multi-Instance Support**: Query multiple PostgreSQL instances from a single interface.
* **Web Interface**: Execute approved queries and view results securely.
* **Query Storage**: Save query results for later access or export.

How It Works:

1. Users authenticate via OIDC.
2. ACLs enforce access to specific instances, tables, and columns.
3. Approved queries are executed, and results are stored securely.

Built For:

* **Developers** who debug production data.
* **Team Leads and Product Owners** who access production data for reporting.
* **DevOps** who run queries on behalf of other roles.
* **Security Engineers** who ensure sensitive production data remains protected.

devops,"Dumb question, a 2 credit undergrad research course shouldn't require me to build a Dockerized Microservice Infrastructure right?","So I'm(M22, Senior, Math Degree) doing this undergraduate research on stylometry of medieval authors. There's a ton of unknown medieval works which we hope we can attribute the text to a specific author. So going in I thought we'd just need to use a simple python notebook, process the files that way, we get an embedding space at the end which we can train from.

  
The weeks go by, and this text datasize is huge, and the GPU requirements forced me to use cloud architecture. So I'm realizing to accommodate the memory overflow, the crashes we have in-between each notebook cell the notebook approach wouldn't work. 



So I broke them up into python scripts and then attached each one to push and pull from a SQL database which has all the data. I know not the best approach but it works.

  
I bring this to the professor and show that the test sample dataset works. He says, great wrap it up into a streamlined process so we can drop .txt files into a folder and each of the scripts run and we get the embedding as the output.

  
So I start realizing, oh I have to wrap each script into a Docker microservice architecture, use rabbitmq to queue the messages. Create an S3 bucket to drop files in and then upload the processed into a database. So I'm about to finish the microservice infrastructure....then I was like. What the hell am I doing for a 2 credit undergraduate research class? 

  
So a part of me is like, 'damn professor, you're asking too much. I can do that, but I really shouldn't for a 2 credit class' but I don't know if I'm the insane one. I'm like new to the whole field, I have no relative sense of context here.

  
So yall are professionals in the devops sphere. My intuition is that this is clearly too much for an undergraduate student to do. I don't know if it is. 



I have a return offer lined up with a finance/tech company. I'm thinking, if this is as valuable as I think it is I really shouldn't be handing it over for free.  I should like, sell the IP to my company  get a fat juicy bonus -- pay off my student debt faster.  Thing is this whole thinking fails if making an NLP Docker Infrastructure isn't as impressive as I make it out to be.

If it is pretty meh, I'll worry less about IP and just give them to both.

devops,"Modern, open-source server management tools","Hi,

I would like to hear your professional experience and advices on how to manage servers as a solo dev/sysadmin in 2024.

I am a full-stack dev and solo business owner, and i manage my infrastracture alone. I am quite proficient in linux terminal, however soon the number of my servers will be unmanageable by doing manual sshing and adhoc housekeeping. I want to manage everything from single screen, and run same commands, install tools etc. on multiple servers.

As i know, Ansible is quite known for this but many years ago I checked and found it unintuitive (but was a long time ago). I want to find something with minimum learning curve and knowledge barrier, as my brain is already full.

The things i need, boil down to these 3 things:

1. do basic resource monitoring everything in one place. I have advanced monitoring with zabbix already, just need very basic charts or gauges, that shows cpu, memory, disk usage etc.
2. run commands or install packages in parallel, show the outputs in one place
3. easy configuration stuff via user interface, such as managing users, permissions, ssh keys, replacing an ssh key from all servers with a few clicks etc.

What do you recommend? Ansible is the way or any better/simpler software?

EDIT: My servers are a mixture of virtual machines, and bare metal in different data centers, private clouds or onprem. I dont have full control over this, but they are all linux, mostly ubuntu servers. They are not doing the same things, some are database servers, some are different application servers, some are for monitoring, vpn, ad-hoc stuff etc. Note that, this mixture of infra is not my decision, this is more like what is available to me.",Feeling-Limit-1326,1gy69v3,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gy69v3/modern_opensource_server_management_tools/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gy69v3/modern_opensource_server_management_tools/,2024-11-23 18:28:31,25,0.77,25,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gy69v3
devops,Are better DevOps engineers former developers or sysadmins?,"I’m curious about the community’s perspective on this. In your experience, who makes better DevOps engineers:

1. **Former developers** who transition into managing infrastructure and CI/CD, bringing their software development expertise to the table,
2. **Former sysadmins** who previously focused on managing infrastructure by clicking through cloud provider UIs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), but now need to adapt to infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, Helm, or Kustomize?

In my current workplace, we have a former sysadmin-turned-DevOps engineer who often criticizes aspects like the structure of repositories where we keep Terraform configurations. Specifically, they push for simpler layouts and seem resistant to ideas like reusing shared configuration components or following DRY principles, which are common in programming.

I can’t help but feel this resistance might come from their lack of a development background, making concepts like modularization and reusability less intuitive for them. It seems more like an adjustment issue rather than a genuine flaw in the proposed solutions.

Have you encountered similar situations? What do you think - do the skills and mindset of one group make them better suited for DevOps roles than the other? Or is it just a matter of experience and willingness to learn?

devops,EROOR_DOCUMENT_REQUEST lors du setup de Lighthouse CI sur GitHub ,"Hi everyone,

I'm posting here because I'm completely stuck on an issue with Lighthouse in GitHub CI.

Here are the essential links:
- lighthouserc.js = https://gist.github.com/cuzureau/eee71c12958f2b4ada1952bc755972d8
- lighthouse.yml = https://gist.github.com/cuzureau/cd6f1981f5e7af201565b88df487143e
- github errors = https://gist.github.com/cuzureau/4850575cfb5c667761ebb0a45466fd14

Here's the situation:

I'm trying to integrate Lighthouse to analyze my project's performance directly in GitHub CI.

I've set up the necessary configuration files. Everything seems correct (at least at first glance).

When the CI runs, the server starts properly and makes the site accessible via localhost. However, Lighthouse can't access this site.

The errors encountered:

1. EROOR_DOCUMENT_REQUEST: it seems that Lighthouse is trying to access a site that isn't responding correctly, probably because it can't find anything at the localhost address.

2. 404 Error: when Lighthouse tries to run its tests, it can't retrieve the expected document, which blocks the entire process.

I'm pretty sure this is an issue related to the fact that GitHub Actions doesn't allow direct access to a local server (for example, if localhost:3000 is running in the environment). So Lighthouse logically fails.

What I've tried:

Verifying that the server launches correctly before Lighthouse is called.

Checking the Lighthouse documentation for GitHub CI, but I haven't seen anything that precisely matches my problem.

Adding delays (sleep) to ensure the server is ready, without success.

Has anyone encountered this kind of problem before? Maybe there's an issue with my configuration, or I'm missing something obvious? Any help or leads would be welcome!

The project is failing horribly and I personally think that one of the key reasons is the way we organized our teams. I read the book team topologies and I would like to apply its methodologies. They talk about 4 teams (Stream aligned, platform, complicated subsystem &amp; enabling teams). In the book they make the case that Stream aligned teams should also handle customer support. As this is the best way to get feedback on the stuff the team is developing. However, this is our current situation and before reading the book I was lobbying heavily with higher management to change this and create a dedicate support team. We have many ""tasks"" that occupy our highly trained developers that are quite mindless like, creating new users or adding products to the product catalog. 

It wouldn't make sense to me to keep this work in our ""stream aligned team"". If it's mindless you could say ""then automate it"" but I think the cost of automation is higher then the cost of a few juniors just doing it as a support job.

devops,Showcasing my load balancer project - Seeking feedback and insights!,"I’m decided to share a project I’ve been working on lately: **Terraster**  
  
Been working as backend dev. last 3 years but still playing with home lab etc. since I was in SRE/DevOps field before and my heart still belongs to ""old style sysadmin"". This isn't something that is aiming to replace nginx or something but since I fell in love with Go, I wanted to create something useful. The project is still in active development but I've been already using it for some small internal APIs at work and seems to be working great. I'm still working on documentation because not all features are documented right now but it should be enough to get you started.

**🔧 Project Highlights**:

* **Concurrency Handling:** Utilizes Go’s goroutines and channels to efficiently manage multiple connections.
* **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Implements Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hashing and some other, to distribute traffic effectively.
* **Support for TLS termination/offloading**
* **Health Monitoring:** Each service gets its own continuous health check to ensure traffic is only directed to healthy nodes.
* **Dynamic Configuration and status monitoring via API:** Ability to add or remove backend servers on-the-fly via admin API as well as monitoring status, health etc.
* **Metrics &amp; Logging - WIP:** Currently working on it. As for today, it logs to file and console asynchronous but I'm planning to implement prometheus integration.
* **Graceful Shutdown:** Ensures all active connections are properly handled during shutdowns or restarts.
* **Auto certificate manager -** if you define tls configuration globally or on each service, it will first try to use that but if not - it will try with lets encrypt.

Bugs are expected and I don't consider it as nginx/haproxy replacement. Just trying something new.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on the architecture, code quality, and feature set.

You can simply create course whit markdown and the best part is there is custom component that interact whit an extension in vscode, so the coruse is more interactive and you can use the code directly in local,

then you can make some money by making a subscription for that coruse

devops,A deep dive into the tar format,"Hey again 👋

You may have seen my recent posts on different container image compression formats such as [zstd](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb4e98/using_zstd_compression_with_buildkit_decompresses/) and [estargz](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1grfchd/lazy_pulling_docker_images_for_80_faster_startup/). I have spent a lot of time lately looking at the different compression utilities and algorithms we use on collections of files, but I noticed the one thing that never changes is the *tar*.

All docker layers are compressed tar archives, caches in CI are stored as tar archives, almost every collection of files is some form of tar.

Why is ""tar"" the de facto standard archival format? Where did it come from? Should we be using something better? Let's learn a little more about ""tar"" together.

This post is a preview of my [full blog post, available here.](https://depot.dev/blog/what-is-a-tar-file)

# Origin of tar

The \`tar\` utility was [created in 1979 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#History)to replace the now-ancient \`[tp](https://www.unix.com/man-page/bsd/1/tp/)\` command. Still, like \`tp\`, tar was a format and utility specifically designed for magnetic tape, and magnetic tape drives. You'll notice a lot of the interesting quirks of \`tar\` can be explained in the context of being used on a tape drive, which is of course no longer a concern today.

Officially, \`tar\` was replaced in 2001 by the \`pax\` command. But it (tar) became so ubiquitous that it is still the standard go-to utility for file archiving today.

# Inspecting a tar file

Let's perform a small experiment to see what we can learn about a tar file. Let's start by creating a file we can archive.

`echo ""level 1, type grass"" &gt; bulbasaur.txt`

\`tar\` accepts a \`-c\` flag to indicate we want to create an archive, and we can use the \`-f\` flag to specify the output file. We can pass in any number of files or directories to archive.

`tar -cf pokeball.tar bulbasaur.txt`

That should leave us with a \`pokeball.tar\` file. This is not compressed, you may have seen \`.tar.gz\` before, but we rarely see uncompressed \`tar\` files, for good reason. We'll get back to that.

The data that makes up the tar is simple ASCII text, we can actually see the majority of the data fairly cleanly by using \`cat\` to display the data.

    cat pokeball.tar
    bulbasaur.txt0000644000000000000000000000002414716660325012303 0ustar  rootrootlevel 1, type grass

# Tar File Structure

[\[ image - tar file structure \]](https://depot.dev/images/tar-file-structure.webp)

***\[ (header \[512B\]) + (data \[512B \* x\]) + (End-Of-Archive \[512B \* 2\]) \]***

Each file in a tar archive is converted into a ""tar file"". A tarfile is simply a header, of a specific size, followed the data in the file.

The header contains information like the name of the file, the creation time, owner id, and a few other metadata fields. Immediately after the header is the raw contents of the file.

The header, and the contents are all stored in blocks of 512 bytes. If the data doesn't require 512B, it will be padded with null bytes to fill the space. Similarly if the data is over 512B, it will be split into blocks of 512, with the last of which being padded to ensure there is a whole number of blocks.

After all tar files in the archive are inserted, sequentially, an additional two empty 512B blocks are added as an end-of-archive marker. \`tar\` will be looking for these two empty blocks as a sign to end the unarchiving process.

# The Tar File Header

Trying to inspect a tar file from the output of \`cat\` can be a bit challenging. Instead, since we know a tar file is just a header + the original data, let's take a closer look at the [structure of the tar header](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html).

|Field|Size (bytes)|Byte Offset|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|`name`|100|0|File name|
|`mode`|8|100|File permissions|
|`uid`|8|108|User ID|
|`gid`|8|116|Group ID|
|`size`|12|124|File size in bytes|
|`mtime`|12|136|Modification time (UNIX timestamp)|
|`chksum`|8|148|Header checksum|
|`typeflag`|1|156|File type (e.g., regular file, directory)|
|`linkname`|100|157|Name of linked file (if symbolic link)|
|`magic`|6|257|Format identifier (e.g., `ustar`)|
|`version`|2|263|Format version (`00`)|
|`uname`|32|265|User name|
|`gname`|32|297|Group name|
|`devmajor`|8|329|Major device number (if special file)|
|`devminor`|8|337|Minor device number (if special file)|
|`prefix`|155|345|Prefix for file name (for long file names)|
|**Padding**|12|500|Padding to make the header 512 bytes|

Armed with this, we can now use a tool like \`hexdump\` to get a more clear view of the data.

Let's say we wanted to know the file size of \`bublasaur.txt\`, we can use this table to know we should read 12 bytes starting at the 124th byte in the file.

    hexdump -s 124 -n 12 -C pokeball.tar
    
    0000007c  30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30  30 32 34 00              |00000000024.|

The 24 value here is actually still in octal form since we are looking at raw bytes, so a quick conversion back to decimal will help us see the true value.

    &gt; echo $((8#24))
    20

That shows us the original file was 20B!

# Why is our tar file so large?

From what we know about the structure of the tar archive so far, we should have a single header block, which is 512 bytes, one data block, and two end-of-archive markers.

*512B (header) + 512B (contents) + 512B (empty) + 512B (empty) = 2048B*

Somehow our 20B file got away from us and became 2 kilobytes. Let's double check to be sure.

    stat pokeball.tar
    
    File: pokeball.tar
      Size: 10240

Woah! 10KB? How the heck did that happen?

# Blocking factor

Another interesting feature of tar that stems from its magnetic tape origins. Magnetic tape takes time to spin up to speed and slow down. It was more efficient to store data in longer chunks at a time due to the mechnical and linear  design of magnetic tape. Today this is less relevant, but still tar implements what is called a ""blocking factor"".

Tape drives read data not in increments of blocks, but instead by ""record"". A record in tar by default is 20 blocks. That means there are 19 additional empty data blocks in our tar archive, filled with padding.

If you happen to be working with small files or a small amount of data, you can ajust your blocking factor.

    tar --blocking-factor=1 -cf pokeball_single_record.tar bulbasaur.txt
    
    stat pokeball_single_record.tar
    
    File: pokeball_single_record.tar
      Size: 2048

With the blocking factor set to 1, we get our original calculation. Still quite a bit larger than the original file, almost exclusively due to null bytes in padding again.

# Compressing a tar file

[\[ pokeball .tar.gz image \]](https://depot.dev/images/pokeball_targz.webp)

I got into this in more detail in [the full blog post](https://depot.dev/blog/what-is-a-tar-file) but tldr, this is why you often see not `.tar` files, but `.tar.gz`. All of that empty space in a tar archive isn't ideal but it is hardly anything to worry about once compression is applied.

**Gzip**

gzip is the long standing standard compression method and it works well enough and fast enough to offset the inefficiencies of the tar format. It is also worth mentioning the overhead of a tar archive shrinks proportionally with the size of the archive. Fewer large files will store more efficiently.

You can use multiple compression tools directly within the `tar` command. Use the `-z` flag with `-c` to create a `gzip` archive.

    tar -czf pokedex.tar.gz bulbasaur.txt squirtle.txt charmander.txt

**Zstandard**

Gzip, like tar, will likely be around for many more decades to come, but it would be difficult to ignore how quickly Facebook's `zstd` compression is gaining traction.

The `gzip` utility is antiquated, and still a single-threaded application. Though a multi-threaded implementation of `gzip` named `pigz` exists. Zstandard by comparison, being much newer, is multi-threaded by default.

We ran some of [our own tests](https://depot.dev/blog/building-images-gzip-vs-zstd#comparison-of-decompression-times) that agree with the claims made by `zstd`, that decompression speeds are about 60% faster compared to `gzip`.

You can use either the `--zstd` flag, or simply the `-a` flag, which will auto detect the crompression tool from the output file extension.

    tar -czf pokedex.tar.gz bulbasaur.txt squirtle.txt charmander.txt

You will need to ensure that `zstd` is installed on the system first.

I’m looking to make my company’s EC2 instances more redundant in case a machine fails. We currently host our entire application and APIs across several machines. Each machine contains their own service, such as frontend, backend, etc. We’re only hosting in one region because we’re a small company and scalability is not a priority yet. 

If a machine fails, the solution right now is to spin up a new EC2 instance and recreate that service on the new machine. We haven’t actually had a scenario where a machine failed yet, but want to build solutions just in case.

We could make our application more redundant by having backup machines on standup so that if a machine fails, we would switch to the backup machine, and we could probably automate this too.

devops,"New to DevOps and Observability – Need Advice for Setting Up Monitoring and Logging, and Tracing","Hi everyone,

I recently started a new role as a DevOps engineer at a startup. It’s my first time working in DevOps, and to add to the challenge, I’m the only DevOps person on the team. My first task is to set up monitoring and observability for our systems, but I’m pretty new to this domain.

Here’s the current situation:

• We have a PHP Slim Framework application deployed on ECR with multiple instances.

• There’s no proper logging in place—just some Monolog logs printed to the console.

• I’m aiming to use **OpenTelemetry** for instrumentation and data collection, sending data to an OpenTelemetry Collector.

• For visualization, I’m considering open-source tools like the **LGTM stack** or **SigNoz**. My plan is to try both and determine which works best for us.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1. **Startup Budget:** Cost is critical, so I want to stick to open-source tools wherever possible. I’m trying to avoid AWS services like CloudWatch unless absolutely necessary.
2. **Logs:** Should logs be written to files or directly sent to a central storage/visualization tool? For example, is it better to print logs to files for retention, and then move them to cold storage (like S3) after a month, or handle this differently?
3. **Best Practices:** I’m looking for guidance on the best way to structure logs, metrics, and traces for a startup environment with limited resources.

**What I’m Hoping to Learn:**

• What are the best practices for setting up observability and logging in a cost-efficient way?

• Are there specific pitfalls I should avoid when setting up OpenTelemetry and integrating it with tools like LGTM or SigNoz?

• Any advice on log storage and retention policies?

I’m open to any ideas, tips, or resources that can help me approach this task effectively.

This is probably my 5th post on this subreddit trying to get some assurance, clarity, etc. I'm coming from a sys admin background in Linux/Windows server. I'm decent at setting up systems and trouble shooting them but creating IaC and the things that come with automation,  CI/CD is a bit daunting.

So many references to other files, scripts, functions. They are templating a whole bunch of jobs but I can't get proper footing. I'm not building anything from the ground up. I'm revamping and repurposing code from a previous team that failed. Is it normal to feel like I'm starting from the middle but actually I'm starting off where most new DevOps engineers start?

In the future, this interface will include advanced management features, such as user creation, database creation, extension installation, a built-in SQL editor, SSH access via a web console, and much more to support the entire database management lifecycle. This ensures intuitive and powerful control that goes far beyond the standard capabilities of Kubernetes Operators.

We believe hosting databases in Kubernetes adds unnecessary complexity by introducing additional layers of abstraction that require maintenance without offering clear benefits. PostgreSQL Cluster focuses on bare metal and virtual machines, eliminating these layers to provide a more efficient and direct solution.

If Kubernetes is a central part of your architecture, our solution might not be the best fit. However, if you’re looking for simplicity, flexibility, and advanced features that go beyond the capabilities of Kubernetes Operators, PostgreSQL Cluster is the solution for you.",vitabaks,1gv7bxc,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gv7bxc/postgresql_cluster_vs_kubernetes_operators/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gv7bxc/postgresql_cluster_vs_kubernetes_operators/,2024-11-19 20:39:44,9,0.72,9,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gv7bxc

devops,My Journey into OCI,"

A while ago, I needed a cloud provider that could handle massive NACLs/Security Groups (we’re talking 300+ rules) without charging an arm and a leg for data egress. I tried all the usual suspects—DigitalOcean, Hetzner Cloud, Linode, etc.—but my quest was looking grim. Either the networking options were lackluster, or  features like NACLs and load balancers were incomplete/non-existent.

In a final, desperate bid, I turned to the one provider I swore I’d never touch: Oracle.



# The Beginning: Oracle, Why Do You Make It So Hard?

Getting started was... an experience. After failing to register an account with eight different debit/credit cards (four U.S.-based, four European), I began to question whether I was cursed. Oracle support offered no clarity, and I suspect even divine intervention wouldn’t have helped. Then I remembered I’d created an account back when OCI first launched. Dusting that off, I finally got in.

The first thing that hit me? The UI. It’s a disaster. Honestly, it’s so bad it lends credibility to the theory that Oracle hired ex-AWS employees to sabotage it as a shadow IT project. But hey, I’ve been doing this for a decade—I can work around bad UX.

After some tinkering, numerous support tickets, and lowering my expectations, I got what I needed. It’s been smooth sailing since. Here are my key takeaways:



# Pros:

**1. Generous Free Tier**

You get a 4 vCPU, 24 GB RAM VM for free. The catch? It’s ARM-based, which limits some use cases, but it’s perfect as a proxy server.

You also get 10 TB of egress traffic per month (as opposed to the 100GB from the 3 hyperscalers)



**2. Strong VMs and Reliable Networking**

My app is a monolith that throws tantrums (and warnings) if single-thread performance isn’t on point. Every other provider failed this test, but Oracle hasn’t had any issues in 7 months.

Networking is solid, and my users are reporting great pings. The Fault Domain architecture seems promising too, though I haven’t needed it for anything mission-critical.



**3. AWS Clone**

OCI is basically AWS in disguise. The VPC architecture, VM setup, image handling, snapshots—they all feel familiar. If you’ve worked with AWS, you’ll adapt quickly.



# Cons:

**1. The Firewall Situation is weird**

OCI’s firewall setup is “allow-only.” Want to block a specific IP while allowing others? Nope—better shell out for their network firewall at $2,000/month.

Want subnet-wide rules but tighter instance-level controls? Tough luck. Security rules across NACLs and Network Security Groups (NSGs) are merged into one giant allowlist.



**2. Support Is… Interesting**

I’ve spoken to OCI’s live agents at least 20 times, and I don’t think I’ve ever gotten the same answer twice. Half the time, their response is irrelevant or flat-out wrong. Press them further, and it’s off to technical support, where you’ll wait a week for another wrong answer or hear, “That’s an enterprise feature.”



**3. FinOps? What FinOps?**

Granular cost breakdown? No idea. Transparent billing? Good luck. Tracking spend on OCI is an exercise in frustration.



**4. Oracle**

Oracle is its own worst enemy. Between impossible account signups, random terminations for “not spending enough” and its reputation for predatory enterprise sales tactics, it feels like they’re trying to scare off customers.



TL;DR

Oracle OCI offers great baseline services (generous VMs, quotas, and egress) but falls short on enterprise-grade functionality and polish. If you’re running personal projects or a small business, it’s absolutely worth a try. But if you’re building anything enterprise-level, tread carefully—this isn’t a “set it and forget it” cloud.

devops,OTEL-COLLECTOR ( issues over short and long term ) ,"Hey community,  
I have been using otel-collector for my org ( x Tbs/day ) observability in k8s setup for sometime. Following is my experience. **Did you have a similar experience or was it different and how did you overcome it?**

**Long Term ( 6 months + of using ) :**

1. Poor data-loss detecting capabilities. I have been loosing data but no good way to see that. Agent/collector pods prints error logs but since pipeline doesn't work so it doesn't reach the log-system
2. No UI to view/monitor my existing connections and pick and drop functionalities
3. No easy way to inject transformers, for example i need to change format of some data for SIEM/snowflake, drop some log data like cribl, i should be able to do it within otel itself.

**Short term ( while setup ) :**

1. No grpc-native load balancer in otel. Horizontal scaling became an issue, as the agent runs on grpc and owing to no native grpc-load balancer directly operating over otel, resulted in oversizing my clusters unnecessarily.
2. Distributed tracing needs more automation, i had to manually stitch at various places.

Wanted to see if you have anything to share around what we could ask? (I've got my list but thought it might be a good idea to take your questions/opinion on this too)

  
\[UPDATE\]

  
A few questions I have till now:

  
Platform Engineering &amp; AI

1. Is platform engineering truly transformative, or is it often overused as a catch-all solution?
2. Could PE sometimes contribute to inefficiencies?
3. How do elite teams leverage platform engineering differently compared to average teams?
4. Trust in AI code still lacks based on this year’s report, how does leveraging AI look like for elite teams? Is AI increasing the gap between elite and average performers even further?
5. AI in the workflow has a few issues, are we prematurely celebrating AI as a great solution for DevOps issues? (ignoring the operational debt that is)
6. 39% devs show little to no trust in AI code while about 75% do leverage AI. Are DORA metrics as they stand today sufficient to handle the complexities of AI integrated workflows?

Elite Teams vs. The Rest of Us

1. What specific practices set elite teams apart from the majority? Is it all about resources, or is there more to it?
2. With economic constraints, can smaller teams realistically adopt elite-level practices?

Misinterpretation of DORA Metrics in Organizations

1. What are the most common mistakes companies make when interpreting DORA metrics?
2. How can engineering leaders use DORA metrics without falling into the trap of “chasing numbers” rather than achieving real improvements?
3. Are there situations where DORA metrics might misrepresent actual team performance?

Developer Burnout – Can Metric Tracking Contribute to This?

1. Does constant metric tracking risk increasing developer burnout? Where’s the line between tracking for improvement and creating pressure?
2. How can teams strike a balance between using metrics to drive productivity and ensuring they’re not creating a high-stress environment?
3. Are there specific DORA metrics that seem to correlate more with increased stress levels in teams?

Transformational Leadership in DevOps

1. How does transformational leadership influence elite teams? Is it a driving factor in achieving high performance, or does it only play a supportive role?
2. In a metrics-driven environment, how can leaders maintain a focus on both quantitative goals and qualitative team well-being?

Balancing Leadership Styles

1. Does the push for high DORA performance metrics conflict with the principles of transformational leadership, especially regarding team autonomy and creative freedom?
2. How can engineering leaders foster an environment that encourages innovation while still meeting the stringent benchmarks set by elite teams?
3. What are the common leadership pitfalls when implementing DORA practices, and how can leaders avoid them?

Reddit Questions

1. Are DORA metrics too detached from the real world nature of work? How to extract actionable improvements out of these?
2. Which measurements have started to be gamed more?
3. How should DORA be used for DevOps modernization efforts in industries where DevOps and DORA are not critical success factors to the enterprise competing in its market?
4. Are there orgs that shouldn’t use DORA metrics?

But they noted that the resource usage of using one Envoy or several will be the same based on CPU cycles and memory usage/allocation:

&gt;**Program code.** The compiled program code itself (i.e., the Envoy binary on disk) must be loaded into RAM to run. However, this binary is the same for all running Envoy instances, and it’s only ever read, not written, so it won’t change over time. Thus, the OS optimizes this by only loading the binary into RAM once, after which all running Envoy processes share it.  
.........  
(Note that modern memory management is very complicated, and it’s important to read the metrics correctly. While virtual memory allocations may well be higher when using sidecars, the number of actual physical pages used will be similar; this figure will be some combination of RSS and shared memory.)

devops,"What is an ""environment"" and how to configure it?","Edit: when I say DEV environment I don't mean my local development setup. I'm talking about environments in the vein of test, staging, production, etc.

Edit 2: whoever is down voting this please add some context why my question is missing the mark or provide me with resources to learn more about this topic, otherwise kindly move on :)

Ok. Bear with me for a second. I know what an environment is conceptually and use it every day as a developer, but now I have to create and maintain it for myself on a side project and I'm completely lost. 

All the articles online try and shove environment variables down my throat, but that's not what I'm looking for and I can't find any good resources on how to manage environments through GitHub for example.

So let's say I have a VPS with GitHub Actions building and deploying a Docker image on my server, let's call this my PROD environment for now, then how can I create a DEV environment?

Is that a whole other VPS or can it be on the same server?

Is it simply a domain name thing where I change `dev.example.com` to `example.com` in my Docker image when moving it from DEV to PROD and then do I have to map all the DNS record accordingly and configure NGINX etc?

Can you recommend resources on how to do this? My setup:

devops,Recommendations for IT Schools offering valuable DevOps courses for career change ,"Hi everyone,

I’m planning to switch my career to DevOps and would like to enroll in a course that I can attend after work. My main goal is to gain practical skills and earn a certification that’s recognized and valued in the industry.

I’m looking for suggestions on IT schools or programs (online or in-person) that you’ve personally tried or heard great things about. Ideally, I’d like to know:
	1.	Which courses helped you the most in understanding DevOps tools and concepts (e.g., AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, etc.)?
	2.	Did the certification you obtained from the course help you land a DevOps job?
	3.	Were the classes flexible enough for someone working full-time?

I work at a small software agency. We usually deploy our apps to Kubernetes (definitely overkill) or with Docker Compose on a single VM.

devops,Are Cloud Cost Management Tools Too Overwhelming?,"Managing cloud costs can feel like an uphill battle.

Here’s the reality:

* **AWS** has **at least 30 tools** for cost management, from Cost Explorer to Savings Plans.
* **Azure** provides **at least 15 tools**, like the Azure Pricing Calculator and Reservations.
* **GCP** offers **at least 10 tools**, including Committed Use Discounts and Intelligent Cost Recommendations.

📖 That’s a lot to learn, especially when each tool comes with detailed documentation—and someone has to be accountable for implementing and managing them.

But here’s the issue: many teams aren’t using these tools effectively. Whether it’s due to lack of expertise, poor implementation, or unclear accountability, businesses are often leaving money on the table.

In my latest blog, I cover:

* 🔢 How the sheer number of tools can lead to analysis paralysis.
* 🧩 The challenges of assigning ownership for cloud cost management.
* 🛠️ Why native tools are enough but often underutilised—and why working with the right teams is critical to getting it right from the start.

Hi everyone,

I hope you’re doing well!

I have a question.

I’ve never worked as a DevOps or been involved in DevOps in any field, but it’s always been a dream of mine. I really like the methodologies, the culture, and the role itself.

Anyway, three weeks ago I was let go from my job, where I worked as a Service Desk Analyst. That same week, I sent my resume to a company looking for a Junior Platform Engineer (I didn’t even know that was related to DevOps). They asked me to complete a Gorilla test. Although my results weren’t great, they still invited me for an interview.

Since then, I’ve been studying Linux, Kubernetes, AWS, Apache, Python, and Bash, which are some of the technologies used in the role, in order to prepare for the interview. However, I’m really nervous about it. It’s a remote interview, but I’m nervous because my experience in IT is limited to being a Service Desk Analyst for the past 2 years (I’m 20 years old).

Do you have any advice on what the interview process might be like for this kind of role? How’s the selection process typically structured?

2- search through all the requests/resposnes (hopefully using regex) and highlight the string i searched for in the tab showing reqeust/response
3- (optional really) manipulate a request some how in the dashboard and send the request again and see the response

since i have everything in my golang script, i can export them in any json format for any toool, i'm just looking for the right one

options i've looked at:
1- exporting all the responses/requests to files/directories and use a tui file manager to do the job, but none of the ones i've seen has the tree thingy done quite like i want

2- Postman, it has the tree like path but the search sucks (doesn't show exacly where the string im looking for is found)

devops,Zabbix or promethes/Grafana/AlertManager for on-prem VM monitoring?,"Hi, 

I am planning to replace the existing monitoring tools for our team. We are planning to use either Zabbix or proemtheus/grafana/alertmanager. We probably deploy in VM, not in a containerized environment. I believe a new monitoring system will be deployed in the k8s cluster for microservices in particular.

We have VM from couple of subnets and around 300 hosts. We just need the basic metrics from the hosts like CPU/Mem/Disk/NetworkInterface info. I found that Zabbix already has the rich features like an all-in-one monitoring tools. They looks like the right tools for us at the moment.   
Thinking of deploying 1/2 proxies in each subnet and 3 separate VM for webserver, zabbix server and postgres+timescaledb. It seems to fit my needs already. It can also integrate with Grafana.

However, I am also exploring the proemtheus/grafana/alertmanager. As my experience, we can use the node exporter to get the metric as well and use alertmanager to make the threshold notification. I did that in my homelab before in containers.

My condition is we can afford the down time for the monitoring system everything when It comes to  a patching cycle. We don't need 100% uptime like those software companies. 

But even so, I am thinking to deploy two prometheus server, basically they scrape the same metrics for both servers. I also heard of the prometheus agent but it looks like it just separate the some work from prometheus. They also have the thanos to make it HA. But I did not find any good tutorial that I can follow or setup in the on-prem environment.

I’m part of an 8-person DevOps team managing multiple clusters via a GitOps repo, which serves as the single source of truth. While the setup works great for versioning and automation, we’ve run into a recurring issue:

Changes pushed to manifests sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in parts of the cluster that weren’t meant to be affected. This results in us spending significant time investigating and debugging the root cause of these side effects.

This team creates custom tooling to create, monitor, and manage cloud based, API enabled, IT solutions. This team will use IaC, Ci/Cd, and custom coding to make these solutions. The majority will be Python, Azure (think App Services, functions, automation accounts, etc.), and some sort of data storage solutions.

As a DevOps engineer, I’ve always felt that managing merge requests in GitLab can be a bit of a grind—especially when it comes to ensuring all the requirements are met before merging. To tackle this, I built [**merge-bot**](https://github.com/Gasoid/merge-bot), a tool that automates merge requests based on customizable rules.

Here’s what it can do:

* ✅ **Merge Requests Automation**: Automatically merges an MR if it meets the following rules:
   * Matches a specific title pattern (e.g., prefixes like POS-1234).
   * Has a required number of approvals.
   * Includes exact approvers you define.
   * Ensures the pipeline is passing.

I’d love to get feedback from the DevOps and GitLab community:

* Are there any features or checks you’d like to see in a bot like this?
* Do you have pain points in your current GitLab merge request process that a tool could help with?

If you’re curious, feel free to check out the bot on GitHub: [merge-bot](https://github.com/Gasoid/merge-bot). It’s open-source, and I’m open to contributions or suggestions!

devops,Lazy pulling docker images for 80% faster startup.,"Hey all 👋

Not long ago I shared [my findings on zstd compression](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb4e98/using_zstd_compression_with_buildkit_decompresses/), which was able to decompress docker images up to 60% faster. I'm back again with another breakdown of alternative compression methods for Docker, this time ""eStargz"".

eStargz allows us to execute our container, before it has even finished downloading.

*Our analysis shows that pulling packages accounts for 76% of container start time, but only 6.4% of that data is read.* \- [Fast \`16](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast16/technical-sessions/presentation/harter)

**What is eStargz?**

What is [eStargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/estargz.md)? It's a snapshotter plugin for containerd. But really, that just means it's an alternative compression setting you can use when building container images, assuming you have the plugin setup (we'll get back to that).

Typically, when you pull a container, you will see right in the terminal output each of the layers that needs to be downloaded, followed by a visualization of each downloading and decompressing, or loading from cache if the layer is on the system already. We talked before about how we could pull the container faster by using zstd compression, making the image decompress faster, but this still leaves us with the issue of first needing to download the whole image first.

  
**What's wrong with Gzip?**

Tar + gzip compression is fine, it's reliable and battle tested. But it isn't particularly clever. When a layer is created in Docker typically, all of the filesystem changes in a layer are bundled up into a tarball and then compressed with gzip, giving us the tried and true \`&lt;layer\_id&gt;.tar.gz\` layer format we are used to.

The issue is, once the tar files are gzipped together, they are no longer indexable. There is no way to remove a single file from a gzip, you must download the entire blob, decompress it, and then you can read the contents to find the file you need.

So maybe, this isnt the best method to transfer files, if we potentially don't need everything in a layer. But, we still want to keep our files small for fast transfer and low bandwidth usage.

You could imagine, if you had an app for example that was a map. Maybe within the first layer of your Docker image is the application code, hypothetically your second layer is a small data subset containing the local geo data, and lets say there are one more layers after that which contain larger map data of the surrounding town, city, etc.

You don't need the full city's map to help you get to the nearest coffee shop. If this were a service in kubernetes, or a serverless function, the execution time would be painfully slow to get those directions, as it would first need to download multiple large datasets we do not need for this task.

**The eStargz format**

eStargz to the rescue. eStargz is fully compatible with tar.gz images, so it's entirely possible you have even used one before, but you may not have received the full benefit.

When creating a layer using eStargz, rather than tarballing all files together in a single gzip stream, multiple gzip streams are concatenated together.

[\[ image of format comparison \]](https://depot.dev/images/tar-archive-format.webp)

The gzip spec allows for two structures, both producing valid gzip files. You can tarball a collection of files and compress them, as is standard, or you can concatenate multiple gzip streams together. Concatenating multiple gzip streams is a bit less efficient as there will be more header information and the compression cant run against the full dataset at once, meaning there will be some duplicate information.

However, this slight bump in file size comes with one very large advantage...

  
**eStargz's index file**

eStargz is going to store one more file along with your file contents at the end of the tarball as well as a tiny amount of information in the footer of the final gzip which states the size and location of the inserted file.

By knowing the offset (location) of this extra file, and it's length, we can craft a a request to download only the bytes that contain that last file. That file is an \`index.json\` file, which in turn contains information on each tar.gz in the full archive. Similar to what was in the footer, the index states the names of the files, their offset, and length. With the index file in hand, its possible to download individual files from any layer.



**How to build an eStargz image**

Building the estargz image is very simple and you likely do not need to configure anything extra at all to start building your own. You just need to make sure you are using a buildkit based builder, like \`docker buildx build\` or \`depot build\`

`$ docker buildx build -t ""&lt;registry&gt;/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;:&lt;version&gt;"" \`

`-o type=registry,oci-mediatypes=true,compression=estargz,force-compression=true \`

`.`

""`force-compression=true`"" will re-compress the base image as well as what ever you add to it.

  
**How to USE an eStargz image**

Using the eStargz image is a bit more complicated. Because it is backwards compatible, you can pull and use this image anywhere, however, by default the image will simply operate like a normal tar.gz image, without lazy loading.

Like I mentioned at the start, a snapshotter plugin must be installed on the host machine pulling the image. Many platforms today do not yet support this. For instance, you can not lazily pull an image on the default GitHub actions runners. You *can* however use eStargz image on [Depot's GitHub runners](https://depot.dev/blog/booting-containers-faster-with-estargz#should-you-use-estargz).

If you are running your own Kubernetest cluster, you'll want to make sure your nodes have the stargz snapshotter installed, linked above.

  
**Summary**

tldr; If you have large images, especially with data that might not be required at the time of booting a container, it may be faster to defer downloading that data to later in the container's execution. That can be done with an alternative image format called eStargz, but it required a containerd plugin to gain the benefits. Most platforms do not yet support eStargz, but it is backwards compatible and will not cause any issues with any currently unsupported platform.

devops,Looking for some advice - DevOps transition.,"Hello everyone, I hope you are dong well. 

I'm gonna go to the point. Around a year and half I started in a company with a team of two working as in an operation team which included things like managing deployments via some tools, dealing with monitoring (creation of dashboards, alerts, etc), doing some changes in the infra using Azure (most of them by click-click mode).  
I interested in other tools that were/are managed by a different team, and started asking questions, slowly trying to troubleshoot issues with aks clusters that where not on my scope but I was curious to learn more.   
Couple of months ago, I was asked if I would like to join this other team and start picking up more cloud/infra stuff, to which I agreed and was excited about. 

From this new team (from two engineers), they seem to work pretty separate from each other, so I reached out to them several times to start getting more context and learn stuff basically ( I was on the side cracking kubernetes and terraform books and information to be up to speed).  
One of the two engineers left around two weeks ago, and the remaining one is really hard to get some information from him. I have literally offered my help into picking up some low hanging fruit from them (now only he) and I was every time not denied directly, but nothing really happened.   
I have been lately being exposed to more challenging stuff which is nice, but at the same time I have no guidance. Manager is cool, I can't complain but I feel kind of trapped, all the things that I see on the board even though is not Chinese to me, I can't really do much and I feel miserable and really considering if this was a good decision. 

I'm not the smartest guy in the block and I'm not technically as this person ( I made that very clear when they offered the position to me). But I have been really working hard until  late in getting up to speed with stuff (namely terraform, clusters configurations), doing my home labs (they are not even close to what is actually is at prd) but I feel like I'm not contributing enough and I'm lacking from guidance.

Anyone has been in similar situation in the past? What would be some recommendations to try to level up technically ?

However, I’m concerned about ensuring data consistency during the migration, as my app handles a large user base, and many of them perform transactions throughout the day.

Here’s some context:

* My app is hosted on AWS and has multiple resources (like Lambda functions, Step Functions, and others) connected to the current MySQL database.
* The database contains critical financial records and other sensitive data, so consistency is non-negotiable.
* I need to minimize downtime and avoid scenarios where some parts of the system use the old database while others have switched to the new one, as this could lead to data integrity issues.

I’m looking for advice on:

1. Strategies or best practices for migrating to Aurora Serverless v2 with minimal disruption.
2. How to handle consistency across connected resources during the transition.
3. Any tools, patterns, or setups that can help with a seamless cutover.

devops,Filelog receiver to move the offset if log entry exceeded maxSize,"I have a use case where I need to use [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver) inside opentelemtry collector agent. The requirement is to add a feature to skip log entries if their size increased unreasonably beyond a certain limit.

For instance, given:

(A) log file `myservice.log`

(B) Three timestamps t0, t1, and t2.

* T0: 6Kb of logs
* T1: 1GB of logs
* T2: 8Kb of logs

The filelog receiver due to entry at T1 will lag behind, as it needs to emit all the logs entries received at T1. I want to skip T1's data and move the reader offset to **EOF** so at T2 it emits directly T2 data.

This can be achieved by moving the offset of the stanza [fileconsumer reader](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/stanza/fileconsumer). I created this GitHub PR: [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/33806](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/33806). Which offers a mechanism to move the offset if the log entries exceeded the maxSurgeSize. Sadly and reasonably enough, the PR won't be accepted.

I saw that max\_log\_size is configurable but max\_log\_size will truncate entries for the scanner, the scanner will end up reading them nevertheless. And we will end up lagging behind in terms of logs being read.

Are there any workarounds you propose? I want to avoid a fork of stanza pkg at all costs.

What does your day to day look like &amp; how much does this differ from these ""Senior"" roles?

I'm not disagreeing that it is by and large a senior role, but my personal experience was interning in government for a year as a DevOps engineer after 2 years of CS at university. I worked on a team where everybody else had 10-20YOE in general, and a mix of ex software engineers/ sysadmins. It felt like a great mentoring experience, and with that experience my very first job was as a DevOps engineer at my company where I've been for \~3 years now.

I'm generally responsible for a lot of AWS, creating IaC &amp; Docker images, creating new pipelines, creating tooling to automate more and more stuff at the company, setting up monitoring and occasionally bits of programming, testing or DB stuff. I have a couple of mentors at the company to go to when I can't figure stuff out, but thats not all the time, and plenty of times they can't so we all learn together.

I use python, bash, AWS, IaC, docker, and branching now into kubernetes, pretty much daily. I don't feel like I'm a 10x engineer, so I'm wondering just how lucky I got in this role. I think my company liked the idea of some limited devops experience as It meant I was much cheaper than more experienced competition, and more knowledgable than the competition at the same price.

In addition to regular storage administration tasks, I worked on bash and Python scripts for automation and monitoring. Our company was testing cloud storage solutions from AWS, which gave me the opportunity to work with S3, NetApp Cloud Volumes, and Storage Gateway. 

After moving to a new company, I was working on  containerizing a CIFS server and automating storage-related tasks on both the server and client side. This company was implementing a multi-cloud strategy for their application, and I worked with OpenShift, Helm, Azure Pipelines, Prometheus, Grafana, Python , bash, powershell, fluentd and AWS FSx with NetApp Ontap. While this role leaned more towards DevOps, I continued to focus on storage management.

In my current position, I'm responsible for implementing COTS solutions in AWS, which is more of a solutions architect/consultant role. I handle architecture design, compliance approvals, and the installation and configuration of applications, while the actual deployment of AWS resources is handled by a separate team. Even here, I continue to work with various NetApp storage products. My current company is an AWS partner and offers certification vouchers. I’ve completed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification and am currently studying for the Professional certificate.

I’m getting bored in my current role due to the slow decision-making process and corporate bureaucracy. I plan to switch roles once I earn my professional certificate. Given my background, I'm considering whether to stay in cloud consultant/architect roles or return to DevOps. What would you recommend based on my experience?


Edit: I'm confused because of my experience and skill set. It's more like a jack of all trades and a master of none. How would recruiters feel about my experience?

devops,Looking for an RDBMS migration tool,"Im in a company right now that does database migrations in a manual way - write sql scripts, and execute the scripts via DBA. The biggest pain point for me is that to ensure the scripts are idempotent, we have to write a lot of boilerplate code. So a simple insert row sql file becomes something like:

`DECLARE`  
`index_exists varchar(20);`  
`BEGIN`  
`SELECT COUNT(*) INTO index_exists FROM some_table WHERE some_index = 'xyz';`  
`IF(index_exists = 0) THEN`  
`INSERT INTO some_table(some_index) VALUES('xyz');`  
`END IF;`  
`END;`

Is there a tool that can handle the idempotency aspect of it, so that as devs all we need to do is write `INSERT INTO some_table(some_index) VALUES('xyz');` ? I've heard of Liquibase but I've also heard that depending on situations the changelog isn't guaranteed to only execute once, and so it's best practice to write them in a idempotent way.

devops,How should I manage Docker services + databases on bare metal,"I'm only familiar with cloud + k8s, but for a side project I need a decent amount of (cheap) compute power to make it profitable. For that reason I'm looking into renting some bare-metal servers and deploying there. I know some Linux basics but that's it.

**What I want to deploy**

It's about a (dockerized Go) web-application that consumes some external APIs, writes a bunch of data into a Postgres database (\~200gb) + Clickhouse DB (\~6TB). Besides that I need some reverse proxy and want to deploy some observability tools (maybe Prometheus &amp; Grafana). Would most likely fit on a single beefy server, but at most two servers. I don't need HA. 

**My question**

I'm wondering how a decent (to manage), but not overkill setup would look like in that case so that I can do my research and eventually learn what's needed to manage this. 

Some of the questions I'm having:

1. I'm aware of tools like Ansible, but I don't know how beneficial it is because it's imperatively. I'm somewhat afraid of ending up with commands that fail because my system state is somewhat different than expected by a playbook. My understanding is that it's good when managing a bunch of servers, but I expect to have no more than 1-2 servers anyways.
2. My web application will likely be 1-3 docker containers that I'd need to deploy. What's a reasonable way to operate docker containers. I'm aware there's k3s but I think it's a bit overkill for what I need.
3. Would I install the databases using the linux package manager or rather go for binaries? How would upgrading work?
4. What kind of (OS) maintenance/updates do I need to do regularly myself?",leventus93,1gqoebl,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gqoebl/how_should_i_manage_docker_services_databases_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gqoebl/how_should_i_manage_docker_services_databases_on/,2024-11-13 21:40:54,0,0.5,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gqoebl
devops,best free tier apm/logging dashboard in 2024?,"logrocket, new relic, sentry js? others?

Requirements:

each of my vps runs an app which does tasks, each vps acts like a node and connects to a central monitoring system.

the central monitoring system displays list of connected nodes, their performance as well as a list of previous events.

I can login using an ios app or web interface to my dashboard and monitor at any time.

errors are instantly sent as a push notification to my iphone.

the ability to communicate with my app from the dashboard, what I mean is, lets say there is an error, I can login on my phone and choose an action like (skip that action, try again, capture screenshot, pause all operations) etc.

It would be cool to be able to also show a graph like 'previous successful actions' and see how the tasks were handled based on last month.

It must have a free tier because its just for a small side project and not some big corporation, I dont even care that much about real time performance as much as I care about the vps doing its tasks properly.

devops,Seeking Advice for capstone project: Local Raspberry Pi vs. Cloud-Based Solution for multi IOT system Using Deep Learning,"Our project focuses on developing a system that improves accessibility for people with mobility disabilities by adjusting the height of the paintings in the museum according to the height of the visitors' faces using sensors, motors, a camera, and most importantly: a microprocessor controller. We aim to upgrade the system so that you can manage several drawings at the same time. Each drawing will have its own components, in addition to a microprocessor controller that allows identification of which controller we are talking to in a certain communication protocol.

Our system needs deep learning software to recognize a person in a wheelchair

The deep learning software will be heavy and require strong resources, so we are debating which approach to choose, and ask for your professional advice.

The options are:

1. Running the software locally: each painting system will use a Raspberry Pi 5 ai kit, which costs up to alot, which is capable of running the deep learning software.

Advantage: simple to implement, especially if you are dealing with one painting.

Disadvantages: complicated when there is more than one drawing, need Re-installation in each controller, complicated maintenance and high cost.

2. Using a powerful cloud server: replace the Raspberry Pi with a cheaper controller (esp32), and establish communication between the controller and the cloud.

Advantage: easier to maintain, economical, scalable.

Disadvantage: more complex system.

Questions:

1. For example: when 4 people are in wheelchairs and each, for example, approaches a different painting in the museum and needs identification at the same time, will the cloud withstand the load of resources?
2. Follow-up question, is synchronous programming necessary so that each request to the cloud (request from different visitors for each drawing) waits for the completion of the previous one? Meaning host 1 cloud for ML program that each painting system communicate with?

TL;DR:  debating between a local solution using Raspberry Pi for each drawing, which is more expensive but simple, and a cloud-based solution using it, which is cheap but complex.",Tormentally,1gqlgif,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gqlgif/seeking_advice_for_capstone_project_local/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gqlgif/seeking_advice_for_capstone_project_local/,2024-11-13 19:37:33,1,0.6,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gqlgif

devops,Security scanning IPs returns invalid cert! (TW: heavy sarcasm),"You're not going to believe this, everyone. When my organization's security team scans an IP address of my Kubernetes cluster's load balancer, they get back an invalid cert! I know, right? I run Kubernetes with AWS EKS, with a load balancer fronting the cluster. If you load any of the valid hostnames I have an ingress entry for, over HTTPS, you get back a valid certificate. But what the security team does is take the hostname I give them, resolve it to a set of load balancer IP addresses, and then individually scan each of those IP addresses. When they do that they get a cert for ""Kubernetes Ingress Controller Fake Certificate"", which is clearly an invalid cert, and therefore *clearly* a reason to fail my scan. (/end sarcasm)

Argh! I've told them repeatedly that if you connect to an IP address, with an IP address in the Host header, you're not conducting a valid test because you're getting a 404. You're not getting into the cluster. But furthermore!! Furthermore!! When connecting to *any* IP address – not just for this application -- there’s no possible certificate that *would* be valid. Certificates cannot be made to apply to connections directly to an IP. There’s no possible certificate I could provide that would secure a connection made to the IP addresses they're scanning, or to any IP address.

It's very frustrating because it delays deploying my application.",-lousyd,1gppmsa,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gppmsa/security_scanning_ips_returns_invalid_cert_tw/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gppmsa/security_scanning_ips_returns_invalid_cert_tw/,2024-11-12 17:06:45,73,0.97,73,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gppmsa

devops,"Seeking Advice for Setting Up a DevOps Homelab with New Tech Stack (Mac OS, Linux, K8s, Docker)","
Hey DevOps community,

I’m transitioning to a new company where the tech stack is quite different from what I’ve been working with so far, and I’m looking for some advice to help bridge the gap.

In my current role, I’ve managed to fully automate Windows Server deployments using Terraform, Ansible, and pipelines, and I have a solid background in PowerShell scripting. However, this new company operates with Mac OS and focuses heavily on Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, and Bash. While I have some exposure to these technologies, I’d like to quickly get hands-on experience to level up my skills.

I’m planning to set up a DevOps homelab at home to familiarize myself with this stack and am specifically looking for recommendations on Docker containers that would help me replicate a similar environment. Here’s what I have in mind:

	1.	Containers for Linux &amp; Bash: Any good base images for Linux systems that are frequently used in DevOps?

	2.	Kubernetes: Should I set up Minikube, K3s, or another local Kubernetes solution in Docker for learning and testing?

	3.	CI/CD Pipelines: Any recommended containers for simulating CI/CD workflows?

	4.	Python &amp; Automation: Best way to structure Python environments in Docker? Any tools you’d suggest I incorporate into my Python setup for DevOps?

	5.	Networking &amp; Infrastructure as Code: Any networking-related tools or IaC components that would be beneficial to include?

Essentially, I’m aiming to build a homelab that simulates a production-like DevOps setup on a smaller scale so I can dive into this new tech stack effectively. Any advice or suggestions on Docker containers, tools, or resources to help build this homelab would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for any insights you can share!",saladindevops,1gpun9c,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gpun9c/seeking_advice_for_setting_up_a_devops_homelab/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gpun9c/seeking_advice_for_setting_up_a_devops_homelab/,2024-11-12 20:31:27,2,0.59,2,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gpun9c
devops,[GKE] Docker images built on M1 Macbook Pro cause pods to crash,"Hey all,

I'm at my wit's end here. I'm trying to deploy an nginx web server to GKE to serve some static files. After creating a deployment, the pods fail immediately. `kubectl logs &lt;pod&gt;` produces this error:

`exec /docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error`

This error is commonly caused by a Docker image being built on an arm64 architecture instead of an amd64 architecture. Since I am on an M1 Macbook, I defined the architecture explicitly in the Dockerfile:


    FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:18-alpine AS builder
    WORKDIR /client
    COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
    RUN yarn
    COPY . .
    RUN yarn build
    
    FROM --platform=linux/amd64 nginx:alpine 
    COPY --from=builder /client/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
    EXPOSE 80
    CMD [""nginx"", ""-g"", ""daemon off;""]

Verify GKE nodes uses the same platform architecture:

Build the image, push image to artifact registry, create a new deployment, enable autoscaling, check the pods:

get logs:

    ➜  client git:(main) ✗ kubectl logs deploy-8c996f9d-47t97
    exec /docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error

Anything I'm missing here?

## Attempt 1: 

Passing a `--platform linux/amd64` does not seem to solve the problem.

Create the image:

    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t &lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt; . --load

Verify image uses `linux/amd64`:

    docker image inspect &lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;

        ""Os"": ""linux"",
        ""Size"": 52645991,
        ""VirtualSize"": 52645991, 

Push to registry, rebuild deployment:

    ➜  client git:(main) ✗ kubectl create deployment deploy --image=&lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;

    exec /docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error


## Solution

This problem was due to two problems:

1. Creating a docker image locally on an M1 Macbook Pro (ARM)

2. Kubernetes serving an old image instead of pulling a new one 

This command will instruct Docker to build an image using the linux/amd64 architecture and push it to the container registry you have configured

    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t &lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt; . --push

However, if you delete the image locally and rebuild it *using the same image and tag*, it will not bust Kubernetes cache if no `ImagePullPolicy` has been set. Kubernetes will see the same image and tag and pull from its local cache instead of pulling the updated image. The simplest solution was to use a new tag.",brodega,1gpq151,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gpq151/gke_docker_images_built_on_m1_macbook_pro_cause/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gpq151/gke_docker_images_built_on_m1_macbook_pro_cause/,2024-11-12 17:23:16,4,0.67,4,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gpq151

devops,How much AI do you use for your scripting?,"I am finding it impossible not to use AI. I know what I need to do, I break it down into steps for myself, and I just ask the AI to do that, and if it doesn't do what I want, I just prompt it in different ways (add this feature, remove this loop, add a logging feature, run this part of the code 10 times). A lot of times, I actually learn a lot from the way it does things - for example - I have some Python code that migrates some CIDR ranges from one place to another, but they need to be transformed along the way and I asked it to implement it once, and then again but using OOP -- and in the process, I learned a bit about OOP, and how it works. Maybe not the right place, but it doesn't matter, I feel like it's teaching me. I asked it to write a Bash script for some work I was doing, and it did an alright job - so I just kept prompting it to add more features, and I obviously read over it to make sure it is doing what I want it to, and it does! Eventually, I am able to add features myself, by sort of guessing what the structure would probably look like based on other code it's created. Sometimes I even take code output from one AI (e.g. ChatGPT) and feed it into another (e.g. Claude), asking it to critique the way the code is written, how it could be improved, etc.

I find it really hard to justify googling, reading 5 different forums, answers which are outdated, or modules that got deprecated etc. etc. trawling through garbage for a week, when the AI will show me the answer and why it's right, and I can learn from that instead. Learn by example, so to speak. I can ask it why that answer is right. If the script is really nice, I even keep it for myself so I can reference it in the feature. Now I spend maybe less than 10-20% of my time doing that searching, only occasionally looking for a few small features, mostly letting the AI do it, as I guide it.

I am completely aware this doesn't help my scripting skills whatsoever (maybe a little bit), but I am basically using AI as a tool. Are you guys also doing this? Are you guys still coding and scripting everything yourself, googling as you go along?

devops,Self-host GitHub Actions runners with Actions Runner Controller (ARC) on AWS,"# Terraform code for setting up Github ARC on EKS with Karpenter on AWS

I put together a detailed write-up on setting up self-hosted GitHub Actions Runners using ARC (Actions Runner Controller) on AWS using EKS.

This includes terraform code for provisioning the infrastructure, and helm configurations for Karpenter v1.0 setup. We also ran a couple of variants in configuration for cost and performance comparison using Karpenter for autoscaling and other best practices.

Using a couple of PostHog's OSS repo workflows as for testing, the variations of config were basically allowing Karpenter to pick runners of arbitrary sizes from the same instance family and figure out the scaling, vs forcing one node per job. The most interesting part from the post is added below.

# Performance and Scalability

All the jobs are run on the same underlying CPU family (m7a) and request the same amount of resources (vcpu and memory).

|**Test**|**ARC (Varied Node Sizes)**|**ARC (1 Job Per Node)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Code Quality Checks**|\~9 minutes 30 seconds|\~7 minutes|
|**Jest Test (FOSS)**|\~2 minutes 10 seconds|\~1 minute 30 seconds|
|**Jest Test (EE)**|\~1 minute 35 seconds|\~1 minute 25 seconds|

ARC runners with varied node sizes exhibited slower performance primarily because multiple runners shared disk and network resources on the same node, causing bottlenecks despite larger node sizes.

To address these bottlenecks, we tested a **1 Job Per Node** configuration with ARC, where each job ran on its own node. This approach significantly improved performance. However, it introduced higher job start delays due to the time required to provision new nodes.

&gt;Note: Job start delays are directly influenced by the time needed to provision a new node and pull the container image. Larger image sizes increase pull times, leading to longer delays. If the image size is reduced, additional tools would need to be installed during the action run, increasing the overall workflow run time.

# Cost Comparison

|**Category**|**ARC (Varied Node Sizes)**|**ARC (1 Job Per Node)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Total Jobs Ran**|960|960|
|Node Type|m7a (varied vCPUs)|m7a.2xlarge|
|Max K8s Nodes|8|27|
|Storage|300GiB per node|150GiB per node|
|IOPS|5000 per node|5000 per node|
|Throughput|500Mbps per node|500Mbps per node|
|Compute|$27.20|$22.98|
|EC2-Other|$18.45|$19.39|
|VPC|$0.23|$0.23|
|S3|$0.001|$0.001|
|**Total Cost**|**$45.88**|**$42.60**|

The cost comparison shows that ARC with 1 job per node is more cost effective than ARC with varied node sizes. This is also the more performant setup.

devops,Serverless vs Managed,"I am a serverless enthusiast. This has been the paradigm I’ve used in my cloud journey from the very beginning, so I don't have much hands-on experience with the ""provisioned"" approach. For a long time, I’ve found it hard to see the advantages of the latter for new greenfield projects.

Recently, I had an insightful conversation with a senior developer from another company after one of their meetups, where we discussed both paradigms, drawing on his experience in each. This gave me an opportunity to understand different perspectives.

We ultimately narrowed down the discussion to two conditions that were personally most relevant:

🔎 The team consists only of application developers with no expertise in cloud infrastructure management.
🔎 The project is greenfield, with no legacy constraints impacting the architecture choice.

Together, we discussed which paradigm might be the best fit under these conditions.

Now, I’d like to pose this question to a wider audience. Without revealing our conclusion, let me ask:

❓What would be your choice for the infrastructure paradigm under the provided conditions?",maks_piechota,1gozcct,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gozcct/serverless_vs_managed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gozcct/serverless_vs_managed/,2024-11-11 18:31:47,13,0.82,13,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gozcct
devops,Recommendations for building an App,"Hi, currently about to build a small app that will need to be scaled up eventually if it goes well.

I have had some experience with Docker, Kubernetes, GitOps, and Terraform, but I have never set them up from scratch myself. I worked on already existing codebases and learned the ropes as I needed. For my app, I am thinking of setting up a good infrastructure and workflow before i even work on the actual services. But I am little conflicted and was hoping if you guys could help with the following:

1. Do you think it’s worth putting effort into researching and trying to come with an infrastructure with industry standards now? Or should I be focusing on building my app first and figuring all this out later? 

2. Would it make sense to go with the big cloud providers from the get go? Or should I find some smaller compute provider for now(would appreciate any recs here). Obviously I would want to reduce the cost as much as I can especially at this stage but I would also want to avoid overhead when scaling up eventually. 
I don’t have a good idea of how far the free tiers of the big three cloud providers can get me. If you could share your experiences, that would be awesome.

I'm a mid level devops engineer for a company with pretty mature ecommerce platform techwise, and I'm looking for more ways/ideas to improve our platform. I'm hoping to show my initiative for my own career, as well as ""icing the cake"" that was pretty well baked when I was brought on board. For context

\- We are on Azure

\- We have a fairly robust and up to date monitoring solution built using Datadog

\- We are all containerized and kubified with gitops CD solutions

\- We have a suite of CICD templates that allow us to keep pipeline definitions small in the repos the are used

\- We have a suite of IaC templates that allow us to break out and organize modules into individual repos/environments within

\- We have a pretty solid hold on our network security, all with VPN's for dev access, WAF in front of the network, Istio for the cluster, hub and spoke arch with security policies in between networks

\- We are all in legal compliance for processing online transaction and storing pii

\- We have a solid suite of DR plans in place, most of which have automatic rollovers/backs with multi-regional (as much as the org wants to spend $$ for)

\- We are fairly up to date with IaC versions/providers and are currently hunting for tech debt

\- We are currently focusing on cost management/idles to try and make the platform run as inexpensively as possible

\- We are sorta on a ""feature freeze"" where most of the dev work is being made on small, incremental frontend changes that require little changes from the existing release platform

  
With all this being said, can anybody think of any work here that I may have missed and/or may be opportinities of places I can think ahead and shine?

devops,How Can I Scale This AWS Serverless Image Handler On Big Scale with Cost Analysis,"Hello Guys,

I recently deployed this solution for on of my client: [https://towardsaws.com/deploy-serverless-image-handler-for-image-processing-in-aws-cloud-848ae43bdfc3](https://towardsaws.com/deploy-serverless-image-handler-for-image-processing-in-aws-cloud-848ae43bdfc3)

This is working as expected, Now there are few challenges,

1. It uses sharp by default which has some basic functionality for image manipulation but I don't think it's possible to do Image manipulation like a GUI tool for example text or custom image on main image etc.

2. This is a simple solution with basic AWS Services being used behind the scene like

* AWS CloudFront
* AWS API Gateway
* AWS Lambda
* AWS S3
* AWS Rekognition
* AWS Secrets Manager

Currently it's a cheap solution based on serverless architecture with low usage, but if we go for high load/usage, is it a good solution or should we go for a server based deployment like ECS with EC2/Fargate Graviton for cheaper solution, Can it be able to handle big traffic like millions of requests and additionally computation load due to image processing on EC2 level, I think it will scale with Auto Scaling &amp; Load Balancing.

3. How can trace the usage cost, I was planning to deploy this individual for every users and then trace the cost on the basis of tags so I can get overall cost idea of complete stack on individual user, let me know if there is any other better option for this considering there are multiple components and based on that, cost analysis for Compute, No of requests and Bandwidth will different for different users.

Additionally, If we go for ECS with EC2/Fargate solution, can we trace the cost on individual level?

Please suggest how can we go live with this solution or go with other approach for kind of same logic to use it as SaaS?

devops,Seeking advice for implementing a self-service provisioning system with Terraform &amp; Ansible,"Hello r/devops,

I'm currently working on enhancing our network provisioning workflow using Terraform and Ansible. My goal is to streamline the process and make it more efficient. Here’s the vision:

* An **IPAM** (IP Address Management system) to manage all IP addresses across various VRFs (Virtual Routing and Forwarding).
* A **Vault** for storing additional, necessary information securely.
* A **Self-Service Portal** for the operations team to autonomously manage network requirements.

The idea is that when the operations team needs to provision additional network resources in a private cloud, they can simply request it through the self-service portal. This request would automatically fetch the necessary IP from the IPAM. The operations member selects the client, which informs the system about the corresponding VRF. Then, Terraform and Ansible would kick off in the background to create and configure the networks, making them fully operational.

**Here’s where I need your help:**

* I’m looking for recommendations on self-service portal software or templates that could be adapted for such a setup. Any suggestions?

**Questions for the community:**

1. Are there any additional tools or integrations you think could enhance this setup?
2. Has anyone here implemented a similar solution? What were your experiences and pitfalls?

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated as I navigate through this setup.

Thanks in advance!",Si-mooon,1go0mqb,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1go0mqb/seeking_advice_for_implementing_a_selfservice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1go0mqb/seeking_advice_for_implementing_a_selfservice/,2024-11-10 13:26:27,17,1.0,17,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1go0mqb
devops,Deleting Vault secrets from the container after init,"Our services are running with Vault injector that creates a `.env` file under `/vault/secrets/.env`, which we then source in our entrypoint:

    if [ -f /vault/secrets/.env ]; then
       source /vault/secrets/.env
       rm -rf /vault/secrets/.env
    fi

These are the annotations we use in our deployment:

    podAnnotations:
      vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: ""true""
      vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-.env: ""secret/data/test""
      vault.hashicorp.com/role: ""app""
      vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-.env: |
        {{- with secret ""secret/data/test"" }}
        {{- range $k, $v := .Data.data }}
        export {{ $k }}={{ $v }}
        {{- end }}
        {{- end }}

With this setup, Vault's agent runs in the Pod and watches that file continuously.

I want to avoid having Vault's agent running, so I added:
    
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate-only: ""true"" 

This annotation spawns a Vault job that creates that `.env` file and exits when it's done.


However this introduced a problem: when my app fails for whatever reason, the app's container restarts, not the entire pod. This results in my Vault's job not running again, so `/vault/secrets/.env` doesn't exist anymore.

I'm trying to decide what to do from here. I've set some goals in mind:

- Avoid running a Vault side container with my app
- Delete the secrets from the disk after init

I was looking into Vault's CSI driver to see if it could solve my issue but wanted to hear other opinions. Maybe I'm approaching this in the wrong way.

devops,I have launched an Open-Source Ingress Controller in Rust — flusso 🚀 Seeking Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement!,"Hi team

i was working this last months building a ingress controller from scratch built in Rust: **flusso**, I’m seeking feedback from the community to make it the most reliable, secure, and efficient ingress solution possible, and I’d be incredibly grateful if you could give it a try and let me know your thoughts.

**Why flusso?**  
I built flusso to address some of the limitations I’ve encountered in other popular ingress controllers:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Rust’s memory safety eliminates common vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows), making flusso a robust choice for security-focused deployments.
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Rust’s performance allows flusso to maintain high throughput without excessive CPU or memory consumption, especially under heavy loads.
3. **Improved TLS Management**: Automates certificate handling and provides easy setup for multi-domain configurations, minimizing downtime risks.
4. **Simplified Configuration**: flusso’s configuration is designed to be straightforward, with a GUI that displays backend services, status indicators, TLS info, host names, and ports at a glance.
5. **Flexible Observability**: Built-in support for detailed metrics and structured logs compatible with Prometheus and Grafana, making monitoring and debugging easier.

**What I’d love feedback on**:

* **Dashboard**: Is the GUI intuitive? Are the service details (status, TLS info, host, ports) helpful?
* **Performance**: How does flusso perform in your environment compared to other ingress controllers? Any bottlenecks?
* **Configuration &amp; Setup**: Was the setup process straightforward? Are there configurations that could be clearer or easier?
* **Suggestions for Features**: Are there additional features you’d like to see or any compatibility issues with your tech stack?

**How to Get Started**:  
flusso is available on GitHub https://github.com/DioCrafts/flusso. The current version is 0.0.1, so your feedback will help shape its roadmap and future improvements. I am just starting with the project, and i am working on it as hobbie in my free time.

If you’re interested in testing or have any thoughts on how to improve flusso, please leave a comment or DM me! All feedback, both positive and constructive, is welcome as it’ll help me refine flusso to meet real-world needs.

devops,Currently DevOps but offered SRE Role,"Dumb question, but am I making the right transition?

I'm currently a DevOps Engineer, focusing on CI/CD pipelines, IaC, and the usual infrastructure troubleshooting stuff. I've recently been offered an SRE position where I'd be diving deeper into automating alerts, standardizing monitoring, and doing more root cause analysing.

I'm probably overthinking this since SREs still apply DevOps methodologies, but my concern is how this will affect my long-term career trajectory as a DevOps Engineer. I don't want to lose market value with my new title. Are people with SRE backgrounds more useful as DevOps engineers than say, someone who was a sysadmin?

devops,Software Engineer Starting My Journey as a Solo DevOps at a Startup – Seeking Advice and Support!,"Hey Reddit,

I’m a full-stack software engineer with 6 years of experience backend + support role as frontend (Fuck you CSS😂), and I’ve developed a real passion for DevOps and SRE. Even though my role is mainly software engineering, I often end up handling a lot of the automation work for my team, like:

• **Docker** for containerization

• **Jenkins** for CI

• **Jenkins + Ansible** for CD

• **Terraform** for managing Dev environments

• Basically, automating whatever I can when I have the time!  


Right now, I’m studying for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)** to strengthen my cloud skills  
  
I recently landed an offer for a DevOps position, starting this December. Super excited, but I’m also feeling the nerves kick in. It’s at a startup where I’ll be the only DevOps person working alongside some backend engineers. I know it’s a fantastic opportunity, but the idea of not having anyone experienced in DevOps/SRE on the team to bounce ideas off of or learn from makes me a bit apprehensive.  
  
do you think you can give me some pieces of advice or anything that can help me kick-start my way through?

Here’s the kicker: I’ve been aiming to transition from Software Engineering to DevOps for a while now, but I keep hitting roadblocks in applications to larger companies with dedicated DevOps teams. My background and CV still heavily lean towards software engineering, and I’ve often been rejected as a “misfit” in HR screenings. It’s like HR filters me out before I even get a chance to explain my interest in DevOps!

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot or has advice on how to best navigate this role and build out DevOps skills in a team with no dedicated mentorship. Any resources, communities, or tips on structuring my day-to-day would be super helpful!

Thanks in advance, and here’s to hoping I can make this work!

The count metrics are incrementing counters and the latency metric is a histogram.

We're pretty big users of Datadog but unfortunately the tags we need makes Datadog cost prohibitive because they charge by unique tag value and it's a cardinality.

We also use Honeycomb but their expertise is in distributed tracing and their graphing and alerting on the metrics leaves a lot to be desired. For example, I'm not able to accurately graphql the error rate because you can't run calculations on queried data.

I am a single DevOps engineer who has been solely responsible for CICD and cloud topics. Over the last year the team for this project has been getting smaller from 6 people (4 devs, 2 DevOps), now down to 2 people (1 dev, 1 devop).

There are many reasons for me leaving but the main one is because of I feel stuck in an eco chamber. I have no one anyone to bounce ideas off of regarding work in my area of responsibility.  No one really able to review my work properly and mostly done by rubber stamping every PR without really reviewing it. 

This leaves me constantly double guessing myself and has had a negative effect on my ability to make decisions. The reason I feel guilty is because there will be no one left to take over my responsibilities and I feel like the project could fail without me. 

I try to tell myself that’s not really my fault or responsibility to make sure there is people for business continuity. I have also brought this problem up with my manager on multiple occasions but nothing has really changed.

devops,Was asked this system design question during an interview. Was my approach acceptable?,"So I recently had a technical interview where the interviewer asked me how I’d design a scalable credit-based system. It was a pretty interesting challenge, so I thought I’d break down my approach here so that you guys can let me know if I did anything wrong or if this approach would fail in any way.

  
Here are the requirements given during the interview

* **Track user credits** (adding/subtracting credits based on transactions)
* **Handle high concurrency** (multiple users accessing/updating their balances simultaneously)
* **Be traceable and auditable** (every transaction should be recorded for accuracy)
* **Scale well** for high read and write demands
* **Allow users to purchase more credits**

  
**My Approach**

So first of all, I have 3 schemas for Users, Credits, and Transactions table. You can view the snippets here [https://pastebin.com/AuBBx517](https://pastebin.com/AuBBx517)

  
To make sure updates were atomic (especially with concurrent users), I proposed using PostgreSQL transactions with `FOR UPDATE` row-level locking. This ensures that only one update on a user’s balance can happen at a time. I've also proposed to use Redis for caching data to ensure that we can support high reads. As for cache invalidation, I ensure that the value in the cache is updated every time there's a new transaction being sent to the database. 

To support auditing and monitoring, I proposed to use either Prometheus or Grafana to track any metrics such as number of failed transactions, high frequency transactions, and for traceability. 

However, this seems too simple and was wondering if I should change my approach for this question? The interview did mentioned scalability, so should I have just introduced Kubernetes for database scalability and using kafka streams to approach this problem?

devops,SonarSource/SonarCloud pricing strategy - anyone running their open source alternative?,"tldr;   
SonarCloud becomes too expensive - does anyone have experience with SonarSource OpenSource version and with the limitations of that version?

Long Story: 

SonarSource/SonarCloud recently adjusted their pricing drastically (from \~3200 Euro/year for 1M LoC to 7200 Euro/year for 1M LoC). The price changed between July 2024 and October 2024 without any considerable change in features. Our contract was signed in July 2024 - so an actual renewal will be next year - but still I want to be prepared for when we either reach the 1M LoC limit or the contract renewal date.

devops,DTLS data length bytes,"Hi, Reddit!

I'm learning how TLS/DTLS works under the hood. I've found a lifesaver [site](https://dtls.xargs.org/) that describes every packet and every byte there. But I can't understand what `length(group of bytes in the end of some headers)` stands for.

So here's a `ClientHello` packet:

    16 fe fd 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9d 01 00 00 91 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 91 fe fd e0 e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7 e8 e9 ea eb ec ed ee ef f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 fa fb fc fd fe ff 00 00 00 06 13 01 13 02 13 03 01 00 00 61 00 33 00 26 00 24 00 1d 00 20 35 80 72 d6 36 58 80 d1 ae ea 32 9a df 91 21 38 38 51 ed 21 a2 8e 3b 75 e9 65 d0 d2 cd 16 62 54 00 2b 00 03 02 fe fc 00 0d 00 20 00 1e 06 03 05 03 04 03 02 03 08 06 08 0b 08 05 08 0a 08 04 08 09 06 01 05 01 04 01 03 01 02 01 00 16 00 00 00 0a 00 04 00 02 00 1d

Then you can find the DTLS Record hHeader explanation:

    16 fe fd 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9d

* ...other bytes, we don't need them in terms of this question
* 00 9d - length of following data in this record (0x9D (157) bytes)

So, the explanation says that the last 2 bytes represent length of following data. I can't figure out what length and what data. How it calculated and where that 157 bytes come from?

You can find other ""magic""(for me... sure that's not random numbers and hope I'll find out where they come from 🙂) lengths.

Here's TLS Handshake Header comes next:

    01 00 00 91

* 01 - handshake record type 1 (ClientHello)
* 00 00 91 - 0x91 (145) bytes of client hello data is in this handshake record.

What 145 bytes? Where they come from?

Could you describe what that lengths stand for?

devops,Help with Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup for Angular App in Docker,"I’ve been working on deploying my Angular app using Docker, and I’m running into an issue with my Nginx reverse proxy configuration. Here’s the current setup:

* **Architecture**:
   * Internet -&gt; VPS Nginx (SSL, 443) -&gt; Docker Container Nginx (`5555`) -&gt; Angular Files
   * The Docker container for the Angular app is running on port `5555`, and Nginx inside the container is serving the Angular files.
* **Issue**:
   * When I try to access the app via the domain ([https://xyz.com/](https://teamwayit.com/)), I’m getting the Nginx welcome page instead of my Angular app.
   * I can confirm the app is running properly in the container, as I get the Nginx welcome page when accessing the container directly (via `curl localhost:5555`).

The main problem seems to be that the Nginx on the VPS is not correctly passing the requests to the Nginx in the Docker container, even though both are running and configured.

devops,How do you deploy fast in a monolith?,"I'm interested in learning how large teams who work with a monolith codebase and two weeks sprint deploy with a focus on frequency.

My team of about 20 engineers on a monolith codebase is struggling with deploying small pieces in record time, which is anti-agile.

Please share what your team structure, process and pipeline look like to support you releasing frequently on a monolith.

What CI/CD tools and strategies do you have locked down in your team?

Thanks 

EDIT: Apologies I missed out some details.

Here's an overview of our workflow;

1. Devs implement and commit code during the sprint. Release branch is cut and pushed to SIT environment at the end of the sprint. (2 weeks).

2. QAs test the cut branch. (2 weeks on the average for a team of three QAs. Most testing processes are manual. There are backlogs of completed sprints yet to be tested. We're in sprint 3 and QA have only just started testing work from sprint 1. I'd say this is a major bottleneck. 

With our current structure (monolith), we're unable to cherrypick what's to be cut into the branch or QAed as the branch/codebase has to move in one sweep. I suppose my question would be how do you manage code committments, testing, UAT and deployment and achieve getting smaller piece of work committed, tested and deployed in time?

3. Once QA is somewhat done, stories are sent to the business for UAT. (1 week). 

4. With UAT sign-off, we deploy.

devops,[ANNOUNCEMENT] cijoe: A New Workflow and Productivity Tool for Systems Development Nears v1.0 – Feedback Welcome!,"Hey r/devops community!

I'm excited to announce that **cijoe**, a workflow and productivity tool built with a focus on **systems development** and **ease of use**, is about to hit its **v1.0 release**! 🎉 Before we finalize, we're eager to get feedback and hear your view on its usefulness.

# What is cijoe?

cijoe is a lightweight, Python-based tool that’s been in the works for **six years**. It’s designed to make it easier to **reproduce build, testing, and benchmarking tasks** across diverse environments, including **cloud infrastructure**, **physical lab setups**, and **local development**. If you’ve used tools like **Just, Makefile, GitHub Actions, Fabric/Invoke, or Ansible**, cijoe will feel familiar—yet it’s unique with its **low learning curve** and **re-targetable scripts**, offering a flexible way to manage and automate workflows.

And, of course, cijoe is **open-source** with a **BSD-3-Clause license**—so it’s free to use and contribute to!

# Project Links

* **Documentation**: [cijoe.readthedocs.io](https://cijoe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/refenv/cijoe](https://github.com/refenv/cijoe)

# Key Features of cijoe

* **Agentless “Initiator/Target” Model**: cijoe operates in an agentless fashion, using general-purpose **SSH** and **SCP** for command execution and data transfer. This model doesn’t require Python on the target machine—just on the initiator—making it versatile for systems where installing additional software on the target is undesirable.
* **Simple Python Interface**: With just a few API calls (`cijoe.run`, `cijoe.get`, and `cijoe.put`), cijoe scripts make complex workflows reproducible and easy to follow.
* **Re-targetable Scripting**: The **target** for `cijoe.run()` command executions, as well as `cijoe.put()` and `cijoe.get()` transfers, can be easily re-targeted. This means that a single script can be adapted to run on different machines or environments (cloud, physical lab, local, etc.) with minimal adjustment.
* **Integrated HTML Reporting**: cijoe includes integrated HTML reporting, making it very convenient to share results with colleagues. The reports are structured for readability and allow for quick insights into task performance and outcomes.

# Why This Release Matters

Version 1.0 marks a major milestone, stabilizing features and API to ensure it’s production-ready and friendly for long-term support. With its streamlined interface and scripting flexibility, cijoe aims to make automated workflows and reproducible tasks more accessible to developers and DevOps engineers alike.

# Looking for Your Feedback!

As we polish this release, I’d love feedback from a wider audience. Are there features you’d like to see? Any pain points in similar tools you’d hope cijoe can solve? If you’ve had a chance to try it, what’s your experience been like so far?

Feel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions here, or if you’d like to explore the code directly, head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/refenv/cijoe).

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas!

devops,Professional crossroads,"**Hello everyone,**

I'm writing this message because I need some advice.

I'll give a brief overview of my background to help you understand my journey.

I'm 41 years old with 16 years of experience in IT support, specializing in networks.

I worked for three years with France's second-largest internet service provider, handling advanced network troubleshooting for large accounts, primarily French multinationals.

Then, I moved to follow my partner at the time, left that job, and found a temporary position as an IT support technician at a university.

My supervisors encouraged me to take the civil service exam to become a permanent employee.

There were three positions available, with 400 applicants. I finished first by studying alone on weekends for several months before passing the three exams required for my permanent position (I’m not trying to brag, just to give you an idea of my ability to work independently).

I've been in this role since 2012, providing Level 2 and 3 network support across the entire campus and remote sites.

I've grown somewhat tired of this job, and despite the various responsibilities I’ve been given, I'm starting to feel worn out.

I also manage a few Linux servers used for relatively simple tasks like DHCP, NTP, etc.

I want to change careers for several reasons:

1. I'd like to work fully remote to join my new partner, who was transferred abroad.
2. I’d like to increase my salary.
3. I want to learn programming because it's always interested me, though I've never really invested time into it as I felt a bit lost.

Lately, I've been exploring what I could do with my skills and what interests me, and I've seen that DevOps might suit me well.

I don’t have the time or money to go back to school, but I do have a strong capacity for self-learning.

Which language should I learn?  
Is it realistic to change careers by learning on my own?

I would really like a quick transition to a field I’d enjoy. I've always loved networks and servers, but I'm also very interested in application development.

What would you advise?

I have been passively looking for a change over the last year and a half but looks like the market is very though (Lower salaries and RTO).

There are a lot of providers that need to operate together when building a website. Let's take a random example: 

1. CI and CD on Github 

2. Frontend hosted on vercel 

3. Backend hosted on GCP 

  
All of them need their own environmental variables (for prod, staging, and dev) on top of additional variables to connect to each other (e.g. github needs vercel access token to push a new version). 

  
Both github and vercel can connect to gcp using Workload Identity Federation, and that's great. However, there are still variables that need to be coordinated (e.g. the url of the gcp backend created by the terraform-based CD pipeline on Github needs to be in sync with what vercel sends requests to). 



Any of these systems has ways to save environment variables, but maintaining them in sync (outside of any code but in some opaque internal systems) seems like a recipe for confusion.

I have multiple Github Actions deployed. All written of course in YAML, and they give me a big head ache, I am looking for something like CDK/Pulumi for CloudFormation or cdk8s for k8s YAMLs.   
One of the issues I have with those YAMLs:

* Its hard to validate that everything is going to work as you expect 
* Syntax is not very clear - especially in cases of IFs 
* Imorting local actions is a nigtmare - what are the parameters of every action, what are optional/required, changing parameters on the origin and what it affect 
* Doing more advanced things like loops is becoming very weird very fast 

  
I do use act to test things locally [https://github.com/nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) but it misses many things. Many times my local act stup works, but the remote github job fails. 

I am considering using github action that just runs Pulumi and do everything and Pulumi like [https://www.pulumi.com/blog/docker-build/](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/docker-build/) but it seems wrong. 

Is writing custom Github actions [https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/tree/main](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/tree/main) \- isnt it too much of boiler plate?

devops,Looking for a better workflow engine,"I am running a CMP that has a workflow engine in it. In some ways their workflow engine is cool - it supports all kinds of different task types (shell scripts, powershell, ruby, Go, python, and many more). It has a nice service chaining capability where you can grab the result from Task A, and it can be accessible downstream to further tasks B,C,D etc.  I should mention that this is NOT containerized / microservices stuff. These are just administrative scripts, mostly reporting stuff.

Where this workflow is weak, comes to ""administering"" the workflow. It gets hung up and I can't clear it, I can't stop jobs that are in a hung state (spinning circle), and I can't put rules in such as ""if this task has a return code of X, keep going"" - which means that these workflows stop no matter what task fails, and you can't fix/restart the workflow.

devops,Opinions on proposed Github Actions workflow step? ,"I have a Github Actions workflow which deploys Terraform infra to Oracle Cloud. I am using remote state stored in OCI Storage Buckets. I am trying to make the entire configuration and deployment process as automated as reasonably possible. Rather than configuring state bucket manually, I put together python scripts which check for a pre-existing state file in a bucket for my template - and if the bucket / state file does not already exist, another set of scripts creates them. The final output is a pre-authenticated URL which will be used by TF engine to access remote backend - this is a sensitive secret, of course.

I am working on logic which takes the pre-auth URL within the same bucket/state creation script at the end and then uses Github API to create an environment secret with the pre-auth URL.

devops,Package managers to speed up build,"So I am considering to refactor our build setup to make builds faster and generally megs the life of the developers easier.

The thing is that we have an application which is dependent on 4 different libraries we also make.

3 of the libraries are written in C++ and one is written in rust. The frontend application is written in dart(flutter ) for windows.

So my plan is to try to use a package manager and an internal repo to publish the packages. The builds will then get dependencies from the local package repository.

Currently I’m looking at vcpkg as package manager and azure devops as an artifact storage of cached vcpkg build.

Does anybody have a setup like this? Are there other and better ways of doing this?

Could I also use cargo or NuGet?

Will this setup be annoying for the developers?

I have suggested everything from VPN access, client certificates / mTLS, private links, etc. instead of whitelisting, but our dev team is on a tight deadline and the solutions suggested would require either changing the existing service or getting the third party to make changes.

devops,"What does ""Yes"" look like","“No” is an easy default response to big technical asks. It manages the risk and expense of large projects with unknown complexity and (let’s be honest) will often take less of your time than a “Yes”. Some times it’s also the correct answer. No, we can’t make a square with three sides.

“No” usually doesn’t help the business though. There’s a reason the PHB is asking for a square with three sides. It might also be tied to some fundamental misunderstanding, but underneath the request is a problem they’re trying to solve (maybe they just need a triangle). Your job as a skilled devops professional is to understand and help solve that problem.

As a matter of soft skills, you should generally address their question in some way before telling them it sounds like the wrong question. “Squares definitionally have four sides, but we do have the ability to make three-sided polygons. They’re called triangles, and they can only have one right angle unlike a square.”

By the time a technical request makes it from the business side over to the tech organization, “yes” is really the only answer they’ll accept. You might be tempted to say “no” and leave it at that, but instead you should just tell them what “yes” looks like.

Switching analogies, let’s say the PHB wants to build a racquetball court as an addition to the office building. Instead of saying “that’s way out of budget and we can’t even get a building permit for that addition” try explaining what it would take to make it work if you had unlimited resources. Explain the cost of labor and materials for the building, the legal process of getting the permits, the unsolved problem of where to fit such a building on the premises.

At the end if you can give a ballpark of the time and total cost and what other projects will be deprioritized to accomplish it, your “yes, and” will have a much stronger case than a “no”. If you frame your answer as “yes” and then let them discover that such a project isn’t feasible, now you can work together to figure out another solution.

If you had just flatly said “no” in the first place you’re making the interaction adversarial. With a “yes, and” it’s collaborative. Alright, that won’t work but let’s explore other solutions.

And now comes the best question you can ever ask a business person: “What problem are we trying to solve?”

Contrary to popular belief, business people are pretty terrible at communication so they generally don’t think to start with the problem at hand. But once you have that you can use your special engineer brain to find a solution. If the PHB wants a racquetball court because they want to be able to play racquetball, you can suggest they get a YMCA membership instead. Now you’ve solved their problem and saved them a big pile of money. If you do this a few times you will be every PHB’s favorite engineer.",kaen_,1ghy9rq,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1ghy9rq/what_does_yes_look_like/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1ghy9rq/what_does_yes_look_like/,2024-11-02 14:56:56,4,0.6,4,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1ghy9rq

devops,New Grad Seeking Advice on Pursuing a DevOps Career,"Hello, I’m a new grad with a deep interest in DevOps.

To give you a brief introduction, I started my journey during a co-op term with the Ontario government, where I was involved in a Kubernetes project. This experience sparked my fascination with Kubernetes, which was not the kind of thing taught in university, leading me to dive deeper into studying and eventually discovering DevOps. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to building a strong foundation, earning certifications like CKA, CKAD, LFCS, AWS Admin, Azure Admin, and CCNA, and doing projects to hone my skills. I’m continually working to advance my knowledge and skills and would appreciate any advice on pursuing a career in DevOps.

1. I know that DevOps is not typically an entry-level position. Therefore, even if it's not exactly DevOps, what entry-level positions are there that involve technologies like Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, and cloud platforms?

devops,My First ever DevOps interview,"This was my very first interview for a DevOps engineering role. Coming from a non-technical background, I took the initiative to learn everything on my own. I turned to YouTube and self-taught programming. After facing many challenges, I eventually joined a company as a junior software developer, where I worked for over two years. During this time, I realized that DevOps was more intriguing to me than programming alone. I started learning AWS on my own, building on some familiarity with Amazon from a prior non-technical role there. To further solidify my skills, I completed the Cloud Resume Challenge, which covers many foundational tasks expected of a DevOps or cloud engineer. I also earned the AWS Cloud Quest certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner. A few months later, I secured an internship in AWS Cloud Engineering, marking what I see as the true starting point of my DevOps career  

  
I didn’t expect to crack it on the first try, though I had a bit of hope. The interviewer began by introducing himself and then asked me to do the same. I handled this easily and confidently. The next question was, ‘Why DevOps and not programming?’ I explained that I’m more drawn to the later stages of the software lifecycle. He then skipped some of the technical questions on Linux and Docker, given my prior experience working with them. He asked about Kubernetes, and I shared that I’d worked with it while deploying a Django project of my own. He followed up with a few detailed questions, and although I couldn’t answer them technically, I described the role of different Kubernetes components and why they’re used.  
  
At the end of the interview, I asked about the experience they were looking for, as the job description hadn’t specified any required years of experience. He mentioned that they’re ideally looking for someone with more experience, but with plans to expand, they might open roles for less experienced candidates in the future. I shared that this was my first DevOps interview and asked for feedback on skills to focus on. He offered some helpful pointers, and it became clear that they need someone ready to handle tasks independently from day one.  
  
What’s less clear to me is what specific skills or projects would best prepare me to get into an entry-level DevOps role.

I understand the bluntness of my question, but I also understand that this domain isn't exactly full of ""Junior"" DevOps Engineers so the playing field for job switches is interesting and extremely nuanced.

Peer review has always just been a normal part of the way I've worked in all my previous teams.

In this team I'm working in though, it's just not a thing they seem to do. From their perspective, they've just got a task to do and they just do it. As long as it works, that's all that really matters. In a recent meeting, a colleague of mine said flatly that he doesn't want to review other people's work. He says he's got other things he'd rather be doing and that he trusts our ability.

I don't agree with his point at all. The point isn't about trust, it's about encouraging each other to think critically about implementation, to knowledge share and to prevent siloing.

The author breaks down how deploying even a basic Rails app to AWS requires wrestling with Docker, ECR, ECS, load balancers, security groups, and more DevOps complexity. They contrast this with Heroku's revolutionary ""git push"" simplicity from 2007, and discuss newer PaaS alternatives like Fly.io and Railway.app. While these platforms work well for standard apps, they can become limiting for specialized needs. The post highlights some promising developments, like Cased's branch deployment system, and suggests that Vercel's success in frontend deployments points to a future where we might have more integrated, opinionated platforms that handle everything from CI/CD to monitoring without requiring developers to piece together multiple tools.

Over the past few months, I've been building BuildBudget - a tool to help teams understand and optimize their GitHub Actions spending. The problem hit close to home when our team's CI/CD costs started climbing and we couldn't easily figure out which workflows were the main contributors.

What it does right now:

* Shows your top 100 most time-consuming workflows and jobs
* Breaks down usage by repo, org, workflow, or job
* Calculates costs for GitHub-hosted runners
* Compares what you'd pay using AWS CodeBuild instead

It's pretty bare bones at the moment, but it works. I'm sharing it early because I want to shape its development based on real feedback from other engineers dealing with CI/CD costs. Check it out at [buildbudget.dev](https://buildbudget.dev) \- it's free during beta, and setup takes less than a minute if you're using GitHub.com. It's also available for teams using GitHub Enterprise Server, via webhook.

* Which CI/CD cost problems are you struggling with?
* What would make this actually valuable for your team?

I know that this is a devop sub and not mlops. I already posted my question in mlops sub as well. But I want to get answers from ppl who've been doing devops for a long time because they have their tricks in their sleeves!

So the question is in the title.

I know that there is a ton of cloud providers out there offering good prices with good GPU powered VMs to deploy ML models. My question is, based on your experience, what is the best cost effective approach amongst the providers available out there?

By cost effective I mean something that offers very good GPUs but if possible has a per-use cost model. So that we only pay when our deployed ML model is being used.

All of our models require good GPUs. We can't go the CPU route.

devops,Data Platform Strategy ,"So as part of our DevOps culture we moved to ""Platform Engineering"" we started to deploy tools for dev Teams and find ways for devs to easily deploy ""directly"" related infrastructure for their apps, etc.

However we are kinda struggling with the data scientists (and science people since we have a reseach branch in the company) They need tools such as juperhub, Argo Workflows, mlflow, etc

I understand this to be part of the company platform, however I wonder if there are other strategies with separate teams specifically for data engineering. 

Until now we have considered data engineering as a separate responsibility, however there is no real ownership because of lack of resources, and even if it's not our strength I'm starting to think the only way is to integrate it with the Platform Team.

What do you think?

Which strategies you use in your companies?

devops,Multiple Jenkins pipelines for each microservice? How to approach this? ,"Still quite new to devops. As a practice project I want to set up CI/CD for my microservices (React frontend, 2 spring boot microservices on backend).

I have a single repository with 3 sub-projects that require similar build processes.

I manage to set up Jenkins (locally installed on host) to build my frontend image and push it to Docker Hub (webhook from github triggers build).  The Jenkinsfile is under frontend/.

But now I want to proceed and create similar pipelines for Microservice A and B. I'm not sure how to approach it. Should I put Jenkinsfiles under each sub-project? Should I have a single Jenkinsfile with conditional logic?  
I also read about Multibranch Pipelines but I don't think it's suitable for my scenary.

devops,"Alternatives or more reliable architectures to a self-hosted, K8s-based KeyCloak","Hey folks,

We have a self-hosted, k8s-based KeyCloak instance (also its postgres is in K8s), which handles authentication and in many cases part of the authorization process of a looot of services: VPNs, K8s, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, etc.

Accessing the KeyCloak resources, needs KeyCloak authentication (VPN and K8s). It is possible to access it without, but it isn't something we do usually and it's also not straightforward at all.

You probably see the problem here. So, my question is: What are the alternatives? The should be KeyCloak compatible, so that we can export/import our current configs, of course.

Here are a few options that come to mind:

- Move KeyCloak to a redundantly configured VM setup like ec2 machines, and its DB to some reliable managed service like RDS (still a self-hosted setup).
- Move the whole KeyCloak to a managed KeyCloak service with guarantees and SLAs. If so, what providers would you recommend?
- Other options and ideas, maybe?

The goal is to reduce the probability of KeyCloak failure and facilitate its repair in the case of failure.

Thank you in advance!

**Edit:**

Sorry, maybe I haven't articulated the problem clearly enough.

Authentication to the infra that allows you to connect to the backend of the KeyCloak server, relies on the KeyCloak server itself. With the KeyCloak server down, it becomes difficult to access the K8s cluster, where it is running (it isn't impossible, but needs jumping through loops...)

The idea is, to make the KeyCloak server more reliable and access to it easier without reliance on the KeyCloak server.

devops,Quick review of Pulumi ESC,"I have been playing with Pulumi ESC since they went GA last month. Here are my quick thoughts on it:

1. It's very practical for centralizing configuration or secrets in environments that can inherit from each other
2. I like how ESC can get secrets from other stores like Azure Key Vault or 1Password. This feature makes it more than just a vault. Unfortunately, some sources like Bitwarden are not yet supported
3. I found that configuring OpenID Connect was quite challenging but once it's set up, being able to easily retrieve short cloud access tokens from an environment opens up a whole range of possibilities
4. ESC has interesting integrations with other tools (like Direnv of Terraform). I've only used the Pulumi IaC integration which is very handy
5. ESC is not completely open source (it seems only some parts like the CLI are) so you can't self-host it unless you pay a license 😕
6. The vscode extension is fairly basic but very nice to modify the environments

devops,Over-Engineering Your Site 101: And So Can You,"https://www.beatsinthe.cloud/blog/over-engineering-your-site-101-and-so-can-you/

I wanted to share my learning journey so here’s the TLDR for those that don’t want to read the full thing (However I included diagrams in the article for you to visualize what I did):

Started with a landing page to showcase my work. I added a blog, quickly pivoted from managed WordPress, and initially this meant my set up was:

• Ghost on AWS via Docker

• DigitalOcean K8s for landing page

• GitOps with ArgoCD

• Multi-cloud setup for Ghost, plus Nginx reverse-proxying into the managed cluster

Once I saw I was weeks away from costs soaring ($55 across both clouds compared to $17.20), I switched to Hetzner and K3s, consolidating everything. Eliminating docker and aws, adding falco, linkerd, grafana and Prometheus. Some takeaways:

1. Simple architecture is often best when the deployment calls for it. Multi-cloud isn’t always worth it when you don’t need it

2. Learning to work with PV and PVCs was rewarding, but it kicked my ass

3. Testing saves time, if a tool is popular doesn’t mean it’s for you. I almost went with Cilium over Linkerd for the production branch, and that would’ve been a mistake since I was looking for something light and fast. 

4. Enterprise-grade infrastructure can be budget-friendly (if you’ve taken the time to test, fail, break things and build again)

5. GitOps best practices will save you so much time when implemented correctly. Got creative with how to do this with Ghost

6. Build to scale.

`push to development &gt; builds binary &gt; names it binary_git_short_sha &gt; deploy it to server with command`

`ansible-playbook -i .ansible/inventory -e ""binary_name=${BINARY} "" --limit staging .ansible/playbook.yml`

BINARY variable has the value of the binary name, but when i call it in drone pipeline in a step i get binary\_name=  in the -e variables. If i replaced the ${BINARY} with lets say `${DRONE_BRANCH`} that is an environment variable set by drone at the start of the pipeline the value is there it would be `binary_name=development` but any time i define a variable by hand it does not work. Ive tried even running a bash script that would define the variables and pass them to the ansible command and run it all inside the script but the source would be the same and the result would be the same as well.

devops,GitLab CI/CD Pipeline with multiple ArgoCD clusters,"We're migrating our azure pipelines over to GitLab, and so far the build process is fairly straightforward.

The problem is we're using multiple instances of ArgoCD, so the same application is deployed to multiple clusters with ArgoCD set up on each cluster.

I can't find a good way to reflect the ArgoCD sync status in the pipeline, and have this 'gate' the subsequent stages of the pipeline.

The pipeline looks something like this:

* install dependencies
* build/ push the image to Azure ACR
* write the image tag to a git repo -&gt; webhook from the repo to ArgoCD to trigger sync
* ArgoCD picks up the change to the image tag and syncs

The problem is that in the final step we've effectively 'handed off' to ArgoCD, and the only way around this I can see is to have a stage that sleeps and periodically calls each ArgoCD endpoint to get the sync status, and once all apps have synced to mark the stage as successful/failed.

This seems quite a janky workaround, and the only 'good' alternative would be to move away from Argo and have GitLab update the kubernetes manifests - this is a big change that's not really feasible for us at this time.

Does anyone have any suggestions or a similar setup?

devops,Need Help: Using Red Hat Developer Subscription on Azure VM,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently trying to use a Red Hat Developer subscription on an Azure VM, but I’m facing some challenges. Here’s the situation:

1. **Azure RHEL Subscription**: I created an Azure VM using the default RHEL image from the Azure Marketplace, which incurs some costs.
2. **Developer Subscription**: I want to switch to a Red Hat Developer subscription, but Azure doesn’t directly provide it.
3. **VM Creation Attempts**: I tried to create a VM using an ISO I downloaded, created a VM in VirtualBox, and then made a VHD from it. However, when I uploaded the VHD to Azure and attempted to create a VM from it, it didn’t work.

# My Questions:

* Is there a more straightforward way to use a Red Hat Developer subscription on an Azure VM?
* Can I create an Azure VM with the RHEL subscription from the Marketplace, then remove that subscription and attach the Developer subscription? If so, how would I go about doing that?
* Are there any specific steps I should follow to ensure a smooth transition from the Azure RHEL subscription to the Developer subscription?

devops,Have you also observed a trend where DevOps Roles are now increasingly requiring a Bachelors Degree?,"Almost 50 percent or higher of the job postings on Linkedin for Devops/Platform Engineer/Software Engineering roles seem to be requiring a degree in Computer Science.

I attended school for Computer Science, but did not graduate because no one really cared about your degree back then for this field and am now re-thinking that decision.

Should we be worried?

**EDIT**: After reading some of the comments, I felt the need to update the original post and provide a clarification. I did not say I was unaware that Bachelors Degree was required by some companies, but MOST did not. You could go through job listing after job listing and hardly come to any job posting that specifically said ""Bachelors Degree or Higher is required"". At best you saw the following, such as Google's current job posting for a

# Staff Software Engineer, Machine Learning, Technology and Society

* ***Bachelor's degree or equivalent practical experience &lt;------------------***
* 8 years of experience in software development, and with data structures/algorithms
* 5 years of experience testing, and launching software products, and 3 years of experience with software design and architecture
* 2 more items(s)

Now go back to Linked in and type in ""Software Engineer"", or ""DevOps"", or ""Platform Engineer"", and you will realize most companies are excluding the ""OR EQUIVALENT PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE"" part.

I have around 200 Jenkins jobs running for a bunch of projects. Not all of them are deployment jobs only a very few &amp; this query is not regarding them. I have other 170+ jobs which are created to run certain functionalities within few applications. They're like cron jobs (or batch jobs) you can say.

So these batch jobs are like taking file input from various SFTP servers &amp; then executing them one by one.

Issue is that these jobs give success message even if one of the file from any SFTP server is not fetched. Let's say each job is fetching 10 files from different SFTP's and they miss out on 1 file but successfully execute 9 of those so it's still a success. Now it's not possible for me to go into console log of each job &amp; see which of these executed all 10 file; if I'd do that then it will be very time consuming.

Is there any solution for cases like this where I can have a dashboard or anything which collects the logs from all specified jobs &amp; I can check them all in as minimum time as possible? I was thinking something like ELK?

2. Second issue we faced was that sometimes when planning we see some drift on DB resources and for production it really scares us like why there is showing changes in DB resources even theo all i did is just changed the values for computer resources,

For first problem we moved to gitops and do all the deployment through our custom made aws CodePipeline only and we got features like Terraform Cloud or Atlantis, for second issue we decided to use terragrunt since it breaks the stacks and due to the structure, we can use singe repo to store multi region and multi environment deployment with less code and bette file structure, but in terragrunt we don't see change detection, for this we need to ise Terramate and tbh there's very less resources available for the same online, so I'm little worried if should we move out production IaaC to Terragrunt with Terramate and migrate from Terraform to OpenTofu?

Bosses who didn't get the strain of 24/7 operations, product owners who thought a pipeline redesign was ""just a quick tweak,"" and users who had no idea what really went into keeping things running. Eventually, the grind and demands took their toll.

So, I did something drastic. I started preparing civil service exams for a role as a forest guard. After relentless prep and a ton of doubt, I actually landed a permanent position in my region. Now, I make less than half of what I was in Devops, but I’m out there every day, surrounded by trees instead of dashboards. No customers, no endless Jira tickets, just fresh air and open trails.


I wanted to share this in case any of you are feeling trapped or on the brink of burning out. It is possible to get out and start fresh (even at the age of 35). I can only hope that if you're in a rough spot, you’ll eventually find your own way out.

devops,Exploring Serverless Solutions for Whisper V3 Turbo Integration,"Currently, the serverless solution from Runpod meets my needs in terms of cost and features: [https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-faster\_whisper](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-faster_whisper)



However, I'm interested in using [https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo) due to its reported speed.



I'm uncertain about how to set up and run Whisper V3 Turbo on Runpod’s serverless infrastructure. 



It seems we might need to wait until the upstream project https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/issues/1030 is updated with Turbo and published on https://pypi.org/project/faster-whisper/. 



Only then will this feature be available, and at that point, we could fork [https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-faster\_whisper](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-faster_whisper) to update it accordingly.



In the meantime, do you know of any cost-effective serverless solutions for using Whisper V3 Turbo?

devops,Vulnerability Management for DevSecOps using OpenSource with prioritization functions,"Hello folks!

Some time ago, I shared with you my project MixewayFlow where I gather free and open-source tools for cybersecurity in DevSecOps. These tools easily integrate into an ultimate solution that, given a Git repository, is able to detect threats using SAST, SCA, Secret Leakage, and IaC scans.

That worked out pretty well and efficiently.

In newly released version I have introduced functionality that I have never seen in opensource project related with vulnerability proritization:)

Have you ever had a problem with the number of detected threats or struggled to convince development teams to look at a report containing 300 findings? Have you focused on findings based solely on severity taken from the scanner? There is a better way:

✅ Take into consideration EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System), which is quite useful for calculating possible exposure to threats.

✅ Consider if there is already an available end-user exploit for the detected threat (e.g., using KEV).

✅ Assess if the application where the threat is detected is processing sensitive data.

Maybe Mixeway Flow is not yet the best vulnerability management system, but point me to an open-source project that does vulnerability management, performs predefined full scans in full scope, and does prioritization. 😉

Any feedback appreciated.

devops,GitOps Setup: Security Concerns with Automated Deployments,"**Current Setup**:I have a straightforward but powerful GitOps workflow that consists of these steps:

1. Developer pushes code to source repository (GitLab.com)
2. CI/CD pipeline builds Docker image
3. Automated pipeline updates image tag in application repository
4. ArgoCD detects change and deploys new version



**Problem**: While this setup works well, there are security concerns. External developers with access to one repository can theoretically manipulate image tags of other repositories by triggering the pipeline with different values. There's a lack of granular access control for the deployment process.



**Planned Solution**: I'm planning to develop a open-source service to address this security gap. Here's the current design:

API Endpoint for New Image Tags: Route: /api/v1/new-image-tag Parameters needed:

* image\_tag (e.g., 1234567890)
* branch (e.g., main, develop, or feature/my-cool-feature-1)
* secret\_key (from GitLab CI variables)
* repository (e.g., gitlab.com/my-application/frontend)

The service will:

1. Validate permissions using secret key and repository
2. Determine environment from branch name
3. Create feature-branch specific values files automatically
4. Update image tag in values-$STAGE.yaml

API Endpoint for Closed Merge Requests: Route: /api/v1/closed-mr Parameters needed:

* mr\_id (e.g., 45)
* secret\_key (from GitLab CI variables)
* repository (e.g., gitlab.com/my-application/frontend)

The service will:

1. Get branch name from merge request
2. Check for open merge requests in other repos with same branch name
3. Clean up feature branch configuration if no other MRs exist
4. Allow ArgoCD to remove obsolete deployments



**Questions for the community**:

1. Are there existing tools that solve this security issue?
2. What are the best practices for securely handling image tag updates in a GitOps setup?
3. Would developing a new open source solution for this be valuable?

I'm particularly interested in solutions that maintain the simplicity of GitOps while adding proper security controls. Before starting development on a new tool, I want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel.

devops,Serverless vs Serverful,"Hi all,

Novice full-stack dev here. I need your opinion regarding the tech stack + deployment of a greenfield, multi-tenant web app for which I have 2 interested customers (payment plan pending) whose pain points are resolved, with hope to have many in the future but not more than 10k users globally.

My initial impulse is to have zero deployment costs, with a dockerized monolith backend (hosted on an always-free Oracle cloud VM), an Angular frontend hosted per Netlight / Cloudflare, and database hosted on Supabase. The reasoning is that “if” I’ll have an increased demand, I’ll simply scale these services vertically, and maybe even go cloud-native in the future. 

Competing with this thought are my AWS cloud skills from work, which push me to going completely serverless and using managed services to speed up development and not think about infra scaling and security down the line. However, if I do it right, with API GW, WAF, etc. I’ll incur costs from the get go (even with free tier) without having seen a single payment from the customer(s).

In your experience, which option would you recommend in such scenarios? Would you recommend I disregard the minimal costs from AWS and go cloud-first to prevent future headaches when I’m focusing on delivering features / adapting business logic, or should I experiment with all-free services to wait until I have enough customers that support putting in effort/costs to go cloud-native (given that all code needs to be refactored / changed anyway)?

The application needs a REST API to perform CRUD operations on multiple related tables in a PostgreSQL DB, and start many task queue operations per user.

I'm an SRE with about 10 years of experience.

Our product has pretty clear value add for SREs, so I wanted to crowdsource a bit.

We're absolutely staying away from the outright obnoxious practices that would have had me never buying from a company (I'm thinking of a particular CI/CD company who called me daily, and y'all have probably had similar experiences).

We are growing, so some amount of prospecting is cold via email. We're trying to sell to people we think we can legitimately help, and we're regularly reaching out to people who have used our open source offerings to see if we can help further. Additionally, I'm trying to bring more of a consultative energy to this process rather than a sales energy. Additionally, I'm aware that even better solutions can not be the right work to pursue at any given moment as bureaucratic overhead can regularly be larger than technical cost of implementation.

devops,Advice on Integrating DevOps Practices in a Traditional Ops Environment?,"
Hey all,

I’m working at a large energy utility company. It’s a pretty traditional environment with no real DevOps culture yet, and most workflows are manual and siloed, with few automation practices in place. It’s a challenge, but I’m really interested in finding ways to improve the workflow and bring in some DevOps ideas where I can.

About Me:
I’m in IT operations and mostly focused on monitoring systems—specifically Splunk—and doing a fair bit of scripting in Python and shell to streamline tasks where possible. My day-to-day includes managing monitoring for incidents, pushing updates, and handling deployment and maintenance across a Linux environment. At the moment, a lot of what I do is still manual, like deploying scripts to multiple search heads, and I’ve just started exploring Ansible to speed that up.

Why I’m Here:
Since DevOps isn’t something widely practiced here, I’d love to learn what daily tasks and routines you all typically handle in more DevOps-oriented roles. Any insights on tools or frameworks you’ve found useful for automating repetitive tasks in similar setups would be great. And if you have any advice on introducing DevOps principles gradually into a traditional ops environment, I’m all ears.

I’m confident with automation and scripting tasks, and I’ve been pretty successful with interview processes overall. However, some companies have strict requirements for live problem-solving interviews, which I've consistently struggled with, making it incredibly frustrating. I recently made it to final interviews with three companies. Two of these require live whiteboarding sessions, and these are roles I’m truly excited about.

Even though I'm putting in the effort, I feel like I might not pass these interviews, which is really discouraging. I’m seriously considering tackling this head-on by dedicating myself to building up my coding and problem-solving skills. Creating logic and solving coding challenges has always been difficult for me, and I've avoided them for too long.

I could really use some advice on where to start—any YouTube videos or resources you recommend would be great. I want to at least reach a point where I can approach coding challenges with some understanding, rather than feeling completely lost. I have two final interviews coming up (they said they’re mostly formalities), one on Tuesday and the other on Thursday, both with live coding. If there’s anything I can do to prepare, even in this short time

I realize this might be considered unethical, but I know I won’t be fully prepared for these interviews in such a short amount of time.

devops,How to manage development between team members and deployment?,"I am working in a very small startup and our entire project is basically a huge web application (related to education). The project has only started right now but the way we have planned it, it will make use of a lot of databases and ML models (eg. to personalize the student's experience). The development team consists of 3 people. 2 of them work on frontend programming and I handle all the backend programming, all the cloud management and deployment. 

Our project runs on Django and uses things like Redis, MariaDB. The way it currently works is that the frontend guys write their code and put it on a git repo, I do the backend programming on it and integrate it with django. Then i push these changes to git and a bash script i wrote on our cloud server pulls it, performs some operations on the files, creates config for the web server and nginx reverse proxy and directly runs it on the server.

The problem we encounter here is, once I integrate the backend with the frontend, it becomes impossible for the frontend guys to make any changes to the frontend code because the project with the backend requires a bunch of dependencies and DB with some tables pre-written on it to fetch constant data. Setting this environment up on their systems will make it difficult to update it if the structure ever changes. This is also bad if the team expands (which it will soon). Another thing I'm concerned about is if its ideal to simply run everything directly on the single VM, if its secure enough or not. Also this bash script method is still very manual.

I thought of using Docker, then I found out that its not good with handling persistent data. Anything else that uses a concept similar to containers is too complex for the project in its current state. I'm not much of a DevOps guy and we're mostly just learning with this stuff. Since the project is only just starting, we can refactor the entire system in whatever way its ideal to handle an environment like this. I am in need of a direction on what is the correct way to handle the development and deployment of such a project. Maybe my tech stack could be insufficient. I would greatly appreciate any assistance!

I am a data engineer dealing with data pipelines running on k8s and would like to initiate a technical discussion about the topic mentioned in the title.

Among the coworkers an idea popped up: what if we had a multi-cluster architecture to reduce costs, i.e. we keep several clusters in more regions (Azure) and we schedule our jobs to the cheap ones.
We are uncertain about how we could meassure these benefits and side effects of such an architecture.

Our idea:
Set up two dummy jobs, one dealing with data (to see how the distance from the storage’s region affects latency, costs, etc.) and one without connection to data.

My questions:
- How would you meassure the benefits of a multi-cluster architecture? What would be the KPIs (like costs, latency)? How would you calculate those?

- What other, if any at all, benefits of such architecture can you imagine?

devops,Observability for a web extension,"Hey everyone. 

I'm currently analysing different vendors to use within my company, which owns a web extension. I've done POCs on Elastic, Datadog, New Relic, Grafana, Honeycomb,..., and I always struggle to make them work for the extension.

  
This extension has a pop-up and a background service, which communicate via browser messaging APIs, which is not covered by any of these vendor's auto-instrumentations tools.

  
**The problems of each of them**

* **Grafana**: Doesn't allow for tail-based sampling in the frontend services (we want the RUM features).
* **New Relic**: Without auto-instrumentation, we need to use manual instrumentation. Creating a transaction in the pop-up and continuing it in the background service doesn't work, because the SDK doesn't provide a way to get the trace ID of a current trace.
* **Datadog**: Out of budget.
* **Honeycomb**: Doesn't allow source maps. Our code is minified, so it's a deal-breaker.
* **Elastic**: The RUM SDK relies on the `window` object, available in a regular web app, but it's not the case for the background service.

  
**The outcome**

We may end up using OpenTelemetry SDKs in the extension, although we use a vendor's specific SDKs on the rest of the infrastructure. With this, we don't really take advantage of the RUM features of any vendor.

Got into a Junior position in DevOps, more like a platform engineer role, and learned a lot in the first couple of months. Later on I’ve noticed that my team is seriously lacking knowledge about anything that’s related to Kubernetes and/or networking, so I didn’t have anyone to ask about issues and problems, or just to learn from. Some basic stuff like what is kubelet, or how to debug the api/etcd failures. Our usage is pretty simple but we’re getting into a situation where it’ll be critical because our scale will be getting bigger in next few months. It’s been like this for over a year and during that time I’ve been self learning via the k8s documentation, creating problems and trying to solve them in my own sandbox cluster, etc, just to get the hang of it. But I still don’t feel like I’m getting the required experience as I should have in a more “serious and professional” place. Don’t get me wrong my team is strong in all other areas, but we’re now in a place that every question that’s related to networking, k8s and Linux is now being redirected to me, the junior.

devops,I have just been fired and wondering whether to continue in DevOps. ,"I came from a systems engineering background and spend the last two years in a DevOps role where I was promoted internally. 

It was predominantly supporting a legacy sitecore(.net) workload running on windows instance, we used teamcity for builds and octopus for deployments. The deployments were really long and clunky. 5 hours end to end including testing. 

We also did run some more typical DevOps stacks,  Jenkins pipelines, deploying .net core applications in to fargate. 

I am in a position where I am missing kubernetes and some other core DevOps skills, due to not using industry standard tools. I also found the work pretty overwhelming initially but that wasn't helped by what I considered a difficult co worker. I am not quite sure why I was fired, but probably had something to do with my relationship with my co worker who is best friends with our boss, I was assured it was not a performance issue.

These are some of behaviours that led to conflict, but it being my first DevOps job, I don't know how if this is just an expected standard behaviour, due to the fast nature of the work: 

Making changes at 2am to our integration layer and not telling anyone

Making breaking changes to a production pipelines, not telling anyone then going on holiday. I atart looking in to the issue then he pops up on slack telling me the solution is easy and what do. Which I had done 40 mins prior

Agreeing with me, then publicly disagreeing me with me in front of the Devs on slack or to our boss.

Generally just going off and doing his own thing and not documenting anything, leaving you to pick up integrations he was working on that have failed in his absence

Messaging you about work on teams at the weekend and when you reply saying it's the weekend, he replies saying you didn't have to reply.

It would be good to get some feedback on how people collaborate with their co workers and what they consider acceptable or not and if you think DevOps promotes alot more conflict than other roles?

At this point, because I am missing some core skills. I could invest time in to skilling up and trying to get another role, but it also does seem like the stress is not worth the money, in the country I live in.

devops,Looking for webapp hosting recommendations - details in post,"Hi /r/devops! Not sure if this sort of post belongs here, but figured I'd give it a shot :)

I often have personal programming projects, and sometimes they're webapps. I'm trying to figure out what's a good place to host them.

So far I've used Heroku. I know you can get cheaper (particularly with usage-based costs like AWS instead of flat costs like Heroku), but $12/mo ($7 for cheapest backend ""dyno"", $5 for cheapest DB) is reasonable for one project for me. Convenience is good.

However, it's nice to be able to have multiple projects going in parallel, and to try new projects out at will, without having to think too much about ""is this worth spending money on"" or worry about forgetting to spin down unused projects

I imagine I can do some multiplexing, so multiple projects don't cost more than one project. (It's ok if one of my projects causes all of them to crash. These are just toys.) But I don't think I can do this with Heroku. Specifically: I can probably run multiple projects' backends on one dyno, but for databases -- Heroku Postgres doesn't give you permissions to use CREATE DATABASE, alas

Any ideas?

Maybe DigitalOcean? AWS? Dokku + DigitalOcean or something? Something else?

A few more thoughts / requirements:

- Architecture is always simple, no weird needs there (a frontend, a backend, a database)
- Traffic for my projects is very low -- it's just me experimenting, usually I'm the only user, not projects I publish to the public or anything. If I ever have something that needs more traffic, I can figure out what platform to use then -- right now I just wanna figure out what platform I want to use for cheap &amp; easy experimentation
- I want to minimize the risk of me accidentally doing something dumb and then ending up with a bill for thousands of dollars
- I want to minimize or eliminate the risk of someone scraping or DOS-ing my site and then I end up with a big bill -- so cut off my bandwidth or crash my server rather than giving me overage charges or autoscaling, etc",prendradjaja,1gc42w1,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gc42w1/looking_for_webapp_hosting_recommendations/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gc42w1/looking_for_webapp_hosting_recommendations/,2024-10-25 20:35:24,2,1.0,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gc42w1

devops,Best practice for organizing test mocks/stubs in a monorepo?,"I have a Turborepo monorepo with two apps - a React + Vite frontend and a Fastify REST API. All shared packages are configured as native ES modules (\`""type"": ""module""\`) and have \`sideEffects: false\` since they only contain types, schemas, and constants.

I need to add test mocks/stubs for my types and schemas, and I'm trying to decide the best way to structure this. Should they live next to their types, or in a separate testing package?

Here's what I mean:

    Option 1: Co-located mocks
    import { ApiResponse, apiResponseStub } from '@acme/contract';
    import { User, userStub } from '@acme/database';
    import { Config, configStub } from '@acme/common';

    } from '@acme/testing';

While co-locating stubs next to their types/schemas feels a lot easier, I have some concerns:

1. Tree-shaking reliability: Even with \`sideEffects: false\`, can I trust that test code won't leak into production builds?
2. Package structure: If I go with a separate testing package, how should I organize it?

devops,PagerDuty not great for small teams?,"Not sure if I’m missing something here, but it seems like PagerDuty really isn’t built for smaller teams? I just recently broke up what was more or less a monolithic escalation policy where everyone on the schedule was more or less on call all the time and issues could be escalated to the same person if they didn’t ack, to smaller Escalation Policies and Schedules. Basically 3ish people per schedule. 

PagerDuty recommends creating a primary and secondary schedule but, how’s that supposed to work with three people? Ideally I’d define primary and then secondary would be defined as an offset of that. Page primary, escalate to whoever is on deck to be on call next. It could work with the existing guidance, but all the people would have to be in both and then the offset would have to be managed manually. And then, if someone overrides in primary and doesn’t also make a similar override in secondary, you could end up with primary and secondary being the same person.

What I really want is an escalation policy that alarms to a team schedule, escalates through everyone there first, and then hits my team as a backup. Right now if the on call for that team doesn’t ack it jumps straight to me and I have to manually kick it to the next person on the schedule.

devops,How do you guys track your deployments when doing configuration managment?,"We are currently discussing migrating  away from our current tool stack which consists of TFS. (For political and financial reasons).

We use it to host our code, build create and host our artifacts.

We can easily create a release with specific build artifacts and deploy it through agents using PowerShell.

We have around 100 different customer that we manage. Each customer, has between 2 and 4 'stages' (dev/int/prd  for example) and we have a total of 4000 tests that gets execute par deployment per customer.

In  the end, we have almost half a million of tests that run to ensure that our artifacts are correctly installed and configured.  
  
Since we need to migrate, we have been evaluating GitLab, but we realized that it is not 'as complete' as TFS.   
Especially the deployment part. It looks there that gitlab is only intended for smaller number of environments. 

In   addition to that, displaying the resulted tests, or just the pipeline run really doesn't scale and defeintly lacks some user friendlyness.

devops,Retrieving TenantID and ClientID from the Service Connection,"Hi there,

In short, I found some articles on the internet which claim it should be possible to retrieve things as the ClientId and TenantId from the Service Connection that you specify in your main.yaml  
This way I wouldn't have to put these into any variables file, or in the script themselves.

          addSpnToEnvironment: true
          

    $env:AZURE_TENANT_ID
    $env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID
    

However, having tried to put this into the main.yaml, I can't seem to be able to use these variables.  
When I use a Write-Host these variables come up empty.

Currently my main.yaml looks like this:

      - task: AzureCLI@2
        inputs:
          azureSubscription: 'Repo-EntraID'
          scriptType: 'ps'
          addSpnToEnvironment: true
          scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'

Does anyone know how exactly I can get these variables from the Service Connection into my Powershell script?  
Other then people (and Microsoft) mentioning that you can, I can't seem to find out how exactly.

devops,Using zstd compression with BuildKit - decompresses 60%* faster,"Last week I did a bit of a deep dive into BuildKit and Containerd to learn a little about the alternative compression methods for building images.

Each layer of an image pushed to a registry by Docker is compressed with `gzip` compression. This is also the default for `buildx build`, but we have a little more control with `buildx` and can select either `gzip`, `zstd`, or `estargz`.

I plan to do an additional deep dive into `estargz` specifically because it is a bit of a special use-case. Zstandard though, is another interesting option that I think more people need to be aware of and possibly start using.

&gt;What is wrong with Gzip?

Gzip is an old but gold standard. It's great but it suffers from legacy choices that we don't dare change now for reliability and compatibility. The biggest issue is `gzip` is a single-threaded application.

When *building* an image with gzip, your builds can be substantially slower due to the fact that `gzip` just wont be able to take advantage of multiple cores. This is likely not something you would have noticed without a comparison though.

When `pulling` an image, whether locally or as part of a deployment, the images layers need to be extracted, and this is the most critical point. Faster decompression means faster deployments.

`gzip` is single-threaded but there is a parallel implementation of `gzip` called `pigz`. Containerd will attempt to use `pigz` for *decompression* if it is available on the host system. Unlike `gzip` and `zstd` which both have native Go implementations built into Containerd, interestingly it will reach out for an external `pigz` binary.

For compatibility and legacy reasons, Docker/Containerd has not implemented `pigz` for compression. The compression of `pigz` is essentially the same as `gzip` but scales in speed with the number of cores.

There is however, another compression method `zstd` which is natively supported, multi-threaded by default, and most importantly, decompresses even faster than `pigz`.

&gt;How do I use `zstd`?

    docker buildx build . --output type=image,name=&lt;registry&gt;/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;,compression=&lt;compression method&gt;,oci-mediatypes=true,platform=linux/amd64

When using the `docker buildx build` (or `depot build` for depot users) you can specify the `--output` flag with a `compression` value of `zstd`.

&gt;How much better is zstd than gzip?

To really answer this question will require knowledge of your hardware, and depend on if we are talking about the builder or the host machine. In either case, the tldr is more cores == better.

I ran some synthetic benchmarks on a 16 core vm just to get an idea of the differences. You can see the fancy graphs and full writeup in the [blog post](https://depot.dev/blog/building-images-gzip-vs-zstd).

Skipping to just the [decompression comparison](https://depot.dev/blog/building-images-gzip-vs-zstd#comparison-of-decompression-times) portion, there is a roughly 50% difference in speed going from `gzip`, to `pigz`, to `zstd` at every step.

|Decompression Method|Time (ms)|
|:-|:-|
|gzip|25341|
|pigz|14259|
|zstd|6108|

Meaning, even if `pigz` is installed on your host machine now, which is not a given, you are still giving up a 50% speed increase if you haven't switched to `zstd` (on a 16 core machine, it may be more or less depending).

Are you wondering how long it took to compress these images? Let's leave out `pigz` since it can't actually be used by Docker.

|Compression Method|Time (ms)|
|:-|:-|
|gzip|163014|
|zstd|14455|
|That is 90% faster compression. 90%... Nine followed by a zero.||

But you are thinking. There must be a trade-off in compression ratio. Let's check. The image we are compressing is 5.18GB uncompressed.

|Compression Method|Compressed Size (GB)|
|:-|:-|
|gzip|1.5|
|zstd|1.32|

Nope. 90% faster than gzip, smaller file, 60% faster to decompress.

# Conclusion

Zstandard is nearly universally a better choice in today's world, but it's always worth running a benchmark of your own using your own data and your own hardware to ensure you are optimizing for your specific situation. In our tests, we saw a [60% decompression speed increase](https://depot.dev/blog/building-images-gzip-vs-zstd#conclusion) and that's ignoring that *massive* savings in the build stage where we are going from a single threaded application to a multi-threaded one.",CodesInAWarehouse,1gb4e98,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb4e98/using_zstd_compression_with_buildkit_decompresses/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb4e98/using_zstd_compression_with_buildkit_decompresses/,2024-10-24 14:48:03,45,0.98,45,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gb4e98

devops,Why should I use ArgoCD and not Terraform only?,"Hey everyone,

I'm digging into the Gitops topic at the moment, just to understand the use-cases where it's useful, when not ideal etc.

Currently, I have fully terraformed infrastructures. That includes multiple Kubernetes projects, each project multiple environments, each environment for each project on a dedicated AWS account.  
All of it is deployed through Github actions, using terraform. My build stage deploys docker images on github registry (or aws ecr). Then, Terraform applies modules one after the other (network config, then cluster config, then application config). The image id is passed from the build to the terraform and is input as a variable, so terraform detects the diff and apply it.  
Using HPA/PDB/Karpenter, we manager to have our environments running at all time, even when faulty image is deployed (pods are not all rolled out). Pipeline fails, so new image is not deployed.

This setup works fine, and we're happy about it. 

What would ArgoCD bring to the table that I'm missing?  
What are the scenarios, where our deployment wouldn't be as good as an ArgoCD one?

devops,Recruitment process &amp; technical challenge ,"Hi there,

Recently, I participated in a recruitment process for a DevOps role at a company that provides services to other businesses. The initial contact was a nearly one-hour interview. After that, the recruiter sent me an email with instructions to sign up on their platform to complete three additional steps.

The first step was a 30-minute test designed to measure IQ, logic, and other abilities to assess if my profile fits with the company.

The second step involved answering several questions while being recorded.

The final step was a technical challenge where I was supposed to build a pipeline for a Node.js application with multiple stages and then deploy everything to Azure using Terraform. Additionally, it required setting up three environments—dev, stage, and prod—along with several rules for merging branches, setting up the branch strategy, etc.

For this final step, the instructions specified that it should take no longer than one hour, and I had to record all steps and explain each part. I decided to decline the process because of these time-consuming requirements. I'm very busy and can't afford to spend a lot of time on these tasks. Since no sandbox environment was provided, I would need to set up everything on my own, which adds significant time to the process. Similarly, there isn't an automatic platform for recording the video, meaning I'd have to handle that setup as well.

devops,Cloud Exit Assessment: How to Evaluate the Risks of Leaving the Cloud,"Dear all,

**I intend this post more as a discussion starter, but I welcome any comments, criticisms, or opposing views.**

I would like to draw your attention for a moment to the topic of 'cloud exit.' While this may seem unusual in a DevOps community, I believe most organizations lack an understanding of the vendor lock-in they encounter with a cloud-first strategy, and there are limited tools available on the market to assess these risks.

Although there are limited articles and research on this topic, you might be familiar with it from the mini-series of articles by DHH about leaving the cloud:   
[https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0)   
[https://world.hey.com/dhh/x-celebrates-60-savings-from-cloud-exit-7cc26895](https://world.hey.com/dhh/x-celebrates-60-savings-from-cloud-exit-7cc26895)

(a little self-promotion, but (ISC)² also found my topic suggestion to be worthy: [https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2024/04/Cloud-Exit-Strategies-Avoiding-Vendor-Lock-in](https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2024/04/Cloud-Exit-Strategies-Avoiding-Vendor-Lock-in))

It's not widely known, but in the European Union, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is responsible for establishing a uniform set of rules to regulate and supervise banking across all member states. In 2019, the EBA published the ""Guidelines on Outsourcing Arrangements"" technical document, which sets the baseline for financial institutions wanting to move to the cloud. This baseline includes the requirement that organizations must be prepared for a cloud exit in case of specific incidents or triggers.

Due to unfavorable market conditions as a cloud security freelancer, I've had more time over the last couple of months, which is why I started building a unified cloud exit assessment solution that helps organizations understand the risks associated with their cloud landscape and supports them in better understanding the risks, challenges and constraints of a potential cloud exit. The solution is still in its early stages (I’ve built it without VC funding or other investors), but I would be happy to share it with you for your review and feedback.

The 'assessment engine' is based on the following building blocks:

1. **Define Scope &amp; Exit Strategy type:** For Microsoft Azure, the scope can be a resource group, while for AWS, it can be an AWS account and region.
2. **Build Resource Inventory:** List the used resources/services.
3. **Build Cost Inventory:** Identify the associated costs of the used resources/services.
4. **Perform Risk Assessment:** Apply a pre-defined rule set to examine the resources and complexity within the defined scope.
5. **Conduct Alternative Technology Analysis:** Evaluate the available alternative technologies on the market.
6. **Develop Report (Exit Strategy/Exit Plan):** Create a report based on regulatory requirements.

I've created a lighweight version of the assessment engine and you can try it on your own:   
[https://exitcloud.io/](https://exitcloud.io/)   
(No registration or credit card required)

Example report - EU:   
[https://report.eu.exitcloud.io/737d5f09-3e54-4777-bdc1-059f5f5b2e1c/index.html](https://report.eu.exitcloud.io/737d5f09-3e54-4777-bdc1-059f5f5b2e1c/index.html)  
(for users who do not want to test it on their own infrastructure, but are interested in the output report \*)

*\* the example report used the 'Migration to Alternate Cloud' exit strategy, which is why you can find only cloud-related alternative technologies.*

To avoid any misunderstandings, here are a few notes:

* The lightweight version was built on Microsoft Azure because it was the fastest and simplest way to set it up. (Yes, a bit ironic…)
* I have no preference for any particular cloud service provider; each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
* I am neither a frontend nor a hardcore backend developer, so please excuse me if the aforementioned lightweight version contains some 'hacks.'
* I’m not trying to convince anyone that the cloud is good or bad.
* Since a cloud exit depends on an enormous number of factors and there can be many dependencies for an application (especially in an enterprise environment), my goal is not to promise a solution that solves everything with just a Next/Next/Finish approach.

Many Thanks,

devops,GitOps for Postgresql - What features would you want to have?,"  
Hi all, I have about 10 years of software development and DevOps experience and I'm currently working on a personal project for managing Postgresql databases with GitOps.   
  
My project started as a declarative way to manage logical replication publications and subscriptions, but I'm thinking for the future road maps. (No link to the project yet as it's in too early development to be useful to anyone)

If you had an app that functioned like Terraform or ArgoCD for managing Postgresql, what features do you think are key? Schema migrations? Access controls? Settings management? 

The gist is it's written in rust and uses a reconciliation loop that reads a yaml file that declares the desired state, connects as a pg user to each database to inspect and update the state to match.  
  
Once I have a decent road map and the foundations in place, I'll definitely share a link to the github and invite contributors/feedback. So, what's your thoughts on must-have features here?  
  
Thanks all!

devops,GitOps Channels/Canary-like Rollouts,"Dear DevOps Community,
We recently adopted Flux to manage our K8s infrastructure components on more than 200 clusters across different cloud vendors in a „GitOps“ pull fashion.

TL/DR:

- How do you manage GitOps on your clusters? Are you using the Multi-Branch „Channel“ approach or another strategy?

- Is there may even a smart way to archive something like controlled „canary-like“ rollouts (10%…30% …60% clusters…)?

So far so good and Flux does it‘s job:
When there’s an update or a new feature to be rolled out, we branch of the main branch, prepare the changes and change the „flux source“ on a few testcluster for testing, before we merge back to main, so it will be rolled out on all clusters. 
When this is done, we change the „source“ on our testclusters back to „main“.

This works well for us, but the continuous change/ cleanup of testcluster (especially when multiple features being developed at the same time)  and having basically all clusters subscribing to the „main“ branch only, always comes with a slight doubt if it could be done better.
Especially when we want to follow a pattern of small, but frequent updates via GitOps.

Of course we could maintain next to „main“ some „branch channels“ (ie. „stable“, „beta“, „dev“,“test/upgradeX“,…), but I’m afraid that this will cause a mess by keeping all the branches up 2 date.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts :) ",w4rth0gdr1ver,1gbddtk,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gbddtk/gitops_channelscanarylike_rollouts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gbddtk/gitops_channelscanarylike_rollouts/,2024-10-24 21:05:19,2,0.67,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gbddtk
devops,AWS vs Azure: Which Platform is Better for Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing is a very vast field. Largely two names dominate this industry: Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

devops,"What's your strategy to provision multi cloud, multi region, managed k8s clusters using IAC, hub and spoke ArgoCD approach?","There are plenty of opinionated ways to provision k8s clusters in a multi cloud, multi region world. Together with that, it's very common today to use a GitOps approach to provision the clusters themselves using ArgoCD in a hub and spoke model or FluxCD on each one. 

While this questions contain quite a bit of information, I'd like to set the focus on AKS+EKS+GKE with a hub and spoke ArgoCD setup. 

For the hub you might end up running Terraform in order to create the k8s cluster, create IAM role or the equivalent, apply multiple k8s \`kind: ServiceAccount\` for things like \`external-secrets\`, \`external-dns\`, \`aws-load-balancer-controller\` etc, then install ArgoCD through Terraform, let it ""takeover"" its installation and provision the rest automatically, expecting the SAs to be ready in advanced.

For the spokes you would probably do something similar without installing ArgoCD, but instead you would somehow make sure ArgoCD learns about this cluster via a k8s \`kind: Secret\` (how did you choose to do that?). 

Long story short, I'd like to hear how you have approached it, ideally asking for more real life scenarios and less theory. These are some of the questions that came in mind: 

* Networking &amp; Security
   * Are you clusters set to be private? 
   * How do you expose your clusters so that ArgoCD will be able to communicate with them? 
   * How do you protected them?
   * Are you using VPN/TGW across all cloud provider or have you preferred solutions such as Teleport or Tailscale? 
* Tools: 
   * Which tools do you use? ""Classic"" like Terraform, Terragrunt?
   * Code based? CDKTF, Pulumi?
   * Native Kubernetes? Crossplane/Cloud specific operators 
* IaC directory structure: 
   * Where is your state? 
   * Where are you variables? 
   * Where are your main file(s)? 
   * Where are your modules?
   * How do you version everything?
* Pipelines: 
   * Do you run it all at once? 
   * Is there a flow? 
   * If you are using PRs for that, what do you do when they are merged but the approval had failed?

devops,"New to devops, please help me plan the backend infra for the startup I work at","Hi!

I'm 18, and would describe myself as a polyglot dev, mainly coming from a c++/rust backend. I've been very lucky to get hired as a backend developer at my friend's company,
and as part of that I've been working on improving our development process and infrastructure. I'm very comfortable with running linux (arch btw) on my desktop/raspi/etc, and I know some docker, but I'm not experienced with putting stuff into production.

We have a Node.js backend and a Next.js frontend. The frontend is hosted on vercel right now (planning a move to self hosted soon), and the backend is self hosted. Additionally, the backend uses postgres, redis &amp; some limited AWS stuff (S3/SNS etc.). 

Our current setup is mainly a beefy bare metal server managed by OVH cloud, that runs postgres and redis as systemd services, and the node server using docker, all of them are exposed through nginx publicly. I'm already working on improving &amp; using docker more throughout our monorepo. My first priority is moving the backend into a single docker-compose (db &amp; pg &amp; node), and adding SigNoz for observability (as another docker-compose -p on the same instance under a different user).

My question is, what is the best way to manage/administer/run/whatever docker/docker-compose on a single server in production? Specifically Kubernetes is not a good fit for us for various reasons, but mainly complexity. Is something like proxmox worth checking out? I'd be grateful for some pointers/suggestions here. I'd also be grateful for any other general advice regarding deployment, and specifically availability/backups (we automatically back up postgres every day to S3)",xxmikdorexx,1gb00x7,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb00x7/new_to_devops_please_help_me_plan_the_backend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb00x7/new_to_devops_please_help_me_plan_the_backend/,2024-10-24 11:09:50,0,0.25,0,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gb00x7
devops,DevOps panic,"Update: Just had the third interview and i got the job!!



I'm in my mid-twenties and work as a Junior SysAdmin/Technical Lead for a support team that specializes in niche Microsoft technologies. I started in the IT world less than three years ago and have been job-hopping every year for new challenges. I've taken a couple of courses, but that's it—no bachelor's degree or anything. I haven't even created a Kubernetes lab or opened up the interface.

Recently, I entered the interview process for a DevOps position at my company (a large firm that works with different clients around the world). At first, I didn't think my application would even be considered, but then, on Monday, out of the blue, I had a phone screening. The interviewer liked me, and that same night, he told me I’d have a more technical interview the next day.

I studied that night and the morning before the interview, but it was a lot to process in such a short time: Kubernetes, Git, methodologies, Docker, etc. Honestly, I thought I was going to show up and get humbled by my lack of experience (If any) in DevOps.

When Tuesday arrived, I was a bundle of nerves, not wanting to make a fool of myself. Somehow, I passed the interview, and they want another technical interview on Wednesday or Friday at most. They provided me with some topics to study for the client screening, and that's it.

Now, fear sets in as they told me there would be no peers to ask for help, no documentation, and no training or ramp-up. I would be on my own, and I need to create SOPs, manuals, guides, processes, and document everything to ""pave the way for future peers.""

One friend who works at a DevSecOps team told me that this is a really great opportunity, and he thinks i'll make it (Though he warned me that it will be a really difficult, soul crushing and just plain hard process until i get a grip on everything)

I'm really scared. What if I mess up and can't make the cut on my own? At the same time, I think this situation could force me to learn and move forward, but I'm just really fucking scared. But, who the fuck with no bachelors, less than three years of experience, and some cookie cutter certs would get a chance like this?

I want this, its a great chance to get a better life and a job I think i'll love, but im just scared of failure.

devops,How do you guys use PowerShell remoting ?,"I have been working with PowerShell for more than 10 years. When it became open sourced and cross platform, I started to manage linux (and at home my macOs ) with PowerShell.

I was wondering how the devops community is using PowerShell remoting for remote management of machines.

If so, I think it can be interesting to discuss how and for what type of machines (and how many?) this is done. To keep things clear and short, maybe each can include the following data:

\- How many servers  
\- Which type of machine (Windows / Linux / MacOs?)  
\- Which protocol is used (OpenSSH / WinRM over HTTPS etc..)

  
\-----------

I'll go first:

\- Servers: 3000  
\- Mostly Windows  
\- WinRM over HTTP at first, then over HTTPS.

Details:

I have been managing mostly Windows machines (around 3000) with raw Powershell remoting. We went and got a licence of Ansible Tower, and this migrated on that platform for our configuration management system.

We use WinRM over HTTPS, as our machines are not always in our main active directory. Ansible is quite cool, but for Windows Management it still uses classical WinRM, and actually works great.

Since I was evaluating OpenSSH as an alternative (since Powershell supports that now) I actually took A LOT of notes. regarding POwerShell in general. I kept having the quesiton: Is PowerShell remoting actually secure ? (And a LOT of people would say it is not - for some obscure reason...)

I have summarized my notes and answer most of the general questions (how to configure, how does it work, is it secure etc....) in the following video -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg\_9r0PHnnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg_9r0PHnnM)

2. Should I even try to ""catch"" or ""debug"" failed requests? I feel I am approaching load-testing from a bias of project development (i.e. print statements or unit tests) and maybe need some tweak in how I think about debugging when doing load testing and telemetry.
3. Should I persist in any shape or form the result of locust runs, or is it better delegated to a prometheus exporter which scrapes locust?

I’ve tried searching this subreddit but haven’t found much relevant information.

Can anyone guide me on what I’m missing or what I need to do to stay updated and bring new ideas to the table?

devops,Need Schema Help: Fun with The Bitcoin Chain,"I'm diving into a personal project as a learning experience and could really use some guidance from more experienced minds. I’m a full-stack developer, but my experience leans heavily toward middle/front-end development. Now I’m dealing with a massive dataset that’s forcing me to rethink some of my usual ""brute force"" methods, which just aren't cutting it here.

**The Situation:** I have \~800GB of raw Bitcoin blockchain data that I need to ingest into a PostgreSQL database in a way that’s usable for analytics (locally).

**Hardware Setup:**

* CPU: Ryzen 7700x (AIO cooled)
* Storage: 2TB SSD
* RAM: 32GB (might be a limitation)
* No GPU (yet)
* OS: Ubuntu Server

I know this setup is a bit overkill for just running a full Bitcoin node, but I'm concerned it might be underpowered for the larger-scale analytics and ingestion tasks I’m tackling.

**What I've Done So Far:**

* I’ve stood up a Bitcoin full node and fully synced the blockchain.
* Built a basic local PostgreSQL structure with tables for `blocks`, `transactions`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `UTXO`, and `addresses`.
* Created a Python ingest script using `bitcoinrpc` to process the blockchain data into these tables.

**The Challenge:** Initially, the script processed the first \~300k blocks (pre-2015) pretty quickly, but now it’s crawling, taking about 5-10 seconds to process each block, whereas before, it was handling hundreds per second.

I still have \~1.2TB of space left after the sync, so storage shouldn’t be the issue. I suspect that as my tables grow (especially `transactions`), PostgreSQL is becoming a bottleneck. My theory is that every insert operation is checking the entire table structure to prevent conflicts, and the `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` clause I’m using is severely slowing things down.

At this rate, processing the full dataset could take months, which is clearly not sustainable.

**Questions:**

* Is there a better approach to handling large datasets like this in PostgreSQL, or should I consider another database solution?
* Are there strategies I can use to speed up the ingestion process without risking data integrity?
* Is there a more efficient way to handle conflict resolution for such large tables, or is my approach inherently flawed?

Ultimately, I want to use this data for visualizing blockchain trends, changes over time, and price/scarcity models.

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

devops,"I'm tired of manually executing commands on VMs, is there a declarative alternative to something like Dokku?","I think I've reached a point where I'm just fed up with going through VMs and manually running commands to deploy/configure/manage multiple apps.

I'm a developer, not a devops, and I have several large VMs with a dozen apps - 20+ SaaS tools, services, each with at least an ""app"" container and sqlite/postgres/clickhouse/redis with backup services near them.

So far I've gone through bare systemd, docker-compose, dokku, caprover, [fly.io](http://fly.io) and frankly I hate most of them. Fly is a good service, but it still requires me to manually manage my services, link them from my terminal, etc.

I need something like Terraform - setup once, write configs, push to git, plan, deploy. E.g.,

- one ""control service"" config in a git repository that configures a system of 1, 2 or more VMs.

- per-app config that defines the services it needs, backups, etc.

git checkout, get secrets into env, run plan, run deploy, start working on the next feature. I want to forget about ssh into VMs, manually binding my database like with Fly, restarting traefik or binding a domain for a specific app from the CLI. I don't want to run commands or click through UIs anymore, all this information should be stored in config files, not in my head, I'm sure it can be picked up after a developer runs a simple ""plan&amp;deploy"" command on config files.

devops,DevOps Engineers - Are These Really Your Biggest Pain Points?,"I’m doing some research to better understand the **real-world pain points** DevOps Engineers face. I've gathered some high-level information on what I believe are common challenges in the DevOps space, and I’d love to get your feedback. Are these legit from a high-level? 

# Here are a few key pain points I’ve identified:

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Ensuring consistent high IOPS and ultra-low latency, especially when dealing with data-intensive workloads in cloud environments.
2. **Infrastructure Complexity**: Managing multi-cloud or hybrid environments without creating operational silos or increasing system complexity.
3. **Scaling Automation**: Automating infrastructure provisioning and scaling, while ensuring the performance keeps up with growing workloads.
4. **Incident Management**: Dealing with unexpected downtime and the need for systems that self-heal quickly to prevent major outages.
5. **Cost Optimization**: Balancing performance and cloud infrastructure costs to ensure you’re not overspending while keeping everything running smoothly.

# Does this align with your experience? How would you validate these pain points in your day-to-day operations?

Additionally, I’m curious to hear more about your personal pain points! **What’s one or two real-life pain points that inhibit you from doing your job well?** It could be related to infrastructure, tooling, processes, or even communication issues within your team.

devops,Can I survive in devops without python?,"Hey Guys,

Ive been in cloud engineering for 6+ years now. (2018). Ive had various jobs, cloud engineer, aws architect, senior devops engineer. Tried to learn python in grad school and some on the job but haven't really become proficient at it.   
  
Got laid off from AWS earlier this year and the current job I'm at is asking me to write/ enhance a python app for data engineering.  

Is automation with python THE thing in this field now or can I survive by writing config files in JSON/YAML and some powershell/bash. Any sub-field to pivot to that is not so programming heavy?

devops,Torn between CKA &amp; CKAD,"Hi everyone,

I’m a computer science student aiming for DevOps/Cloud roles. I’ve recently completed my AWS SAA and a few other things.

I want to add NGINX, Kubernetes, and Docker to my cloud resume project. 

Since the certifications are quite expensive, I want to make sure I choose the one that offers the most valuable and practical skills to get started. 

I’ve heard a lot of people recommend CKAD because it’s more practical to the cloud, but I also see many people going for CKA.

I’m concerned that CKAD might not carry as much weight as CKA in my resume and for the long run. What do you all think?

devops,Seeking Advice and Help: Building a Flexible DevOps Monitoring Report Automation System,"Hi everyone! I work at a DevOps-as-a-Service company, and I'm looking to automate our daily monitoring workflow (mainly the report writing and generation part). I'd love to get your thoughts on the best approach and potentially collaborate on making this an open-source tool.

## Current Situation

Every morning, we check multiple monitoring systems for several clients and generate two types of reports (internal and client-facing, we have alerting but this is some kind of nice thing that we do for customers, it is a bit of formality but at the same time craetes a nice routine to check up on everything and have an idea of what is going on). We start by looking at Grafana dashboards, checking different panels and then we go on and check other services like Gitlab, sentry, etc. Here's what we currently monitor (though this varies by client and project, and the list keeps growing):

### Common Monitoring Sources
These are some of our typical monitoring points, but they can vary significantly based on client infrastructure and requirements:

- **Infrastructure Metrics** (Grafana/Prometheus)
  - RAM usage
  - CPU utilization
  - Load averages
  - Disk usage
  - Usage trends
  - PVC status (for Kubernetes clusters)
  - *And other metrics specific to client infrastructure*

- **Application Health**
  - ArgoCD status
  - Pod health
  - Uptime metrics (via Uptime Kuma)
  - CI/CD pipeline status (GitLab)
  - Error tracking (Sentry)
  - Alert Manager status
  - *Additional services based on client stack*

This is just what we're currently monitoring - different clients have different needs, and new monitoring requirements emerge as technologies and infrastructures evolve.

### Current Report Structure (It can be a message, or maybe something fancy like a PDF in a daily, weekly or monthly manner)

We generate two daily reports:

**Internal Report:**
```
Date: YYYY.MM.DD
Customer: EXAMPLE_COMPANY
- Service Status: ✅
- ArgoCD Health: ✅
- CI/CD Status: Last pipeline successful
- PVC Usage: data-sentry-zookeeper-0 (87% ⚠️)
- Alert Manager: Operational
[Technical details and action items]
```

**Client Report:**
```
Hello team,

Here's your daily infrastructure report for YYYY.MM.DD:
- All core services: Operational ✅
- Deployments: Healthy
- CI/CD: Running smoothly
- Storage: We're monitoring elevated usage on some volumes
[Professional explanations of any issues]
```

## Project Vision

I want to build a modular, extensible system that:

1. **Automates Data Collection**
   - Fetches metrics from various sources (takes screenshots too)
   - Supports running ad-hoc commands on servers
   - Handles authentication securely

2. **Generates Reports**
   - Uses customizable templates
   - Supports different formats per client
   - Enables weekly/monthly report generation

3. **Delivers Reports**
   - Sends to Telegram/Slack/Whatever
   - Emails stakeholders
   - Maintains separate internal/external communication (Two reports, configurable)

4. **Future Features**
   - AI-powered report generation (exploring LLMs integration, although not much sure about the privacy challenges)
   - Trend analysis
   - Custom scheduling
   - Report history in db and maybe a nice frontend to explore them
   - Connection to task management apps or notes apps to make an issue a task or add it to a documentation or something.

## Technical Questions

1. **Architecture:**
   - What language would be best? (Considering Go or Python)
   - Should we use existing monitoring tools' APIs or build collectors?
   - How to handle secrets management securely?

2. **Design:**
   - What's the best way to make it modular/pluggable?
   - How to structure the config for different clients?
   - Should we use a template engine? Which one?

3. **Integration:**
   - Best practices for integrating with various monitoring tools?
   - How to handle rate limits and API quotas?
   - Recommended approaches for secure credential storage?

## Would Love Your Input On

- Similar tools you might have used or built
- Architecture recommendations
- Security best practices
- Potential pitfalls to avoid
- Interest in collaboration if this becomes open-source

## Open Source Collaboration

I believe this could be a valuable tool for the DevOps community, as many of us may are facing similar challenges. I'm considering making this an open-source project and would love to collaborate with others who are interested in DevOps automation and reporting and are much more experienced than me. If you've faced similar challenges or would like to contribute your expertise, let's discuss how we could work together to create something useful for the broader community!

I want to avoid reinventing the wheel, so if there are existing tools that could help, I'm all ears! The goal is to create something flexible and maintainable that others might find useful too or maybe start something cool together and work on it!

Looking forward to your thoughts and suggestions, thank you everyone.

* Learning more about containerization. Again, recommendations for materials are greatly appreciated.

devops,"Proper Secrets Manager vs Cloud Storage Bucket with fine-grained access control, what am I missing?","Working on updating some existing Ansible automation during a slow period at work. Our team recently got access to our Org's HashiVault instance(s) and we've started populating some static secrets there. Our automation can now retrieve those secrets at runtime, and it makes things easier to manage over having ansible-vaulted values in our code. 

One of the steps in our code needs to access an SSH key for connecting to a specific machine. We currently keep the SSH key in a GCP Storage bucket. The bucket has fine-grained access control enabled on it, basically needing to be a member of an AD Group to get access to it, (or have a GCP SA with the same permissions).

I started to move the contents of those SSH keys into HashiVault, but it got me wondering, what am I gaining by doing so? 

If i'm not wrong, Google encrypts all storage bucket data at rest, access to that data is controlled by group membership ACL. Storage buckets contents are versioned.

All those above things are the same thing HashiVault offers.
