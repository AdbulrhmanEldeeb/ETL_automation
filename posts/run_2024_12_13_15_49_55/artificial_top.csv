artificial,A website that uses AI to generate appeals to insurance coverage denial,"Fighthealthinsurance.com

I'm trying to spread this site around as much as possible. It's a free website where if your insurance company denies your claim, you can upload the denial letter and it will use AI to automatically generate an appeal letter. Most claims that are appealed get approved, so making the process as simple as possible is a good way to force insurance companies to approve more claims. Please share the link to let more people know about this promising service. They are trying to scale up so that physicians can use their site to appeal in bulk. 

Just to be clear, I am not affiliated with this site in any way. I am a random guy on the internet that discovered it when searching for a productive way to channel the rage everyone is feeling towards insurance companies right now into positive change.",CiconiaBorn,1hcxvqr,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hcxvqr/a_website_that_uses_ai_to_generate_appeals_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hcxvqr/a_website_that_uses_ai_to_generate_appeals_to/,2024-12-12 22:57:01,24,0.95,24,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Project,self,t3_1hcxvqr

artificial,Think of AI as a child,"I’m not a programmer but I am just thinking we should reframe how we look at AI.

It is a new type of intelligence, it’s like a tool.

But it’s to a tool to emulate us.

That is how a child functions, through imitation.

Right now AI is in its infancy so of course many are going to be like “It’s not that smart, it can’t do my job yet”….yet. 

Literally everything we can do on computers can be imitated. Even our voices. 

Humanity has created its own unified child. And we are teaching…rapidly. Before we know it it’ll be an adult. 

I think many people still are not even aware of the potential AI will be able to do. 

The film industry is going to be hit the hardest first because of the ease of generation. 

Now a lot of these changes will probably be really good. Just as with every new generation there are discoveries and fresh perspectives…it changes the current lifestyle and status quo.

AI is our generation, it will be a disruptor and change things rapidly, perhaps even more than the advent of the Internet. Be flexible in the next decade because things are about to get weird.
