books,An observation after a year only reading books written by women.,"I thought I‚Äôd share a little unscientific observation I made after a year spent only reading books written by women (across all genres) in order to correct for the preponderance of male authors on my bookshelf. On the whole, I found very little difference between male and female authors except for one thing:

Male authors tend to have their protagonists explicitly written as taking action, for good or ill. This applies to male and female protagonists.
Female authors have their protagonists watch as actions happen around them, *even in cases where the protagonist is driving the plot*. The protagonists‚Äô key actions are done ""off the page"".
 
I‚Äôm sure I am over-generalising and I am fully expecting my case to fall apart under scrutiny, but I thought it would warrant some discussion !


Some examples: 
In Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall, Thomas Cromwell - the ultimate arch-manipulator and man of destiny - is never shown actually making a decision. It is implied he is, because others react to him, and he is always in the room when things are being decided, but he is never actually shown ordering someone to be executed. In contrast, authors like CJ Samson and Patrick O‚ÄôBrien have their characters perform their actions on the page.

Likewise, if we compare books in another genre: Agatha Christie's protagonists don't actually physically investigate. They mostly seem to appear in the right place to listen and watch. Lee Child's characters on the other hand will be shown to explore, interrogate and take proactive acyion.

In YA literature, Harry Potter is famously passive, despite being the chosen one, etc, etc. Anthony Horowitz's leads on the other hand are always explicitly doing things off their own decision-making. I'd be interested to know if Katniss Everdeen is actually shown taking action explicitly off her own back.

In fantasy, I can't think of an instance in Ursula K LeGuin's Earthsea series where the protagonist isn't acted upon and therefore has to react, rather than decide for themselves. E.g. Ged is the protagonist of the first book. He is reactive to the chase by the shadow and in the end chooses to accept what is happening to him. However, when he appears in the Tombs of Atuan, he is no longer the protagonist, so he is now shown to take active decisions which the protagonist Tenar has to live with. Same goes for his role in the Farthest Shore. 
Terry Pratchett's female protagonists (e.g. Susan, Tiffany) are *very* proactive, to the point that some have felt they are too ""male"".

In sci fi, Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake has the main character as an observer to Crake's actions, rather than having Crake as the main character. Mary Shelley never actually shows Frankenstein giving life to the Creature, but rather sort of brushes over it. Then he's reacting to the Creature who is the character driving the plot with his actions until the pov switches to the Creature who never describes himself doing anything. His actions happen ""off-screen"".  On the flip side: Iain M Banks' The Player of Games has a very proactive protagonist, despite the character being manipulated the whole way through. George Orwell's Winston takes subversive actions explicitly on the page, even though he is shown to be ultimately powerless.",forestvibe,1hdeymc,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdeymc/an_observation_after_a_year_only_reading_books/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdeymc/an_observation_after_a_year_only_reading_books/,2024-12-13 15:41:52,32,0.77,32,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdeymc

I went online and got a sense of all the controversies around the difference in what happened. But to me they are irrelevant. 

What wrenched my heart is the way the author has captured the struggle of mankind braving the harshest elements in nature. Maybe in 1997 there was a different motive for the book but now in 2024, when people everywhere are trying to solve complex social problems in a tweet or two, it is proof that human psyche and our interactions with this world are both extremely complex.

books,‚ÄúTom Sawyer‚Äù is making me realize that writing can be beautiful outside of Speculative Fiction.,"Hello all. 

I‚Äôm about halfway through ‚ÄúThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer‚Äù and I‚Äôm absolutely adoring it. I just recently finished The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb and it left me with a severe case of post-book depression; online it said that in order to alleviate this feeling I should read something completely different. 

Enter Mark Twain.

I thought it was witty and charming throughout the first few chapters but what really started to grow on me was the atmosphere of the book. Twain has a way of putting you right in Missouri to the point where I feel as if I‚Äôve been there before. I‚Äôve met Tom and Huck; Aunt Polly and Sid. I‚Äôve been to that church or schoolhouse. I can practically smell the air wafting off the Mississippi.

The characters are simple and charming. Tom is a dramatic and mischievous kid, prone to curiosity and trouble. Sid is exactly like my own little brother ‚Äî a little tattle-telling goody-two-shoes. Becky Thatcher is the girl that we all had a crush on simply cause she was pretty. It‚Äôs a very nostalgic book.

I was under the impression that only speculative fiction ‚Äî specifically fantasy ‚Äî could leave this much of an impression on me. I‚Äôve only read speculative fiction‚Ä¶for years now. I feel like my eyes are being opened to whole new walks of reading

books,"My review of ""The Road to Wisdom"" by Dr. Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institute of Health for the last three presidents, and the director of the Human Genome Project before that. He's also a Christian. The book discusses truth, science, faith, and trust.","I've been following [Dr. Francis Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins) for quite a while since he's the founder of [BioLogos](https://biologos.org/), a foundation dedicated to helping Christians understand faith and science.  He was also the director of the National Institute of Health under Presidents Biden, Trump, and Obama, and prior to that he was the director of the Human Genome Project, discovering what each one of the genes in our bodies does. He's also the author of *The Language of God*, a memoir about how he went from atheism to faith in medical school, and why he believes there is reasonable evidence to have faith in a Creator.


*The Road to Wisdom* is a different kind of book.  It's more his reflection on truth, science, faith, and trust, different kinds of truth, where we find truth, how we determine what is true, and most importantly - how we have difficult conversations about what is true and what isn't.  As part of that, he discusses his experiences with [Braver Angels](https://braverangels.org/), an organization dedicated to helping depolarize America by bringing people of opposing viewpoints together for dialogue.  As one of the major figures who devised America's response to the Covid pandemic (he was Dr. Fauci's boss), he also discusses what he got right, what he got wrong, and what he wished he'd done better.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I've always been interested in things like metacognition - thinking about how we think - and he spends a fair chunk of the book breaking that down in a very accessible way, although he doesn't use that term.  He writes,

&gt;The premise of this book is that by reclaiming the solid ground of truth, science, faith, and trust, we can find ourselves back on the road to wisdom - that ability to bring together experience, knowledge, and good judgment to allow wise personal and professional decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society.  

He discusses some of the philosophical underpinnings of truth, as well as different areas of knowledge, arranged in concentric circles outward:


* **Necessary truth** - 2+2=4, the value of pi, etc.

* **Firmly established facts** -  (DNA is the hereditary material of humans, HIV causes AIDS, the earth is a slightly elliptical spheroid, gravity is related to mass, the accelerating rate of warming on the Earth, Germany and France share a border, and so on.)  He differentiates these two categories by saying, ""These statements are all essentially settled scientific facts.  Unlike 2+2=4, these firmly established truths might have turned out otherwise in a different universe (hence, philosophers call these contingent truths) but in this one we have compelling evidence they are correct.""

* **Uncertainty** - claims that are potentially true but there is insufficient evidence to move them towards firmly established facts.  For instance, cosmologists believe that there is something missing in the composition of the universe, but we don't have enough evidence yet to identify what they are.  Currently we call them things like ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"".  Another uncertain claim would be life on other planets.  Maybe there is, maybe there isn't, but we don't have enough data to say yet.

* **Opinion** - areas where facts and evidence are scanty, or irrelevant.  Dogs are better than cats, tattoos are cool or not cool,  the Red Sox are the best baseball team, Taylor Swift is the best artist, etc. 

He spends a little bit of time decrying postmodernism and its claims of nothing being really true, but I had to quibble with that, since I've not really (personally, at least) seen that postmodernism is interested in tearing down scientific claims - it's much more about deconstructing social, cultural, and personal ideas, and examining them individually. 

He also discusses six categories of untruth:

* **Ignorance** - not having relevant information about a particular topic.  This is not the same as stupidity - very smart people are also usually ignorant about areas of knowledge outside their fields of expertise.

* **Falsehood** - a statement that can be convincingly be shown to be untrue, like a Facebook post saying that drinking seventeen glasses of wine a day keeps cancer away.

* **Lies** - an intentional distortion of truth, intended to deceive.

* **Delusion** - Common forms of delusion (not rising to the level of mental illness) are widespread.  He specifically cites the study that gave rise to the Dunning-Kruger effect, wherein people who are untrained or inexperienced in an area overestimate their competence or knowledge in that area.

* **Bullshit** - Information that has no interest in whether or not it's actually true.  [Scientific American called ChatGPT a bullshitter](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chatgpt-isnt-hallucinating-its-bullshitting/) - it's not trying to be truthful, it's trying to sound human.

* **Propaganda** - A massive scaleup of lies and distortion with political intent (i.e. Putin's justifications for invading Ukraine). 

Collins goes on to talk about biases and cognitive fallacies, which I greatly enjoyed, but won't list out here.  However, he brings up a model of cognitive thought that I found to be very helpful, similar to the concentric circles of truth above.   Citing the work of philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine, he talks about our cognitive thought as a web of belief, like a spiderweb.  Near the center of the web are nodes of fundamental beliefs - my spouse loves me, the scientific method is effective, Jesus died and rose again, etc. As the web goes outward, the nodes are rather less critical or important - GMOs are safe, I'm a good driver, my cat loves me. 

He goes on to share [his own personal web](https://imgur.com/tWD5sUN), as well as [the web of Wilk Wilkinson](https://imgur.com/XNHvUTn), a conservative he had long discussions with through his partnership with Braver Angels.   He also discusses how while these webs are not set in stone, they are resistant to change, especially the closer to the center they are.  [I would add to this the idea that when someone changes their mind about something important, it can also risk their relationships, connections, and social standing.  If you ask a Christian to change their mind on something like LGBTQ rights or evolution, you are asking them to possibly risk their place in their church, in their family and friends, and other important relationships.  It doesn't matter how strong or Biblical or factual your arguments are, if you are asking them to give up the most important relationships they have in their life.]

He goes on to discuss additional factors like news media and social media that make our ability to distinguish what is true very difficult.  He recommends three strategies that the individual can do:

1) Try constructing your own web of belief

2) Consider the general question of how to decide whether to accept the truth of a surprising new claim - What is the source?  Is that source an expert source who knows what they're talking about? Is the claim based on an anecdote, or a larger study or set of studies?  Is the language sober and accessible, or is it hyperbolic and designed to induce fear or anger? He recommends the very helpful [Ad Fontes Media Bias Chart](https://adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/). 

3) When you encounter someone who disagrees with you, approach the discussion with openness and generosity.  ""Resist the temptation to demonize - if you demonize them, they will probably demonize you, and then there will only be demons in the discussion.""  Recognize that you may have flaws or gaps in your own understanding.

Collins concludes this section by encouraging the reader that while people may have different webs, all those webs generally have a few fundamental pillars of value that they are anchored to - Love, beauty, truth, freedom, family, faith, and goodness.  While our webs may look different, most of us can find common ground with those underlying pillars.  

Collins spends the next chapter discussing his own experiences in the scientific field as a doctor, a geneticist, and an administrator.  He discusses how he got involved with the Human Genome Project and the achievements it made, including finding the genes responsible for cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, and Huntington's Disease.  He shares why scientific research is reliable and accurate when it comes to the treatment of diseases, and why rigorous testing is required.  He warns that ""the plural of anecdote is not data"", and shares an example where treatments were advanced without sufficiently rigorous testing, and people suffered and died because of it (specifically women with a certain type of metastatic breast cancer). 

He adds that science has made terrific contributions to human health and longevity.  He says, ""At the beginning of the twentieth century, the average person in the United States lived just to age forty-seven.  One out of four children died in childhood.  Now our average lifespan is seventy-nine, and only one out of 150 children die in childhood.  Vaccines are a major reason; diseases like pertussis, measles, diphtheria, and polio that used to take the lives of tens of thousands of children every year are now rare.""  He goes on to discuss major culprits for vaccine distrust - men like Andrew Wakefield who claimed that the MMR vaccine caused autism - without revealing that he was being paid by lawyers who were suing the vaccine manufacturers, and that he had falsified the data in his study to fit his conclusions. He also names Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has no medical training but whose connection to JFK lends him credibility.  Kennedy claims that childhood vaccines are dangerous, while he himself profits from snake oil cures he sells instead. [That last part is my assertion, not Dr. Collins'.]

Collins also admits that scientists don't always get it right.  Sometimes important details are missed, sometimes researchers act unethically. But science is a self-correcting process in that if a single research study draws an incorrect conclusion, other studies will be able to figure that out and correct the inaccuracies, which is exactly what happened with Wakefield's study - there's now more evidence than ever that vaccines do not cause autism.  

If I'm not careful, I'm going to summarize the whole book, and I don't have time or energy for that.  I was predominantly interested in Collins' discussions on truth and science.  I learned a lot from it, including several studies I hadn't been aware of before.  He spends the latter half of the book discussing faith, including his own experience of faith, how faith and science interact, and his experiences interacting with people who profoundly disagreed with him about science.  He also gives several strategies for dealing with conflict and beliefs in our own lives, which were good.  All in all, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is struggling with ideas about faith, science, and truth, or is struggling to have difficult conversations about science, faith, and politics in our world today.",TheNerdChaplain,1hd1dyv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hd1dyv/my_review_of_the_road_to_wisdom_by_dr_francis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hd1dyv/my_review_of_the_road_to_wisdom_by_dr_francis/,2024-12-13 01:49:04,25,0.77,25,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hd1dyv
