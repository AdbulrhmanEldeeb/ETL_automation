webdev,"To my beginner friends, a warning: transitioning your career out of JS is hard","I've worked (in Italy as my first dev role) as a Full Stack dev around the MERN stack for a little less than 4 years. At the time, it wasn't a difficult position to get, and it allowed me to finance my degree in Germany.

Now that I have my degree in Comp Ling, I'm again interviewing for positions more around what I'm interested in, which is BE only and, possibly, other ecosystems like .NET (there are many open positions for this environment in my area now, which there weren't a few years ago).

Unfortunately, it seems it's really quite hard to transition out of both the front end and javascript in general. I had a company turn me down due to not having professional experience with Kubernetes and relational DBs, while there was good overlap with the rest of the stack. This is of course completely fair on their part, but I think I could've become a competent user in relatively little time thanks to experimenting with these things in my personal interests and projects. Regardless, it seems I have room to grow in selling what I'm capable of.

Overall, this process of trying to transition out of front-end work and (specifically) MongoDB has been a bit more depressing than I anticipated. I hope you'll have better luck out there, but if you're getting into development on the front-end or full-stack in a JS-centric stack, you might want to look a bit further if your long-term goal is devops or back-end.

With that, happy holidays!",RandomGoodGuy2,1hd8uxk,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd8uxk/to_my_beginner_friends_a_warning_transitioning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd8uxk/to_my_beginner_friends_a_warning_transitioning/,2024-12-13 09:46:57,0,0.45,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hd8uxk

webdev,Developed a SPA to help devs temporarily deploy their javascript and css code,"**Hello Fellow Developers,**

Have you ever needed a quick way to temporarily host a JavaScript or CSS file to share with friends, colleagues, or even just for testing your own code—without having to update the entire project?

Recently, while working on a project, I faced this exact challenge. I needed to integrate custom JavaScript into a Squarespace website to ensure it met WCAG accessibility standards. Unfortunately, Squarespace didn’t offer a direct way to write custom JavaScript (or at least I couldn’t find one). However, it allowed adding custom scripts via a `&lt;script&gt;` tag.

After some research, I discovered a few platforms that let you temporarily deploy JS/CSS files. But most of them were either limited in functionality or required payment after a few uses. While I managed to resolve my issue, it made me wonder how many developers face similar obstacles.

That’s when I decided to create **CloudSyntax**. You can check it out here: [cloudsyntax.site](http://cloudsyntax.site/)

I developed it over a weekend—starting Friday night and finishing by Sunday morning. I wanted to share it immediately, but the domain was unexpectedly suspended. Now that it’s live, I’d love for you to check it out!

**What is CloudSyntax?**

* It’s a free platform (no sign-up or login required, for now).
* You can deploy any JavaScript or CSS code and receive a CloudFront link to embed directly into your projects.

I’d really appreciate your feedback—whether positive or constructive—to help improve the platform.

**Tech Stack:**  
It’s a simple project built with **Next.js**, **AWS S3**, and **CloudFront**.

Thanks, and I hope CloudSyntax proves useful to you!",Beginning-Bother4644,1hd4jmn,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd4jmn/developed_a_spa_to_help_devs_temporarily_deploy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd4jmn/developed_a_spa_to_help_devs_temporarily_deploy/,2024-12-13 04:39:24,10,0.7,10,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1hd4jmn

just in case you're not familiar, a quick breakdown of itch.io from a user perspective:

* sign up either as a developer, a player, or both
* search games by tags, developer, etc
* developers have a profile page that lists their games along with your standard profile stuff
* games have individual pages that can host multiple versions of their game, comment sections, etc
* allow games to also be played on the site, or downloaded,  if the developer wishes
* communities and events for things like game jams 

I might be missing a few things, but that's the majority of how the site is generally interacted with.

webdev,Color management in NextJS/TailwindCSS (and in general),"I am very new to web developing, but I come from a background with strong fundamentals in firmware/embedded development. So I am a good ""programmer"" - just for context.

I taught myself webdev and have so far become intro-level decent but have recently struggled with color management.

From what I gather, it's common practice to set a bunch of very specific variables in your globals.css for things like primary, secondary, card, accent, muted (thinking of [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com)) and applying those liberally around the codebase. And should you want to support multiple themes (e.g. light, dark) you just need to define these vars for each theme and use media queries to select which one to use. But how/why were these vars chosen specifically?

What's a best practice for what's in globals.css (with respect to colors) and generally how to apply them to components? I feel like this could quickly unravel into having variables for everything - card, button, link, etc. That seems poorly designed and a maintenance nightmare.

webdev,Please Advice a Sole-Developer Seeking a Corporate Job with NDA-Limited Portfolio,"# Context:

I’ve been working remotely as the sole back-end developer for a boutique Cyber Security company since 2021. My focus has been on Python (Flask) for back-end work, but I’ve also handled full-stack tasks like front-end development (Angular), database design and deployment.

While it’s been a fantastic learning experience, the lack of mentorship, code reviews, and team workflow exposure has limited my growth.

Key projects if needed:

1. A system for analyzing machine-generated files and generating Word docx reports with complex formatting.
2. A tailored CRM for management of clients and services.

Unfortunately, **NDAs** prevent me from showcasing these projects, leaving me without any real-life portfolio examples for interviews.

# Research results so far:

Most advice suggests building custom projects, but I worry that a truly reflective project could take 1–3 months, while simpler ones might make me look like a fresh graduate.

# TLDR;

How can I effectively demonstrate my skills (specifically backend) with no real-life projects?

What are your thoughts on creating custom projects to bridge the NDA gap? Is the time investment worth it?

webdev,"Google Pagespeed sees way outdated version of my website, and I don't know why!","Hi!  
When going to google pagespeed to analyse my website performance, I found out something very weird:

It seems like google is reading a looongly outdated version of the website. I can see this on ""color contrast complaints"" where it highlights a blue box, which is now red. It also complains about a console error which I cannot reproduce.

This change happened months ago. Checking incognito with any browser gives me up-to-date results. Doing the page speed test in a Chrome browser (locally) will provide me with a good result.

This could mean that not only Pagespeed sees outdated stuff but the search indexer as well. Nobody wants old stuff to be indexed.

It seems like Google is somehow looking at a cache proxy or something I cannot control.

Does anybody know of similar situations? What would be a way out?

This is what Google sees:

webdev,GraphQL static Resolvers vs dynamic resolvers ,"Hello cool cats. I have a quick question. I'm defining resolvers for a personal application.
I plan on implementing a mix of dynamic resolvers capable of being used for essentially any of the models and resolvers specific to certain requests like creating a user, creating tokens, etc..

The reason why l'm asking this question is to develop standards and best practices.

Without the use of a dynamic resolvers capable of placing data wherever i need to I would have to create somewhere around 250 resolvers. Don't really have a problem doing that but I can obviously make this list A LOT smaller and it is probably not advisable just because it'd be a pain in the ass to manage.

What resolvers would you, as a graphql developer, design with specific intent and what functions would you leave to a dynamic resolver? 

It's an E-commerce project. I'm looking for general standards and practices but E-commerce specifics are useful as well. I can make sense of what is said and apply it logically to what I'm doing so no need to cater your response specifically to an E-Commerce plattorm.

I understand my technical jargon and lingo may not be up to par. You are welcome to correct me but if you do please add something to the topic that can benefit my resolution rather than only pointing out flaws in how I worded my question.",orgin100,1hcuedm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcuedm/graphql_static_resolvers_vs_dynamic_resolvers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hcuedm/graphql_static_resolvers_vs_dynamic_resolvers/,2024-12-12 20:24:16,2,0.75,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hcuedm

But I want to go deep and to advanced level. I understand that coding it live will help me go deep, but I am not interested in starting from scratch. And instead spend time on architectural or implementation overview of advanced apps. So I thought of wrestling with LLM's on. So I started with prompt like 

\`Give me a problem in web development. I want them to be medium to advanced level from perspective or use cases of experienced developers,  and i will give you the required procedure but not the code to be used for solution.

webdev,How did web advertising become so bloated?,"I'm not talking about the excessive, obnoxios ad campaigns that cover content or exceed its quantity; that's a separate issue. What I'm talking about are articles, even from known and relatively trusted (at least for reading content) websites, that become so bogged down with ads that they wind up freezing or outright crashing mobile browsers, or lagging noticably on budget or low-power PC-based devices.

I don't think their quantity alone, as annoying as it is, is enough to account for their overhead. Many just display static images or simple animations which barely take up any processing power at all once loaded from the server. What are a few dozen animated images for a device that has no trouble whatsoever running quite complex browser games? The rest are presented as videos that take up some fraction of the screen, and only two or three of these videos are onscreen and playing at any given time. Meanwhile it would take at least a dozen videos at the same resolution to match the load of a single 1440p video stream which the same devices can comfortably handle, in a browser, even after downsampling it to fit the display.

What are these ads doing in the background that takes up so much processing power?

webdev,"ddev problems, any idea?","Hi all, this is a question to those who are familiar with ddev.

I used opensuse for a long time and due to struggle with updates I ran an older version of ddev. Because I began with this several years ago I fix-messed my system in a way that I was able to just change the php-version in the config.yaml of each new project to my desired setup which worked like a charm or maybe it was just possible in the older ddev?

Now I went to debian, set up a fresh new ddev and started working. This was fine for php8.3 but now I have a migration project where I have to run an older system under php7.4 locally.

The problem, I can't just change the php-version in the config.yaml because it isn't available when I try to make ddev start on the project afterwards.

webdev,How do you work remotely in your team?,"This is a long post, I apologize in advance, but background info if required and I am not sure how to TLDR it.

I just joined a new company almost 4 months ago. In my previous company we had the following setup (prior to covid):: 

Everyone had a work computer in the office with VirtualBox running a local copy of the codebase and the DB. (we also had VirtualBox with a local copy at home after covid when we went remote for 1 year).

That local copy was a git repository connected to a BitBucket remote origin. We all worked on our own copy of the codebase because prior to 2014 we were not using git at all. We used Dreamweaver with it's checkin/checkout and we constantly were overwriting each other's changes. In comes git and we solved that problem.

This new company I am working for now, also does not use git, and we all (4 devs) just remote into the dev server and work directly on it. So far in 4 months, it has happened 4 times where someone has been ""working on a new feature"" directly on the dev server, and it would break something for some other section that QA was working on. QA all have to stop and wait for it to be fixed before they can keep working. 

On my second week there, I was told that 2 of the other devs use SFTP. So I also setup SFTP in order to at least create a local git repo to track my own changes locally. Of course now I have to sync my local with dev manually. Not ideal. So long story short, I get assigned a larger project that is a major overhaul of a single system within the application as a whole (which I am still working on today). So I setup a local development environment in docker, which involves tweaking some things in the application code in order to get it to run locally because hard coded redirects and forced https and whatnot.

Everyone asks how I am working on stuff when they can't see my changes on dev... I work on a local setup with proper version control... ""OH THAT SOUNDS COOL!!!! WE WANT SCM TOO!!! CAN WE DO THAT TOO!!!"" why yes you can. Here is a docker compose file so you can mount your local files directly into the VM, and here is the remote repo so you can clone it. Have fun.

They immediately go straight to the single devops guy who calls me and tells me that I am not authorized to have a local copy of the codebase, and is freaking out because he thinks we are running the DB locally as well. In fact, no one is authorized to have local copies. We all need to stop using it and docker immediately and work on dev directly like they have been doing for decades. After the new year we will look into setting up something else that is more inline with ""doing it the right way"".

So I apologize for overstepping my role (Senior Frontend Architect - DevOps Engineer), and let him know it was not my intention to violate any non-existent, not-in-writing, never-explained-to-me-as-a-new-hire policies or procedures, and that I just wanted to get things moving in the direction of using SCM, since it is something we need to implement.

Anyway, I thought about it for like 20 minutes after I got off the phone, and thought of the following setup:

* Everything is already running on AWS
* Setup 1 remote server with 4 user accounts, one for each dev
* Each user account has it's own copy of the codebase that is a git repo on the server that only they and a single devops user can access (in case someone leaves and has not pushed code to the origin yet we can still get into it and not lose the code). (Possibly also running a remote VSCode IDE so we don't have to configure a local one as well - not really necessary, but would be a cool feature to have).
* Each dev remotes into their account on the server and works on the server files in their account directly (no local copies).
* The account based repos connect to a self-hosted git origin, and push/pull from there
* The self-hosted git origin CI/CD pipelines into the current dev server (which now becomes staging) and the load balancer which pushes to 2 production servers.

webdev,What's the recommended way to handle state in modern Angular?,"
Hello,
I'm primarily a Next.js developer, and I’m currently working on a large enterprise project. I'm using standalone components and signals, and everything is going well so far. However, I’m a bit confused about the best way to manage global state. In Next.js, I typically use the React Query library.
I’ve read that using services with RxJS and signals might be the recommended approach, but I’m not entirely sure if that’s accurate.
Thanks for taking the time to read my post!

webdev,Website load testing advice,"I run a website that sells tickets for events. It’s built with **Next.js**, hosted on **Vercel**, and uses **Turso DB**. I’m trying to figure out how scalable the setup is and how many purchases it can handle per second before things start to break.

My idea is to simulate up to **100,000 clients** with an end-to-end test (using Playwright), starting with smaller loads and scaling up gradually. The goal is to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle significant traffic, as this is critical for securing deals with larger customers. I’m not too worried about cost since this testing is an investment in reliability.

# My Questions:

1. **Has anyone load-tested a similar setup?** What challenges did you run into?
2. **Should I notify Vercel and Turso DB** about the spike in traffic beforehand? I assume they’ll need a heads-up.
3. **Is Playwright suitable for this kind of load testing**, where can I run it?

# My Current Plan:

* **Vercel**: Since it’s serverless, scaling should be automatic, but I’ll confirm with their support.
* **Turso DB**: I’ll reach out to Turso to discuss their rate limits and any potential bottlenecks for write-heavy operations.
* **Testing Strategy**: Start small (e.g., 1,000 clients) and incrementally increase load while monitoring response times, query latency, and error rates.
* **Monitoring**: Use tools like Vercel Monitoring to pinpoint any issues during testing.

# What I’m Looking For:

* Where to host the playwright tests that won't get blocked by a firewall.
* Advice from anyone with experience load-testing serverless + turso setups.
* Tips on tools, methods, or optimizations I might not have thought of.
* Any ""gotchas"" I should be aware of before I dive into testing.",Neekzorz,1hd6wb4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd6wb4/website_load_testing_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd6wb4/website_load_testing_advice/,2024-12-13 07:11:23,3,1.0,3,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hd6wb4
