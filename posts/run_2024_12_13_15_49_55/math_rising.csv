math,What exactly is Representation theory?,"I am a graduate student in my first year. I attend a lot of talks. Compared to my undergrad years, now understand more. I also attended a bunch of talks on Lie theory and representation theory. In my experience that was the hardest series of talks I attended. In all the talks I attended I didn't understand anything other than few terms I googled later. I have only experience with representation theory of finite groups. I know it is not possible to understand all the talks. I liked representation theory of finite groups. So I was wondering if it is similar to that. I also realised representation is not only for groups. I want to know for what kinds of structures we do represention and why? I want to know what exactly is a representation theorists do?

math,Do graphs of analytic functions have any distinguishing features?,"If you look at the graph of a function its usually easy to tell if its continuous or not (it doesn't jump around anywhere). It's slightly less obvious but you can also tell when a function is differentiable by looking at its graph (it doesn't oscillate a lot and is ""smooth""). I find these qualitative features helpful even if they're not very rigorous.

Can anything similar be said of real analytic functions where you can roughly say whether or not you expect it to be analytic if its graph does/does not have certain features?",If_and_only_if_math,1hcs2xl,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hcs2xl/do_graphs_of_analytic_functions_have_any/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hcs2xl/do_graphs_of_analytic_functions_have_any/,2024-12-12 18:44:26,30,0.93,30,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcs2xl
math,Why does this not work? (Integrodifferential PDE),"I am working on an integrodifferential PDE (a coefficient in the PDE is given by the integral of the function squared over the whole domain) and I was trying to see if there are any ways of turning it into anything simpler. I came up with something that somehow seems like it cannot work, but I don't see where it fails. I'll explain it with a simple example, using a diffusion-like equation. Suppose we have

u_t = A(t) u_xx

where A(t) could be a simple time dependent function, or given by an integral of some function of u over x. The idea I had was to simply rearrange

u_t/u_xx = A(t)

And then take a partial derivative w.r.t. x so that

[u_t/u_xx]_x = 0

Developing this expression, one gets

u_xt u_xx - u_t u_xxx = 0

which can be rewritten as the simpler (?) system

v_t v_x - u_t v_xx = 0,   u_x = v

This is now a (nonlinear and higher order, but no longer integrodifferential) PDE. In particular it is first order in time derivatives so (I might be wrong) given an initial condition u(x,t=0)=u_0(x) it can be integrated forward in time, say numerically.

Obviously this can't be right, because where is all the information that was contained in A(t) gone? Even for standard diffusion, where A is a time independent constant, this doesnt make sense.

Where does the argument fail, or what am I missing?",m3tro,1hcxnyi,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hcxnyi/why_does_this_not_work_integrodifferential_pde/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hcxnyi/why_does_this_not_work_integrodifferential_pde/,2024-12-12 22:46:52,9,0.92,9,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcxnyi
