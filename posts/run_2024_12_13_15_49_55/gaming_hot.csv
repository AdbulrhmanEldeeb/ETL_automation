gaming,A Fjord I made in Minecraft,"This Inlet is part of major fjord I have been developing in my Minecraft world called Sky Pixel. The fjord itself is called the ""Lullaby Fjord"" it is surrounded by large tidewater glaciers I have been making for quite some time now. 

This world is also already released on my Patreon (Sky Pixel) for users to experience and download.

Much of my builds can also be seen on my YT channel @elijahjones as well. 

This build is a small section of my world that I have been developing since 2014. Which includes many cities and landscapes. 

This glacier itself is called the ""Porter Glacier"" it's part of a series of glaciers that run near it such as the ""Harlette, Kusuah, Ellie, Jacie, Rezjvik, Lunaska, and Sathomko glaciers"" amongst others. 

This area I have been developing in my world is inspired by the Pacific Northwest landscapes. I've been doing a ton of developing similar to these landscapes because I was born and raised in the PNW. This area in particular is mostly focused on areas of British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska. I have already developed much of areas within the Cascades and Coast Mountains already. Just making my way up the line. And almost done with this region in my world.

Right now i’m sorta running out of difficult experiences and so i thought why not make a post on here to ask for any of you guys recommendations. 

If you know of any hard but fair game, whether niche or popular, feel free to name it. 

Here are just a few guidelines though:
- single player would be better

- no rogue likes/lites or bullet hells because I just don’t really like them sorry

- the game must still be somewhat fair. I don’t want inflated difficulty just for the sake of « ahah my game is absolutely unbeatable »

-I’ve already played fromsoft games so no need to recommend those


Anything else is fair game. I’m not sure this post’ll really work out but i thought i’d give it a shot.

so lets come to yesterday, I saw on the epic store there was LEgo starwars for free and while watching a few videos I realized that is seemed like a collectathon. can anyone confirm that? are the lego series games all like that? is fighting easy? (he struggles a bit with the controller, that's why he is loving collectathons as they don't require to many buttons/combo to be played)

other than the lego series there is something else you'd recommend? (rayman trilogy is on the to do list but I heard there are controller mapping issues on steam)

gaming,The industry’s AAA revenue problem,"After the very real issue of layoffs and the sometimes toxic revenue model of the industry was brought to the forefront at The Game Awards last night I thought I would create a post to have a constructive discussion on the state of the industry if we can (please try).
The industry has a genuine problem.   The cost of what we consider AAA or even AA game development is at an all time high.   The old model of just selling a game for $70 and hoping to sell enough copies to make money doesn’t work anymore.  If this model was retained, the baseline price tag of most games should really be $120 for example…but consumers don’t want that. Companies are mandating either micro transactions, live-service, etc as a way to even just stay in business let alone profitable.  Gamers generally don’t want that either…but it has worked. There’s nothing wrong with profit; it often helps funds next projects.   No one is staying in this business if they are not making profit. We have seen how many companies have gone out of business even when gaming switched from SD to HD graphics with the 360 era.   Companies are less likely to take risks on new IP because they don’t want to lose money.  We have seen larger companies like Microsoft make massive acquisitions of several smaller studios and have said it’s bad for the industry; but how many of those companies would have eventually gone the way of Midway and just gone out of business eventually.   If you’re still reading this; thank you…just wanted to put some thoughts out there to have some focused discussions…not rants, discussions hopefully.

gaming,"Has there ever been a game recommendation website that behaves similar to how social media sites recommend friends based on ""mutual friends"", where it will recommend games based on ""mutual games"", however the games are reverse-weighted?","Specifically, I was thinking of a sort of unique algorithm, where it would weight games based on reverse-popularity (or at least a toggle feature for it).

So, a game like Super Mario World on SNES, or Sonic on Sega Genesis would have a very low weight, due to it's popularity (measured by how many others have the game favorited).

Whereas, a game like Gain Ground on Sega Genesis, or Xardion on SNES would have a very low weigh, due to their popularity, and the fact that me and 3 other people have played them.

My thinking is, say I had 100 of variety of games ""favorited"". Of those, if I have 20 niche games, and it pairs me up with someone who also has some of those games in their list, it would stand to reason, we have a very similar taste in games (with the other lower-weighted games help support it), and should have a very high likelyhood of enjoying what other games the other person has favorited that we are unaware of.

The website can also offer suggestions independent of other users, by stack ranking your list against the popularity of other titles, using the same algorithm.

Has this been done before? Can others see the logic in what I'm saying? Does someone want to steal this idea and make a site for it?

It would have come out between 1991 and 1995.

All they remember is something about a little girl going into a vampire's house. They swear they played it with a controller at a friend's house.

Any help is appreciated as I can find anything online.

We all love gaming and we all wish our favorite game should have won. However, throwing baseless claims about a company rigging a game election sounds like a conspiracy theory to me.

They don’t affect us at all. It changes absolutely nothing. The game awards are supposed to be about gamers. To me it’s about us coming together and appreciating that gaming is taken seriously.

gaming,Game narrative idea,"This is just a loose overview not a beat by beat. 

1. Player is working for a mentor performing assignments. To keep it simple let's say getting to and destroying guarded broadcast towers which are (they are told) being used to subjugate villagers. 


2. As they are partway through completing one of these quests, something gets their attention about this being not quite as believed. Further investigation unveils that these are _not_ subjugating people but form a defence network. 

The player, instead of helping people, is endangering them. The guards are also villagers protecting their defences. In fact the very mentor who directed them is a villain.

3. Although they don't have direct interaction with the mentor until the end, the enemies along the way work for the mentor. 

The player now desires to undo the damage they have done but, unsurprisingly, the villagers don't trust them so that's an additional hurdle. The player killed their friends and neighbours so at best they will get a begrudging compliance. 

4. The final boss is the former mentor (yes, this has been done before such as in Assassin's Creed 1) who has gained power in the background after the player helped them. The player does not want to fight and maybe kill the mentor but is left with no alternative.

gaming,A reveal: I'm so ready for this eventuality,"Theres a microchip floating through space.  Something happened to it, but what?  

You hear a voice, Stephen Fry's voice actually:

""Oh, what do we have here?  You seem to have had a very, very, bad day.  I know just the ...thing... that might - just - help.  Ah!  And here it is now.""

A spaceship is heard arriving off screen and a glowing blue cord with a little circle at the end flows out of it after a pop.  The string grabs the Microchip and pulls it towards the still off-screen ship.  Slowly, the ship is revealed and with it a familiar silhouette pulling the cord.  It's SACKBOY!

""Its been awhile, Sack-Thing,"" Stephen Frys voice says again.  \*Sackboy begins waving his arms around and nearly (and iconically) slaps the Micro-Chip back out into space\* ""Yes, Yes, its great to see you too but be careful!  We'll reminisce later, first things first little sack-thing, can you Imagine any way to help this other-thing, whatever it is?""  

Sackboy thinks for a moment before jumping up in excitement and opening up his pop-it and creates a Sackbot from thin air.  Using his Pop-It-Cursor, he opens the Sackbots Microchip Brain and places the mysterious space microchip inside it.

Immediately, a pair of round blue eyes pop up on the Sackbots previously empty wooden face, with some glitching.  No other features appear.

""Ah yes!  Wonderful idea!  Hello new friend, can you hear me?""  The Sackbot jumps in surprise at the narrative voice, but nods a yes.

""Can you tell us what happened to you?""  The Sackbot thinks and shakes its head, ""no"".  

""No? Well, then perhaps we should just start, with your name, can you tell us that?""

The Sackbot thinks again, narrowing its solid blue eyes and says, with a question,

""I...am...Astro-Bot?""

gaming,Idea: Ranking games by their devs,"This is an idea I've had for a month or two now, and I can't imagine I'm the first person to suggest something like this:

People want to be able to experience works of art made by artists they like.  But with video games, the art in question is being developed by potentially hundreds or thousands of people, and it's harder to ascribe authorship to any one person.  Yes, AAA gaming still has the rare Hideo Kojima or Sam Lake, but it's more common for people to follow game companies- which is fine in the short term, but once enough developers leave or get laid off, it turns into the Studio of Theseus.  And all the while, the big publishers want us to focus on the franchise itself rather than the people behind it.

So what if you could keep track of all the individual game devs from project to project?  My idea here is a website that would keep track of games and their devs, and be able to compare them based on how many devs are shared.  So for instance you'd be able to select Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, and find out that they shared (wild guess) 85% of the same devs.  The most obvious challenge is how much weight you give to certain devs, since a game's director is probably more responsible for its vision then, say, a guy who modelled some of the enemy bicycles.  I know basically nothing about how responsibility is divided up within a studio, but just for example you could have the director given 25% of the credit, the department heads another 25%, and the remainder split among everyone else.

I feel like a lot of people would have the same kinds of problems with this that they do with systems like RottenTomatoes, but respect for artistic vision in AAA gaming is in such dire straits, I'd think any version of this would be an improvement.",MiloHawkins,1hcn5np,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,2024-12-12 15:10:54,0,0.37,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcn5np

gaming,My thoughts on TGA Nominees having now played them,"I finally played all of the TGA GOTY nominees thanks to Black Friday deals and I wanted to share my thoughts as award season approaches 

Balatro (9/10)

This game is a masterclass in deceptively simple design and It’s astonishing how easy to lose hours to its “one more run” hook. 

If you’ve avoided it because you think it’s “just poker” or “just a card game,” you’re seriously missing out and doing yourself a disservice. It’s a deeply engaging experience that I think you should try if you haven’t 

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (9/10)

While there’s some debate about its eligibility, for me personally there’s no denying that SOTE delivered one of the absolute best gaming experiences of the year. 

This expansion earns a spot on my Mount Rushmore of DLCs, right alongside Blood and Wine, Shivering Isles, and Phantom Liberty.

Astro Bot (9.5/10)

This. Game. Fucks.

As a fan of classic Nintendo 3D platformers, this felt like a love letter to the genre with a modern twist. 

My only complaint with the game is that I just wanted more of it at the end of the short run time to a platinum trophy. 

The final challenge run and the themed X, Square, Circle, and Triangle levels were brilliant and I’d kill for more levels of that difficulty and quality

If this game was just an appetizer, I can’t wait to see what Team Asobi has in store for the main course. If not for my ultimate favorite this year, this would have been my pick for GOTY.

Black Myth: Wukong (7.5-8/10)

While I enjoyed my three playthroughs of BM: W, I don’t think it quite reaches the same level as the other nominees. 

That said, for the developers’ first big swing, this is a fucking crazy impressive showing. I’m excited to see where they go next as this was an incredibly solid starting point and a downright great game in its own right 

Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (8.5/10)

As a huge fan of the original FF VII, the remake series has been a delight for me. 

The visuals are stunning, and it’s fucking sweet seeing the locations I remember in full 3D recreations. 

However for me it ultimately suffers from some modern open-world fatigue (developers seriously need to retire map towers and their equivalents lmao) 

Despite that, it’s a standout gaming experience, and I can’t wait for Part 3.

Metaphor: ReFantazio (9.5/10)

Jesus Christ, this game.

The characters, world-building, and narrative are utterly fantastic. 

At 40 hours in, it’s easily my GOTY—though, of course, a poorly executed ending could change that. 

My only (minor) gripe is that the soundtrack, while great, doesn’t quite hit Persona levels of perfection.

Final Rankings:
1.	Metaphor: ReFantazio
2.	Astro Bot
3.	Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
4.	Balatro
5.	Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
6.	Black Myth: Wukong

You can judge the quality of my insight by what is announced tonight, so I raise a can of Red Bull to any of you who are staying up late to watch it!

For everyone that’s not though, we’ll have coverage all through the night (or at least from after 4 am, when it ends) and continuing into the morning. 

Whether this is a milestone in the current generation of consoles or just another wet squib, I hope everyone gets at least a couple of announcements to interest them and that The Game Awards 2024 sets us up for a more optimistic 2025!

**Hi, I’m David from GameCentral and I’m part of the Metro judging panel for The Game Awards, one of many contributing to the nominations and winner ballot for this year’s event.**

I’ve been leading Metro’s video games coverage for over a decade now and can discuss every element of the games industry as long as it doesn’t involve sports or driving a car in a straight line!

GameCentral has been contributing to The Game Awards for several years now and, unlike almost everything else about the games industry, it doesn’t tend to have that many leaks about its reveals. There are some [official confirmations already though, and a lot of unsubstantiated rumours, so it’s going to be fun to speculate on](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/11/game-awards-2024-predictions-gta-6-split-fiction-rumours-22170224/) what could be the most important night of the year for gaming...

I can’t tell you who we voted for at The Game Awards, and it would be undiplomatic for me to talk about who might win, but if you want to **Ask Me Anything else about the event -** [**in particular what I hope and expect in terms of new trailers and announcements**](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/12/half-life-3-rumoured-one-game-awards-2024-megaton-announcements-22173667/) \- you can tune into our AMA on Thursday 12th December at 5 pm GMT.

gaming,Are we ever going to get a sense of normalcy back for the AAA gaming space?,"Just saw a post that explains how Activision has a patent in place for a system that maximizes exposure of players with bought skins towards non-paid skinned players. Just reminds me of how desperately greedy every AAA company as seem to turn into. It's as if 
 
-The push for live service for every single company in the industry. 

-Ubisoft's yearly pumping out of same formulaic copies for every IP they have, becoming worse and worse every time till they get to the point where the entire company is looking to sell

-Xbox's constant fumbling of so many first party studios that they've bought out and subsequently shutdown, that's if they were able to finish their projects and release their flops of games. 

-Sony's obsession for high 
profile/cinematic/high fidelity games to get block buster sales numbers. Apparent push for live service games when single player games were what made them get the lead in the I dustry in the first place. Why does it seem

-Rockstar's refusal to develop any games outside GTA and RDR to utilize their extremely monitored online modes for years/decade to come

-EA's total flop of battlefield/battlefront do to short sighted decisions of the company, and there entire scorched earth approach towards shutting down so many studios

-So many god damn broken releases with studios having to deal with outside forces that always end up prioritizing money so far from the actual quality of the product. Even outside of that, we have constant stories of infighting in long standing studios that one way or another have an inherent lack of direction and leadership to get a working product out. This makes the lack of quality in a lot of games an issue involving terrible leadership in developer studios as much as outside interference from share holders.

Can make the list twice as long but you get the picture. It's crazy just how fucked the industry is, especially with how many studios have shut down during and after COVID, and I honestly don't believe the aftermath of COVID has had the most affect in this regard. These companies have been going down this route throughout the late 2010's and took it to overdrive this generation. I mean just look how far Sony has fallen from before, it's good damn mind blowing how much they are fumbling this generation, it's as if anyone in the company with any sense of the industry were lobotomized. 

With the pending recession thats bound to happen soon, along with the aftermath of so many studios shutting down in the past 5 years, I feel like decades of progression and development of the industry itself from now to at least the 90's is going to be totally lost. There are a handful of high profile leaders in the thick of it that are rumored to be developing new studios as we speak, but the economy is turning to shit and these kinds of studios need proper funding to get through and I just don't think many publishers are going to have reasonable demands anytime soon.

I can't help but to feel we aren't going to back to a sense of normalcy in the AAA space. We got some AA studios that have show up, plenty of indie's, but I for one miss the kind of quality, tightly and fully developed games we used to have back in the ps2-ps3/xbox-xbox360 and some of the PS4 eras (where the momentum for monitizaion really picked up). I personally don't believe the amount of indie's, majority of them on early access most of its life on the market, makes up for the lack of experiences we used to have before hand in the gaming space. And I don't believe that's speaking with rose-tinted glasses, as much as reddit likes to preach otherwise.",NamedFruit,1hc87kj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,2024-12-12 00:11:19,0,0.26,0,0,49,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hc87kj

gaming,Revisiting classics can be heartbreaking sometimes,"For example, I’ve recently reinstalled Battlefield 1. I had some major memories with this game as I used to take my PlayStation over to my friends house every Friday night and we used to sit there with two monitors so it was as close to split screen as it gets. For those that are familiar with the game type “Operations” you’ll know what I’m talking about when I say THAT was the game mode you would play. It was both hectic and chaotic all at once.

Coming back to it now there’s just no player base numbers to fill up the lobby so you have to resort to smaller games in different modes like “frontlines”. Makes me think about all the classics shutting down or just not having a player base anymore like rainbow six vegas 2 and Halo 3. I feel these games live forever in our memories but sometimes trying to go back to them just feels so different. Almost like revisiting a house you used to live in. You have the memories but it’s just not home anymore. I think that’s the bitter sweet thing with online games these days….

Lately, I've played a lot of stuff like Nekopara, Stardew Valley, Minecraft, fairly easy and laid back games. I'm trying to not use guides because I am dumb and want to learn to learn.

TL; DR: Any tips, suggestions, or advice on getting gud at stuff like rougelikes, survival games, and bullet hells?

Some examples of games that are giving me trouble include the following: Coin Crypt, Crypt of the Necro Dancer, ARK: Survival Evolved (don't have ascended, don't care to get it), Don't Starve, and Quest Run.

Not looking for guides, just general strategies.",Fate_Fire,1hb7r9t,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hb7r9t/need_a_little_help_here_with_certain_genres/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hb7r9t/need_a_little_help_here_with_certain_genres/,2024-12-10 17:56:21,0,0.5,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hb7r9t

gaming,Why are most new games that aren’t AAA titles coming out as early access?,Don’t get me wrong there are a few gems that are still in early access that are well worth the buy. My biggest issue is a lot of these games shouldn’t even be released because they’re early alpha builds at best. Damn near unplayable due to numerous bugs and glitches. I know deadlines and impatient shareholders are some reasons for early access releases. I just wish devs would go back to the way things used to be and release the finished game on launch. Early access to me feels like a cop out where the dev can keep a small team working on the game for its future updates. Then use the rest of the dev team to start working on their next game. If I wanted to play a game where all the content isn’t available from the get go I’d play an MMO or a live service game.,Southernchef87,1hbo2o7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbo2o7/why_are_most_new_games_that_arent_aaa_titles/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbo2o7/why_are_most_new_games_that_arent_aaa_titles/,2024-12-11 07:15:36,0,0.25,0,0,22,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbo2o7

gaming,We shouldn't praise devs for doing the bare minimum,"I see so much praise for developers nowadays for doing things that *should* be standard and was back in the early 2000s and early to mid 2010s lol.

gaming,Why doesn't Steam get involved in Android Gaming/Emulation?,"Mobile gaming is appareantly the biggest market in gaming: [Global increase State of Mobile Gaming Industry | GO-Globe](https://www.go-globe.com/state-of-mobile-gaming-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20the%20Mobile,2.8%20billion%20mobile%20gamers%20worldwide.). The reasons are clear. Everyone has a smartphone, but not everyone has a PC fit for gaming or a console. So the obstacles for getting into gaming are pretty low.

Sadly the Playstore mainly constists of garbage games, with a free-2-play and in-app-store monetization model. This model does not aim for good gameplay, but for pulling your money out of your pocket. There are some pearls standing out, like Dead Cells, Slay the Spire and so on, which are direct ports of their pc/console counterparts, but as they have upfront cost, appareantly the big mass does not want them or does not find them in the pile of thrash, that the Playstore is. Since they don't generate enought revenue, the willingness of other publishers to port their already existing games to Android is also neglectable.

Now comes the neat part: If you checkout r/EmulationOnAndroid , basically the whole gaming history, with the exception of the latest consoles, is available on Android through emulation. Using **Winlator** or similar, it is even possible to emulate PC games, without much hassle. I have seen videos of Skyrim, Witcher 3 and even Cyberpunk getting played on High End Android devices. Since this is possible, this eleminates the need for porting games, you can just play the PC version, if you want to. As i understood it, the Steam Deck does the same. It creates a compatibility layer for PC games for the Steam Deck hardware/OS, they were not initially made for.

Now comes the big question: Since such feats can be accomplished by just a few developers worldwide, why is lets say Valve/Steam so not interesed in this topic? They already have a mobile app, with Steam Link a powerful editor for mobile controls and the compatibility layer through their Steam OS. If they tie these parts together they could have a third platform, they could distribute their games for. Imagine you buy a game on Steam and you could play it on PC, on the Steam Deck AND on Android!

It is definitely technically feasible, as it was already shown by others. So why does no one use that potential?",dibade89,1hbntng,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,2024-12-11 06:57:57,0,0.17,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbntng

They are super short so they make you want more. Some do feel like glorified cutscene but more or less it’s because of the length. I personally want more but due to the reviews I don’t think we will.
