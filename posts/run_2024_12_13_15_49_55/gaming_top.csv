If you know of any hard but fair game, whether niche or popular, feel free to name it. 

Here are just a few guidelines though:
- single player would be better

- no rogue likes/lites or bullet hells because I just don’t really like them sorry

- the game must still be somewhat fair. I don’t want inflated difficulty just for the sake of « ahah my game is absolutely unbeatable »

-I’ve already played fromsoft games so no need to recommend those

gaming,The industry’s AAA revenue problem,"After the very real issue of layoffs and the sometimes toxic revenue model of the industry was brought to the forefront at The Game Awards last night I thought I would create a post to have a constructive discussion on the state of the industry if we can (please try).
The industry has a genuine problem.   The cost of what we consider AAA or even AA game development is at an all time high.   The old model of just selling a game for $70 and hoping to sell enough copies to make money doesn’t work anymore.  If this model was retained, the baseline price tag of most games should really be $120 for example…but consumers don’t want that. Companies are mandating either micro transactions, live-service, etc as a way to even just stay in business let alone profitable.  Gamers generally don’t want that either…but it has worked. There’s nothing wrong with profit; it often helps funds next projects.   No one is staying in this business if they are not making profit. We have seen how many companies have gone out of business even when gaming switched from SD to HD graphics with the 360 era.   Companies are less likely to take risks on new IP because they don’t want to lose money.  We have seen larger companies like Microsoft make massive acquisitions of several smaller studios and have said it’s bad for the industry; but how many of those companies would have eventually gone the way of Midway and just gone out of business eventually.   If you’re still reading this; thank you…just wanted to put some thoughts out there to have some focused discussions…not rants, discussions hopefully.

gaming,"Has there ever been a game recommendation website that behaves similar to how social media sites recommend friends based on ""mutual friends"", where it will recommend games based on ""mutual games"", however the games are reverse-weighted?","Specifically, I was thinking of a sort of unique algorithm, where it would weight games based on reverse-popularity (or at least a toggle feature for it).

So, a game like Super Mario World on SNES, or Sonic on Sega Genesis would have a very low weight, due to it's popularity (measured by how many others have the game favorited).

Whereas, a game like Gain Ground on Sega Genesis, or Xardion on SNES would have a very low weigh, due to their popularity, and the fact that me and 3 other people have played them.

My thinking is, say I had 100 of variety of games ""favorited"". Of those, if I have 20 niche games, and it pairs me up with someone who also has some of those games in their list, it would stand to reason, we have a very similar taste in games (with the other lower-weighted games help support it), and should have a very high likelyhood of enjoying what other games the other person has favorited that we are unaware of.

The website can also offer suggestions independent of other users, by stack ranking your list against the popularity of other titles, using the same algorithm.

Has this been done before? Can others see the logic in what I'm saying? Does someone want to steal this idea and make a site for it?

gaming,Game narrative idea,"This is just a loose overview not a beat by beat. 

1. Player is working for a mentor performing assignments. To keep it simple let's say getting to and destroying guarded broadcast towers which are (they are told) being used to subjugate villagers. 


2. As they are partway through completing one of these quests, something gets their attention about this being not quite as believed. Further investigation unveils that these are _not_ subjugating people but form a defence network. 

The player, instead of helping people, is endangering them. The guards are also villagers protecting their defences. In fact the very mentor who directed them is a villain.

3. Although they don't have direct interaction with the mentor until the end, the enemies along the way work for the mentor. 

The player now desires to undo the damage they have done but, unsurprisingly, the villagers don't trust them so that's an additional hurdle. The player killed their friends and neighbours so at best they will get a begrudging compliance. 

4. The final boss is the former mentor (yes, this has been done before such as in Assassin's Creed 1) who has gained power in the background after the player helped them. The player does not want to fight and maybe kill the mentor but is left with no alternative.

gaming,A reveal: I'm so ready for this eventuality,"Theres a microchip floating through space.  Something happened to it, but what?  

You hear a voice, Stephen Fry's voice actually:

""Oh, what do we have here?  You seem to have had a very, very, bad day.  I know just the ...thing... that might - just - help.  Ah!  And here it is now.""

A spaceship is heard arriving off screen and a glowing blue cord with a little circle at the end flows out of it after a pop.  The string grabs the Microchip and pulls it towards the still off-screen ship.  Slowly, the ship is revealed and with it a familiar silhouette pulling the cord.  It's SACKBOY!

""Its been awhile, Sack-Thing,"" Stephen Frys voice says again.  \*Sackboy begins waving his arms around and nearly (and iconically) slaps the Micro-Chip back out into space\* ""Yes, Yes, its great to see you too but be careful!  We'll reminisce later, first things first little sack-thing, can you Imagine any way to help this other-thing, whatever it is?""  

Sackboy thinks for a moment before jumping up in excitement and opening up his pop-it and creates a Sackbot from thin air.  Using his Pop-It-Cursor, he opens the Sackbots Microchip Brain and places the mysterious space microchip inside it.

Immediately, a pair of round blue eyes pop up on the Sackbots previously empty wooden face, with some glitching.  No other features appear.

""Ah yes!  Wonderful idea!  Hello new friend, can you hear me?""  The Sackbot jumps in surprise at the narrative voice, but nods a yes.

""Can you tell us what happened to you?""  The Sackbot thinks and shakes its head, ""no"".  

""No? Well, then perhaps we should just start, with your name, can you tell us that?""

The Sackbot thinks again, narrowing its solid blue eyes and says, with a question,

""I...am...Astro-Bot?""

gaming,Idea: Ranking games by their devs,"This is an idea I've had for a month or two now, and I can't imagine I'm the first person to suggest something like this:

People want to be able to experience works of art made by artists they like.  But with video games, the art in question is being developed by potentially hundreds or thousands of people, and it's harder to ascribe authorship to any one person.  Yes, AAA gaming still has the rare Hideo Kojima or Sam Lake, but it's more common for people to follow game companies- which is fine in the short term, but once enough developers leave or get laid off, it turns into the Studio of Theseus.  And all the while, the big publishers want us to focus on the franchise itself rather than the people behind it.

So what if you could keep track of all the individual game devs from project to project?  My idea here is a website that would keep track of games and their devs, and be able to compare them based on how many devs are shared.  So for instance you'd be able to select Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, and find out that they shared (wild guess) 85% of the same devs.  The most obvious challenge is how much weight you give to certain devs, since a game's director is probably more responsible for its vision then, say, a guy who modelled some of the enemy bicycles.  I know basically nothing about how responsibility is divided up within a studio, but just for example you could have the director given 25% of the credit, the department heads another 25%, and the remainder split among everyone else.

I feel like a lot of people would have the same kinds of problems with this that they do with systems like RottenTomatoes, but respect for artistic vision in AAA gaming is in such dire straits, I'd think any version of this would be an improvement.",MiloHawkins,1hcn5np,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,2024-12-12 15:10:54,0,0.33,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcn5np
