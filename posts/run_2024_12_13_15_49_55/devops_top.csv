devops,[Humor] A Company Asks me to Rate my tech Skills on a 1-5 Scale... So I Gave Them an 8,"**I know it's not the smartest thing I could have done, but it came straight from the heart.**

So during a recent job hunt, I received a pptx file from a company asking me to rate my skills in various technologies on a scale from 1 to 5, **plus specify the exact versions I’ve worked with for +30 diff technologies.**

Yeah, you read that right: They’re expecting me to say, *“I’m a level 3.74 at Python version 3.10.2”* or something equally ridiculous.

Anyway, I filled out their form, but not the way they wanted. I just wrote something like:

**Skill Level:** 8 (out of 5!)  
**Version:** “INDIFFERENT""

Maybe it’s unprofessional, but you know what’s also unprofessional?

Trying to quantify my entire skill set with arbitrary numbers **like I’m a damn Pokémon card stat** lol.

Maybe they have their reasons for doing what they do, but I didn’t want to take part in a process like that, which is why I responded the way I did.  


I hope you’ll (and they) take it the way I do, with a sense of humor.

devops,Is This CI/CD Pipeline Setup for React Frontend and .NET Backend Feasible?,"I’m planning to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for automating the deployment of a **React frontend** and **.NET backend** to IIS servers for development and staging environments. I’ve outlined the workflow below and would love your input on whether this is feasible or if there are any potential pitfalls I should address.

# Proposed Setup

1. **Repositories:**
   * **Frontend:** React codebase with `dev` and `staging` branches.
   * **Backend:** .NET codebase with `dev` and `staging` branches.
2. **Environments:**
   * **Development:** Hosted on IIS, accessible via `http://dev.example.com`.
   * **Staging:** Hosted on IIS, accessible via `http://staging.example.com`.
3. **Pipeline Workflow:**
   * **Triggers:** Push to `dev` or `staging` branches in the frontend repository triggers the pipeline. It fetches the corresponding branch from the backend repository to keep both in sync.
   * **Builds:**
      * **Frontend:** Runs `npm install`, builds the app, and deploys static files to IIS.
      * **Backend:** Runs `.NET restore`, builds the project, and deploys compiled output to IIS.
   * **Deployments:** Artifacts are deployed to IIS directories:
      * Frontend: `C:/inetpub/wwwroot/dev/frontend` &amp; `C:/inetpub/wwwroot/staging/frontend`.
      * Backend: `C:/inetpub/wwwroot/dev/backend` &amp; `C:/inetpub/wwwroot/staging/backend`.
   * **Monitoring:** Post-deployment notifications and logs for debugging failed builds.
4. **Jenkins Pipeline Design:**
   * Parallel stages for frontend and backend to optimize time.
   * Environment variables for repository URLs, branch names, and deployment paths.

# My Questions:

1. Is syncing both repositories in the same pipeline a good practice, or should I create separate pipelines for frontend and backend?
2. Are there any better approaches for automating deployments to IIS servers?
3. Would there be issues with this setup in handling branch-specific environments (`dev` and `staging`)?
4. Is this really possible? I haven’t worked on Jenkins before, so I’m not sure if this workflow is achievable.

devops,"Visual Studio 2022, C#, multiple defines seem to negate..... at least on GitHub windows-2022 runner...","This is a really weird one, folks here might have some thoughts/interest.  

If you define the same conditional compilation symbol twice, Visual Studio will revert to default settings.  Haven't tried pinning this to a particular version, just hit us a few hours ago.

Our symptom was that we rely on conditionals to control the URL's the product connects to, and the most recent release builds were connecting to the dev host.  MSBuild was using the correct build configuration yet the code was building things that shouldn't build in this configuration .  

To further verify , we 'broke' debug build by introducing a bug inside an #if so that we could be absolutely certain that the wrong defines were applied, and sure enough our 'GOLIVE' was building Debug code.

I noticed duplicate defines when reviewing in VS project properties, the lead dev cleaned and confirmed this fixes the issue.  In our specific case the apparent culprit was checked in directory.build.props files having the same &lt;DefineConstants&gt; values as the .csproj files.  Removing the &lt;DefineConstants&gt; from directory.build.props files resulted in correct build.

It's entirely possible that there is some other root cause, we're in the middle of a regulatory compliance cycle so no time to dig any further..
