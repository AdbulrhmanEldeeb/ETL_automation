My name is Nicholas, I am 18 years old and I live in England. I'm looking for people who want to learn, share knowledge and work on projects together. I am open to communicate with people from anywhere in the world, but it would be great if it was mostly people from England, as I would like to be able to meet in person in the future.

I'm learning Python and want to improve my skills with others who already know a bit of the language. My goal is to create projects, share experiences and grow together.

Besides Python, I am also interested in Machine Learning and am looking for people who want to get into this field or are already involved in it to work together on projects and share knowledge. I also want to learn and discuss statistics - would be happy if someone joins.

If anyone is interested in Frontend or Backend (e.g. Flask), that's welcome too. This will give us the opportunity to create quality web interfaces for our projects.

I would also like to add that I am not a native English speaker, and by working in this community I aim to improve my spoken English. I am open to communication, and I think it will help all of us to learn and grow together!

I plan to use Discord for communication and collaboration, so if you want to improve your skills in Python, Machine Learning, Flask or statistics, we'd be happy to work together!

If you're interested, drop me a line in the comments or private messages. I would be glad to meet you and start working on projects together!

learnprogramming,How to decide folder structure / architecture for a project to scale?,"Hello all, 

I'm a Backend Developer and trying to do some basic projects I've seen in [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects) with Typescript/Node.

Every time I start a project, I know what I can do to handle the program's logic flow. For example, I have to take arguments from the user from the CLI, transfer these arguments to the Business logic, and then transfer the data to the database/write them on a file. I usually approach it like the classical structure: 

    src
    -- config
    -- models
    -- services
    -- utils
    index.ts 

The thing is, I don't know how to separate these logics to different services/ managers/ utilities/ functions etc. How can I learn this? Most of the project tutorials just simply says ""I'll create the ExpenseService"" but doesn't tell you why it's a service or a manager. God, I can't even seperate what's a manager and what's a service.

I can't even create a folder structure, and the more I think about it, the more complex it gets. If you read this far, thanks in advance.

learnprogramming,"5 years of experience, 4 months without a job, anxiety issues, and gaps in modern technologies ‚Äì what should I do next?","Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm facing a dilemma and need your advice. I have 5 years of experience as a full-stack developer, primarily in a small company where I was the sole programmer. I built websites (with custom CMS), CRM applications, and e-commerce systems from scratch. The main technologies I worked with were HTML, CSS, JS (formerly jQuery), GSAP, PHP, and MySQL. I would receive designs (from Figma/Adobe) and client requirements, and then complete the project from start to finish.

However, for the past 4 months, I‚Äôve been unemployed, and I suffer from anxiety, which adds a lot of stress. On top of that, programming is my passion, and I deeply miss it. The issue is that I never chased higher salaries, I just loved the work itself. Now I realize that technology has advanced, and I feel like I‚Äôm falling behind. I don‚Äôt have experience with tools like¬†**React, Laravel, Next.js, Docker, Kubernetes**¬†‚Äì and I‚Äôve never even used¬†**GitHub**. In my previous job, I worked alone, handling everything from code to deployment (FTP), and I did all my local work on my own computer using¬†**XAMPP**¬†instead of a proper Git or CI/CD workflow. Now I see that focusing on performance over learning new tools was a mistake.

**My questions:**

1. **What should I do next?**¬†I‚Äôm lacking motivation and don‚Äôt know which path to take. Should I focus on learning¬†**React**? Although I‚Äôve done full-stack projects in the past, I don‚Äôt feel confident about keeping up with both frontend and backend simultaneously. I‚Äôve always learned through practical experience ‚Äì solving tasks rather than focusing on theory ‚Äì and I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt perform well in technical interviews where they test theoretical knowledge. This is especially scary since I‚Äôve never been through a formal job interview before.
2. **Will 4 months off cause me to forget everything I know?**¬†I feel like as I try to catch up on new frontend topics (like JS), I‚Äôm losing touch with backend skills (PHP). Is this just an illusion, or can you actually lose skills that fast?
3. **How should I structure my learning?**¬†I tend to be a perfectionist and have trouble knowing when to move on to the next topic. I feel like I can‚Äôt master both the frontend (React) and backend (PHP/Laravel) at the same time. I want to focus on frontend right now, but in the future, I still dream of building full applications from A to Z, as I‚Äôve done in the past. However, with the current pressure to learn frameworks, I‚Äôm not sure how to manage both. How should I plan my learning for the next 3 months to maximize my chances on the job market?
4. **Has anyone been in a similar situation?**¬†How did you deal with job gaps, stress, and catching up on modern technologies? Is my perfectionism slowing me down, or is it actually a good strategy?

# My Experience:

**Frontend:**¬†HTML, CSS (no experience with SASS/LESS, used Tailwind once but found it simple), jQuery, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Swiper, JS (DOM manipulation, form validation, handling JSON returned from PHP, animations).

**Backend:**¬†PHP (no frameworks, mainly CRUD operations, database/file handling, generating PDFs, processing Excel data, managing user roles, handling forms and sending emails, payment gateway integration, API integration), MySQL (database design, query optimization, indexing).

**What I‚Äôve done:**¬†Built websites, CMS systems, CRM apps, applications with payment gateways (PayU, parcel locker integration), PDF generation, database management, API creation.

**Concerns:**¬†I‚Äôm afraid that lacking modern technologies in my CV makes me unattractive in the current job market, and my anxiety only amplifies those concerns. Should I apply for jobs even if I don‚Äôt meet all the requirements? Or should I focus on catching up with new skills first? I feel stuck because I‚Äôve never been through a recruitment process, and that scares me.
