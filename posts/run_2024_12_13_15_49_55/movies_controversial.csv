movies,Why I'm Frustrated with the Coyote Vs. Acme Crowd,"It’s not just about the fact that Coyote Vs. Acme is likely lost forever—that’s frustrating, yes—but what really annoys me is how some people keep reacting to *The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* as if Warner Bros. is releasing it. They're complaining that *this* movie is coming to theaters while Coyote Vs. Acme isn’t, and it’s honestly infuriating.  

Let me break this down for you:  

1. **Warner Bros. is NOT releasing this movie.** It was sold to an indie distributor. If it hadn’t been bought, it might have suffered the same fate as Coyote Vs. Acme. Thanks to this sale, it’s now getting a theatrical release, but that’s not because of WB.  


2. **This is a traditionally animated Western film in theaters!** Let’s be real—these movies don’t usually do well at the box office. Judging by the marketing's view counts, it’s probably heading toward being a flop unless it gets serious support soon. Releasing the trailer on the same day as the Game Awards? Not the best move. But instead of helping this film succeed, some people are whining about Coyote Vs. Acme. You’re not helping.  


3. **This movie has had a rough journey.** It started as an HBO Max exclusive during the pandemic, set to eventually air on Cartoon Network. Then production was halted during the WB Discovery merger and David Zaslav’s infamous tax write-off spree. Only after being sold did work resume, and now it’s finally getting a theatrical release. It had its premiere during the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and was extremely positively received. It is also the first real original Looney Tunes movie on the big screen. It's not a short. It's not a collection of shorts. It's a full-length, fully animated movie with an original story.


So, to all those targeting this film: Stop complaining about how a movie you didn’t even know or care about didn’t get released for a second. Instead, show some support for a movie that actually *did* survive against all odds. This could’ve easily been lost media too.  


If you actually care about what’s happening at Warner Bros. Discovery—or even about movies like Coyote Vs. Acme—then PROVE IT. Support The Day the Earth Blew Up. This is your chance to send a message.

Here's the trailer if you haven't seen it:

movies,"With 2024 almost over, what are your top 3 movies of the year?","Mine:

1. The Substance (very fun and extra points for originality)

2. Alien: Romulus (also very fun)

- Anora (admittedly I didn't really get this one but it's a humongous emotional roller coaster that I think again about from time to time)

- The First Omen (refreshing to see evil Christians in a horror movie)

- The Wild Robot (heartwarming and a surprise from DreamWorks)

- Robot Dreams (quite relatable, teaches a good lesson)

movies,Dumbest decisions that unravelled entire movie plots? ,"The butterfly effect is an interesting concept when seen depicted on screen: the idea that a single seemingly insignificant decision can cause a ripple effect leading to a massive consequence. In film, a lot of the time this is usually what causes a downfall, especially in the crime genre. Also usually in the crime genre, it’s usually because of extraordinarily dumb decisions that spark a chain reaction. So what are some of the best examples of dumb decisions that led to an unraveling of a films plot? 

Though there’s a multitude of reasons that added up to cause its downfall, one of my favourites is Artie Piscano’s decision to keep a ledger of his travels to and from Las Vegas despite being specifically told not to. On the one hand it’s pointed out no one could have possibly known about the bug in the store that captured him loudly and recklessly announcing that he had the ledger, especially given that the bug wasn’t even there in relation to the skim, but on the other hand Artie was told very pointedly do not keep a ledger and he still did because the bosses knew what it’d cause if it was ever discovered. Sure enough, at the conclusion of the movie as well as the other points converging the ledger is the silver bullet the FBI needs to sink the whole thing.

movies,28 Weeks Later: 2 hours 27 minute walk to chopper pick up point,"I'm re-watching 28 Weeks later and after the outbreak, Sgt Doyle is trying to save the kids and a handful of red shirts. Chopper pilot Flynn tells Sgt Doyle that the napalm attack will drop in four minutes. He then tells him to make his way to Regent's Park as he can land there.  
Regents Park is a two and a half hour walk from Canary Wharf. And London has so much parkland that the city is technically classed as a forest so I'm sure he could have found a closer spot to play Choplifter.  
Lol, live update while I watch.  
After the pickup in Regent's Park is a no go due to them being swarmed by infected, Flynn then tells Doyle he needs to get to Wembley Stadium . . . which is another 2 hour 50 minute walk :)

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 2 - Northern Ireland,"Hello there,

I think an introduction to what I'm doing here is no longer necessary after such a long time, so I'd rather start with the fact that I would like to announce an earlier winner - a winner from a country that is very close to my heart, not least because of the current situation: At least according to your votes, ***Тіні забутих предків*** (engl.: *Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors*) is the favorite movie set in Ukraine. So just before the end, a film from the 60s lands [on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) once again.

When I realise that I won't be drawing your attention to this list so often anymore, I'm getting a little wistful. Even if the watchthrough is still to come, my Reddit journey through the filmed Europe is slowly coming to an end... But what an end it is! To be honest, the UK, a country made up of several countries, is actually giving me a bit of a headache. Yesterday we found the first contender for your favorite movie set in UK, when we took a look at movies set in England. But while in the case of England it is strange that it should be a country and at the same time part of a country, its status as a country is in the end comparatively undisputed... and by that I mean the comparison with **Northern Ireland**, which you can read about on Wikipedia after all:

&gt;**Northern Ireland** (Irish: *Tuaisceart Éireann* \[ˈt̪ˠuəʃcəɾˠt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ\] Ulster Scots: *Norlin Airlann*) is a part of the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland that is variously described as a country, province or region.

As an outsider, I just want to shout out: ‘Jeez, finally decide on something!' But to keep the peace and because I'm going to declare a UK winner at the end anyway, I'll leave it that way. But I'll also keep to the usual rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Mother! As interesting a movie as I've ever seen. I thought it really showed of the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence. How did you view this movie?,"I went into Mother! knowing absolutely nothing about it other than it starred Jennifer Lawrence. I watched it cold. I thought to myself Jennifer Lawrence is everywhere on social media, TV interviews, Insta Reels, and of course movies.  I thought to myself I will know if it is a good movie or not base on whether or not I become absorbed in it and forget that it's Jlaw acting in it. Well about a tenth of the way through I realized she was completely absorbed by the role. And the weirder the movie got the more she, the actress, disappeared into it. At first, as things got more and more out of hand, I thought it could turn out to be a weird dark comedy. But things never stopped getting out of hand. Every time I thought it had gone too far, it went even further. It literally took me to the very end to figure out what was going on and even then I had missed a lot of the message. I can tell I liked it and it was a good movie because I'm still thinking about it. Man what a ride it was! I'm dying to hear other people's thoughts and reactions to this movie.

Edit: Interesting. This appears to be a movie one either loves or hates. Very little middle ground. The vast majority of movies are unable to generate this kind of response - creating such a divide. That says something. Most movies I watch are just diversions, forgotten about the next day like a finished comic strip. This one lingers, generating strong feelings one way or another. That seems to me one of the defining qualities of art. So, if nothing else this movie is art.

movies,What over-30-year-old movie's quality have you come to appreciate greatly over most made in the last 30?,"I watched the original The Wizard of Oz the other day and hadn't seen it in a while, and, now that I'm much older, was just absolutely in awe at the acting, casting, production quality, set designs, script, camera work, the fact that it not only had color in a 1939 film, but the use of it was better than most movies (for example, a horse that changed colors, ruby red shoes, changing from B/W to color, yellow brick road, green witch, etc.), the fact that it was also a musical... and so on.  I was blown away that it *didn't* get best picture that year (it lost to Gone With The Wind, which I have not yet seen, but based on what I have seen of it, seems wild that it beat TWOO).  

It's no wonder it's a classic and can still be watched to this day and loved.  The true effort and creativity (originality) that went into it is almost unfathomable.  This is also considering the resources and technology (or lack thereof) they had at the time to make such a film.  I miss it as films today seem so low-effort, and are all effects and shock value (which isn't inherently a bad thing, but considering some of the best movies I've ever seen had little to none, it says a lot) with little substance and poorly put together.

movies,Nickel Boys review,"Nickel Boys: 

Boy oh boy, where do I begin. They told RaMell Ross that he wouldn’t pull this off, that people wouldn’t adapt to the style. Well I’m here to tell you, they were dead wrong. Nickel Boys is creatively astounding. Movies that are so unique don’t come around often and this is unique with a capital U. 

The cinematography is the obvious place to start here. This is an experiment that passes with flying colors. Every frame will be burned into your brain that you’ll see them when you close your eyes. This camera work is like nothing I’ve seen ever seen before and it’s executed to sheer perfection. 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure detail and effort that pays off massively. Don’t take your eyes off the screen cause not a single frame can be missed. Nickel Boys is a vision of artistic excellence. 

Onto the acting. Credit to all the actors and actresses involved cause they were all in danger of being over shadowed by the creative choices made, but man oh man do they hold their own. Pure emotion on display. A gripping but grounded tale. 

RaMell Ross is cinema’s Einstein. Everything about Nickel Boys is innovative and inspired, a truly staggering cinematic achievement. I felt like I was witnessing cinema history… I’m not saying it’s for everyone and Nickel Boys is a movie that will inevitably divide audiences. That said I think this movie is generational, and you can say I’m taking the bait but I have never witnessed something on this scale before and I’m deeply elated with what I have seen.

I have lost count of the number of time I've heard charaters who supposedly speak spanish have horrible accents.

He obviously worked hard to learn the language, but you can tell he's not a native speaker. I've always wondered if the was the case for other languages?

movies,Early 90sish movie help,"I think it's 90s, could be late 80s. Only saw the intro while waiting at an appointment.

Starts off with a guy robbing a small town bank. When he leaves he makes a slick getaway to his truck a few blocks away. He finally gets in his pick up truck, where he removes a fake beard and moustache, his trucker hat and vest. He might of removed some stuff while walking to the truck (can't fully remember).

It then goes to two boys who are hanging outside their place with three Latino kids. One is a young girl who doesn't talk. The Latino kids parents arrive home and those three kids leave. Then the robber guy almost runs into the two young boys and yells at them, and their mom says hey watch it.

Robber guy goes in his apartment/house and looks for a place to hide his money. He looks in the freezer and various other spots before eyeballing a little attic thing in the ceiling. That's all I saw. It's buuuugging me. Robber dude looked a little like Steve Buschemi.

movies,Den of Thieves is a great heist movie,"I get why people call it Heat for dirtbags, and that's part of the film's charm. I also think it's a great heist movie that stands strong on its own terms.

Here are a few things I love about it:

\- Gerard Butler's Big Nick eats a donut from a crime after his wife kicks him out.

\- The movie does a great job at highlighting how much the criminals have to lose if they fail (50 Cent's character especially).

\- The heist sequence mines tension out of the simplest moments, such as cops asking the criminals (who are posing as cops) for ID. It shows that bureaucratic procedures can be just as nail-biting as gunfights. 

\-Butler's character follows Pablo Schneider's to a gun range and they show off their shooting skills to each other. After Schneider shows up in Butler's apartment, smiles, and walks out. It's a fun way of showing that they're on to each other.

  \- It recreates the Heat diner scene but moves it to a BBQ joint, but instead of having cops and robbers have meaningful conversations about life, they just antagonize each other.

\- The guns are very loud and the bullets are piercing, which is effective in highlighting the danger of firearms.",WorldsBestWrestling,1hcw2h7,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,2024-12-12 21:35:11,23,0.68,23,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcw2h7

movies,Sing Sing review ,"Sing Sing: 

Now that’s how you make a movie. A completely grounded script that makes you feel emotions on such a deep level that didn’t know was possible from a movie. You can feel the tension in scenes like watching a caged tiger pace up and down staring at you. 

Colman Domingo puts in the performance of a century. The subtleness of his actions, to his breaking point in the movie. He goes to lengths that are completely elegant and alluring. His character work here is truly groundbreaking, like I said when his character reaches that breaking point you feel it all, everything his character is feeling you feel so powerfully. Clarence Maclin does supporting acting and then some. He makes you feel uneasy with the way he walks and his facial expressions but you always feel there’s something underneath the hard exterior. A perfect portrayal of character that’s desperate to protect himself from where he is. I forgot I was watching actors on a screen, everyone totally disappears in to their roles. 

The camera work here is something to behold. The hand held shots are exquisitely displayed. The cinematography like an artists gallery on display. The editing as well is of the highest quality. The score like a melodic symphony that graces your ears. The true essence of the dialogue will leave you hooked on every sentence, every word. 

From its captivating opening to its heart lifting end this movie will you make your heart and soul rise from your body. Everything is orchestrated to perfection. Well and truly revolutionary on all levels.

Particularly the scene talking to his brother at the bar. I was on a binge last year of his filmography, and I was blown away by I Love Liza as id never seen it before. Such a raw story, raw emotion, he portrayed something perfectly, albeit something I haven't been through and would never want to (as someone who suffers severe depression and is a lover I think losing a lover to suicide would be the hardest thing I could ever imagine). Although I've only watched it maybe twice total now I would consider it a comfort film for me now (is that fucked up?). The sniffing gasoline is both sad and hilarious at the same time, which I think it's intended to be and very well done. I don't want to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.. but when he grabs that pillow I have never felt a gut punch in a movie as hard as that.

movies,The Most 80's 80's Movie,"Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. 

  
I figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. 

  
So, for example....

  
Back To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. 

  
Top Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks ""80s""

  
But Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there.

movies,"Depictions that were considered historically or scientifically accurate at the time, but not anymore due to later discoveries","Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.

For example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the Titanic sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the James Cameron movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.

The public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of Jurassic Park . The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.

movies,"The filmmakers who are taking inspirations from ""Die Hard"" seems to be forgetting something, especially with regards to the main character.","I have seen the trailer ""Cleaner"" starring Daisy Ridley and it seems that the filmmakers have taken cues from the film ""Die Hard"". However, I've noticed something when others are taking inspirations from the said film. John McLane is basically a normal cop who is just trying to fix his marriage to his wife who is working in the building that he came in. When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beats some of the bad guys, but he's hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he's gonna die but he's afraid of it). These are the reasons why I loved this character. He's vulnerable but he's determined to his job especially when he has to save his wife.

movies,If you had to say... who is the greatest actor of all time and why?,"I have watched thousands upon thousands of movies in my years. All genres of all decades. I've thought about this a lot, and I'll give my answer from a position of being a self-proclaimed ""movie connoisseur"".

There's hundreds of amazing actors that have done incredible works, but when it comes to picking a ""best"" I had to do a lot of sifting and made some very difficult choices of dropping the top players.

I won't give this accolade to anyone purely based on their merits or personal successes in the film industry. I don't how care how big their award closet is or how many top-grossing films they starred in. Although awards correlate with great acting, they are in no way indicative of who the greatest actor is in my humble opinion. 

There's good actors, great actors, and incredible ones. Then there's actors that seem to transcend acting in a movie and literally become the characters (and I'm not just talking about method acting). I'm talking about actors that have you convinced you're not watching a script come to life, but instead your watching someone's life.

I believe it is a toss up between these 2. My first pick is Daniel Day Lewis. When I watched him in The Phantom Thread, I was convinced he must be playing himself because there's no way thats an actor pretending to be someone else. Then I saw him in Gangs Of New York and ofcourse my favorite movie, There Will Be Blood. Completely different characters and each felt like they  were played by different actors. Given his reputation I'm sure it's no surprise to many that hes a contender to be one of if not the best actor ever and he deserves that recognition.

The second I'm sure will be very controversial to many, especially given the hundreds of names of big actors. I'm sorry, but it has to be Robin Williams. Yes, I said Robin Williams.

If you've ever seen one of his movies (or if you haven't seen one in a long time), I can assure you that you'll see what I mean and where I'm coming from. Every movie Robin is in feels like someone just bought a camera and filmed his life for a while.

Nothing felt acted, every word feels lived. Every action is heart-felt.
Look into his eyes as he speaks. It's almost impossible to believe that he wasn't that character, and wasn't living in that scenario.

movies,What do you think happens next?,"What are some of your theories that happens next after the movie is over? This could be for canned sequels or movies that ended but still seemingly have more to the story.

For example, after The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Spidey gets back to it. Harry is still crippled, so he hires Spencer Smythe to help him with Oscorps and on the side they plot to take down Spidey. Harry recruits other villains while recovering and eventually takes the helm of the Sinister 6.

After Alex Garland’s Civil War, Jessie follows in the path of Lee. She gets pretty big and Joel and her go around continuing their job. Joel recognizes he harbors resentment for Jessie basically getting Lee killed and leaves her on her own. Without overhead she gets into more compromised situations taking great shots but ultimately dies young before the war ends.

Those are my examples, I’d like to hear yours. It doesn’t have to anything elaborate or good for that matter.

Are we to expect more of this? Old films run through an AI sharpening filter that's so obvious that some scenes look like those DeepDream samples we saw a few years back? And then they call it ""remastered for cinema""?

Didn't know it was AI upscaled when I booked the tickets, and I'm sure others were the same way.

movies,Why do movies don't show real props and processes of elaborate things?,"I know the title is a bit confusing but I don't really know how to frame it. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, but I don't know where else to ask it.

What I'm referring to is things like in the Spider-Man movies. The way for the mask to look so perfectly fitting when Peter is using it, is by using a some sort of plastic mold in the front, so that it has the perfectly round shape on top, the straight shape on the sides without the ears popping out, and the chin shape at the bottom. However, in all movies with all 3 spidermen, whenever they take off the mask or whenever the mask is shown separately, it doesn't have that, it just shows the mask as if it was just the fabric, with no shape. Also, the way that the mask fits so perfectly with the suit and doesn't look separated at all is that it really isn't separate, the whole suit is one piece. However, in the movies they show it as if it were separate parts like the mask, the torso, the gloves, and even the the feet as if they were boots.

And what I said about processes, what comes to mind is hair, mostly for men. A lot of times there are actors who in a film have a hairstyle that clearly requires things like hairdryer and product, but according to the movie, the hair just naturally is like that by just drying it with a towel. One example that comes to mind (even though it is in a show and not a movie) Harvey Specter in Suits. Another thing is that an actor has his hair styled a certain way, and then puts on a baseball cap or does a lot of physical activity or gets his hair wet either because of rain or by falling in water, and after that, the hair is still the same. That's literally impossible. And I know a lot of people are going to say ""duh, it's a movie, it's not real"", and I know that, but I think a bit of realism would be appreciated by some.

This is just something that I have been curious about for a long time.",santivega,1hcr93z,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,2024-12-12 18:08:55,0,0.22,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hcr93z

movies,Kubo and the Two Strings is an unbelievable achievement in filmmaking ,"Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika – the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can’t believe this movie is real. I’m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.

Stop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of “Chicken Run” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit” (which I love, btw) – we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that’s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo’s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)

Also stop motion characters are usually dressed in tight clothes and have steady hairdos to make them easier to animate – but in Kubo, they’re using kimonos and have long hair; plus, there are animal characters and one of them is a MONKEY with fur. That means the animators had to move the kimonos and each hair strand (or the fur, in the monkey’s case) individually for every frame. And they placed that monkey in the middle of a snowstorm!!! They had to manipulate every single piece of that fur 24 times to end up with a second of footage.

Kubo is a very touching and beautiful film too, and I recommend it for its storytelling appeal as well. But I’m mostly here to praise the achievement by itself. Seriously, I couldn’t believe my eyes.",miggovortensens,1hd4puo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,2024-12-13 04:49:39,434,0.93,434,0,47,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hd4puo
