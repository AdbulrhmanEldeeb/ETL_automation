webdev,How did web advertising become so bloated?,"I'm not talking about the excessive, obnoxios ad campaigns that cover content or exceed its quantity; that's a separate issue. What I'm talking about are articles, even from known and relatively trusted (at least for reading content) websites, that become so bogged down with ads that they wind up freezing or outright crashing mobile browsers, or lagging noticably on budget or low-power PC-based devices.

I don't think their quantity alone, as annoying as it is, is enough to account for their overhead. Many just display static images or simple animations which barely take up any processing power at all once loaded from the server. What are a few dozen animated images for a device that has no trouble whatsoever running quite complex browser games? The rest are presented as videos that take up some fraction of the screen, and only two or three of these videos are onscreen and playing at any given time. Meanwhile it would take at least a dozen videos at the same resolution to match the load of a single 1440p video stream which the same devices can comfortably handle, in a browser, even after downsampling it to fit the display.

webdev,Best Headless CMS for Freelancing (editable by the client?),"Hey guys,

I'm a freelance web developer who enjoys building websites with custom code (often using Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS). I'm looking for the best headless CMS solution to allow my clients to easily edit website content.

**Current Challenge:**

* I want to maintain full control over the front-end development, avoiding limitations imposed by traditional CMSs like WordPress.
* My clients need the ability to easily edit all aspects of website content (text, images, etc.) through a user-friendly interface, not the layout or design, just the content.

**Current Considerations:**

1. **Astro with DecapCMS:** While promising, I feel it might limit client editing to specific components, and I'd prefer more granular control, also I can't seem to figure out how to customize the user interface/dashboard of the CMS.
2. **Storyblok:** I haven't used it extensively, but it seems like a strong contender.

**What are your recommendations?**

* What headless CMS do you recommend for this scenario?
* Are there any with highly customizable interfaces that I can tailor to my clients' specific needs?
* What are your experiences with client-facing CMS interfaces? Any tips or pitfalls to avoid?

I'm open to exploring other options and appreciate any insights!

Hello,
I'm primarily a Next.js developer, and I’m currently working on a large enterprise project. I'm using standalone components and signals, and everything is going well so far. However, I’m a bit confused about the best way to manage global state. In Next.js, I typically use the React Query library.
I’ve read that using services with RxJS and signals might be the recommended approach, but I’m not entirely sure if that’s accurate.

webdev,Developed a SPA to help devs temporarily deploy their javascript and css code,"**Hello Fellow Developers,**

Have you ever needed a quick way to temporarily host a JavaScript or CSS file to share with friends, colleagues, or even just for testing your own code—without having to update the entire project?

Recently, while working on a project, I faced this exact challenge. I needed to integrate custom JavaScript into a Squarespace website to ensure it met WCAG accessibility standards. Unfortunately, Squarespace didn’t offer a direct way to write custom JavaScript (or at least I couldn’t find one). However, it allowed adding custom scripts via a `&lt;script&gt;` tag.

After some research, I discovered a few platforms that let you temporarily deploy JS/CSS files. But most of them were either limited in functionality or required payment after a few uses. While I managed to resolve my issue, it made me wonder how many developers face similar obstacles.

That’s when I decided to create **CloudSyntax**. You can check it out here: [cloudsyntax.site](http://cloudsyntax.site/)

I developed it over a weekend—starting Friday night and finishing by Sunday morning. I wanted to share it immediately, but the domain was unexpectedly suspended. Now that it’s live, I’d love for you to check it out!

**What is CloudSyntax?**

* It’s a free platform (no sign-up or login required, for now).
* You can deploy any JavaScript or CSS code and receive a CloudFront link to embed directly into your projects.

I’d really appreciate your feedback—whether positive or constructive—to help improve the platform.

**Tech Stack:**  
It’s a simple project built with **Next.js**, **AWS S3**, and **CloudFront**.

Thanks, and I hope CloudSyntax proves useful to you!",Beginning-Bother4644,1hd4jmn,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd4jmn/developed_a_spa_to_help_devs_temporarily_deploy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hd4jmn/developed_a_spa_to_help_devs_temporarily_deploy/,2024-12-13 04:39:24,12,0.71,12,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1hd4jmn

webdev,"Google Pagespeed sees way outdated version of my website, and I don't know why!","Hi!  
When going to google pagespeed to analyse my website performance, I found out something very weird:

It seems like google is reading a looongly outdated version of the website. I can see this on ""color contrast complaints"" where it highlights a blue box, which is now red. It also complains about a console error which I cannot reproduce.

This change happened months ago. Checking incognito with any browser gives me up-to-date results. Doing the page speed test in a Chrome browser (locally) will provide me with a good result.

This could mean that not only Pagespeed sees outdated stuff but the search indexer as well. Nobody wants old stuff to be indexed.

It seems like Google is somehow looking at a cache proxy or something I cannot control.

Does anybody know of similar situations? What would be a way out?

This is what Google sees:

webdev,Help me estimate cost of an app,"Hi, I’m thinking to start creating a project, I’m not yet sure to begin.

Anyway, I’ve experience in creating app with small audience (internal tools) so usually the cost of hosting and databse is very limited .

The app that I’m thinking is an app that offer a service for a single city.

The user can:
- login
- register

The main feature is:
- user open the app and see a map (like map box or Google maps ) but the map is restricted to show only one city
-user can zoom in , zoom out and move around the map
- user can add a marker to a street in the map and add some information (text only for now , images upload will be added maybe in the future but I don’t want to consider it for now)
- user can see every marker created by other user
- user can add a “like” on a marker 
- user is not happy to pay for this, but the user expects that the app to be a free service payed by the city (so the user indirectly pays for this with taxes)

My question is: how much monthly it will cost to have an app like this ? Development excluded.
The things that need to be payed are:
- hosting (VPs or serverless)
- frontend (react for sure so next js or vite)
- db (with only text I don’t think the disk space of the db will be higher that 1 go for a while
- map service ( I never used for an app like this a service for map so I have no idea how to estimate it.user will zoom in,zoom out and move around the map
so I presume a lot of requests are performed under the hood.
- Auth service

For sure the app will have an initial stage with super low traffic , then later it can increase highly but not sky rocket. 
How to estimate these two stages?



The city has 15000 people in the main area, and with interland it reaches 300000 people. It isn’t expected that every user will use that , so I think 10/15% of total people can spend 30 minute every month on the app.
This when the app is in high traffic stage.

webdev,How do you work remotely in your team?,"This is a long post, I apologize in advance, but background info if required and I am not sure how to TLDR it.

I just joined a new company almost 4 months ago. In my previous company we had the following setup (prior to covid):: 

Everyone had a work computer in the office with VirtualBox running a local copy of the codebase and the DB. (we also had VirtualBox with a local copy at home after covid when we went remote for 1 year).

That local copy was a git repository connected to a BitBucket remote origin. We all worked on our own copy of the codebase because prior to 2014 we were not using git at all. We used Dreamweaver with it's checkin/checkout and we constantly were overwriting each other's changes. In comes git and we solved that problem.

This new company I am working for now, also does not use git, and we all (4 devs) just remote into the dev server and work directly on it. So far in 4 months, it has happened 4 times where someone has been ""working on a new feature"" directly on the dev server, and it would break something for some other section that QA was working on. QA all have to stop and wait for it to be fixed before they can keep working. 

On my second week there, I was told that 2 of the other devs use SFTP. So I also setup SFTP in order to at least create a local git repo to track my own changes locally. Of course now I have to sync my local with dev manually. Not ideal. So long story short, I get assigned a larger project that is a major overhaul of a single system within the application as a whole (which I am still working on today). So I setup a local development environment in docker, which involves tweaking some things in the application code in order to get it to run locally because hard coded redirects and forced https and whatnot.

Everyone asks how I am working on stuff when they can't see my changes on dev... I work on a local setup with proper version control... ""OH THAT SOUNDS COOL!!!! WE WANT SCM TOO!!! CAN WE DO THAT TOO!!!"" why yes you can. Here is a docker compose file so you can mount your local files directly into the VM, and here is the remote repo so you can clone it. Have fun.

They immediately go straight to the single devops guy who calls me and tells me that I am not authorized to have a local copy of the codebase, and is freaking out because he thinks we are running the DB locally as well. In fact, no one is authorized to have local copies. We all need to stop using it and docker immediately and work on dev directly like they have been doing for decades. After the new year we will look into setting up something else that is more inline with ""doing it the right way"".

So I apologize for overstepping my role (Senior Frontend Architect - DevOps Engineer), and let him know it was not my intention to violate any non-existent, not-in-writing, never-explained-to-me-as-a-new-hire policies or procedures, and that I just wanted to get things moving in the direction of using SCM, since it is something we need to implement.

Anyway, I thought about it for like 20 minutes after I got off the phone, and thought of the following setup:

* Everything is already running on AWS
* Setup 1 remote server with 4 user accounts, one for each dev
* Each user account has it's own copy of the codebase that is a git repo on the server that only they and a single devops user can access (in case someone leaves and has not pushed code to the origin yet we can still get into it and not lose the code). (Possibly also running a remote VSCode IDE so we don't have to configure a local one as well - not really necessary, but would be a cool feature to have).
* Each dev remotes into their account on the server and works on the server files in their account directly (no local copies).
* The account based repos connect to a self-hosted git origin, and push/pull from there
* The self-hosted git origin CI/CD pipelines into the current dev server (which now becomes staging) and the load balancer which pushes to 2 production servers.
