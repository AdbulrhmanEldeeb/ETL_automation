learnprogramming,"5 years of experience, 4 months without a job, anxiety issues, and gaps in modern technologies – what should I do next?","Hey everyone,

I’m facing a dilemma and need your advice. I have 5 years of experience as a full-stack developer, primarily in a small company where I was the sole programmer. I built websites (with custom CMS), CRM applications, and e-commerce systems from scratch. The main technologies I worked with were HTML, CSS, JS (formerly jQuery), GSAP, PHP, and MySQL. I would receive designs (from Figma/Adobe) and client requirements, and then complete the project from start to finish.

However, for the past 4 months, I’ve been unemployed, and I suffer from anxiety, which adds a lot of stress. On top of that, programming is my passion, and I deeply miss it. The issue is that I never chased higher salaries, I just loved the work itself. Now I realize that technology has advanced, and I feel like I’m falling behind. I don’t have experience with tools like **React, Laravel, Next.js, Docker, Kubernetes** – and I’ve never even used **GitHub**. In my previous job, I worked alone, handling everything from code to deployment (FTP), and I did all my local work on my own computer using **XAMPP** instead of a proper Git or CI/CD workflow. Now I see that focusing on performance over learning new tools was a mistake.

**My questions:**

1. **What should I do next?** I’m lacking motivation and don’t know which path to take. Should I focus on learning **React**? Although I’ve done full-stack projects in the past, I don’t feel confident about keeping up with both frontend and backend simultaneously. I’ve always learned through practical experience – solving tasks rather than focusing on theory – and I’m worried I won’t perform well in technical interviews where they test theoretical knowledge. This is especially scary since I’ve never been through a formal job interview before.
2. **Will 4 months off cause me to forget everything I know?** I feel like as I try to catch up on new frontend topics (like JS), I’m losing touch with backend skills (PHP). Is this just an illusion, or can you actually lose skills that fast?
3. **How should I structure my learning?** I tend to be a perfectionist and have trouble knowing when to move on to the next topic. I feel like I can’t master both the frontend (React) and backend (PHP/Laravel) at the same time. I want to focus on frontend right now, but in the future, I still dream of building full applications from A to Z, as I’ve done in the past. However, with the current pressure to learn frameworks, I’m not sure how to manage both. How should I plan my learning for the next 3 months to maximize my chances on the job market?
4. **Has anyone been in a similar situation?** How did you deal with job gaps, stress, and catching up on modern technologies? Is my perfectionism slowing me down, or is it actually a good strategy?

# My Experience:

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS (no experience with SASS/LESS, used Tailwind once but found it simple), jQuery, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Swiper, JS (DOM manipulation, form validation, handling JSON returned from PHP, animations).

**Backend:** PHP (no frameworks, mainly CRUD operations, database/file handling, generating PDFs, processing Excel data, managing user roles, handling forms and sending emails, payment gateway integration, API integration), MySQL (database design, query optimization, indexing).

**What I’ve done:** Built websites, CMS systems, CRM apps, applications with payment gateways (PayU, parcel locker integration), PDF generation, database management, API creation.

**Concerns:** I’m afraid that lacking modern technologies in my CV makes me unattractive in the current job market, and my anxiety only amplifies those concerns. Should I apply for jobs even if I don’t meet all the requirements? Or should I focus on catching up with new skills first? I feel stuck because I’ve never been through a recruitment process, and that scares me.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer!",guffcio,1hcxw6r,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcxw6r/5_years_of_experience_4_months_without_a_job/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcxw6r/5_years_of_experience_4_months_without_a_job/,2024-12-12 22:57:37,20,0.95,20,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcxw6r

I, aswell as so many other students, CANNOT learn by just typing along with whatever the professor is coding. I found it impossible to learn like that, and unfortunately 99% of my courses were taught this way. I discovered NeetCode ~2 years ago and man. IT CHANGED MY LIFE! His DSA stuff in particular is awesome. I learned so much from him and I loved the way he would explain each concept and have you try and solve the problem on your own before moving on to the next topic. 

His free stuff is great, but I really recommend you buy the full experience if you have skme extra cash to spend.

I'm learning Python and want to improve my skills with others who already know a bit of the language. My goal is to create projects, share experiences and grow together.

Besides Python, I am also interested in Machine Learning and am looking for people who want to get into this field or are already involved in it to work together on projects and share knowledge. I also want to learn and discuss statistics - would be happy if someone joins.

If anyone is interested in Frontend or Backend (e.g. Flask), that's welcome too. This will give us the opportunity to create quality web interfaces for our projects.

I would also like to add that I am not a native English speaker, and by working in this community I aim to improve my spoken English. I am open to communication, and I think it will help all of us to learn and grow together!

I plan to use Discord for communication and collaboration, so if you want to improve your skills in Python, Machine Learning, Flask or statistics, we'd be happy to work together!

If you're interested, drop me a line in the comments or private messages. I would be glad to meet you and start working on projects together!

`if (error) {`

`output.textContent = ""Error: "" + error.message;`

`console.error(""Supabase Error:"", error);`

`console.log(""Supabase Data:"", data);`

`}`

`}`



`testSupabase();`

`&lt;/script&gt;`

`&lt;/body&gt;`

learnprogramming,I'm trying to create a C fille with multiple custom headers included. The 'top' header seems to turn other headers off and their function become uncallable. How do I fix this?,"Not sure how to pin an image or a ile to th post, so here is the text:

main.c:

	int x=5;	  
int y=6;

learnprogramming,I cannot seem to understand pseudocode or the assignments given to me.,"So for context I’m about to graduate from highschool but the only thing I need is an elective which is why I chose a course that had to do with advanced applications (pretty much teaching how to use word, excel, and PowerPoint.) I competed that one and I’m now on introduction to programming. I’ve read the text book that was provided to me and have turned in 3 projects and 2 out of the 3 were wrong, the ones that I thought were good were wrong but the one I felt was off and wrong was correct. My point to this little rant is I need help understanding how to create pseudocode, I understand loops and do-while statements but I don’t understand what they exactly want from my project to be correct. For the assignment I’m working on now I need to design a program with validation functions, and it has to validate that fat grams and calories aren’t less than 0 and ensure that the number of calories entered isn’t greater than fat grams * 9. 


I completely understand that I have to do this assignment on my own and am not seeking someone to MAKE the pseudocode for me rather i am asking for someone to help me understand how to create pseudocode like this. I made a menu code that looked wrong but was correct and I received a hundred on it, but I also created a code that would mix colors and although it looked correct it was completely wrong. Help would be greatly appreciated. I would also like to say thank you for reading through this and taking the time out of your day to do so.",MartyPugPlayz,1hcqqjg,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcqqjg/i_cannot_seem_to_understand_pseudocode_or_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcqqjg/i_cannot_seem_to_understand_pseudocode_or_the/,2024-12-12 17:47:07,2,1.0,2,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcqqjg
learnprogramming,How to write great documentation for your project,"When I first started working on different projects, I really struggled with documentation. But after a lot of trial and error, I learned a lot about writing clear and helpful docs. Working on several open-source projects has also taught me just how essential good documentation is to the success of a project. So, I'd like to share with you some of the tips that have helped me improve (in the hope that they will save you the same headaches I've experienced😂):

1️⃣ **Guide first**  
Start with simple guides that focus on common use cases to help users get started quickly.

2️⃣ **Show, don’t tell**  
Use screenshots &amp; screencasts early &amp; often to visually demonstrate features.

3️⃣ **More code than text**  
Prioritize clear, working code examples over lengthy text explanations.

4️⃣ **Use plausible data**  
Craft realistic data in examples to help users better relate &amp; apply them to their projects. I use [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev)for this.

5️⃣ **Examples as stories**  
Write examples in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to ensure accuracy &amp; consistency between code &amp; visuals.

6️⃣ **The reference follows the guide**  
If an advanced user is looking for all possible options of a component, they can find them in the same place as the guide.

7️⃣ **Pages can be scanned quickly**  
Break content into short, digestible sections for quick navigation and easy reading.

8️⃣ **Features have several names**  
Use multiple terms for the same feature to improve searchability.

9️⃣ **Document features multiple times**  
Cover features in different contexts (guides, HowTos, references) to enhance discovery.

🔟 **Overview section**s  
Provide high-level summaries of feature groups to help users grasp concepts before diving into details.

1️⃣1️⃣ **Beginner mode**  
Offer a simplified view of the doc to avoid overwhelming new users.

1️⃣2️⃣ Eat your own dog food  
Regularly use your own doc to spot usability issues &amp; improve user experience.

Here's a [doc example](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/documentation.html) where I've tried to implement these ‘best practices’.

Feel free to share your tips for writing good documentation, so that we can collectively help other open-source projects!",React-admin,1hcpuq4,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcpuq4/how_to_write_great_documentation_for_your_project/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcpuq4/how_to_write_great_documentation_for_your_project/,2024-12-12 17:09:45,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hcpuq4
learnprogramming,How to import a function from a Javascript module and use it inside a HTML page?,"This is a seemingly simple problem but I don't know why I'm struggling with it. Could it be a syntax issue?

I have a HTML page and a Javascript file. I have a function inside that Javascript file that simply returns a string. I want to print that string to the console on my html page.

The html file is like this (simplified):

    &lt;html&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;script type=""module""&gt;
          import {sayHi} from ""./Robot.js"";
    
          console.log(sayHi());
       &lt;/script&gt;
     &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

And the Javascript file called Robot.js is like this:

    function sayHi(){
      console.log(""Hi"");
      return ""Hi"";
    }
    
    export sayHi;

Nothing happens. My console is blank. As you can see the sayHi function is printing to the console as well as returning a string.

I have also structured my Robot.js file like this:

    export default function sayHi(){
      console.log(""Hi"");
      return ""Hi"";
    }

But it doesn't seem to work.

Where am I going wrong? Also is it correct to surround ""sayHi"" with curly brackets within the script tag?",DrumsOfTheDragon,1hcozhq,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcozhq/how_to_import_a_function_from_a_javascript_module/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcozhq/how_to_import_a_function_from_a_javascript_module/,2024-12-12 16:32:20,2,1.0,2,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcozhq

learnprogramming,How do I make an optimized find primes before n algorithm?,"The Algorithm for finding if a number is prime is pretty easy, that one is just looping through all the numbers up to the square root of that number and checking if there’s a mod that returns 0. To find all primes up to n you just check each number before n 1 by 1 with our prime finding algo. This is O(n\^2) time. Seems easy enough. However, My friend has challenged me to possibly do it in O(n log n) or even O(n) time. I am not sure where to begin though. In order to improve the time to n log n which is what I’m aiming for, I need to find a way to either optimize the determine if prime algo, or the algo for looping through the numbers before n into log n time because both of that are O(n) right now.

The checking of the system has been automated, but I now want to automate the sending of the WhatsApp message. From what I am reading, I need to use the WhatsApp Business API, but the process seems too overkill just for the one message to one group per day.

What tool is best to use in this situation? I need something safe, that will send the message on the standby phone's number to the group. I don't think I need a business account for this. Can someone explain if there is anything that WhatsApp has for this use case?

* No client interactions, just a notification to one group
* No bot, it needs to seem like it is coming from the standby phone
* Obviously nothing that would break WhatsApp's policies (no selenium)

I have also heard that WhatsApp deprecated the functionality for sending messages on groups, so I am not sure if the WhatsApp official API would even fit my needs.

	1.	Focus exclusively on Flutter for 8-10 months to build strong app development skills.
	2.	Transition to React for web development and spend about a year mastering it.
	3.	Dive into Python, focusing heavily on AI and ML in the final year.

I’m currently dedicating 45+ hours per week to studying and building projects, so I have the time and drive to make this happen.

My questions:
	1.	Is this plan realistic for a three-year time frame?
	2.	Should I overlap learning these technologies, or stick to sequential learning as outlined?
	3.	What are some must-have resources or strategies for progressing efficiently in each of these areas?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s attempted a similar journey or has experience with these tech stacks. Any advice, roadmap tips, or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",Just_Candy_7160,1hcom4b,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcom4b/mastery_in_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcom4b/mastery_in_programming/,2024-12-12 16:16:06,1,0.67,1,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcom4b
learnprogramming,Need some guidance on web dev and AI,"I am starting my 4th semester as a comp science major soon; all I know is DSA in C/C++, mid-level Java, and Python. I have completed around 200 questions on leetcode but I've realized the importance of projects so I would like to get started on that. I am considering starting Web Dev this semester and working on some projects before the end of this sem, but I'm also considering starting some ML and GenAI for projects. I am not sure if that is the right move considering I'm in a pretty competitive college that loves giving a lot of workloads but I do want to build my resume with at least 2-3 good projects and a decent leetcode profile before starting my 5th semester so I can apply for on-campus internships and by the end of 6th sem apply for google stem 2026.

learnprogramming,From Programmer to Plumber and back to Programming ,"Hello Everyone , i moved in United States (New York) in December 2023 through green card .

I was a software developer back at my country for 4 years with a very good paying job and a very good work life balance. I had a lot of time to do also side projects and learn new things even at work which was very nice and challenging because we were always implementing new stuff and it was very fun. 

Fast forward leaving my country for US it was a hard decision but because of the experience i thought why not do it let me try and maybe i can find a job and make my dream come true to work on a high-rise building in Manhattan.

4Months i didn't find a single thing applying and applying the same thing every day and so i decided to start plumbing for prevailing wage which i waås getting good money for. Approx 1800-1900$ every week 

So i went from a programmer to a plumber . I know it's a funny stroy but you gotta do whatever to survive and anyways last month that job came to an end and i haven't found a new job yet. So basically i'm not liking United States that much anymore and i really wanna go back even though we might start a new prevailing wage job which pays a lot of money/per week. I just wanna go back at my country and do programming which i find interest on doing and have been doing so for weeks .   
  
I just wanna know what you guys think in general about this whole situtation ?  
Would you go back and quit getting a passport you have an opportunity or  work something totally different like i did on plumbing to get some money but you don't like doing it at all and you feel like do are doing it just to survive ?   
  
I really want you to put yourselves in my position and think . Thank you !
