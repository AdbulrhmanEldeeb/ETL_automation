artificial,A website that uses AI to generate appeals to insurance coverage denial,"Fighthealthinsurance.com

I'm trying to spread this site around as much as possible. It's a free website where if your insurance company denies your claim, you can upload the denial letter and it will use AI to automatically generate an appeal letter. Most claims that are appealed get approved, so making the process as simple as possible is a good way to force insurance companies to approve more claims. Please share the link to let more people know about this promising service. They are trying to scale up so that physicians can use their site to appeal in bulk. 

Just to be clear, I am not affiliated with this site in any way. I am a random guy on the internet that discovered it when searching for a productive way to channel the rage everyone is feeling towards insurance companies right now into positive change.",CiconiaBorn,1hcxvqr,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hcxvqr/a_website_that_uses_ai_to_generate_appeals_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hcxvqr/a_website_that_uses_ai_to_generate_appeals_to/,2024-12-12 22:57:01,22,0.92,22,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Project,self,t3_1hcxvqr
