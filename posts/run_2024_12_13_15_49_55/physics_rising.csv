Physics,Should I retake physics?,"Hello everyone. I really need advice and insight from others in the same situation or have gone through such.

I‚Äôm taking a physics course and it‚Äôs been a long time since I did sciences or math. I tried really hard but found that it took me so much longer to even grasp the concepts. Everything felt so overwhelming but I kept trying, watching videos, figuring out problems and trying to get help.

My problem is that despite how much effort I was putting in, I wasn‚Äôt getting results I hoped. I feel like I get stuck on almost every single question unless I‚Äôve worked on something extremely similar. It take me a whole day to get through just a couple of questions and I feel like my head is about to explode. I tried to just do a bunch of practice problems that way I would have come across multiple scenarios but it was unrealistic since it takes me so long to get through even 5 questions. I also work and had 2 other courses.

Whenever I put in effort in art classes, I end up in the high A‚Äôs so I‚Äôm not used to putting in so much effort and just barely pass. It‚Äôs frustrating. I find that on my exams, I‚Äôm almost running out of time and have to leave a bunch of questions unanswered. I always feel like if only I had more time, I could figure out but it‚Äôs not just about figuring it out but the speed at which you do.

I know I will still pass the course but if it‚Äôs going to be like this in the upper levels, then I feel like something is wrong. I genuinely put in so much effort and was almost always studying physics.

I had 2 other art type classes and I got A+‚Äôs in both by barely trying (cause most of my attention was going towards physics)

Should I retake this physics course? Is it a problem of not fully understanding the fundamentals? How will it impact me in future courses because I hope to go into engineering. If I retake it and I‚Äôm able to not only fully grasps these concepts but work at the necessary speed, will it be better for me or should I just try again and take what I‚Äôve learnt about myself and studying tactics from this intro course into the higher levels. What do you think?

Any help and insight is so very appreciated. I feel so drained but when I‚Äôm actually understanding the problems, there‚Äôs an electrifying happy feeling I get and want to do more

Physics,About Dark Matter,"So I was just glancing and reading basic things about dark matter so I don't know much about the topic but I just had a fun theory about it or potentially other stuff in space.

Is it possible that dark matter is really just normal matter that was trapped in black holes, and since with the time warping and all the mysterious stuff with black holes, could it be the dark matter is just mass trapped from the future of our existence. We can't see or directly observe the dark matter because it is now only in the dimension of time rather than what we can observe currently. So this in turn leads to us to knowing something should be there but we can't see it due to it technically being from our future and only in the dimension of time.

I don't even know if what I wrote would make sense to anyone or if there is anything like that already.",dominic75450,1hd8q34,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hd8q34/about_dark_matter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hd8q34/about_dark_matter/,2024-12-13 09:36:26,0,0.21,0,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hd8q34
Physics,Theoretically (I have no experience),"As I put in the title I have no physics experience whatsoever, but from what I understand gravity is the result of a large amount of mass applying pressure on space, again I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, but to my knowledge the core of the earth is made out of nickel and iron, assuming that that is way outs enough force on space to warp it to contain the rest of the mass that makes up our planet.
I hear that a black hole the size of a coin would have the mass of planet earth, am I too assume that‚Äôs just like if you put way more pressure due to condensed mass?
I had a theory, if a massive ball of iron and nickel puts noticeable tension on space, what would happen if we used a much denser material like uranium or radium, what if we have a bunch of large chunks of heavy elements and mashed them all together at once at high speeds, all in the same place? Could that poke a hole in space?
It seems like a black hole would have way more density than a large ball of uranium or heavier element, and those don‚Äôt seem to fully rip a hole in space do they?
Sorry just curious, thanks
