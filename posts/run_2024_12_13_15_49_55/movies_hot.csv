movies,"The filmmakers who are taking inspirations from ""Die Hard"" seems to be forgetting something, especially with regards to the main character.","I have seen the trailer ""Cleaner"" starring Daisy Ridley and it seems that the filmmakers have taken cues from the film ""Die Hard"". However, I've noticed something when others are taking inspirations from the said film. John McLane is basically a normal cop who is just trying to fix his marriage to his wife who is working in the building that he came in. When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beats some of the bad guys, but he's hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he's gonna die but he's afraid of it). These are the reasons why I loved this character. He's vulnerable but he's determined to his job especially when he has to save his wife. Films inspired by ""Die Hard"" are pretty entertaining in terms of action but they don't have the main character that we supposed to root for.",dietherman98,1hd7kq1,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd7kq1/the_filmmakers_who_are_taking_inspirations_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd7kq1/the_filmmakers_who_are_taking_inspirations_from/,2024-12-13 08:03:29,1067,0.9,1067,0,287,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hd7kq1

movies,Kubo and the Two Strings is an unbelievable achievement in filmmaking ,"Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika – the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can’t believe this movie is real. I’m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.

Stop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of “Chicken Run” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit” (which I love, btw) – we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that’s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo’s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)

Also stop motion characters are usually dressed in tight clothes and have steady hairdos to make them easier to animate – but in Kubo, they’re using kimonos and have long hair; plus, there are animal characters and one of them is a MONKEY with fur. That means the animators had to move the kimonos and each hair strand (or the fur, in the monkey’s case) individually for every frame. And they placed that monkey in the middle of a snowstorm!!! They had to manipulate every single piece of that fur 24 times to end up with a second of footage.

Kubo is a very touching and beautiful film too, and I recommend it for its storytelling appeal as well. But I’m mostly here to praise the achievement by itself. Seriously, I couldn’t believe my eyes.",miggovortensens,1hd4puo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,2024-12-13 04:49:39,435,0.93,435,0,47,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hd4puo

Are we to expect more of this? Old films run through an AI sharpening filter that's so obvious that some scenes look like those DeepDream samples we saw a few years back? And then they call it ""remastered for cinema""?

Didn't know it was AI upscaled when I booked the tickets, and I'm sure others were the same way.

movies,"Depictions that were considered historically or scientifically accurate at the time, but not anymore due to later discoveries","Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.

For example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the Titanic sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the James Cameron movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.

The public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of Jurassic Park . The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.

So what other depistions used to be considered accurate but later weren't due to new information?",AporiaParadox,1hdcfn3,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdcfn3/depictions_that_were_considered_historically_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdcfn3/depictions_that_were_considered_historically_or/,2024-12-13 13:41:20,25,0.81,25,0,72,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdcfn3

movies,I really miss Philip Seymour Hoffman,"He just absolutely brought it every time. I recently watched Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, and while not particularly a movie I enjoyed, he didn't fall short of a great performance. Particularly the scene talking to his brother at the bar. I was on a binge last year of his filmography, and I was blown away by I Love Liza as id never seen it before. Such a raw story, raw emotion, he portrayed something perfectly, albeit something I haven't been through and would never want to (as someone who suffers severe depression and is a lover I think losing a lover to suicide would be the hardest thing I could ever imagine). Although I've only watched it maybe twice total now I would consider it a comfort film for me now (is that fucked up?). The sniffing gasoline is both sad and hilarious at the same time, which I think it's intended to be and very well done. I don't want to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.. but when he grabs that pillow I have never felt a gut punch in a movie as hard as that. He was such a talent, and I am truly sad we will not see him in any new roles. A love letter to Philip: Thank you for sharing your talents, we will never stop watching.

movies,Mother! As interesting a movie as I've ever seen. I thought it really showed of the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence. How did you view this movie?,"I went into Mother! knowing absolutely nothing about it other than it starred Jennifer Lawrence. I watched it cold. I thought to myself Jennifer Lawrence is everywhere on social media, TV interviews, Insta Reels, and of course movies.  I thought to myself I will know if it is a good movie or not base on whether or not I become absorbed in it and forget that it's Jlaw acting in it. Well about a tenth of the way through I realized she was completely absorbed by the role. And the weirder the movie got the more she, the actress, disappeared into it. At first, as things got more and more out of hand, I thought it could turn out to be a weird dark comedy. But things never stopped getting out of hand. Every time I thought it had gone too far, it went even further. It literally took me to the very end to figure out what was going on and even then I had missed a lot of the message. I can tell I liked it and it was a good movie because I'm still thinking about it. Man what a ride it was! I'm dying to hear other people's thoughts and reactions to this movie.

Edit: Interesting. This appears to be a movie one either loves or hates. Very little middle ground. The vast majority of movies are unable to generate this kind of response - creating such a divide. That says something. Most movies I watch are just diversions, forgotten about the next day like a finished comic strip. This one lingers, generating strong feelings one way or another. That seems to me one of the defining qualities of art. So, if nothing else this movie is art. So many others are mere entertainment.",Zappavishnu,1hcxq51,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcxq51/mother_as_interesting_a_movie_as_ive_ever_seen_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcxq51/mother_as_interesting_a_movie_as_ive_ever_seen_i/,2024-12-12 22:49:36,28,0.64,28,0,53,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcxq51
movies,The Most 80's 80's Movie,"Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. 

  
I figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. 

  
So, for example....

  
Back To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. 

  
Top Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks ""80s""

  
But Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there.

movies,Den of Thieves is a great heist movie,"I get why people call it Heat for dirtbags, and that's part of the film's charm. I also think it's a great heist movie that stands strong on its own terms.

Here are a few things I love about it:

\- Gerard Butler's Big Nick eats a donut from a crime after his wife kicks him out.

\- The movie does a great job at highlighting how much the criminals have to lose if they fail (50 Cent's character especially).

\- The heist sequence mines tension out of the simplest moments, such as cops asking the criminals (who are posing as cops) for ID. It shows that bureaucratic procedures can be just as nail-biting as gunfights. 

\-Butler's character follows Pablo Schneider's to a gun range and they show off their shooting skills to each other. After Schneider shows up in Butler's apartment, smiles, and walks out. It's a fun way of showing that they're on to each other.

  \- It recreates the Heat diner scene but moves it to a BBQ joint, but instead of having cops and robbers have meaningful conversations about life, they just antagonize each other.

\- The guns are very loud and the bullets are piercing, which is effective in highlighting the danger of firearms.",WorldsBestWrestling,1hcw2h7,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcw2h7/den_of_thieves_is_a_great_heist_movie/,2024-12-12 21:35:11,27,0.7,27,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcw2h7

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-jc-chandor-1236083842/) (20/100):

&gt;Punishingly dull.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):

&gt;I’ve seen much worse comic-book movies than “Kraven the Hunter,” but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn’t stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That’s a dereliction of duty, but it’s one I didn’t commit on purpose. I simply hadn’t bothered to think about it.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):

&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don’t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, “Kraven the Hunter” might be very, very bad (and by “might be” I mean “almost objectively is”), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today’s audiences might consider as “good.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):

&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

&gt;Crowe’s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there’s not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it’s best that this misbegotten series quits while it’s just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

movies,Gimme All The Christmas Carols….,"I’ve watched several versions this month and it got me thinking just how many are there?

Prefer movie versions but TV is okay as well.

So far I’ve watched Scrooged, Muppet Christmas Carol, Mickey’s Christmas Carol, the Alistar Sims version and the George C. Scott version.

Just drop the title &amp; year please and where (if anywhere) its available.

movies,I’ve suddenly become obsessed with classical music - seeking your favorite compositions/ scenes featured in film. ,"As of late I've become absolutely enthralled with classical music.

movies,Nickel Boys review,"Nickel Boys: 

Boy oh boy, where do I begin. They told RaMell Ross that he wouldn’t pull this off, that people wouldn’t adapt to the style. Well I’m here to tell you, they were dead wrong. Nickel Boys is creatively astounding. Movies that are so unique don’t come around often and this is unique with a capital U. 

The cinematography is the obvious place to start here. This is an experiment that passes with flying colors. Every frame will be burned into your brain that you’ll see them when you close your eyes. This camera work is like nothing I’ve seen ever seen before and it’s executed to sheer perfection. 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure detail and effort that pays off massively. Don’t take your eyes off the screen cause not a single frame can be missed. Nickel Boys is a vision of artistic excellence. 

Onto the acting. Credit to all the actors and actresses involved cause they were all in danger of being over shadowed by the creative choices made, but man oh man do they hold their own. Pure emotion on display. A gripping but grounded tale. 

RaMell Ross is cinema’s Einstein. Everything about Nickel Boys is innovative and inspired, a truly staggering cinematic achievement. I felt like I was witnessing cinema history… I’m not saying it’s for everyone and Nickel Boys is a movie that will inevitably divide audiences. That said I think this movie is generational, and you can say I’m taking the bait but I have never witnessed something on this scale before and I’m deeply elated with what I have seen. 

Nickel Boys = 10/10

movies,What over-30-year-old movie's quality have you come to appreciate greatly over most made in the last 30?,"I watched the original The Wizard of Oz the other day and hadn't seen it in a while, and, now that I'm much older, was just absolutely in awe at the acting, casting, production quality, set designs, script, camera work, the fact that it not only had color in a 1939 film, but the use of it was better than most movies (for example, a horse that changed colors, ruby red shoes, changing from B/W to color, yellow brick road, green witch, etc.), the fact that it was also a musical... and so on.  I was blown away that it *didn't* get best picture that year (it lost to Gone With The Wind, which I have not yet seen, but based on what I have seen of it, seems wild that it beat TWOO).  

It's no wonder it's a classic and can still be watched to this day and loved.  The true effort and creativity (originality) that went into it is almost unfathomable.  This is also considering the resources and technology (or lack thereof) they had at the time to make such a film.  I miss it as films today seem so low-effort, and are all effects and shock value (which isn't inherently a bad thing, but considering some of the best movies I've ever seen had little to none, it says a lot) with little substance and poorly put together.  

What other films have this lasting effect because of the unique production quality?

It then goes to two boys who are hanging outside their place with three Latino kids. One is a young girl who doesn't talk. The Latino kids parents arrive home and those three kids leave. Then the robber guy almost runs into the two young boys and yells at them, and their mom says hey watch it.

Robber guy goes in his apartment/house and looks for a place to hide his money. He looks in the freezer and various other spots before eyeballing a little attic thing in the ceiling. That's all I saw. It's buuuugging me. Robber dude looked a little like Steve Buschemi.

movies,Dumbest decisions that unravelled entire movie plots? ,"The butterfly effect is an interesting concept when seen depicted on screen: the idea that a single seemingly insignificant decision can cause a ripple effect leading to a massive consequence. In film, a lot of the time this is usually what causes a downfall, especially in the crime genre. Also usually in the crime genre, it’s usually because of extraordinarily dumb decisions that spark a chain reaction. So what are some of the best examples of dumb decisions that led to an unraveling of a films plot? 

Though there’s a multitude of reasons that added up to cause its downfall, one of my favourites is Artie Piscano’s decision to keep a ledger of his travels to and from Las Vegas despite being specifically told not to. On the one hand it’s pointed out no one could have possibly known about the bug in the store that captured him loudly and recklessly announcing that he had the ledger, especially given that the bug wasn’t even there in relation to the skim, but on the other hand Artie was told very pointedly do not keep a ledger and he still did because the bosses knew what it’d cause if it was ever discovered.

movies,Why I'm Frustrated with the Coyote Vs. Acme Crowd,"It’s not just about the fact that Coyote Vs. Acme is likely lost forever—that’s frustrating, yes—but what really annoys me is how some people keep reacting to *The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* as if Warner Bros. is releasing it. They're complaining that *this* movie is coming to theaters while Coyote Vs. Acme isn’t, and it’s honestly infuriating.  

Let me break this down for you:  

1. **Warner Bros. is NOT releasing this movie.** It was sold to an indie distributor. If it hadn’t been bought, it might have suffered the same fate as Coyote Vs. Acme. Thanks to this sale, it’s now getting a theatrical release, but that’s not because of WB.  


2. **This is a traditionally animated Western film in theaters!** Let’s be real—these movies don’t usually do well at the box office. Judging by the marketing's view counts, it’s probably heading toward being a flop unless it gets serious support soon. Releasing the trailer on the same day as the Game Awards? Not the best move. But instead of helping this film succeed, some people are whining about Coyote Vs. Acme. You’re not helping.  


3. **This movie has had a rough journey.** It started as an HBO Max exclusive during the pandemic, set to eventually air on Cartoon Network. Then production was halted during the WB Discovery merger and David Zaslav’s infamous tax write-off spree. Only after being sold did work resume, and now it’s finally getting a theatrical release. It had its premiere during the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and was extremely positively received. It is also the first real original Looney Tunes movie on the big screen. It's not a short. It's not a collection of shorts. It's a full-length, fully animated movie with an original story.


So, to all those targeting this film: Stop complaining about how a movie you didn’t even know or care about didn’t get released for a second. Instead, show some support for a movie that actually *did* survive against all odds. This could’ve easily been lost media too.  


If you actually care about what’s happening at Warner Bros. Discovery—or even about movies like Coyote Vs. Acme—then PROVE IT. Support The Day the Earth Blew Up. This is your chance to send a message.

Here's the trailer if you haven't seen it:

movies,The Wackness (2008) nails the 90s New York atmosphere. ,"If you don't know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it's worth the hour and 40 minutes.
 

First of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography.  The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. 

Most of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my view you could see Dr Squires trying to help Luke so he doesn't become him. I think the movie shows that if Luke is in the same direction he is in he will end up like Squires. Honesty Luke and Squires have the best chemistry and scenes together. And the way they written Squires wife relationship and Luke and Stephanie relationship is great.
 
It also has a great soundtrack. If you love 90s hiphop the film and actually fits in with the movie well. 

And the movie has great commentery. The movie portrays 90s New York problems well with Rudy Giuliani drug war aganist weed as a supporting part of the story. 


The only problem i have is Josh Pecks acting. I think this is one of those rare times where a character is written well but the actor isn't great. Josh Peck does more better in comedic roles and his acting isn't good in this film. I don't know how you describe it but Josh Peck has trouble portraying a pot head in this story. 


Anyway I love this film, The cinematography is great, the music is great, the writing is good, and despite Josh Pecks performance, I think everyone else did a good job.

movies,28 Weeks Later: 2 hours 27 minute walk to chopper pick up point,"I'm re-watching 28 Weeks later and after the outbreak, Sgt Doyle is trying to save the kids and a handful of red shirts. Chopper pilot Flynn tells Sgt Doyle that the napalm attack will drop in four minutes. He then tells him to make his way to Regent's Park as he can land there.  
Regents Park is a two and a half hour walk from Canary Wharf. And London has so much parkland that the city is technically classed as a forest so I'm sure he could have found a closer spot to play Choplifter.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 2 - Northern Ireland,"Hello there,

I think an introduction to what I'm doing here is no longer necessary after such a long time, so I'd rather start with the fact that I would like to announce an earlier winner - a winner from a country that is very close to my heart, not least because of the current situation: At least according to your votes, ***Тіні забутих предків*** (engl.: *Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors*) is the favorite movie set in Ukraine. So just before the end, a film from the 60s lands [on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) once again.

When I realise that I won't be drawing your attention to this list so often anymore, I'm getting a little wistful. Even if the watchthrough is still to come, my Reddit journey through the filmed Europe is slowly coming to an end... But what an end it is! To be honest, the UK, a country made up of several countries, is actually giving me a bit of a headache. Yesterday we found the first contender for your favorite movie set in UK, when we took a look at movies set in England. But while in the case of England it is strange that it should be a country and at the same time part of a country, its status as a country is in the end comparatively undisputed... and by that I mean the comparison with **Northern Ireland**, which you can read about on Wikipedia after all:

&gt;**Northern Ireland** (Irish: *Tuaisceart Éireann* \[ˈt̪ˠuəʃcəɾˠt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ\] Ulster Scots: *Norlin Airlann*) is a part of the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland that is variously described as a country, province or region.

As an outsider, I just want to shout out: ‘Jeez, finally decide on something!' But to keep the peace and because I'm going to declare a UK winner at the end anyway, I'll leave it that way. But I'll also keep to the usual rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,If you had to say... who is the greatest actor of all time and why?,"I have watched thousands upon thousands of movies in my years. All genres of all decades. I've thought about this a lot, and I'll give my answer from a position of being a self-proclaimed ""movie connoisseur"".

There's hundreds of amazing actors that have done incredible works, but when it comes to picking a ""best"" I had to do a lot of sifting and made some very difficult choices of dropping the top players.

I won't give this accolade to anyone purely based on their merits or personal successes in the film industry. I don't how care how big their award closet is or how many top-grossing films they starred in. Although awards correlate with great acting, they are in no way indicative of who the greatest actor is in my humble opinion. 

There's good actors, great actors, and incredible ones. Then there's actors that seem to transcend acting in a movie and literally become the characters (and I'm not just talking about method acting). I'm talking about actors that have you convinced you're not watching a script come to life, but instead your watching someone's life.

I believe it is a toss up between these 2. My first pick is Daniel Day Lewis. When I watched him in The Phantom Thread, I was convinced he must be playing himself because there's no way thats an actor pretending to be someone else. Then I saw him in Gangs Of New York and ofcourse my favorite movie, There Will Be Blood. Completely different characters and each felt like they  were played by different actors. Given his reputation I'm sure it's no surprise to many that hes a contender to be one of if not the best actor ever and he deserves that recognition.

The second I'm sure will be very controversial to many, especially given the hundreds of names of big actors. I'm sorry, but it has to be Robin Williams. Yes, I said Robin Williams.

If you've ever seen one of his movies (or if you haven't seen one in a long time), I can assure you that you'll see what I mean and where I'm coming from. Every movie Robin is in feels like someone just bought a camera and filmed his life for a while.

Nothing felt acted, every word feels lived. Every action is heart-felt.
Look into his eyes as he speaks. It's almost impossible to believe that he wasn't that character, and wasn't living in that scenario.

movies,Watching Dead Man (1995) and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) back-to-back is a unique experience,"*Dead Man* is an acid western in which a wounded accountant named William Blake teams up with a strange Native American man named Nobody, who happens to be a fan of the artist William Blake and believes the accountant is a vengeful reincarnation of the more famous Blake. The movie plays with western tropes, but it is mostly a somber meditation on death.

*Ghost Dog* is more modern and less bizarre, but it explores many of the same themes and features a similarly heightened reality in which a masterful modern assassin takes strong influence from the Hagakure as he works for (and then against) a bunch of old wiseguys.

They're both unconventional independent action-thrillers by Jim Jarmusch. Both feature a protagonist who acts as a personification of death, often effortlessly killing various stereotypes (cowboys, gangsters). Both films are very philosophical and artistic, but in different ways.

In addition to death and philosophy, the two films are also quite amusing. Jarmusch's dry sense of humor contrasts well with the dark plots full of murder. I like that there's nothing flashy about either movie's world. Dead Man makes the old west feel like a dirty and miserable playground for deranged weirdos, and in Ghost Dog the modern city run by gangsters looks totally mundane and unglamorous, an environment plagued by elderly has-been punks with guns.

The subdued reality of the world and its villains allows the heightened reality of the heroes to shine. There's nothing really superhuman about Blake or Ghost Dog, but the way they intensely associate themselves with death and the fatalism that breeds puts them on another level than the basic bad guys they do battle with.

After Alex Garland’s Civil War, Jessie follows in the path of Lee. She gets pretty big and Joel and her go around continuing their job. Joel recognizes he harbors resentment for Jessie basically getting Lee killed and leaves her on her own. Without overhead she gets into more compromised situations taking great shots but ultimately dies young before the war ends.

movies,Sing Sing review ,"Sing Sing: 

Now that’s how you make a movie. A completely grounded script that makes you feel emotions on such a deep level that didn’t know was possible from a movie. You can feel the tension in scenes like watching a caged tiger pace up and down staring at you. 

Colman Domingo puts in the performance of a century. The subtleness of his actions, to his breaking point in the movie. He goes to lengths that are completely elegant and alluring. His character work here is truly groundbreaking, like I said when his character reaches that breaking point you feel it all, everything his character is feeling you feel so powerfully. Clarence Maclin does supporting acting and then some. He makes you feel uneasy with the way he walks and his facial expressions but you always feel there’s something underneath the hard exterior. A perfect portrayal of character that’s desperate to protect himself from where he is. I forgot I was watching actors on a screen, everyone totally disappears in to their roles. 

The camera work here is something to behold. The hand held shots are exquisitely displayed. The cinematography like an artists gallery on display. The editing as well is of the highest quality. The score like a melodic symphony that graces your ears. The true essence of the dialogue will leave you hooked on every sentence, every word. 

From its captivating opening to its heart lifting end this movie will you make your heart and soul rise from your body. Everything is orchestrated to perfection. Well and truly revolutionary on all levels.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 1 - England,"Hello there,

since over one and a half month I'm asking you for your favorite movie in a certain european country once a day. This was very easy for me in the last round: I can't announce a winner yet, because the 24 hours aren't up yet (I'm a bit early today, as I have plans for later - yes, there is an RL outside of Reddit), so stay tuned, but all in all, Ukraine is still and hopefully will continue to be an independent country. But when it comes to today's country, it is sometimes a little difficult to understand, at least for me as an outsider.

I know, I know, Wikipedia can never be the last source, but let's take a look on it here. When it comes to the UK, it clearly says:

&gt;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.

At the same time, you can read on another article:

&gt;Since 1922, the United Kingdom has been made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales (which collectively make up Great Britain) and Northern Ireland (avoriously described as a country, province, jurisdiction or region.

Further internet research has shown that not only for me as a non-native speaker, but also for the British themselves, it is sometimes not so clear where their country begins and their state ends. Even here in the discussion group I have even read that the UK is not a country at all, then again that it is a country made up of several countries (sometimes by one and the same person). It's all quite confusing, but I think I've found a solution that I can live with.

Today we're going to start with films set in **England**. Over the next few days, we'll do the same with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On the fifth day, the respective individual winners will then compete against each other again, so that we have a winner for the UK, but also winners for the individual ‘sub-countries’. I think that's a lot of effort, but hey, even if I think the UK members should sort out once and for all whether they want to be federal states or separate countries, I can't ignore the actual situation. In return, I ask you not to ignore the following two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,A movie you have watched that is so obscure that it doesn't have an IMDb or Letterboxd or Wikipedia page,"For me, I think this has to be a weird animated Indian movie called [Icy N Spicy](https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=1340)

It was not difficult to find the [full movie on YouTube](https://youtu.be/fBf85FaYkHA?feature=shared) once I remembered the name. I am yet to re-watch, looks hilarious though

The funny thing is, I don't remember anything about the movie itself, but I remember when and where I watched it in great detail... It was aired at 12.00 PM on Sunday, July 3, 2011 on Doordarshan National (a state owned TV channel and the oldest TV channel in India). Why do I remember this? Well, I have a knack for remembering calendar dates, and July 2nd was when I first got eyeglasses. The 3rd of July was the last day of summer vacation and this movie is possibly the first movie I watched with vision glasses. I was in 5th grade and I didn't  really find the animation to be so ghastly as I do now. I believe the only animation movies I had watched at that point were Ice Age 1, Finding Nemo, Stuart Little 3, and a Ramayana adaptation from around that time.

movies,Highlander - What if Kurgan had won?  Could he really do anything?,"This is a very old movie with well know ending, so need to spoiler tag.   Don't read any further if you somehow haven't seen Highlander after 40 years.

There were lines in the movie where Ramirez (Sean Connery) warned Connor that they couldn't let The Kurgan win the prize, or mankind would enter a terrible darkness and never recover.

But what if Kurgan had beaten Connor, and won the prize?   What could he really have done to the world?  As we saw in Connor's closing comments during the ending, he became mortal.   He did say he ""knew everything"" and could basically understand everyone in the worlds feelings and intentions.

So if their worst fear came true and the Kurgan won - so what?  He is now mortal and can be killed.   How would he topple the worlds governments who were defended by massive Armies, war machines, and technology?  

The Kurgan would be the best swordsman in the world which would be meaningless in the 1980s.   He would have a great understanding of people and be able to manipulate SOME people do his bidding, but it doesn't seem like he could really surpass the level of ""local kingpin""

Any thoughts on what ""prize Kurgan"" could actually do to the world?

movies,Why do movies don't show real props and processes of elaborate things?,"I know the title is a bit confusing but I don't really know how to frame it. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, but I don't know where else to ask it.

What I'm referring to is things like in the Spider-Man movies. The way for the mask to look so perfectly fitting when Peter is using it, is by using a some sort of plastic mold in the front, so that it has the perfectly round shape on top, the straight shape on the sides without the ears popping out, and the chin shape at the bottom. However, in all movies with all 3 spidermen, whenever they take off the mask or whenever the mask is shown separately, it doesn't have that, it just shows the mask as if it was just the fabric, with no shape. Also, the way that the mask fits so perfectly with the suit and doesn't look separated at all is that it really isn't separate, the whole suit is one piece. However, in the movies they show it as if it were separate parts like the mask, the torso, the gloves, and even the the feet as if they were boots.

And what I said about processes, what comes to mind is hair, mostly for men. A lot of times there are actors who in a film have a hairstyle that clearly requires things like hairdryer and product, but according to the movie, the hair just naturally is like that by just drying it with a towel. One example that comes to mind (even though it is in a show and not a movie) Harvey Specter in Suits. Another thing is that an actor has his hair styled a certain way, and then puts on a baseball cap or does a lot of physical activity or gets his hair wet either because of rain or by falling in water, and after that, the hair is still the same. That's literally impossible. And I know a lot of people are going to say ""duh, it's a movie, it's not real"", and I know that, but I think a bit of realism would be appreciated by some.

This is just something that I have been curious about for a long time.",santivega,1hcr93z,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,2024-12-12 18:08:55,0,0.17,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hcr93z
movies,Recent movie styles/trends that you don't like? ,"I've noticed that most movies tend to become more of the same, especially this:

\- Action movie that tries to be nitty gritty? Lower the colors, make everything green/gray and film shaky hand style during the adrenaline/fight scene. During the 2000's, the movies would try to at least choreograph an admirable fight scene and the camera 's point of view would be at least steady

\- There are almost no epilogues for romantic movies. They basically roll the credits as soon the couple kiss. We don't get a moment to catch our breath or appreciate whatever is happening and boom the credits starts. The epilogues doesn't even need to be a 5 minute if you want to cheapen the budget. Just a minute or something to show what the future holds. Even the side characters doesn't really get their side plot resolved or hear about it what happened.

\- Movie intro. In the 90's en 00's, we would hear music, the introduction names start, we see the main character start their morning/life/moment and there is a minute of no talk. We just get a sense of what their life is before the main plot starts. Now it's bam, immediately start and it takes us a lot more minutes before finding out the gist and we have to remember everything because of possible plot relevance. And the title comes just before the credits roll.

\- Car riding scenes: 80's and early 90's could get away with this because the technology wasn't quite there yet: Green screen driving. Back then, they could hide this by filming in the dark and have the character sway the wheel furiously from left to right and back to indicate he/she is driving all while telling us the problem in thoughts. Nowadays they film with a green screen, especially when we see it from sideways. The scenery is also a bit blurry, giving us a stark contrast when the characters and the car itself is in crisp 4K quality. I see this style getting back more and more.

What is your thing that you don't like, that has been happening lately? I'm not asking about the main character grabbing a toast from a full breakfast spread and heading off examples.

movies,"Opinion / discussion: examples of iconic actors (and well written roles I guess) are those who only played a very small movie part, but feel like were much bigger! ","I posted this is r/television, but then thought maybe there are examples in movies too! Original post below:

For example: I was amazed to learn that Shelly Long, who played DeDe Pritchett (ex wife of Jay) in Modern Family, only appeared in 8 episodes (out of the total 250)! I really couldn’t believe it when I read that. I would have never guess that and felt like she really made such an impact that I felt she was in way more episodes.

Another example is for me is Kathy Bates who played Jo Bennett in the office for 8 episodes as the CEO of Sabre (out of 188 episode total). Or can you imagine Game of Thrones without Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo? He was only in 11 episodes out of 73. 

Obviously as the title says it’s not only the actor but also how well written te part is, but still execution is key.

How do you guys feel about this opinion? Or do you feel it’s mostly how well written it is? Do you have any other examples?

movies,Deja Vu (2006),"So I just watched this, and I'm confused about the third act.

The movie very strongly suggests that there is only one, immutable timeline in the manner of 12 Monkeys.

We learn that the main character's partner is inexplicably killed in the ferry attack. Later we see the scientists send a warning back, which is intercepted by the partner and explains why he was killed. This is one timeline then: that note was *always* there for the partner to find

When the main character himself goes back in time, everything he does is stuff that already happened. His finger prints were found all over the house because he'd *always* traveled back in time to touch stuff. The bloody tissue was on the garbage because he'd *always* gone back in time to leave it there, etc. In this scene he realizes that this has always happened this way and then... suddenly changes things?

Did I miss something, or is this a glaring plot hole? He's been trying to use his knowledge of the future to change things for half the films runtime, only to be consistently thwarted with the realization that he'd *always* done those things. His foreknowledge consistently fails him because by trying to apply it, he's just ensuring that things happen the way they already happened. So how is he able to just suddenly change things at the end? What's different about that instance?",AnAquaticOwl,1hc4jdf,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc4jdf/deja_vu_2006/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc4jdf/deja_vu_2006/,2024-12-11 21:25:40,2,0.6,2,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1hc4jdf

movies,David Lean’s “Brief Encounter” and my paradoxical experience watching “classic” films,"I have a hard time placing my genuine thoughts towards judging older films from before the 60s, mainly stuff around the Hays Code era, as a lot of them maintain a place in the film canon by having been ahead of their time, or at least timeless enough to still be watchable in 2024. Having seen Brief Encounter last night, I didn’t fall in love with it but there are some sparkingly modern filmmaking techniques and creativity that must’ve been distinct at the time. I’m thinking of shots like the dream sequence Celia’s character has when reflected in the train window, it has this ethereal quality to it with the ornate lights that would feel very fitting to a new release today, and the “madness tilt” zoom on her when she contemplates suicide after the man leaves. Plus the whole recontextualisng of the beginning is very slickly done and easy to love. However, and this may be the jaded part of refusing myself emotional attachment to it, but like lots of classic revered titles I can’t tell if I like it for the film or the filmmaking. It’s difficult to decipher where my investment in the story ends with a recognition of how ahead-of-its-time a certain film was. 

This could be a wider humbug I have when it comes to my personal assessment of films in the “canon” and at the risk of overcomplicating matters, but when they have such a long reputation and are held up in every conversation about being essential viewing and/or revolutionary, it feels like an inevitable shadow on the film as I’m watching. I’m not just watching Brief Encounter, I’m watching David Lean’s universally acclaimed 1945 classic Brief Encounter. 

If this post ends up sounding more like an overly verbose rephrasing of “letting expectations hamper my viewing experience” then apologies for that, but it’s an issue I encounter regularly whenever I dip my toes into this circle of the movie world.

movies,"After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?","After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?

Recently I watched the Indian movie ""Devara"" starring N. T. Rama Rao Jr. of RRR, and just like RRR the movie was astonishing. There's something about modern Indian movies of the last 15 years. The Aesthetic (?) is something else. I don't know any other word, because the movies are so unique. They way male characters stand on their word, the emphasis on concern for family and the community, the hero and villains' willingness to resort to cartoonish levels of violence, the preserving of women's virtues unless it's a colourful pop video in the middle and repeated fanfare when the hero appears or begins killing people. 

I always start laughing uncontrollably at these moments but I am throughly entertained! Are there any books or online articles that explain this style of filmmaking and why Indian producers believe or know this is what their audience responds to? The closest thing I can think of is like Michael Bay, but on a budget! Because I think the directors draw on a lot of elements of music videos &amp; commercials throughout the films through colour schemes, cinematography, family scenes, fight sequences and of course the pop songs. 

Are there any Hollywood movies made like these? I know Hollywood only just recognized RRR, but there must be something good about what the Indian filmmakers are doing as they show a hell of a lot more imagination and are determined to give their audiences spectacle on what is Hollywood mid-budgets.

movies,Just got done rewatching The Green Mile.,"The Green Mile is my favorite movie of all time, along with Fight Club and another Darabont/King film, The Shawshank Redemption. But what Mile has over Shawshank is the supernatural and stronger religious themes. 

I love all the characters here, with my favorite being Paul Edgecomb. His character arc and relationship with John Coffey is so sad, but also so sweet. The way he starts to believe in miracles and actually offers John a way out is such compelling character writing. As is his relationship with Brutus and Dean. 

Wild Bill is a threatening antagonist, and you truly learn to hate him. Very satisfying seeing him get what he deserves.

John Coffey is a true miracle of God. A man who heals and helps people, and who sees the good and bad in everyone on Earth. His death had me bawling like a baby, and his dialogue is some of the best in the film. His execution is my personal favorite scene in film history for how well-executed and emotional it is.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation) (100):

&gt;Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It’s all rise, but troubled and unclear. You might not buy Chalamet’s Dylan at first; I didn’t, until that Guthrie bedside scene. There is amazing bravado in this performance.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/10/bob-dylan-movie-review-a-complete-unknown/76857860007/) (3.5/4):

&gt;“A Complete Unknown” is that rare biopic that leaves you wanting to watch it again *and* go on a Spotify deep dive, and you're apt to find new respect both for Dylan as a bluesy contrarian and Chalamet as a top-shelf thespian of his generation.

[Collider](https://collider.com/a-complete-unknown-review/) (80):

&gt;James Mangold's A Complete Unknown explores the music of Bob Dylan with fantastic care and a great performance by Timothée Chalamet.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan) (70):

&gt;Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold takes his hands off the steering wheel for A Complete Unknown, resulting in a Bob Dylan biopic that takes unpredictable turns. Rather than connecting the dots between how the world influenced him (and how he influenced it in turn), the film frames his enormous musical sea changes as personal drama for his peers. It’s formally straightforward, but its focus on the characters in Dylan’s life – rather than the musician himself, played by Timothée Chalamet – turn him into an enigma, for better or worse.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-complete-unknown-bob-dylan-movie-review-b2661910.html) (60):

&gt;Despite the drip-fed reminders of contemporary history (the Cuban Missile Crisis! the Kennedy assassination! Weren’t the Sixties wild, man!), A Complete Unknown struggles to fully engage with Dylan’s relationship to that intersection between politics and music.

Written and Directed by James Mangold:

movies,Actors/Actresses who screwed up a comeback arc?,"Everyone loves a good comeback story. From sports to music and especially movies. Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, and soon probably Demi Moore and Pamela Anderson. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?

First one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.

Another example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo.

movies,"Pedro Almodóvar's style and writing doesn't translate well in English in ""The Room Next Door""","I wanted to like Pedro Almodóvar because Almodóvar was my childhood idol when I became obsessed with Cinema and I identified with his vision. His worldwide success after Todo Sobre Mi Madre was exciting because the world could see his genius. 

For years, I've been wanting to see Almodóvar cross over into English and after I got to watch ""The Room Next Door"", it might be a case of his style, his trademark, doesn't translate well into English. 

Because the way he writes and directs didn't change, it's always been slightly theatrical, big yet subtle at the same time when it comes with his writing, and in Spanish and the way Spanish actors accostumed with Almodóvar are, it works, yet in English, it's distracting. It's more wooden and stagy and some of the dialogue comes off as contrived. 

Yet I wouldn't call ""The Room Next Door"" a bad film, because of the use of colors, the direction, the way Almodóvar shoots scenes with symbolism and the importance of sets, and, of course, Tilda Swinton is excellent (as usual) as a dying woman who chooses euthanasia. She is fascinating and you can't take your eyes away from her. Julianne Moore is good, it's just, she's more of an observer, she exists to support Swinton, and as a result, her character ends up being underwritten. John Turturro shows up a few times to spout stuff about the world ending, I didn't like how forced his dialogue was.

movies,Collateral ,"

At the beginning of the movie Vincent is walking through a airport and bumps into a character played by Jason Statham.  They both drop identical briefcases and then exchange them.  We then follow Vincent on his journey but we have never revisited what Jason’s character may have been off to.  It’s provides perfect foreshadowing for a second movie loosely based on the plot of the first one (drama with drug cartels, law enforcement, litigation etc).  I always thought that Michael Mann would revisit this moment.  He could start a movie with this exact scene again and then follow Jason’s character as Vincent walks off.  Thoughts?

First of all: it's artificially long. It's only over 2 hours because of excessive slow mo and cuts. That part near the end where Patrick gets warned for stalling and then it takes like 2 minutes for him to serve was infuriating to watch.
The soundtrack is all over the place, some random electronic beatsuthat are suddenly cut off.

The characters are all extremely unlikeable. Art is a major pushover with basically no will of its own, Patrick is a nihilistic womanizer, but Tashi takes the cake.

&gt;Although not hitting us emotionally on the scale of the live action films, Kamiyama has produced a visual landscape that at times , through use of motion capture, models, and hand drawn animation do register a striking visual motif, not what we have previously associated with the cinematic efforts at Tolkein, but a world of its own merged with more allegiance to Jackson than Tolkein.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236243179/) (60):

&gt;For those who can’t get enough of Middle Earth, here’s two-plus hours of deep-cut backstory to feed your appetite, centered around a siege at the stronghold that would come to be known as Helm’s Deep (where we saw Saruman’s Orcs obliterated by Ents in “The Two Towers”).

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (80):

&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore’s original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).

[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien’s appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm’s Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we’ve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):

&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie’s greatest strength — The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson’s LotR in the best way. It’s packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):

&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from ""The War of the Rohirrim."" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that’s unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It’s hard to get mad at this movie, but it’s oh so easy to be disappointed.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):

&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson’s trilogy — few do — but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.

[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):

&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth’s famous legends.

\--------

Directed by Kenji Kamiyama

&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003), *The War of the Rohirrim* tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold Helm's Deep.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Ukraine,"Hello there,

I've been asking you for your favourite film every day for almost a month and a half now, and the journey is gradually coming to an end. Following an alphabetical order, in which the United Kingdom will soon be duly dissected, I arrived at the letter T yesterday. Today I can now announce the winner for Turkey: To be honest, I'm not familiar with ***Bir Zamanlar Anadolu’da*** (engl.: *Once Upon A Time in Anatolia*) yet, but it really s to touch the heart of this project and to provide an as entertaining as accurate look into the country.

When it comes to the next country, some would say that it is particularly important nowadays that films can offer us a real insight into the country's current condition: I'm talking about **Ukraine**. But please take note: Since *20 днів у Маріуполі* (engl.: *20 Days in Mariupol*) would actually be an obvious suggestion as a prominent documentary film, I would like to explicitly point out  what was always implicitly clear to everyone in the previous rounds, namely that documentaries are excluded from [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). Apart from that, the following two rules apply as always:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Best film series with the most unique naming sequence?,"Inspired by the trailer for 28 Years Later (in case anyone doesn’t know, a sequel to 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later). 

Off the top of my head I’d say numbers, “Franchise: Subtitle”, and Indiana Jones/Harry Potter’s “…and the…” aren’t unique. There are probably plenty of questionable ones though…. The Matrix is “franchise: subtitle” but they’ve all got “Re-“ in them, for example. The Vacations are all different, well, vacations, but they don’t feel unique to me bc they all just state the premise. If your pick is borderline include the rationale in your argument if you’d like lmao.

I’m gonna go with Linklater’s Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight. An incredible romance that you probably approach differently as you age, just as the characters do, and which leaves you questioning your idea of love at every turn.

movies,Meet the Fockers 4,"With the recent announcement of Meet the Fockers 4 being in production, I would like to share the two ideas/predictions I had for what the plot will be. My girlfriend and I love the movies so we’re really excited for this fourth installment (I literally had not watched it until last year, safe to say I loved it). Also, regardless of what the movie is about, my girlfriend had a great idea for the name: “Everything’s Focked”. I’ll start with the best prediction my girlfriend and I came up with and then I’ll throw in the second backup guess. The most likely thing that we see happening is a repeat of the first movie, but instead with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro WORKING TOGETHER to do the same thing that was done to Ben years ago. We pictured Stiller (or Greg) having a daughter, and him going through the same situation that Deniro (or Jack) was going through in the first movie. We think that either 

A.) Robert deniro will help stiller to investigate his daughters new bf with all of the gadgets and such he possesses
or 

B.) Greg realizes that he’s acting exactly like Jack, and even when he tries to stop himself, he can’t help but see the similarities (when it comes to their daughters)

The last throw away idea we had was a huge family reunion, where we see all of the aunts, uncles, and cousins from the Focker family, and they have to interact and get along with the cousins and such from the Byrnes family. Anyways, that was our ideas. Lmk what you think and whether you agree! Honestly, I think the first idea is very likely, and if it’s not done, then i think it would be a miss that they definitely should’ve taken.

movies,Was the Duke of France gay in Elizabeth (1998). ,"Hey guys I hope you all are doing well. 
I was watching Elizabeth (1998) and am confused about a particular scene.
A Duke from France who happens to be the nephew of Mary of Guise comes to England to ask the hand of Queen Elizabeth for marriage. 

She of course is reluctant because of her ongoing affair with Lord Robert. 

Then during a party, she goes to the room of the Duke and catches him in a dress. He is drunk and dressed like woman. Does this imply that he was gay ? Or is this just a lord doing lord things. 

Also, she proceeds to extend her hand to be kissed by the Duke but he is obviously embarrassed by this. He reluctantly agrees and does not even kiss it properly. 
Why ? Can men in dress not kiss the hands of a Queen ? Why was he embarrassed and so reluctant for this. 

I hope to get answers to these two questions as I'm not European and not well aware of the customs of that region.

movies,The Real Reason Landa Kills Hammersmark - Inglorious Basterds,"Landa mentions after capturing Aldo that he was a detective before the war. I think this is supposed to be a clue for us that he can figure out what happened at the bar. He sees shoes on the ground, blood from a low impact shot, knows that whoever the shoes belong to was shot low, then laid on the ground for a while. 

He sees the corpse of Wilhelm ( guy with newborn son Max) lying not far away, with no weapon, and with some of his detective work, notices that Wilhelm has been shot from a low angle with a low-caliber pistol, from the spot where the blood and shoes are. He sees the napkin which confirms that Hammersmark knew that she was killing an un-armed man with a newborn son. 

Landa has already been shown not to kill without reason, and he seems to genuinely care about some people (like Shoshanna and the soldier at the end of the movie who is killed by Aldo). I think he proves to himself that Hammersmark killed a drunk, unarmed, and fearful new father, and regardless of what comes next, decides that she deserves to die for those actions. 

When Landa is asked what happens to Hammersmark, he says she got what she deserved. I think many would assume it's because she is a traitor, but that would make him a hypocrite a few moments later when he chooses to betray the Nazi regime. I think what he really means is that she got what she deserved for killing Wilhelm.

On Reddit I’ve often seen people talk about Jenny as a villain, and watching this movie as a 31 year old - I do understand the hate. She engages in a sexual act with a man who has an intellectual disability and then bears his child and leaves him and finds him again so many times causing so much heartache. I don’t think it ever clicked to me until now how messed up it is.

How does this movie sit in 2024? I am so touched by it and love it AND feel super critical of Jenny and Forrest being a love story of sorts.

movies,"I find the score of Bresson's ""Pickpocket"" to be weirdly disconnected in mood from the action. Would value a discussion of it, or others.","What the subject says. I find the musical score of Bresson's ""Pickpocket"" to be weirdly disconnected in mood from what's happening on screen. Distractingly so. (I'm here, aren't I?)

I don't want a score to tell me what to think. But if it's there at all, it should unobtrusively underscore the action. I understand some will say that's the same thing, but I promise you it's not, at least not the way I mean it. But that's not the point of this. 

I just watched Pickpocket and the score seems weirdly at odds with the mood of the action.

Anyone else find the music oddly… buoyant?

And I can't say I've ever had this experience with another movie. There are scores I hate (Midnight Cowboy anyone?) but not because they're jarringly at right angles to the action, but because I just don't like them.

movies,La La Land’s (2016) ending sequence is one of the best uses of a no-dialogue scene in major modern film since the beginning of Up (2009),"I just finished a rewatch of La La Land and was reminded just how amazing the ending is, when Mia stumbles across Seb’s club and sees him for the first time since they parted ways all those years ago.

Despite having seen the movie before, the sequence that shows how one of them would’ve ended up unhappy if they stayed together still manages to make a strong emotional impact. In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would’ve played out in other circumstances, I can’t watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could’ve been, and ill-fated love. 

The way that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were able to convey so much emotion through just their movements and facial expressions was a testimony to their talent. Of course, the slowed down piano version of City of Stars also plays in a big role in setting the mood for this scene and is a gorgeous score. It’s hard to think of another movie that captures such a perfect balance of being bittersweet. 

I know it’s strange to compare La La Land to an animated children’s movie, but I couldn’t help but thinking about Up (2009) while rewatching the ending. The beginning of Up that shows how Carl met and lost his wife with no dialogue had people of all age groups in tears when the movie was released. These two scenes are both uniquely special in the way they’re able to convey strong emotions and make an impact on the audience while using no dialogue. 

Barring actual silent films, can anyone else think of a scene in a movie that manages to pack an emotional punch with no dialogue on the level of La La Land and Up?

movies,I have a question about “The substance” I seriously don’t this one thing. ,"If you haven’t noticed - spoiler ahead .

So when Elisabeth (Demi) is told about substance she is advise “you are one” with your other self, so I was watching the movie as if her consciousness has been transferred into Sue, however later in the movie I realised Elisabeth has no recollection of what Sue does when she was watching the interview on tv she was shocked and livid and clearly hearing it for the first time. Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth’s experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. 

But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it’s clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn’t? But the bigger question is if you are Elisabeth, you don’t actually get to experience being young again, you go to sleep for a week wasting away, why would anyone want to just clone themselves and keep going when they don’t get anything out of it?! It just doesn’t make sense. Is there a reasonable explanation within this movie’s universe that I’m just not getting ?

movies,Ariana DeBose needs a better agent,"TL;DR: Ariana DeBose's movies after WSS aren't very good. Hopefully that changes soon. If not then she needs to give her agent the boot.

This isn't something only exclusive to her (looking at you Tom Holland, though things are looking up for you), but I'm shocked by how drastic of a downturn Ariana DeBose's career took after West Side Story. That movie put her in the spotlight and even won her an Oscar! Yet every movie she's been in after that has been panned by both audiences and critics.

I.S.S was the first movie she stared in after WSS, which released on January 2023. For the uninformed January is seen as a dumping month for movies which studios think won't do well. That movie bombed at the box office despite a low $13 million budget and received average reviews.

Then she voiced the main character in Wish. I think we all know what happened with that movie. It flopped, making $255 million on a $175–200 million budget. Don't forget movies need to make 2.5x their budget to make a profit. I remember a lot of people on social media and irl making fun of the movie's animation, story and songs. It was seen as an embarrassment to Disney, especially since it was meant to celebrate their 100th anniversary.

In 2024 she starred in Agrylle. The movie was meant to launch a new franchise but it bombed and was ridiculed by critics and audiences. I know many people see it as a low point in Vaughn's career. Tbf her role in that movie was very minor but still.

This likely went under your radar as it's a streaming movie released on Amazon Prime but she stared in a horror movie called House of Spoils where she plays an evil chef I think. Cool premise but unfortunately it's produced by Blumhouse and you know how all their recent output has been like lately. It didn't make much splash but from what I can tell it was received quite negatively by both critics and audiences.

Later this month the 8 people still invested in Sony's Spider-Manless Cinematic Universe will be seeing her again in Kraven the Hunter. Tbh I actually think this movie's reception won't too bad, or at least not as bad as Morbius and Madame Web. I can totally see people calling it a fun turn-off-your-brain popcorn flick. But I really doubt it'll get higher than a 65% on the tomatometer.

Finding out that she was going to be in Kraven the Hunter was what prompted me to write this ridiculously long post (that and the fact that I have a lot of free time.). To be completely hyperbolic, this was what broke me and caused me to write all this out. I admit that I've never seen a single movie she's been in but I have seen clips of WSS and she was phenomenal in it. She's a scene stealer man, not just because she looks absolutely stunning but because of her amazing acting and singing. She deserves a better career man. I'd hate to see such talent be reduced to such poor and ill-fitting roles.

Not all hope is lost for her tho, next years she'll be in Love Hurts, also staring Ke Huy Quan. I have really high hopes for that movie as I love Ke Huy Quan and the premise sounds really fun! She's also staring in two other upcoming movies which don't have release dates yet. Those may be good. Who knows. I hope they are. If all three of her upcoming movies end up terrible then she ought to fire her agent cause man is she squandering her skills and potential. Of course I'm not saying gonna end up in poverty if she keeps getting bad movie roles but I do think it's odd she hasn't been in a single hit since WSS.

movies,Hellboy: The Crooked Man is better than I expected,"I'm a fan of Brian Taylor and I love the Hellboy character, but I expected this to be a complete disaster after it got buried during its release. Honestly, it isn't a great movie, but it's completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it's pretty clear that most of what we're seeing is fake, which drags it down. 

Despite me finding it passable enough, I'm really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights. The character isn't much of a box office draw either, which is a shame as the comics are excellent.

movies,Hunting Matthew Nichols (2024),"I just caught this Hunting *Matthew Nichols* (2024) at the Whistler Film Festival last weekend and really wanted to put it on people's radars, especially if you love horror. [https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols](https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols)

I did not know ANYTHING about this movie before I went in to see it and that's the best way to experience it. It won me over because the story about this woman searching for her missing brother is interesting. The atmosphere is dripping. Literally because they filmed in December on Vancouver Island, showcasing really dark, rainy and super foreboding/dread tone. The deeper they get into the woods the eerier it gets. It's strangely grounded and absorbing. It's decently-shot, but what I appreciate is it's a nice slow burn. It builds and builds to one of the tensest, scariest movies I've seen in years. Closest I can compare is UNCUT GEMS,  in style, realism and oh-my-GOD tension.

It's a locally produced Vancouver indie so a lot of the audience had heard about it through family, friends or colleagues, myself included. I showed up 20 minutes early and most movies at the Whistler film fest don't have crazy lines. This one day. I barely got in via the rush line, they had 10 spots open and I was the eighth.

movies,What is the most well-rounded (not necessarily best) film all time?,"Everyone has their favorite film, but what is one you have to admit is the most well rounded?

By definition, a well rounded film should have these attributes

1. Quality - Be a quality film, obviously. Within the script, acting, scenes and soundtrack 

2. Good Length - Have an average run time not too long or short 

3. Highly Accessible - Able to watch with almost types of audiences, including film critics and casual viewers. Not too niche of a topic or style.

4. Rewatchability - Is able to be rewatched multiple times without fatigue

—-

For me, I feel Terminator 2: Judgement day has it all. You can watch it with your dad or with film nerds. It has high cultural influence, great ending and action sequences that give it an easy rewatch. The pacing is great, and doesn’t have long drawn out sequences. The soundtrack is simple yet fits the movie perfectly. Also, While watching T1 makes it better, I don’t think it’s completely necessary for the average viewer.

movies,"December 6-8 Box Office Recap: 'Moana 2' stayed on top of the box office, earning almost $600 million worldwide after just 2 weeks. The 'Interstellar' IMAX re-release earned $4.6 million from just 165 theaters. Meanwhile, A24's 'Y2K' flopped in ninth place with just $2.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/qi1cxbn2ew5e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8

Thanks to the excellent performance last week, this was a fantastic post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. ***Moana 2*** broke the record for highest post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office, while ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II*** continued their run. As is typical with the weekend, studios avoid releasing big stuff. The biggest push was A24's ***Y2K***, which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. In contrast, the IMAX re-release of ***Interstellar*** fared much better in just 165 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 115% from last year, when ***The Boy and the Heron*** opened in North America. It's the best post-Thanksgiving weekend in history.

Without any competition, ***Moana 2*** easily held the top spot with $51.2 million this weekend. That represents a 63% drop, which is a little steeper than usual for the post-Thanksgiving weekend. It's worse than ***Wish*** (61%), ***Frozen II*** (59%), ***Strange World*** (58%), ***Ralph Breaks the Internet*** (54%), ***Frozen*** (53%), ***Encanto*** (52%), and the original ***Moana*** (50%).

Through 12 days, the film has earned $299.3 million domestically, already eclipsing the original ***Moana***. For a comparison, it had a huge start over ***Inside Out 2***, but it's now running almost $60 million behind that through the same point. It should hit $500 million for the holidays, but the $600 million dream appears to be dead.

***Wicked*** stayed at #2, dropping 55% and adding $36.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $322.1 million, and it should finish with over $450 million.

***Gladiator II*** dropped a rough 59%, adding $12.5 million this weekend. The film has earned $132.8 million so far, and it's gonna close with a little over $150 million unless the holidays surprise us.

Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** dropped 45%, adding $7 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $85.7 million. We'd like to say it will hit $100 million, but that's pretty much Joever; Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday. That's gonna kill legs.

The Indian film ***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** opened with $4.88 million in 1,245 theaters, which grows to $9.3 million in its first five days.

Paramount re-released Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** in 165 IMAX theaters. It earned a huge $4.6 million in these locations, which translates to a $27K per-theater average. IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out. These numbers took its lifetime gross to $192.6 million.

Sony/Crunchyroll's ***Solo Leveling: ReAwakening*** earned $2.4 million from just $846 theaters. Not bad for a recap of the first season.

Fathom Events released the concert film ***For King + Country’s A Drummer Boy Christmas Live*** in 1,540 theaters, for a limited 4-day run. It finished in eighth place with $2.2 million ($2.8 million four-day).

Debuting in ninth place, we find A24's ***Y2K***, which flopped with just $2.1 million in 2,108 theaters. That's a poor $1,003 per-theater average, suggesting a lot of empty screenings. It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2,000 theaters. 

This shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. The film lacked big names, with the big emphasis on its writer and director, Kyle Mooney. Mooney is definitely well known for ***Saturday Night Live***, but like a lot of stars in the show, that doesn't mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen. Horror is a profitable genre, but the film is actually a horror comedy, making it a tougher sell. A24 takes a lot of risks, but it was clear that this would struggle. Since its SXSW premiere, reviews have been mixed, and they've been worsening (currently at 43% on RT), making it one of the worst titles of the studio. It's simply a film that couldn't find an audience.

According to A24, 58% of the audience was male, and 77% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it an awful ""C–"" on CinemaScore, suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters. A run under $5 million is a possibility, and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives. Not the best years for Rachel Zegler, apparently.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever***. It fell 53%, adding $1.5 million this weekend and taking its total to $34.4 million.

Outside the Top 10, we find ***Werewolves***, a horror action title with Frank Grillo. It hit 1,351 theaters, but it flopped with just $1 million this weekend. Don't expect it to last long.

Vertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel's ***The Order*** in 603 theaters, but it only made $878,000 this weekend. Ouch.

A24 expanded Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** to 47 theaters. It added $405,910 this weekend, taking its run to $866K after 10 days. It will continue expanding.

Searchlight didn't even bother with ***Nightbitch***. Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters, but they didn't release box office numbers. Le sigh.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** continued leading the box office after its record-breaking weekend. It added $103.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $599 million. Its biggest debut was Japan, where it opened with $6.5 million. The best markets so far are France ($32.5M), UK ($27.2M), Germany ($19.7M), Mexico ($19.1M) and Brazil ($16M). A billion is imminent, but it looks like it will take a little while.

While ***Wicked*** registering strong numbers domestically, it continues performing softly overseas. This weekend, it added $26.9 million, taking its worldwide total to $457.5 million. It had very soft debuts in France ($2M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Poland ($900K). The best markets are the UK ($47.4M), Australia ($17.2M), South Korea ($10.6M), Mexico ($8.1M) and Spain ($4.5M). It will open in more markets, but it's not like it will suddenly explode. If it was performing on par with its domestic run, we'd say a billion is a possibility, but that's not the case here. 70% of its money is coming from the domestic market, which is crazy.

***Gladiator II*** added $17 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $368.5 million. The film is slowing down, and while it will hit $400 million, it won't get much further than that. Far below the original's $460 million worldwide total.

***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** opened in 31 markets, mostly Latin America, a week ahead of its worldwide rollout. To say that it performed badly would be an understatement. The film debuted with an awful $2 million. It had terrible starts in Spain ($347K), Mexico ($239K), Thailand ($146K), Brazil ($106K), and Czech Republic ($103K). Yep, not a single market over $1 million. This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Here* | Nov/1 | Sony | $4,875,195 | $12,227,851 | $13,295,076 | $50M

- Wake up babe, new Zemeckis flop just dropped. After barely one month in theaters, Sony/Miramax's ***Here*** has closed with just $12 million domestically and $13 million worldwide. Despite touting the film as a ***Forrest Gump*** reunion (Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright), the audience was uninterested. In fact, the domestic total is barely half of what ***Forrest Gump*** earned on its opening weekend back in 1994, and that's not even adjusted. Oh, Robert Zemeckis, what happened to you? To say that his glory days have passed...

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Five films, two of which are hitting wide release. But none stand a chance in topping the box office.

The first is Sony's latest addition in the Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe, ***Kraven the Hunter***. This universe has been mostly profitable, but it carries an asterisk. The three ***Venom*** films are hits, while the other two (***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***) flopped and became Internet's laughingstock. ***Kraven*** is leaning towards the latter. And for reasons beyond understand, Sony decided that this film warranted $130 million, making it their most expensive SSU film. After this, who knows what'll happen.

The other wide release is Warner Bros.'s ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, an anime prequel to Peter Jackson's trilogy. This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history... yet ***The War of the Rohirrim*** is not gonna come close anywhere close to that. Anime has a ceilling at the box office, and the pre-sales are insanely low. With a low screen count, limited marketing, and middling reviews so far, we'll see how low it can go.

Paramount is releasing ***September 5*** in limited release, before its wide release on January 17. The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events. The film has received some solid reviews so far.

Amazon MGM is releasing ***Nickel Boys*** in limited release. The story follows two African American boys, Elwood and Turner, who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida. The film has received critical acclaim, and there's Oscar buzz on the horizon. Watch out for this one.

The other one is Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl***, starring Pamela Anderson. Reviews are very positive, with Anderson lauded for a career-best performance.

movies,What do you think will happen when the Hobbit enters the public domain?,"J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth franchise began way back in 1937, with the release of the Hobbit. The Hobbit has been adapted twice, once back in 1977 as an animated movie, and again as a live action trilogy, between 2012 and 2014. 

However, something that often goes unnoticed, is that we're creeping up on the date in which the Hobbit novel, will be available to the public domain. In 2034, the original Hobbit novel will enter the public domain, at least according to an article I read recently. 

Given how people had issues with both the original animated adaptation and the Peter Jackson trilogy, I'm curious to know what you think of the idea that anyone will be able to try adapting the Hobbit for themselves. Do you think it's a bad idea, or could we see a more faithful adaptation come about as a result? Or do you think the market will get over-cluttered with poor retellings of the story?

I myself see a lot of potential here. A fledgling studio could use the Hobbit to turn their fortunes around for instance, or a rival major studio to WBD, could try beating them at their own game. Universal Studios, who owns the rights to the LEGO movie franchise, could easily do their own LEGO adaptation of the original book if they so wanted to. Even if the worst comes to pass and the Hobbit gets adapted into a horror movie, like Steamboat Willie and Winnie the Pooh already have, I'd still be down for a horror movie about Middle-earth. I still think that could work wonders if handled correctly.

The soundtrack is excellent, and overall tone is suitably foreboding when it needs to be. The ""pirate speak"" could be better, but it is obviously aimed at kids.

It's got a lot of the charm of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and follows the time-tested Moby Dick format while staying fairly original. It's got a very classic feel that reminds me of the old swashbuckling pirate films of the 80s. Its a proper adventure film.

movies,What if Sergio Leone made Leningrad: The 900 Days?,"Question, What if Sergio Leone never died and managed to make Leningrad: The 900 Days?

On what I am saying, While finishing work on Once Upon a Time in America in 1982, Leone was impressed with Harrison Salisbury's non-fiction book The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad, and he planned on adapting the book as a war epic. Although no formal script had been completed or leaked, Leone came up with the opening scene and basic plot. According to the documentary Once Upon a Time, Sergio Leone, the film opened in medias res as the camera goes from focusing on a Russian hiding from the Nazis' artillery fire to panning hundreds of feet away to show the German Panzer divisions approaching the walls of the city. The plot was to focus on an American photographer on assignment (whom Leone wanted to be played by Robert De Niro) becoming trapped in Russia as the German Luftwaffe begin to bombard the city. Throughout the course of the film, he becomes romantically involved with a Russian woman, whom he later impregnates, as they attempt to survive the prolonged siege and the secret police, because relationships with foreigners are forbidden. According to Leone, ""In the end, the cameraman dies on the day of the liberation of the city, when he is currently filming the surrender of the Germans. And the girl is aware of his death by chance seeing a movie news: the camera sees it explode under a shell .... ""

By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire $100 million in financing from independent backers, and the film was to be a joint production with a Soviet film company. He had convinced Ennio Morricone to compose the film score, and Tonino Delli Colli was tapped to be the cinematographer. Shooting was scheduled to begin sometime in 1990. The project was canceled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film.

Now, Since Sergio Leone never had a script, it's hard to know whether the film would go, but I think, given Leone's track record, I really think this film would've a been another masterpiece. I am just sadden that Sergio died just only 2 days before he was to sign on to this film, and one thing that amazes me is that Leone managed to acquired 100 Million just for this project, probably making it one of the most expensive film projects is it actually got made?

movies,District 9 is great original film.,"A recommendation post of this film suddenly popped on my Instagram feed and I thought I should give it a try. I'm glad that I did.

I knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it has aliens in it (thought that it was an alien invasion movie).

Never in my life did I imagine that a film can make me sympathize with aliens and hate humans. Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.
 
Another thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.

The ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).

The only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.

In short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.

Highly recommend if you haven't already watched it.",CYBOZAX_,1ha0t0x,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,2024-12-09 03:40:06,2267,0.92,2267,0,230,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha0t0x

movies,2000s Cliche lines/tropes,"Hello all! About a while back on social media, there was a steady stream of jokes involving early 2000s movies, marvel movies, etc. where people would act and recreate cliched scenes we’ve all seen before such as: 

“He’s right behind me… isn’t he?” 

Or people stacking on top of each other to watch something from afar, 

or even the classic “I’ve got it! I’ve got it… guess I don’t have it.” Type of line.

Long story short: I’ve created a one act comedy play based on those joke lines and I’d like to try my hand at making it into a two act play for a local writing competition. Problem is, the trend is far over and I’d like to open it up to you guys for inspiration!

What’re generic cliched lines or tropes from early 2000s movies that you guys remember?

movies,"Another ""The Prestige"" post asking for some clarification","Hi everyone! I know... 9 years late to the party hahaha. I love this movie so much I had to watch it twice in once sitting.

I won't lie... I was looking for a suggestion to ""Now You See Me"" as I enjoy the over the top heist movies that don't take themselves too seriously (think Rick and Morty heist hyperbole and not Fast and Furious). I saw the movie ""The Prestige"" pop up multiple times, but since it was often coupled by overt animosity towards the person asking for movie recommendations similar to ""Now You See Me"", I had assumed it was a sarcastic recommendation, and thus also accidentally mistook the suggestion for ""The Purge"", thinking these people where being malicious with their recommendations; but I digress.

The actual question I have involves the jail scene, in which Jess visits Alfred accompanied by Lord Caldlow; whom we immediately learn is actually Angier. They have a heated transaction, and Alfred frantically grabs Jess's attention and says, ""I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise. I promise. Look"" and after he pulls the red ball out from behind her ear, he repeats, ""I promise"" and ends the transaction with, ""I love you. I love you. I love you Jess."" We're not privy to the details, but we learn that in fact, Alfred is a portmanteau of the first names of the twin Borden brothers Albert and Frederick, so that means either Albert or Frederick is in jail. Well... to be accurate, we learn that Alfred is actually the single identity born from the shared lives of the twin Borden brothers, without really learning any names. These names I've learned from extensive Google warrioring. Anyway, I'm led to believe that Frederick is the one in jail, especially since he opens by saying to Jess, ""I've missed you so much. Fallon's missed you too. We both have."" Meaning that the one in jail is not Jess's father, and that leads me to believe it is then Frederick, who is the who who has been cold to Sarah Borden, Albert's wife.

I guess I'm just confused because If Frederick is the one who is in jail, and is the one who is ultimately hanged, I just find it odd that he showed such an overwhelming amount of love and concern for Jess. Especially since he was incapable of showing that affection towards his sister in law, which led her to her eventual suicide. That didn't seem like an act to me. It didn't feel like he was just trying to use her to garner sympathy enough to get out of jail. It didn't feel like he was acting for the sake of the daughter. The scene to me felt very real, and very self-less might I add. It feel like he was truly worried about her well being and how she would cope after him. I think the magic trick with the ball—a signature ""Borden"" gesture, was meant to reassure her in a familiar, comforting manner, maintaining the illusion of stability knowing that he was at an end the moment he learned of Caldlow's true identity. And that, is where I'm confused, if that's true, why would he have that kind of feeling towards his niece. Why did he comfort her so desperately when he could even do the same for Sarah?

Oh, I guess as I further think on this as I try to organize my thoughts into a coherent Reddit post, I again want to point at his coldness towards Sarah; and I want to supplement that with the fact that he \*immediately\* chased Olivia after Sarah's passing, leading to her leaving him as well. She was unsettled by how little her death affected him, and how quickly he moved on to his mistress. To me, this leads me to believe that Frederick is not much of an actor. I don't believe he's able to fake love, and that reinforces my thought that what he shows towards Jess is genuine and true; and again, I just want to know why? Unless of course, it was not Frederick in the jail cell.",Aerothix,1hbkl85,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,2024-12-11 03:40:15,0,0.39,0,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbkl85

movies,"""The Lovely Bones:"" A New Add to My Least Favorite Movies List","I just saw the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. 

I came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on ""paired with"" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl ""everyone dies"" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. 

I also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to ""everyone"" like the spirit guide describes death. The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. 

Furthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the ""cool grandma"" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a ""grown man"" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just ""live with it"" less than a year after the murder.

It's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.

Finally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the ""weird looking, creepy stranger"" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.

This movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.

EDIT: I guess I wasn't as articulate as I could have been, no I don't think they needed to show a 14 year old literally getting raped, please stop saying that's what I said or asking why I supposedly wanted to see that. My point there was, I think the film is way too flipant with how it handles rape's emotional impact by not acknowleding what happened in any way, or at the very least by rushing the girl to get over it ASAP. Girls need to show that this isn't okay and their upset feelings are valid when it happens to them. No death survivors can get anything from this movie, as they are dead. However SA survivors can. And if the point wasn't supposed to be about the girl, we didn't need to see her in the afterlife.",Due_Assist_7614,1ha2xe2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,2024-12-09 05:43:43,544,0.73,544,0,216,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha2xe2

movies,I'm still confused by 'The Platform' and 'The Platform 2',"I have seen both movies, but I'm still confused on a couple of things (I'm going to reference both):

* The platform shoots to the top really fast, but what happens when the platform approaches Level 0? Does it slow down or does it immediately stop?  If it immediately stops then I don't think either the child or the panna cotta at the end of the first movie would be intact if either was sent up. The child would likely go splat on the ceiling like a squashed berry. The panna cotta wouldn't be intact either. Otherwise, the platform would need to slow down as it approaches the top, whereby some prisoners could possibly attempt to jump on? I guess this is a plot point that is just never explained?
* Does a child being placed at the bottom level at the end of the second movie confirm that the child at the bottom in the first movie was NOT in fact imaginary? THAT was the possible ending that really happened, and not the other one with the panna cotta being sent up?
* There are cannibals beneath the pit which survive on dead bodies and their parts that fall down the hole? And who are these cannibals? Are these all prisoners that descended to the bottom of the pit with a child over time? 
* Lastly, so either the platform suddenly stopping or the cannibals at the bottom are the things that make the prison completely escape proof? So if a prisoner rides the platform down to the very bottom they are simply killed by the cannibals? Or if they have a child they are just pulled off by the cannibals, the prisoner joins the cannibals, and the child is sent up and is supposedly not killed at the top by the sudden deceleration?

I finally got a decent chunk knocked off my to watch list and absolutely feel in love with some movies that I wished I had seen sooner.
My Top 5 
1. The Menu (2022) might be in my actual top 5 of all time, so funny while still super tense 
2. Coherence(2013) one of the best mind bender movies I’ve seen and made for 50k which still blows my mind
3. Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) movie just is stuck inside my soul and is so depressing while being comforting simultaneously 
4. The Thing (1982) unbelievable how good it looks for being over 40 years, perfect paranoia thriller 
5. Frailty (2001) another great mind bender

I just finished watching it, and the incredibly constant time-skips back and forth were incredibly jarring. The constant cutting to people back on earth giving these post-journey and pre-journey explanations was so random .

It's especially confusing because you're just with the same five cast the entire time (plus the two main people on earth) so it's impossible to keep track of what has and hasn't happened yet.

movies,Can we talk about Apple TV movies?,"This week I saw three Apple TV movies:

Napoleon

Killers of the Flower Moon

The Instigators.

Whilst The Instigators was a tragic waste of talent, the first two imo were both resounding successes. Both fine, magnificent movies cinematically speaking. I’d read bad things about both (too long, inaccurate etc) but on a purely cinematic level, both these movies delivered and I applaud Apple TV for these. 

I’m genuinely excited what Apple TV can offer. The only downside is that I can only watch it in my iPhone as when viewed on my television the picture breaks up. That’s quite a major problem especially as Ridley Scott has publicly voiced his disapproval of watching movies on phones. 

Anyway, I think I might watch Blitz next. I have reservations about this one too but, seriously, after The instigators, surely it won’t be on that level of badness.

movies,Biggest Filmmaker ,"Who according to you are among the Top 5 Biggest ( most influential ) filmmakers in the world currently , of this era ( 2007-present ) ?



According to me -

1. Christopher Nolan - Probably the most famous and commercially/critically successful filmmaker of this Era .
With movies like The Dark Knight , Inception , Interstellar , Dunkirk , Oppenheimer under his belt , I certainly presume that no one even comes close to his invincibility .




2. Bong Joon Ho - With masterpieces like Mother , Snowpiercer , Okja , and Parasite , he nearly misses the first spot solely on the basis of lack of global recognition compared to Nolan. But definitely on the same level on the basis of the quality of content when compared to Nolan.




3. Martin Scorsese  - This era has been sort of a second phase of Scorsese's cinematic journey imo. It feels as if in the current phase of Scorsese , he is not making movies for them to be great classics but just for enjoying the privilege of creating real "" old school "" cinema in a world which is largely dominated by movies which feels more like factory produced products for consumer's satisfaction.
His Shutter Island , Wows , Silence , The Irishman , and Killers of the flower moon are 
' breeze of fresh air ' .





4. Wes Anderson   - One of the most unique filmmakers of recent times , his distinctive style and artistic approach has cemented his position among the great comedy filmmakers of all time.




5. Denis Villeneuve  - Probably the best ' spectacle movie ' director in the world with his movies like Arrival , Blade Runner 2049 , Dune  achieving the perfect balance between being extremely well made and thoroughly entertaining .",Beefyvalkyrie,1hbae2h,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbae2h/biggest_filmmaker/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbae2h/biggest_filmmaker/,2024-12-10 19:45:54,0,0.35,0,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbae2h
movies,The Substance is way too long for what it is and suffers greatly for it.,"Don't get me wrong Demi and Dennis' performances were great and the movie was thematically strong and has some of the best use of practical effects I've seen in recent film. However, the damn movie is just too long. It's not hard to surmise what will happen once the exposition is through. Demi will recapture her youth but only a week at a time, or else? Surely she won't disobey those orders! Surely ""Remember, you are one"" is not a foreboding warning that underlines the entire theme of the movie? And there's nothing wrong with telegraphing your thematic intentions and then leaning into them, but when you do that you need to make it snappy. The middle section of the movie drags so hard because you know what's coming the whole time and instead of getting that, you get stiff dialog and a few gross out scenes. It felt like sitting at the dinner table watching the food get cold. It's being heralded for its message, which is a good one, but it's also not a complicated one and it DEFINITELY did not need almost 150 minutes to be delivered.


I'll also mention that I get what the idea was with all of the intense sexualization of Sue, but the movie falls into the trap of being popular for the things it's trying to denigrate. Sex sells and that sucks for women, but also, let's make an over the top sexualized movie and hey, look, people love it. It ends up feeling like virtue signaling mixed with hipocracy via naivete.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Turkey,"Hello there,

since more than 40 days I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain european country. Yesterday, it was Switzerland's turn and it was certainly not the first try to bring the *Three colours*\-trilogy into the game, but now, finally, quasi at the last opportunity, it made the cut: ***Trois couleurs: Rouge*** (engl.: Three colours: Red) will be the next entry on our official letterboxd list. 

What comes next? Well, we'll see - here in this thread. I am following the alphabetical order of the Council of Europe's official list of European countries here, which means, on the one hand, that we're yet to get to England and the like (stay tuned), but on the other hand it also means that today we are  talking about a country that is only partially part of geographical Europe: I'm looking for movies set in **Turkey**. But even in this case, there are only two rules to follow when approaching this country from a cinematic perspective:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

My mom was welcoming of anyone and I think there’s just a lot of things covered in this movie that make sense.

I was very excited to watch Dear Santa because it felt like a wholesome, old school Christmas movie, all I really knew about it was the concept and that one trailer I saw, but that was enough for me.

The movie was just wholesome from beginning to end and at the end, it did it, a story that FINALLY had the courage to and we're heading into end game major spoiler territory here

&gt;!A story that had the courage to DEFY death! THANK YOU to the writers, whoever approved it, thank you!!&lt;

&gt;!I'm so tired of stories teaching us that the dead are gone and we should accept it, that we can't bring our loved ones back and all that reality check stuff. No, this is a fantasy movie, this is a world that someone imagined and in their world this kinda stuff IS possible because the worlds we create in our imagination are ours to write the rules in and the writers did just that. I'm glad that somewhere out there exists a world like this, I wish ours was one but it isn't, but I'm happy just to see this stuff.!&lt;

So not only did I enjoy this heartwarming movie from the very beginning, but it ended the way I was hoping it would ever since I learned of the main plot twist I would say.

For me, personally, as a non movie critic person, a casual guy just watching his flicks

this is my #1 new Christmas Movie alongside Klaus.

It's just wonderful.

10/10 in my book

I couldn't have asked for a more perfect movie and ending

movies,Should long movies have intermissions?,"I recently watched Wicked. It's a great movie, check it out if you got the time. But it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. A 10-minute intermission would be cool. It would allow the audience to get up, get some more popcorn, and use the washroom. That being said; not all movies need one. If the movie is just 90 minutes long, an intermission would not make any sense. So only movies that are longer than 120 minutes (might) need one.

movies,Han’s Zimmer’s score for Interstellar,"I was fortunate enough to get IMAX 70MM tickets for a showing. Of Interstellar’s re-release last weekend.

Obvious love for the visuals aside. One thing that I did not appreciate when I saw this film 10 years ago was the stakes and what was happening to the characters. Being that this was Nolan’s first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could “solve” his movie like many tried to after Inception released.

I can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.

I read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. “Stay/Coop leaving Murph” in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. 

there is something so powerful in that composition that just had me losing it. It might be the idea that I’m becoming more open to becoming a father, but when the entire orchestral noise starts escalating as Coop is letting Tom have the truck, I am wailing for him to stay. 

And this was just for one of the compositions in this film. I can keep going on about how this element alone was truly amazing for a film like this.

movies,Onegin (1999) - Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler are excellent in this beautiful romantic drama based on the novel in verse by Russian writer Alexander Pushkin.,"https://preview.redd.it/lfizh83n9q5e1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c406dbf791527cd189be56708ea4efc41484aa1d

Alexander Pushkin's verse novel ""Eugene Onegin"" is well-known in English-speaking countries, partly due to the influence of Tchaikovsky's opera, so I need not set out the plot in any detail. It centres upon the relationship between Yevgeny Onegin, a 19th century Russian landowner, and a teenaged girl named Tatyana Larinа, the daughter of a neighbour. Tatyana falls passionately in love with Onegin and writes him a letter setting out her feelings, but he replies that he cannot return them. Six years later Onegin meets Tatyana again and discovers that she is now married to a prince. A subplot deals with a duel fought between Onegin and Vladimir Lensky, the fiancé of Tatyana's sister Olga.

Ralph Fiennes executes a stunning performance as the aloof, sarcastic disillusioned aristocrat managing a performance which combines a great deal of emotion and extreme surface passivity; Liv Tyler is at her most beautiful in one of her best performances to date as the poignant Tatiana who, as the film unfolds, evolves from passionate idealism into resignation and honour.

As for the story, the movie is very faithful to the Pushkinian attitude. The story is very character-centred, typical to Russian lit. The change in Evgenyi Onegin  is marked indeed. However, the character of Tatyana captivated me. Her faithfulness to herself and to her integrity is amazing.

It just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying ""jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore"" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. 

Of course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic.

yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Sweden.

...but we can try. I'm following an alphabetical order here (yeah, yeah, I know, that England and Co are still missing, wait for it), and so, we now take a look at movies set in **Switzerland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

The third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.

Some ups and downs:
+Denzel glooming
+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again
+Nice location
-Boring villain
-Slow pacing
-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie

I came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him.

movies,Juror #2 Thoughts,"Wondering if anyone else has seen this yet.

I personally was really excited for it, based on both the reviews, the director and a solid cast with JK Simmons, Nicholas Hoult and that chick from the sixth sense. If nothing else, a good courtroom drama is always hard to beat.

Watched it last night and was so utterly confused by the praise this movie has gotten. The plot was ludicrous even for a hollywood film, every secondary character's dialogue was incredibly obnoxious and no I every standard clique/trope was left untouched.

All I can figure is that people believe this is Clint Eastwood's last movie and are being nice; nobody wants to send him to the afterlife with a movie that is 25% fresh with an IMDb of 5.4. Or am I offbase here?

movies,"Characters, where you felt the same exact devastation they did. ","Hearts In Atlantis. Liz, the mother was so excited about being included on the business retreat. Obviously, the pay increase to take care of the family. I was fucking gutted when she found out what sort of business retreat her boss had in mind. Every time I watch the film, my heart sinks. She was so excited and hopeful. It was a knife in the chest and the back. I still have never forgiven the actor that was her boss. I'll honestly stop watching something if he pops up.

The performances of everyone in this movie was amazing, but its few films where you feel just as bad emotionally as the character does. You feel bad for them. You feel as if ""what if that happened to me?!"" and you're living it in real time.

Its not so much the actions, because a lot of people go through this. But watching the entire before and after is what the film captured well. It was seeing a characters candle extinguished.

The only other time I really felt the film was when the villagers in Apocalypto were enslaved/sacrificed. It really captured how dire the situation was, and how much of a total and complete alien mindfuck that would have been.

movies,"Now You See Me 3 (2025) - Cast, Release Date - Parade","Now You See Me 3 wasn't delayed because of COVID like the writer claims. The head of Lionsgate notoriously was more interested in hitting specific release dates than making good movies. Writer/director Gary Ross didn't return to direct the sequel to The Hunger Games because Lionsgate wouldn't give him any time to work on the script or do pre-production prep. The sequel ended up going into production without any script at all --the director was shooting pages from the book until a shooting script was cobbled together. Catching Fire was a big hit anyway because of the goodwill generated by the first film but Lionsgate's slapdash approach to production led to diminishing audience interest and box office for the final installment (which was split into two films since that worked for Harry Potter and Twilight).

Before Now You See Me 2 opened Lionsgate announced that part 3 would be going into immediate production and be released the following year --but audiences weren't happy with the sequel which underperformed in North America. Lionsgate claimed the China box office made up for the disappointing returns in North America which clearly wasn't true because the original sequel which was to be helmed by Jon Chu again was cancelled.

In addition to completely screwing up the sequel to Now You See Me Lionsgate did the same with the sequel to the Bruce Willis action comedy R.E.D. Now You See Me and R.E.D. were both developed by Summit Pictures before that company was acquired by Lionsgate. Lionsgate was 100% responsible for the lackluster sequels.",Loose-Reaction-2082,1hak57w,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hak57w/now_you_see_me_3_2025_cast_release_date_parade/,https://parade.com/movies/now-you-see-me-3,2024-12-09 20:55:44,0,0.29,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,News,default,t3_1hak57w

movies,"Why does Jared Leto keep getting picked up by directors? I think he’s had good performances in the past, but is it really worth putting up with him?","Like, I think he’s a more talented actor than people give him credit for. I feel like a lot of the criticism of his ability comes from people who have only seen Morbius and Suicide Squad

But it’s well known that he seems like a huge pain in the ass. His method thing seems really annoying for his costars, and also just wastes a lot of time. Leto seems to have a lot of confidence in his formula, not realizing most of the roles that made him famous were just relatively normal dudes. Now he wants to prove himself as some kind of “eccentric method genius!”

After a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven’t been very successful recently.

Also, I know David Ayer seemed to like his weird process, which I suppose makes sense considering Ayer got along with Shia Labeouf very well. However, what I find funny is when you look at the behind the scenes for the Suicide Squad, the cast seemed legitimately very close.

movies,Looking for historical courtroom dramas,"Because of the nature of the work I do now,  I’ve become fascinated with how courtrooms are shown in tv and movies. It’s a convenient way to showcase moral dilemmas and human conflict, and it gets great performances out of actors.  

What I’m looking for, though, is movies that take place in historical versions of the standard courtroom drama. For arguments sake, by historical let’s say we mean before 1930. These courtroom settings could be either in a western or non-western country.

Two films made me think of this topic, and they coincidentally have the same lead actor and similar themes. The first one I saw was Le Colonel Chabert (1994), with Gerard Depardieu as a French cavalry officer presumed dead during the Napoleonic Wars. When he returns, he hires a lawyer to regain his inheritance from his remarried widow.    
The second, also starring Gerard Depardieu, was Le Retour de Martin Guerre (1982). In this one, a peasant in 16th century France leaves his wife and village to take part in the Hundred Years’ War. But the man who returns seems to be an imposter, and the village is divided on his identity.

movies,I don't agree with the sentiment that the Driver from Drive was a psychopath (SPOILERS),"Just watched the movie for the first time. Fantastic, instantly went to see what others were discussing. Seems the common consensus seems to be the Driver was sociopath/psychopath, even my friends think so.

To me, the movie was a character study on a troubled man looking for a normal, happy life, but got involved with the wrong people (and continues to.) Not a sociopath or psychopath. Probably on the spectrum. The whole movie was also showing us that he was a real human being. 

First, biggest signs of a socio/psychopath are lack of empathy and love, but he clearly has a lot of empathy and love for Irene and the child. He puts himself into danger just so he can keep them from harm. He isn't just physically or intimately in love with her, he never advances on her in a sexual way, it's a sweet and caring love. The elevator scene didn't scream lust to me (or my wife) personally, just a final kiss before he'll never see her again. The dates were always innocent with them chilling with her child. He is also very clearly distraught when Shannon dies, who again, proves to be part of the wrong friends he accidentally associates himself with. 

At the beginning of the movie, he denies a job for a lot of money from a previous client. Tells him to STFU, but ends up inadvertently taking the job because now Irene and her little boy are in danger if he doesn't.

People also mention the brutality of his kills, but all his kills in the movie come from self defense, or defense of a loved one. He was furiously stomping on the guy in the elevator because he was an active and present threat to Irene. It was a violent outburst towards his frustration at being unable to keep a person he loves out of danger. She becomes sad because she realizes she fell in love with yet another man with violent baggage that mean harm to the family.

He 100% does have a violent past. That is why he is disconnected, awkward, calculated and aware. 

He has good intentions, but fate and nature keep him away from them. He's the frog, the scorpion, and the shark in one package. He's not feigning his care for humanity. He sacrificed his only remaining bond to keep her safe. He left the money behind. Gave her a sweet goodbye voicemail. Clearly sad as he drives onto nowhere, where he'll probably get a job on the spot from a random guy again, forever and ever in this cycle.",Forhaver,1ha4h5u,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,2024-12-09 07:28:38,0,0.46,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha4h5u

movies,Detective movie subgenre name?,"I recently started reading The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, a book from 1958. In it, an old detective seeks to solve a crime that he failed to solve for decades due to a series of stupid bureaucratic mistakes and absence of any concrete leads.The author sought to make a point about how detective novels are the opposite of real-life crime solving in that it pretends that coincidences don't exist and logic is the only thing that matters.

movies,"Gulliver's Travels with Jack Black it doesn't even manage to be a fun parody of Jonathan Swift's book,","Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear.

What is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose. 

the film gives us  two woozy love interests and a multitude of over-the-top jesters (also guised in the form of kings and generals). The overall story has whittled down to the bare minimum of Liliputs and conflicting kingdoms, but apart from the that the connection is non-existent.

movies,What did we think of Nightbitch?,"I was on the fence, leaning negative, for the first two-thirds. This is coming from someone who unreservedly adores *Can You Ever Forgive Me* and *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*. Once it hit the third act, I got it. And thank god it clicked, because it would have made me really sad to give a negative review to a movie that needle-drops ""Dare to Be Stupid"" by Weird Al.

While I still prefer Marielle Heller's previous films, this big and often baffling swing reveals itself as a deeply personal reflection on balancing artistic legacy with continuing heritage. Kudos to Heller for making a film on her terms, even if it almost turned me off completely before eventually winning me over.

I was reminded of Ari Aster's *Beau Is Afraid*. In *Beau*, Joaquin Phoenix as Aster's self-insert protagonist only finds peace when performing a play in the woods—mirroring how Aster himself might only feel at ease when creating films and seeing the world through his unique lens. Even as some audiences follow Richard Kind's character out the door wondering what the hell they just saw, they at least had the opportunity to understand how it feels to live with Aster's restless, haunting brain.

An unhinged Amy Adams gives us a similar peek into Heller's mind in *Nightbitch*. And like Scoot McNairy's character admits, I ""didn't get it"" at first. Honestly, as a single man with no kids, I still don't get all of it. But now I feel a little closer to empathizing, rather than just sympathizing, with moms in the arts.

(Side note: I saw Brian De Palma's *Phantom of the Paradise* a week ago and didn't recognize a young Jessica Harper until the end credits. Then tonight I didn't realize an older Jessica Harper plays Norma until I saw her name on the Letterboxd page. I don't know what's causing my Jessica-Harper-prosopagnosia, but as a big fan of hers, I'm hoping one of the witches at Tanz Akademie can cast a spell to fix it.)

movies,Was the Hag in Snow White an Illusion?,"We all know that after the huntsman fails to provide Snow White's heart, the queen then magically transforms herself into the old hag which she then uses to trick Snow White into eating the apple.

The thing that I've always been curious on is whether or not that transformation is simply an illusion or not. What I mean is does the black magic only make her appear to be an old woman but she still functions as her normal self or is it truly a transformation and she IS that old woman? Sure she acknowledges the voice change, but she also seems to run pretty damn fast for an old woman and almost succeeded in moving a boulder onto the dwarfs; also an impressive feat given her ""age"". It wouldn't surprise me if someone that powerful was able to keep her strength and endurance while changing the voice to make it believable. 

What do you all think? 

Bonus question, do you think that after her death the magic wore off? Or did she remain even in death as the hag?

Regardless, personally she remains tied for my top Disney villain (with Maleficent), and by far the scariest, particularly as a child.

movies,Do Audiences Even Care About Cinematic Details Like Color and Light?,"As a filmmaker passionate about cinematography, I’ve been diving deep into the niche of film emulation—replicating the look and feel of celluloid film in digital work. I find it fascinating, almost magical, how the right colors, textures, and lighting can transform a scene. But here’s the question that keeps circling in my mind: Do audiences, especially those not involved in filmmaking, really see these subtle details? Do they feel them, even if they don’t consciously notice?

For context, I make movies purely for fun, out of passion. They’re not for money or validation, just a way to express myself. Sometimes I wish I could ask my 10-year-old self—someone who simply loved movies without knowing the technical side—if these nuanced elements would have mattered to him. Back then, I wasn’t thinking about grain structure, dynamic range, or color grading. I was just immersed in the magic of storytelling.

It reminds me of this video by Cleo Abram about football shots. She discussed how people thought the footage looked incredible—like it was shot in 8K—when, in reality, it was all about the aperture. The shots people loved were done on DSLRs with a shallow depth of field, unlike traditional broadcast cameras with their massive lenses, which prioritize a different aesthetic. When I saw the footage, I instantly recognized it was the aperture creating that ""cinematic"" look, not resolution or 8K. But it was fascinating to see how much people loved the DSLR footage without knowing why.

From this example, it’s clear that people do notice these things—but does it really matter? My assumption is that there’s a bare minimum that evolves over time as generations grow up exposed to better and better clarity. They notice the overall improvement, but they can’t pinpoint what it is—and honestly, they don’t even care. It’s not their job to know these details.

That’s the thing, right? This is also why smartphones have diminished DSLR sales compared to a few decades ago, when standalone cameras were the only option. Obviously, we in the industry know the technical reasons why DSLRs are still better than even flagship phone cameras. But that’s not the point. The point is the bare minimum.

And honestly, as an aspiring filmmaker, I feel great about this. It means I can start with a smartphone as my camera. All I have to do is figure out what the bare minimum is for how my movies need to look. Everything above that is good to have, but not necessarily a deal-maker.

Because at the end of the day, if the vibe of the movie doesn’t resonate with someone, they won’t want to watch it—no matter how good it looks, even in IMAX.

So, to the community here: Do you think the average viewer, or even a younger version of yourself, notices or appreciates subtleties like film emulation, color, or light? Or are these details more of a filmmaker's obsession? And what do you think that ""bare minimum"" standard is today?

Edit-
The reason why I ask this question is because I make movies simply because the process makes me happy. But sometimes, I find myself diving too deep into the rabbit holes of filmmaking details, losing track of the joy and starting to see perfection in those details as the only path to fulfillment—when it’s really not. That’s not who I am. Even though I make movies for myself, I wanted to understand what the audience actually feels about these things because, honestly, I’ve been exhausted thinking about it all on my own. What I really want is the clarity to know when I’ve done enough, to recognize when I’m focusing too much on the details and losing sight of myself in the process.",No-Indication9775,1ha8nph,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,2024-12-09 12:31:23,0,0.25,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha8nph

movies,Was the main character of Kingdom of Heaven (2005) the real son of Godfrey in the movie? I think he might not have been.,"Rewatching the movie and I start to think that Bailan (Orlando Bloom) may not have been Godfrey's (Liam Neeson) real son.

I see it as Godfrey and his circle were driven by meritocracy and finding a right guy to fit into Jerusaleem to keep peace, justice and all.

After seing the smith and hearing about his talents, the hosptalier (David Thewils) asks Godfrey ""remember what we talked about on the road?"".

I think that they either
a) agreed to come back to France and pick the most deserving/fitting man to become Godfrey's heir, either while on the road or even before sailing out from the Holy Land

b) Met his real son and realized they couldn't let such a jerk inherit the.piece of the kingdom of god they were building

c) Both a) and b) + hearing about his engineering talents played the crucial part of choosing him.

It is just a presumption, but it lays into the narrative which both Godfrey and King of Jerusaleem pronounce, ""everyone can be the master of his fate here, no matter who he was in his homeland"".

Baldwin even straightly says ""a father may claim a son"" while pronouncing this whole narrative during his first conversation with Bailan.",RuslanNCAA,1ha1p10,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,2024-12-09 04:30:26,0,0.33,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha1p10

It's interesting, because more than 100 comments later, in a way, we have a ""fpreign-but-not-so-foreign"" winner here: Internationally, ***El labertino del fauno*** (engl.: *Pan's Labyrinth)* is likely to be the best-known film on our list so far.

But [our official letterboxd list ](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)immediately calls for the next movie. We now move on to the next euorpean country with S, namely **Sweden**. Just like yesterday, there are only two rules to follow today:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!
