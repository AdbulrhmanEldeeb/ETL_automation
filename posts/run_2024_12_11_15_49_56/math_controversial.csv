math,Can there exist a non-linear smooth curve in R^2 whose image has no intersection with Q^2?,"*Can there exist a non-linear smooth curve in R\^2 whose image has no intersection with Q\^2?*

In other words, is it possible to find a differentiable function f: I -&gt; R\^2 such that:

1. f(t) is never a rational point for any ~~real~~ rational number t in the interval I.
2. f is not a linear function.

Long story short, I arrived at this question from considering the problem of arranging *n* points in the Euclidean plane such that the distance between any two points is a natural number, and then delving into primitive Pythagorean triples.

I've been thinking about this, and while it seems intuitively unlikely, I'm not sure how to rigorously prove or disprove it.

math,Why is there no proof of the Church-Turing thesis?,"I heard there is no proof of it, even though it seems obviously. There are proofs of Turing mahines being equivalent to various systems, but according to some people, there is no formal definition for an effective method.

I am assuming that this topic is actually important, and that someone would actually benefit from the Churing-Turing thesis being proven. If that is the case, then whoever would benefit from it must have a formal definition of what an effective method is, since they would need a formal definition just for their brain to be able to think about it. In that case, I don't see why it wouldn't be very hard.

If it's worth anything to you, I came up with an idea for a proof. Wikepedia says that ""\[A finite method\] consists of a finite number of exact, finite instructions."", so I'm assuming that means we have some f:A -&gt; B, where A and B are both finite. Turing machines work with a finite alphabet on a tape, and the alphabet can be mapped to the natrual numbers, so A and B would both be sequences of natural numbers. Since A and B are finite, even if their inner sequences are infinite, we can map them to finite sequences. Therefore, we can replace f with a function that only takes in finite sequences of numbers.

A finite sequence of numbers can be equivalently mapped to a vector. A mapping of any set of vectors to another set of vectors can be represented by a matrix, as long as we pick a mapping with vectors that have the same sizes.

My proof is therefore this:

* Turing machines are equivalent to matrices, if we only look at a specific finite slice of the tape before or after the machine halts.
* Matrices are equivalent to functions that are effectively computable.
* Therefore, turing machines can be mapped to effectively computable functions with the same inputs and outputs.",Simanalix,1hbumro,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,2024-12-11 14:26:34,10,0.71,10,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbumro

math,"A nice little generalization of the homomophism theorem I ""found""","Of course I didn't really ""find"" it, as I am certain that someone else thought about it centuries ago, but nonetheless, I'd like to present this neat little generalization of the homomophism theorem for groups.

We start with a generalization of group homs. Given two groups `X` and `Y`, we say a **group relation** `R` is a subgroup of the product `X \times Y`. By the closed graph theorem of groups, a map `f: X\rightarrow Y` is a homomorphism iff the graph `\Gamma_f=\{(x,f(x))\}` is a subgroup of `X \times Y`. Thus, group relations can be regarded as a generalization of homomorphisms. You even can compose relations in a natural way such they are mimicking homomorphisms.

Note that this notion is symetrical and more flexible than homs, e.g. it might happen that the elements of `X` are ""related"" to more than one element of `Y` or that only the neutral elements are related to each other.

Either way, for each group relation `R`, we have group homs `p_X` or `p_Y` maping from `R` to `X` or `Y` respectively. Note that since the surjective image of a normal subgroup is still normal, `p_X(ker p_Y)` is normal in `p_X(R)`.

Now to the generalization of the homomorphism theorem. In its classical form it states: ""If we, on the left side, treat elements as equals if they get mapped to the same thing and on the right side only consider the image, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short: ""`X/\ker f \isom f(X)`"".

This theorem - and this is what I ""found"" - can be generalized to the following:

""If we, on the left side, only consider the image of a relation and treat elements as equals if they are related to the same elements and do the same thing on the right, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short:

`p_X(R)/p_X(ker p_Y) \isom p_Y(R)/p_Y(ker p_X)`

If our relation is the graph of a homomorphism, this formula gives us pricisely the classical hmomorphism theorem, but is, as group relations are, more general than this. Which is quite nice.

The proof of this theorem is of course an exercise for the reader ;-) But in all seriousness, it is very much like the proof of the classical version, give it a try if you like.

If any of you have a source where this generalization is stated and there is more to read about the things I called group relations, I'd be more than happy if you'd inform us about that.
