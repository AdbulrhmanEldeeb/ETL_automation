devops,8 year Traditional SysAdmin - 2 years Cloud Operations Engineer - Feels more like a role meant for developers,"I've seen some discussions saying that traditional SysAdmins/Systems Engineers tend to do better in these Cloud Operations/DevOps/PlatEng roles, but after 2 years in I have to disagree.

My previous experience comes from majority of on-prem infrastructure (blade servers, SANS, Windows, some Linux, Microsoft 365, etc). I have never been able to write scripts from scratch, but can interpret things others have done and piece together whatever I need to automate using others (somebody has already written it typically, why reinvent the wheel of it works?). 

I know ClickOps is frowned upon in this culture and EVERYTHING must be code. With this point, personally even though my coding skills are almost non existent these types of roles seem to be more gear towards a developer or at least a developer has an upper hand in knowledge.

devops,Seeking Career Advice: Mid-Level DevOps Looking for Less Stressful Path,"I have been working as a mid-level DevOps engineer for about four years now. Before that, I spent 10 years as a network engineer. I don't see a path to becoming a senior engineer due to my character. I'm very sensitive to stress, and I can't imagine handling serious production-related projects.

I also have two young children who require a lot of energy from both me and my wife, so I'm not in a position to pursue labs, certifications, or further expand my knowledge. Most days, I'm dealing with a foggy brain from lack of sleep and fatigue. I'm not naturally curious as an engineer, and every ticket feels more like a chore than a fun problem to solve.

At 40 years old, I feel it's time to do something different, but I can't afford to start over with a junior salary due to our family's expenses and mortgage.

I'm seeking recommendations on what to do in my position. Ideally, a managerial path would be best, but I lack experience as a shift leader or team leader and don't have the necessary soft skills.

I need to find a role that doesn't require continuous education and training. Any recommendations are welcome.

devops,Useful DevOps projects at work,"I was just wondering if anyone has done any useful projects at work that has helped their teams a lot.

My entire company is migrating our kubernetes pipeline into an internal platform, so a lot of my helm knowledge is now rendered useless as we're using our internal k8s ""language"" (honestly it's terrible but whatever). This is managed by a developer team and I can only request features now, but not actually work on it (example: we should be using KEDA for autoscaling, but we simply have to wait until they convert helm into our internal language, then have them support it in our pipeline).

To shorten what we own is simply the actual deployments themselves, creating alerts/monitoring (but these tools are actually internal and we moved away from prometheus/grafana), 3rd party communications with our LLM Vendors, infrastructure costs.

So now I'm trying to do some work around this, like automating our verifications. But other than that, I really don't know what else I can do except clearly defining and documenting our processes. I just want to be a DevOps engineer again, not some technical writer or glorified deployment fodder for our engineers.

And yes, I'm just looking for new jobs, but also trying to strengthen my resume while I'm still at this company.

devops,Trying to create an interactive video - is it possible?,"So i have a to create an art installation for display in any desired format. I decided to create an interactive video like a mini game. The idea is that there is a video projected in a room. In a video there is a person in a room with various items he can interact with. For ex: play guitar, sit on chair, try open the door (very simplistic actions). The vision is that a person comes, starts the ""game"", with controller does several actions and the game ends. (Inspired by Bo Burnhams ""inside"")
My question is - is this possible? Can i somehow programme each action to a button on a controller and have a beggining and an end to this game? If it's not a video what kind of format file would it be? Can i use any controller for this? What programs? Extremely grateful for any info!
