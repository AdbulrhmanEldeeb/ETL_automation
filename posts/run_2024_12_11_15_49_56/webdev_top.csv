I saw the .ing tld and thought something like [struggl.ing](http://struggl.ing) or [ambl.ing](http://ambl.ing) or [attempt.ing](http://attempt.ing) would be fun, but it turns out that anything I tried that is a short-ish single word verb is either already registered or is being marketed as a ""premium"" domain.

I checked a few other registrars and the price for the same domain varied by about $1k from the cheapest to the most expensive. 

I'm curious about who is setting those prices, and who is getting paid the premium price? Is it the .ing tld itself charging the registrars a premium? Or do the registrars mark up the good domain names? 

One of the registrars I checked had a message that said something along the lines of, ""This domain was priced by our partner as a premium domain"", which makes me think the tld itself sets the prices.

","Hey everyone! 🙌

I’m back with the **first episode** of my HONO YouTube series, and I’m so excited to share it with you all! 🎉 In this episode, titled **""Hono Decoded: Unveiling the Powerhouse of Modern Web Frameworks""**, I dive into what makes HONO such a powerful yet lightweight choice for building web applications.

We’ll break it all down:

* What HONO is and why it's worth learning.
* Its core features and how it compares to other popular frameworks.
* Why its loved by Developers

If you’re curious about HONO or want to learn a modern approach to backend and full-stack development, I think you’ll really enjoy this one!

Here’s the link: [**Episode 1 - Hono Decoded**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGLxrvDxsF8) 🎥

As always, I’d love your feedback, thoughts, or even questions about the framework or what’s coming next in the series. Your support and ideas mean so much as I work on this project!

How would you go about creating a radial menu like this, that has multiple concentric menus.  


What I am looking for:  
\- having the ability to rotate each radial menu as a form of selecting something (selection at the top of the concentric circle)  
\- the child elements need to look like they are buttons.  
\- 6 elements per menu/concentric circle  
\- each element need to be spaced out and have a custom width and still look exactly as in the example above.  
\- the larger the concentric circle, the move space each element need to have in between.

I have managed to create the circle, and  managed to rotate the.

The issue is when I try to add the child elements that represent different options. It just doesn't click with me.

From my understanding, I need to bring each element at the border of the circle...

webdev,Easy Automated Image Gen on the Web,"I have written some python code that generates a few .png using matplotlib with some data I get from an API. I want to regenerate these images daily, and share them with one or more people. Currently this involves me sending an email every day. I'd rather have it hosted on the web where it's easily accessible.   
  
Two questions: 1.) Is there a photo hosting site that has an API I can automatically upload them to? If so, I assume you can program a computer to automatically run some python code at a set time each day, what would I search to learn more about this?  
  
2.) Some of the parameters are customizable, so I'd rather have a little website that allows the other person be able to adjust some parameters and generate the images on the fly. Is Django the best way to get this done? If so, should I host it on a VPS or is there a simpler place to run this web app? Theoretically, these plots/data have monetary value, so I'd eventually want to lock it behind a login as well. I know this seems like I might be biting off more than my amateur self can chew. But I am happy to learn along the way of this process. I don't care if it takes me a few weeks to make all of this work.

I've recently gotten into Laravel, and I love it. It was very easy setting up a previous project using it as a backend to a nextjs frontend. The documentation was great on this front.

I have a pet project now where I really want to use Processwire as a CMS in conjunction with Laravel for authentication only. ***I'm just curious how many here have done this, and if there are any pointers that can be offered? How well is it also working out for you?***

I know how to implement the appropriate table migrations for the Laravel part within the existing MySQL database that Processwire uses - as these will the be same kinds of tables I want to use as I did on my previous project. However, I want to bypass any and all authentication and user management that processwire does. 

Appreciate any advice.

webdev,"I want to create a website that's essentially a mix of debateart, kialo and lichess","I'm well aware this may not be realistically viable. But just in case it is, I'm asking here.

I want to create a website that's essentially a mix of these three sites: https://www.debateart.com/ https://www.kialo.com/ https://lichess.org/
A site where you can create or join timed matches (much like in lichess, with different time controls and ratings) to debate virtually any subject you like.

But during the debates, instead of each person having day(s) to come up with a big block of text like in Debateart, the debates will generally be much faster and structured like they are in Kialo, making it very systematic.

Voters, instead of having to read the whole debate to have any input, can vote on individual arguments in the kialo-esque chart according to their relevance, validity, soundness and impact on the parent claim. They can vote on as many or as few arguments as they want, perhaps restricted by whether or not they've voted on the child arguments.

I have some other ideas for it as well if it's possible, but what I've described so far is the main part.

I looked into Odoo, Yola and Webflow but it seems like they won't work. How can I make a complex site with almost no experience? And I would prefer to do it for free or on a low budget.
