books,Should I Have Been Allowed to Read That?,"What was the most inappropriate thing you had read by the time you were 15 or 16? Some things I had read by that age include the following: 

- Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) 

- Flowers in the Attic

- Interview with a Vampire (which my science teacher asked to borrow after I was done?)

- Almost everything Stephen King had written up through 1987

- The Happy Hooker 

(It doesn't fit in with scandalous list above, but I was also obsessed with Erma Bombeck starting around age 11 or 12. I desperately wanted to be seen as the world-wearied housewife and mother of two that I, a pre-teen boy, apparently so identified with.)

So, tell me what yours are: 

Do you remember what it felt like reading the book? 

Did you feel like you were getting away with anything? 

Did you feel as if you had to keep this reading secret? 

Or were you reading this stuff openly? 

Do you get the sense that your parents also maybe had a list of books they had access to at too young an age? (If so, I'd love to hear what those are, too.)

books,Average Books Read Per Year by Country 2024,"As an Italian, I’ve grown accustomed to hearing a common lament: *“No one reads anymore.”* It's a phrase that echoes through discussions about cultural habits, often paired with reports of dwindling readership statistics. So you can imagine my surprise when I recently stumbled upon a report claiming that Italy ranks fifth in the world for readership. Naturally, this raised a mix of curiosity and skepticism—can such a claim be trusted, or is it an anomaly amidst the usual narrative? While I remain cautious about the source, it did prompt me to reflect on the broader landscape of reading habits.

I’d love to hear from you: in your country, do you also sense a decline in readership, or perhaps a shift in the way people engage with books? Is there a growing preference for digital formats, or are traditional books still holding their ground? I find this topic fascinating, especially since it speaks not only to our personal habits but to the cultural and educational priorities of our societies. What’s your perception?

books,"Why is Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince, seen as controversial?","I read a poor translation of it 16 years ago, while in high school, and basically took nothing away from it. 

I recently bought a new copy, with a different translation, and reread it with a more adult perspective, and I'm both more and less confused than ever.

Less confused, because as a lover of history, I understand that Machiavelli was ""subtly"" throwing shade at quite a few people in Italy's ruling class, but more confused because there's nothing in there that should be deemed controversial by modern readers.

Aside from actual military advice, like the relevance of fortress cities like Pistoia, the stockpiling of military equipment, and supplies, the rest of the book is very basic in its advice.

* Treat your friends graciously, pay special attention to allies who may become enemies, and ensure you keep them on your good side. 

* Be good to your people. 

* Try to be charismatic. 

* Know the value of those around you, and leverage it. 

* Don't be a dick for no reason. 

* Don't let people walk over you. 

* ""Speak softly but carry a big stick"" (be a good diplomat, but be ready to go to war if you need to).

* If you need to deal with opposition, make sure it's dealt with decisively so they don't harbour resentment and come back later to try and harm you again.

Basically, the majority of the book is either advice your parents should have given you in high school, or advice you learn watching children's cartoons. I mean there's literally a part in there about being crafty like a fox, and strong as a lion... you could put that into a child's storybook, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone did.

books,[Swiss Family Robinson] Rereading this book as a modern reader was WILD ,"*Disclaimer: I've not read too many ""classics"" for most of my life, the only other exception aside from this book is Dracula, most of the time I read nonfiction. Please pardon if I'm not too familiar with the ""genre conventions"".* 



Back when I was about 10 or 12 years old, I had a copy of Swiss Family Robinson that eventually got ruined by me spilling a glass of milk on it. I have always been fascinated by survival stories of various kinds and had a fascination with zoology, so young me (as much as I could recollect) absolutely loved the book. Anyways, three weeks ago I decided to purchase a copy to see if it has held up after all these years. 

**Oh boy.** 

For the most part, despite being influenced by Robinson Crusoe with its castaway and survival setting, it really stood out to me the sheer lack of \*strife\* the family experienced. Aside from the initial event of the shipwreck and having to survive on an exotic tropical landscape, the family for the most part lives very comfortable lives as the island itself seems to spawn whatever kind of flora and fauna that would help them live comfortable lives. In the edition that I read, there are kangaroos, buffaloes, hippopotamus and a whole bunch more on a single island. 

What was even more darkly hilarious is that the characters never once lampshade on how weird this was, rather opting to shoot and consume any animals they come across (understandable given the context but lmao). A constant barrage of ""see new animal, shoot animal because we own this island now and we can do it"". 

The family themselves were ""interesting"". I'm gonna be honest, the dad was what I could only described as the ""platonic ideal"" of what a M A N should be. Not only he was so religiously devoted that he could quote the Bible rivaling that of a senior clergyman, but knows about every plants and animals, their uses and can build practically anything. The children were well, just there, mostly to make things happen by running around doing shenanigans. The mother meanwhile was barely a character, mostly there to smooth out whichever things that stumps the father. Overall though, there was a distinct lack of character arcs for any of them, no new revelations about each other, no one gets changed by anything that happened. They got stuck on that island for years, and left it none the worse for wear.

Ultimately, I'd say that the online reviews I read before reading the book really was correct, it TRULY FELT like a product of its time. The specifics are too much for a post, but the overall constant occurrence of overt religious theming of the family's mass exploitation of nature because god gave them dominion of it and the whole ""ideal parental figures"" as I've mentioned above. For me, it encapsulates quite a fair bit of the common worldview at the time it is written, but there were points where it felt like quasi-absurdist humor at times. In conclusion for those that wants to read/reread it, it was a fun read but be prepared for some occasional ""weirdness"". 

Tl;dr: People weren't kidding about it being ""a product of its time"" ",BattleMedic1918,1hbwgh0,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbwgh0/swiss_family_robinson_rereading_this_book_as_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbwgh0/swiss_family_robinson_rereading_this_book_as_a/,2024-12-11 15:49:15,2,0.75,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbwgh0

books,Fahrenheit 451 and Martial Law in South Korea,"Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books. Different people have different thoughts on what it's about. Is it about censorship? Is it a critique of Television? What makes it great is how versatile it is.  



One of the things that I think gets missed sometimes is what it can tell us about the nature of authoritarianism. First, however, I want to talk about some key scenes.  



On the second page of the story, Montag is heading home and we're told that he ""let the escalator waft him into the still night air."" Later, Mildred is listening to music through her ""tamped-shut ears, and her eye all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.""  


In each of these early scenes, air plays an important role in characterizing both Montag and Mildred. In Montag's case, him being wafted up the escalator shows his lack of agency. Later we learn he only even became a fireman because someone suggested he should be one. He didn't actually choose for himself. This is where he is at the beginning of the story, a man who isn't even aware of his lack of agency. I think many of us living in the world as it is feel similarly. It's easy to say, what can *I* do to make a difference? Why even bother trying? The more we think like this, the less we assert our agency, the less we're able to utilize our free will.  
 

In Mildred's case, this air imagery conveys her apathy. She can't be bothered to breathe because she is so bored and discontent. She knows something is wrong but can't put her finger on it, and that's why she takes too many sleeping pills and has to have her stomach pumped.  


Both of these scenes serve to show the impact living in an authoritarian, dystopian hellscape can have on people. It hollows you out and leaves you stuck, unable to pinpoint what's wrong and even less able to do something about it if you could.  



Here's where it ties into authoritarianism and tyranny. Fire is the symbol of authoritarian power in this world/story. The firemen are the enforcers, they're meant to be feared and respected. When the power of authoritarian rule makes itself felt on any citizen deemed problematic, that power is manifested through fire.  
 

So what Bradbury is saying is that the flame of authoritarianism/tyranny is sustained on the air of apathy and lack of agency.  
 

I think in light of how the people of South Korea stood together and said ""fuck this shit,"" and how quickly they organized and how immediate their success was, it's worth pointing out this subtle, easily missed, nugget of wisdom from Bradbury. We need to remember that people who strive to erect an authoritarian, tyrannical government designed for their own benefit depend on the indifference of the masses.",flyingjesuit,1hbw1yc,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,2024-12-11 15:31:32,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbw1yc

books,No more TBR?,"This year was the first year I really dove into book spaces online, and while I have always had a long TBR, I never had the sheer volume of suggestions coming at me as I have this year. I also did not have access to a public library until a couple of years ago and had limited money, so my reading was very limited to what I could actually buy on Kindle or the occasional bookstore trip. 

I was excited for a while to get into online book spaces and have access to more books through the library and a decent income, but I quickly became overwhelmed, and I'm thinking of scrapping the idea of a TBR altogether. There are still ""hidden gems"" I come across and think to note for later, but putting them on my TBR feels like a committment that just haunts me until I read them. However, navigating the world of books without a TBR feels daunting, despite doing it for most of my life and having a great time.

books,Reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac made very nostalgic for a time I never lived in ,"Disclaimer: I know, like most books in its vein, On the Road was sensationalized to a degree. I also understand that the Beat Generation was countercultural and Kerouac’s writings do not represent the general views of people of the 1950s. 

That being said, as a Gen-Z guy who recently finished this book, I was really struck by how unusual so many of the formative, chaotic experiences portrayed in this story would be in the America of today. On an obvious level, hitchhiking and carpooling with random people cross country are largely a thing of the past. I also found the characters rolling into random towns and instantly getting informal work as unrealistic. I mean, these days you have to submit an online resume for Walmart, and they’re also gonna run a background check, which would have severely hampered Dean’s employment opportunities. People also just take fewer chances now. Statistically, our generation uses way less drugs, has way less sex, and is a lot more cynical than the On the Road crew. 

But also on a deeper level, it feels like there’s a huge difference between what “finding yourself” involves now and what it involved then. Maybe more than in the late 40s and early 50s, people are expected to take their 20s to find themselves today. But you don’t really get lost anymore. People usually study abroad or see Europe through a tour company. If they go to Africa, it’s through a safari; Mexico is through a resort package. Even Mount Everest has somehow been commodified. And of course, for all of those trips you’ll be in constant contact with the outside world, have directions to everything on your smartphone, and be cataloguing the whole thing on social media. How many people are camping in the middle of the Mexican jungle on the roof of their car, as Dean and Sal did? Moreover, in contrast to the live  jazz clubs where Dean acted like an absolute madman, you’ll be paying $20+ covers to get in today’s clubs for the opportunity to stand around and take pictures of the light show while listening to remixes of 20 year old music. It’s like when the majority of people start to see young adulthood as a time of impulsive hedonism and self discovery, a framework for how that hedonism and self discovery is supposed to be done starts to emerge, and the whole thing feels a lot less adventurous. It becomes scheduled, ordered, and expensive—sometimes done more for others than yourself. Maybe adventure is still there, but it’s certainly way less messy. 

And I guess in more concrete terms, that’s what On the Road makes me nostalgic for: a time before we’d set out to remove all the messiness from life. In Kerouac’s day you could bounce around the West for a few years without having to worry so much about how the gap on your resume would look to employers. You could earn fine money living in the Dakotas and hitching rides to work on the harvests. People weren’t always connected; they couldn’t just Google how places looked, and when they went out on an adventure, it felt like they were really going into the unknown. Paradoxically, it feels like in a time that is seen as much more socially restrained, life could be much freer. 

The message I took out of On the Road was that, ultimately, the chaos of youth gives way to adult responsibilities. But, that doesn’t make the chaos pointless, unfulfilling, or wrong. It’s really a necessary step in development that challenges your preconceptions, puts your life in perspective, and gives you a concept of something beyond yourself before you do surrender to responsibility. I see the diminishment of this developmental phase and the commodification of chaos and adventure today as being a very unfortunate thing. Of course, Dean’s philosophy had major drawbacks (his general sexism and willingness to abandon women read pretty badly today), but I think the general point stands: adventure isn’t the same now as it was then. 

I would be interested in how others read the “beat” writers today, or, if any of you are of that generation, if you see this analysis as true. I think overall, while this book was definitely a product of its time, I found it to be very thought provoking and enjoyable, largely because of how well it captured spontaneous youthful exuberance and the atmosphere of the era.

For me, it's *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin. The title of the book is what pulled me in. It's directly quoted in the book as ""Light is the left hand of darkness, and darkness the right hand of light"". Its referring to the age old thought that light and dark need to exist together and you can't have one without the other.

books,1Q84-Haruki Murakami,"Just finished the novel yesterday. First of all, even though I say that every single I finish a long novel by Murakami, no matter how much doubt or hate he may be receiving as of late, it's an objectively challenging task to write a novel 1318 pages long and have the reader's boredom or weariness be minimal (or to be honest close to nonexistent) and he absolutely achieved that, so I take my hat off to him. Having said that, I found 1Q84 to be a particularly enjoyable and gripping page turner. This is not always necessary to make for an amazing read, and every novel that is enjoyable to read is not necessarily amazing, but if I'm being honest, the best reads are those in which those two qualities come together. That in my humble opinion of course. And 1Q84 certainly was one of those for me. As a reader I generally tend to believe that the journey is more importnant than the destination, but it would be a blatant lie to not admit that 1Q84 had one of the most satisfactory endings of any piece of fiction I've read in recent momory both from a somewhat objective literal standpoint and my personal view/interpretation/liking/preference of its characters and story&gt;! (with the exception of Ushikawa's death which I found totally unfair and frustrating but I guess that wonderful scene featuring the creation of an Air Chrysalis out of his dead body by the little people makes up for it).!&lt; All in all, despite the novel's main thesis being relatively simple and old as time (basically a slightly more sophisticated take on the whole concept of soulmates and the inescapability of fate), Murakami always has his special ways to make everything so magical, so vivid, multi layered and lively that even though it's not always entirely necessary, it's always what I want going into a novel of his. And it was welcome especially in this kind of novel which in my eyes is far less cold and distanced compared to other novels by Murakami and which demands its reader to surrender his own life a bit for the ones of it characters, for quite some time due to its length.  I guess that's all I wanted to say for now, but I would love what other people who have read it feel about it. Specifically I would also like to hear the other readers' opinions and thoughts on Fuka-Eri as a charcter and her significance to the story. To me, she really was the border that ended up bringing Tengo and Aomame together, but what I'm not sure about is whether this was her real mission from the very start.&gt;! Did the guys from Sakige, knowing that Leader would sooner or later die costing them the hearing of the voice, send Fuka-Eri just to bring these two together so that Aomame would produce in heir/a dohta to whom the ability would be passed (but why would that have to be Tengo's and Aomame's baby?) or was it just a coincidence, planned not by some human factor but simply the universe itself (if there is such a thing)?!&lt; Intrigued to hear your thoughts.",I-Like-What-I-Like24,1haf463,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1haf463/1q84haruki_murakami/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1haf463/1q84haruki_murakami/,2024-12-09 17:29:35,35,0.72,35,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haf463

books,Rumaan Alam's Entitlement is one of the worst things I have ever read,"I don't know how to describe how bizarre this book was. I was flabbergasted at least once per chapter. The Guardian's review was apt, the [NY Times review](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/books/review/entitlement-rumaan-alam.html) feels like it's full of lies and exagerrations. The reviewer couldn't possibly have thought this was a good book.

I enjoyed Leave the World Behind, I didn't love it, but it was an easy read and I found it thought-provoking. Entitlement feels like he was in a rush and didn't want to lose the book advance. It feels like it's all telling and not showing. The main character feels 2-dimensional and has only 5 people in her life-- she's not fleshed out at all. The elderly billionaire has a similarly narrow characterization-- nothing going on with him besides his wife and his new charity foundation. I think this guy would be a bit busier?

The writing style- which I don't remember being this confusing in LTWB-- is very irritating. He uses sentence fragments constantly, in a staccato pacing, which becomes tiresome. &gt;!And there were a few scenes where the reality of what happened is not made clear-- one in particular where the main character, Brooke, either hits a woman at a coffee shop or imagines she does, and I could not discern what actually happened, or whether this was supposed to be ambiguous on purpose.!&lt;

&gt;!The main problems were that the main character's arc felt so unreal that she just seems to have gone crazy or had a mental breakdown.. that's the only way to describe the sudden turn he character takes. It's sloppy. !&lt;Oh, also nothing really happens in the book. That seems to be the main complaint on Goodreads from the 2- and 3-star reviewers.

books,Maybe it's not all doom and gloom?,"I know there's been a lot of discussion on this subreddit about the downfall of reading. Kids aren't reading anymore. Everyone's attention span is shot. Booktok is ruining the book industry, etc. Media literacy is dead. But is it really that bad? Has the times really changed that much?

1. Kids aren't being assigned books anymore, just sections of books. And that's a shame, right? But I grew up in the 90's. We often didn't read the full assigned reading. There was immense pressure to have a high GPA, be in all honors/AP classes *and* be in like a million clubs and activities to impress college admission boards. We could Cliffnote our way through Crime and Punishment but not calculus and physics so that's where our time went. Some of us had to work jobs. Some of us had to watch our siblings because our parents worked a lot. Some of us just didn't want to. We did read some of it, but it was highly supplemented by Cliffnotes. 

Were there kids who read every single word of every single assigned books? Absolutely. They genuinely enjoyed reading and prioritized it. But was that all of us, or even most of us? No.

I'm old enough that the many of the English department heads are probably about my age. I can totally see them going, ""Let's be honest, we didn't read the whole book when we were their age, they're not going to read it.  Let's just assign them to read the crucial parts so they can understand the themes and the cultural impact."" 

2. Kids, and people, are reading just as much as ever, just not books. I am ***not*** (again, *not*) saying that reading chats, texts, comments, emails, subtitles, etc is anywhere near the same as reading a book. Of course it's not, they are two completely different form of reading. But our lives have gotten *significantly* more text based in a past few decades. For a lot of us, we probably read more than we speak or listen. Maybe the reason we read less is because we just need a break from written words. You know how when you're at a party, it's just nice to go to the bathroom and enjoy a break from all the noise? Maybe we're not getting stupider or less intellectually curious, we just need a break from text.

3. I don't think booktok is ruining the publishing industry, but I do think that the publishing industry figured out they can sell mass market quality books at paperback prices. Low effort books were always around, they were just mostly sold as mass market paperbacks. And while those still exist, I feel like there's far less of it because, thanks to booktok, publishers can sell them at paperback prices. Sure, the ""As Seen on Booktok"" section is taking up space but it's probably taking up the same amount of space the Harlequin romance books would've taken up twenty years ago.

4. Regarding media literacy, thirty years ago, if I had a stupid hot take on a book, the only person hearing about it are my friends, maybe my teacher if it's for school. Now if I have a stupid hot take online, several somebodies all over the world are shaking their head in disbelief. Has the ideas gotten stupider or has it just gotten much easier to get our stupid ideas out there.  There used to be gatekeepers (newspaper and magazine editors) but now anyone can voice their opinions on a public platform.

And speaking of stupid hot takes... Maybe I'm being naive and optimistic. Reading has changed significantly, for sure. I'm just not convinced that we, as a society, have gotten stupider. I do think that reading will become more of a niche hobby, but just because people are reading less books, does that mean that people are learning less? Being exposed to any less ideas? Being immersed in less worlds?",Anxious-Fun8829,1h9r8nx,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9r8nx/maybe_its_not_all_doom_and_gloom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9r8nx/maybe_its_not_all_doom_and_gloom/,2024-12-08 19:56:05,289,0.82,289,0,234,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9r8nx

books,"Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy. Yes, it seems you can read a book again for the first time.","I read this book for the first time in high school, which was over 30 years ago.  I remember really liking it but couldn't remember anything about it other than how the book jumped from character to character.  Now that I just finished reading it again, having forgotten nearly all of the details made it like reading it for the first time.

It's a little scary how nothing I read seemed even remotely familiar; I've usually been able to recall a fair amount of details from other books I've read, even ones from way back in childhood.

I highly recommend this one though, for anyone who likes techno-thrillers.  Anyone unfamiliar with the book, it takes place in the 1980s (contemporary to when it was written) and details a conventional war between the Soviet Union and NATO.

books,"I like Stephen King's ""Mr. Mercedes"".","I just wanted to read a thriller about a killer whose weapon would be a car. Although the machine is only used at the beginning, I liked the book.

Let's start with the plot. Someone hit a crowd of people at a job fair with a Mercedes a year ago and managed to get away with it. Now the killer is pestering retired police officer Bill Hodges with letters to kill himself. As a result, this motivates Bill to search for the killer. That's how intellectual games begin.

The first half of the book is a game of ""who is smarter"", because what is Bill, what is Mr. Mercedes are trying to outwit each other in different ways.

The second half is ""to make it to ..."", where the characters must manage to prevent a new crime of Mr. Mercedes.

Let's do without spoilers and briefly. The book turned out to be intense, especially towards the end. The author does not hide the identity of the maniac and at the beginning of the book shows who he is and how he thinks (and his name is Brady). In the first half, it was funny to read how Bill pranked the villain by saying that Brady is not the real Mr. Mercedes (and how it bombed him).

About the characters. Bill Hodges is not a very interesting character yet. I don't even have anything to say about him. His friend Jerome is a funny character. Such a cheerful, brave guy who likes to make the reader uncomfortable by jokingly speaking bad English (because he is black). Holly Gibney, a character who later acquires a own cycle, develops well in the second half from a sociophobic and insecure woman into a completely resolute and talkative (at least, talkative with Bill and Jerome).

Brady Hartsfield aka Mr. Mercedes turned out to be simultaneously cartoonishly angry, pathetic and menacing. Like, look, he's a racist, a sociopath, and he's only turned on by his mother. He gets angry when someone is happy. At the same time, he is quite smart, because he hides well under the guise of an ordinary guy, he gets along well with technology, and in the end he cunningly equipped his new weapon. And when something bad happened to him, I was happy with all my heart, because to hell with that asshole.

I like the author's writing style. This is a regular Stephen King text, that is, a lot of information, especially about the characters, which is easy to read. But the scenes where he describes sex are very uncomfortable.

All in all, a good thriller. He's intense, the villain is nasty, the writing style is good. Maybe not the best of this author, but definitely good.",mystery5009,1h9mvlj,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,2024-12-08 16:44:23,84,0.84,84,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h9mvlj
books,To Paradise-Hanya Yanagihara: Defying history to create a modern masterpiece,"**''We always think that we as individuals are responsible for shaping society. But what if actually society is shaping us?''**

Yanagihara's perception of history in this novel is totally decentered from individuality, an almost living, breathing entity, with her characters (of limited agency) being merely varied along in its wake. After all, To Paradise is a novel about all that history can take away from us: Our freedom, our dignity, our safety, our families, our loved ones (in Charlie's case in the third section of the novel even her literal emotional intelligence and critical thinking ability). But one thing it can not, argues Yanagihara: A series of certain fundemental desires too elemental to what humans are to simply be stamped out of humanity, no matter the society one may live in or how totalitarian a state may be: The desire to love, to be loved, to find affection, beauty and many more. And that has been proven true by human history for century after century, and hopefully will keep doing so. The three sections of the novel are seperated from one another by a century each. 100 years, no more, no less. The active years of the American experiment. The characters of the three sections who all share their first and last names, may be related, maybe not, may be echoes of one another, perhaps a remark about history repeating (or not) itself. Perhaps not. What is certain is that Yanagihara argues (and rightfully so) is that the idea of constant, almost perpetual progress, which is one of the main promises of modernity, is fundamentally non-compatible to the concept of history, and that periods of regression are inevitable. However, if she thinks regression is how it will all end, she doesn't say.

**Book 1-Washington Square:**

Drawing inspiration from Henry James' novel of the same name, Yanagihara twists (the old as time) concept of a marriage story to both to create a version of it which (defying the genre's standards) is not about a gendered association with money, but also the perfect opportunity for her to lay down American history, remove its puritanist, relegious spine, and set up what will be the start of her incredibly detailed reimagining of American history. Also, lots of interesting ideas about paradise actually being one's entitlement to making their own decisions about their own lives, no matter how foolish they may turn out to be. In the center of it all is a gripping story.

**Book 2-Lipo-Wao-Nahele:**

Divided into two sections. The first one dealing with AIDS crisis and the disctively human force (perphaps instict) which is present at every crisis and which drives us to keep on cling to life, to keep on fighting for the hapiness of us and our loved ones. I consider it worth mentioning that in this section, for the first time in any of her books, Yanagihara argues that this process may not be totally futile (I mean, no shit, but she really seems to belive that is the case on everything else she has ever written. Also, no matter how much she doesn't seem to embrace it, optimism suits her real well.). The second one is about the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, the impossibility of returning to state before colanization or contact, but also the enduring romance of it. I would say that the whole movement as well as the general feeling of an irreristible pull of a culture which you have never actually experienced and yet you mourn for all the time are approached with great compassion by Yanagihara.

**Book 3-Zone Eight:**

In a future that feels like a total regression in every sense of the word, driven by plauges and led by a totalitarian state, takes place the third and final section of the novel, narrated by two fundementally tragic characters, Charles and Charle. Charles is a tragic figure because he experienced a scientist's worst nightmare: He became one to contribute to society, to help people, but in a word where alutruism is no longer, appreciated or rewarded he seems to be punished for it. His discoveries and ideas are used to hurt people in the most morally dispicable ways, just for him to become hated by his own family for that, to end up trapped in a system to which's creation he once contributed thinking he was doing the right thing and to even lose his own lose (this is not a spoiler by the way). But what really makes him a tragic figure, is the fact that he experienced true hapiness, even for a relatively short amount of time, just to have it taken away from him without him being to blame, gradually, slowly, painfully, and have him live his remaining years mourning for its loss. Charlie on the other hand has never experienced something even remotely similiar to happiness and also lacks any prospect of ever doing so. And this is fundamentally tragic for a human being.

All in all, I can certainly say I'm in awe of both this wonderful and ambitious novel as well as Yanagihara as a writer. Both her ideas and prose are intruging and fabulous to me. Maybe the pacing of the novel is a bit off at times, but other than that I had no complaint about what this novel that I consider a masterwork and one of my favorite reads of the year. I have actually finished it for a month now but these 30 days or so were absolutely necessary for me to wrap my mind around the novel's scale and to properly articulate some of my thought and feelings on it (yup, this is just the tip of the iceberg).

books,Yet another post on Ulysses.,"As the title suggests, I am currently reading Ulysses by James Joyce. As of now, I’ve finished part 1. And what the hell am I reading?

It’s awful. Both in the technical and literary sense. From
What I’ve read so far, it follows a day in the life of a guy named Stephen Deadalus. An Irish Catholic who is sad because he is Irish and Catholic. As for the technical writing, I was able to follow it at first. The guy talks with his room-mates, and then goes to work as a teacher. After that, it’s like Joyce took acid, threw a bunch of non sequitar sentences at the page, and called it a day.

For example; 
“His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: Mouth to her womb. Oomb, all wombing tomb. His mouth mounded issuing-breath, unspeeched ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globes, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, Blast them. Old Deasy’s letter. Here. Thanking you for hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table rock and scribbled words. Thats twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter. 

That’s one paragraph. Using the same formatting as the book. As far as I can tell he might be looking at a woman? Maybe a prostitute? I can’t tell. 

Joyce chose to write at least ten pages like this. It’s a strange flow of consciousness that goes nowhere. Masters of an art can choose to break the rules. But is that really what happened here?

As for the plot, it’s not great. A little research before hand told me to look out for parallels with the odyssey. This is the closest I’ve been able to get. One of Deadalus’s housemates is an Englishman. It’s kind of like the suitors partying it up while Odysseus is away. 

What I have seen a lot more of is wasted potential. Now, I’m not going to explain the entirety of irelands subjugation. I’d need a history degree k don’t possess to do it justice. There’s a LOT there. But suffice to say that historically, England treated the Irish like second class citizens, going so far as to suppress their language and culture. 

Deadalus is angry about that. However, he is bunking up with possibly the only Englishman who gives a damn. The guy only views it as a trifle, but he wants to know about Gaelic language and culture! Instead of taking the opportunity to educate the man, potentially create a linguistic record, and influence his views, Deadalus considers him to be a nuisance. As if he is somehow trying to usurp the culture. 

This is exemplified during a scene with a milk maid. The Englishman asks if she knows any Gaelic phrases. She asks if he means Irish, and then says no. Deadalus spends the next paragraph thinking about how awful the woman is, because (paraphrasing) her genitals are not like gods genitals and are like the genitals of eve which were tempted and are sinful. (Please note Deadalus is supposed to be a reflection of Joyce) 

(As a small aside, this would be a good place to note that Deadalus has no actual faith. He follows cultural norms, and Thats about it. Except when he can demean women. That seems to be an exception)

Continuing on the theme of wasted opportunity, he goes on to his job as a teacher. There, he sees a student he thinks is similar to himself. As previously stated, he is upset about the loss of Irish culture. As a teacher, he has an opportunity to guide the next generation. Maybe Instill them with some of that language and culture. But he doesn’t. He just teaches them the bare curriculum and sends them in their way. 

It shouldn’t be his job to solve the cultural suppression. Realistically, there isn’t much he can do. But he doesn’t even really seem to make much of an effort. It’s like he’s angry that it’s raining, but doesn’t even bother seeking cover. 

All of this tells a story about a mopey man who has no hope. Not every protagonist should be sympathetic. But so far it’s like reading about paint drying. Instead of a character whose goals I can support, I’m reading about a husk with little to no direction or drive. It’s neither entertaining, nor does it seem to convey any particular message. 

So that leaves me with the question, what is all the hype about? Does it suddenly get better in part 2? I read reviews calling it one of the greatest novels of all time. But about two thirds of what I read so far is barely coherent, let alone “great”

So what am I missing? Am I just not smart enough to see genius buried under the gibberish? I’m willing to believe that. But if Joyce purposefully hid the art and quality, he did a good job of it with words like “contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality”.",cain11112,1hatf4o,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hatf4o/yet_another_post_on_ulysses/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hatf4o/yet_another_post_on_ulysses/,2024-12-10 04:17:05,0,0.32,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1hatf4o

books,"Faust's Death (Faust Part II, Goethe)","I have been reading Goethe's second part of his most famous verse tragedy ""Faust"", and I have always been fascinated with the Faust's final scene in the fifth act (*Grosser Vorhof des Palasts; The courtyard of Faust's palace).* In this scene we see a blinded Faust (he was blinded in the previous scene by the personification of Depression; ""*Curae""* in latin) walking towards Mephistopheles and his ""Cronies"" (Lemuren; Lemures, ancient roman spirits of death); he quickly lounges into a long speech about progress, happiness and utopic desires (which most 20th century writers and philosophers have interpreted as a ""capitalistic"" desire which Faust tries to apply towards his subjects). During this speech he pronounces the ill-fated words of his deal (*""verweile doch, du bist so schön!; ""stay a while, you are so lovely!"")* and promptly falls on the ground, dead. I have always loved this scene because of its beautiful nature and because I love Goethe as an author in general. What do you guys think?

Anyway, I think I'll leave a copy of Faust's last speech right under here: ""*Ein Sumpf zieht am Gebirge hin, Verpestet alles schon Errungene; Den faulen Pfuhl auch abzuziehn, Das Letzte wär das Höchsterrungene. Eröffn’ ich Räume vielen Millionen, Nicht sicher zwar, doch tätig-frei zu wohnen. Grün das Gefilde, uchtbar; Mensch und Herde Sogleich behaglich auf der neusten Erde, Gleich angesiedelt an des Hügels Krat, Den aufgewälzt kühn-emsige Völkerschaft. Im Innern hier ein paradiesisch Land, Da rase draußen Flut bis auf zum Rand, Und wie sie nascht, gewaltsam einzuschießen, Gemeindrang eilt, die Lücke zu verschließen. Ja! diesem Sinne bin ich ganz ergeben, Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluß: Nur der verdient sich Freiheit wie das Leben, Der täglich sie erobern muß. Und so verbringt, umrungen von Gefahr, Hier Kindheit, Mann und Greis sein tüchtig Jahr. Solch ein Gewimmel möcht ich sehn, Auf freiem Grund mit freiem Volke stehn. Zum Augenblicke dürft ich sagen: „Verweile doch, du bist so schön! Es kann die Spur von meinen Erdetagen Nicht in Äonen untergehn.” — Im Vorgefühl von solchem hohen Glück Genieß ich jetzt den höchsten Augenblick.""*

*English version:* A swamp lies there below the hill,

Infecting everything I’ve done:

My last and greatest act of will

Succeeds when that foul pool is gone.

Let me make room for many a million,

Not wholly secure, but free to work on.

Green fertile fields, where men and herds

May gain swift comfort from the new-made earth.

Quickly settled in those hills’ embrace,

Piled high by a brave, industrious race.

And in the centre here, a Paradise,

Whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,

And though it gnaws to enter in by force,

The common urge unites to halt its course.

Yes, I’ve surrendered to this thought’s insistence,

The last word Wisdom ever has to say:

He only earns his Freedom and Existence,

Who’s forced to win them freshly every day.

Childhood, manhood, age’s vigorous years,

Surrounded by dangers, they’ll spend here.

I wish to gaze again on such a land,

Free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand.

Then, to the Moment I’d dare say:

‘Stay a while! You are so lovely!’

Through aeons, then, never to fade away

This path of mine through all that’s earthly. –

Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,

Now I savour it, that highest moment.

books,An apocalyptic pandemic as imagined in 'The Scarlet Plague' by Jack London (1912) - a short and gripping novel.,"It is quite difficult to choose some words to begin this review. Let's say that the novel gripped me with its fast pace. An almost cinema-like dynamism - the descent of civilization into chaos, through a combination of visceral panic and despair, spred like a fire, devouring everything around - and *a fire* it was, as the onset of *Scarlet Plague* brought forth the innate instincts of self-destruction - murder, looting, arson. For, if once the unexpected symptoms appear, it takes the microbes only hald an hour to turn a healthy man into rotting corpse, people seek either salvation - fruitless endeavors, as it turned - or accept their fate and set the world ablaze as a final act of will. 

A dystopian, magnate-ruled society of the 21st America (as it was imagined by a *Belle Epoque* writer) could not withstand the catastrophe. A rigid class system to be torn down, all of the intricacies of progress to be annulled by a single flash of Plague - in just a week! No wonder that the narrator, now an old, sickly man, the last alive witness of *the end*, recalls the events of the long ago with tears and trepidation. 

Jack London imagined an absolute catastrophe, that would leave a score of people alive - deserting all knowledge of civilisation and turning to a primitive way of life within a geberation. One might consider this interpretation a little naive - but the tale nevertheless retained its strong grip on me from the first moment to the last. And it is short - no more than eighty pages.

books,No Spoiler Review: The Riyria Revelations by Michael J Sullivan,"First time poster, I generally read a series every week to two weeks depending on other tasks and felt like sharing so those wondering if they should grab that whole series at the bookstore or just the first book can make a more informed decision. 

The Riyria Revelations is a three book series following the thieving duo of Riyria; Royce and Hadrian. They are contracted for a job that turns their lives, and the world, upside down. Enjoy a twist on familiar fantasy themes, succinct but detailed combat sequences, and world building that rivals RR Martin and Anthony Ryan in scope if not detail. 

I don't like star reviews, because books deserve more than that. 

I rate this as a Good Read. The books are thick, detailed, and have just enough uniqueness to let them stand apart from the traditional fantasy fare. 

The plot was convoluted but tied up nicely with several twists that caught me off guard. Despite being self published, the quality of editing is superb, and I feel that it gives the writing more authenticity. If you love Tolkien's work with description, Sullivan accomplishes the same effect with dialog between the characters that pulls the reader deeper into the story and the arcs of the various characters. 

I loved this series for the storytelling through dialog and Sullivan's take on the traditional fantasy peoples of elves, goblins, dwarves, and humans. 

If you're a fantasy fanatic or even a casual consumer, this is a fantastic series that you should definitely grab as a set. If you're looking to jump into fantasy I would recommend picking up something a bit shorter, but it's not quite as beefy as The Raven's Shadow series or Night Angel Chronicles. Regardless, I would put this on the ""To Read"" shelf. 

If you've read this series, what other things would you say about it? And if you pick it up, come back and comment what you thought.

books,Life among the aliterate (a small rant),"In terms of aliterate, I mean people who know how to read, but don't care to. A familiar quote, ""I had to read in college (or high school) but I don't need to anymore.""

I grew up in a household of readers and have family who are still voracious readers.

20 years ago, I moved from a major Northern U.S. metropolis to a major Southern U.S. metropolis.

In my former home everyone I knew read all the time - different stuff, but they read. Poor people, rich people - for most it had been a lifetime avocation. And they did love reading.

When I moved, my partner (who was a former publishing person like me) and me continued our reading adventure. 

But NO ONE is our social circle reads here. Not books, not anything. Our friends don't even have books in their homes. They come to our house and see the books crammed in the 6 big bookcases and usually the first comment is ""Did you read all of these?"" - like it's some aberrant thing, like it's an impossible thing to do.

And they seem suspicious - like, what kind of person would read those books? Definite suspicions about the science books...

I get the impression that if the books were replaced with sports memorabilia, everything would appear normal to them.

I have learned not to talk about my love of reading. I know they will never understand. It's kind of lonely except for the reddit connections - and then, that's just shorthand for any real discussion about anything substantial.

At least my partner still reads - much more than me.

I agree with this very rude plea from noted director and author, John Waters:  
**“**&gt;!If you go home with somebody, and they don't have books, don't fuck 'em!!&lt;**”** “It wasn't until I started reading and found books they wouldn't let us read in school that I discovered you could be insane and happy and have a good life without being like everybody else.”",BigJobsBigJobs,1h86yrm,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,2024-12-06 17:40:26,467,0.8,467,0,406,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h86yrm
books,"""One does not read a book: one can only reread it"" - V. Nabokov","I finished my first time through *The Brothers Karamazov* (the Katz translation; excellent, btw) on December 2. 

Noted weirdo Vladimir Nabokov said once that one doesn't read a book, one only *re*reads it. It's his fancy way of saying that the first time through a book doesn't really count, since the reader is mostly just trying to make sense of the scale and dimensions of the story. It's the reread where the book starts to really reveal itself to the reader. 

So, I picked up the McReynolds translation (from Norton*) and started the introduction tonight (December 6 -- this will be relevant in two shakes).

[* The McReynolds is worth it if only for the ""Names in *The Brothers Karamazov*,"" which goes into the etymological roots of the names.]

In the introduction she mentions two scenes that I have *absolutely* no memory of (both quotes come from p viii in the Norton Critical Edition):

1) ""But we also share Ivan's indignation as he recounts the tale of Richard, whose life was taken away twice -- once, symbolically, by the biological parents who gave him away as chapel to some shepherds, and then by his social family, his fellow citizens of geneva, who chop off his head in brotherly fashion.""

2) ""We reel from the vision of the naked, terrified little boy ripped apart by hunting dogs before his mother's eyes.""

So, in conclusion: if you love a book once, it's probably worth reading twice, because what if you, too, don't remember two horrible deaths?

books,I finished Wuthering Heights and am very confused,"I don't understand why this book is held in such high regard. All of the characters are so unrealistic. The elder Catherine and Heathcliff are so emotionally volatile it's ridiculous, the younger Cathy and Linton are also unstable and unsympathetic. I feel bad for everyone, but the main characters are so cruel to each other it's hard to care about anyone. 

Heathcliff is just a monster with no redeeming qualities. His behavior is inexcusable. And apparently, some see this book as romantic because of Heathcliff and Catherine's obsession with each other. 

This book is so depressing. All of these people's lives are lived in abuse and misery because of Heathcliff. I don't mean that every book has to be happy to be enjoyable, but there's a feeling of pointlessness to all this suffering. I feel like I got nothing out of this book other than a sense of hopelessness. 

I wouldn't say it's valuable commentary on human nature since the characters behave in such extreme ways that it's almost inhuman. 

I know I'm looking at it through a modern lens of everyone being traumatized and thus traumatizing each other and wanting for there to be some sort of redemption or recovery that isn't present.

books,"I went through a phase where I collected tons of books to keep on my shelves, and it had a negative impact on me. I want to talk about it in case anyone else has experienced the same thing. ","I love books. I always have. Not just reading them, but looking at them, holding them, feeling them, turning the pages, admiring the covers, seeing them displayed on my bookshelves so prettily, reorganizing my shelves. Books are art to me. Over the past few years one of my main hobbies was exploring used bookstores for fantasy, science fiction, lit fic, history, and poetry. I live in an area with many amazing ones and I would spend hours on my days off exploring them and learning about all the authors I wanted to read. The vast majority of my collection is used books and I often would only be spending a few dollars on one book even for very popular authors and that’s how I justified to myself that it was ok I was doing all this buying.

I told myself that I was ""collecting,"" which was a very different thing than hoarding in my mind. Books are my hobby, right? So it's okay that I collected so many.

I had this notion that I was building a little library for myself, a beautiful display that I could always go to and find my next read. However, this did not work out the way I thought it would. I enjoyed my time collecting these books very much but over the past week or so I've had to confront the negative impact this has had on me personally.

Problem 1: If a new release came out that I really wanted to read, one of two things would happen. One: I wouldn’t let myself read the new release because I knew I had so many books on my shelf. I needed to get to the ones I already owned. Two: I would read the new release and feel this creeping sense of guilt that I had just spent money or spent time on yet another book when I already owned hundreds at home.

Problem 2: My taste in genre had a rather drastic evolution this past year. I had been collecting mainly fantasy as that has been my lifelong literary interest. But this past year historical romance took over my reading and I began collecting that genre too. I adore my fantasy collection and I have good memories of exploring certain used bookstores that I love dearly, but the genre switch took my a bit by surprise.

Problem 3: I discovered my love of audiobooks this past year. I was a person who could never do audiobooks for some reason, my brain just would not focus on the story, and so I really thought I would be reading all these physical books. Well, not sure how it happened, but something changed in me and now I LOVE audiobooks. I find myself searching for a good audiobook more than a physical book now.

Problem 4: Looking at my shelves started to make me feel like a hoarder. I own enough books for the next five years and when I don't even know where I'll be living during that time and when libraries exist, there's no logical reason for me to own that many. The joy of going to a bookstore is gone for me now, and the only way to get that back is to simplify what I own so one day I will have an actual reason to go book shopping. The thing I once loved so much, I began to see as clutter, and that makes me sad. I don’t want to see books as clutter anymore, and the only way to prevent that is to literally de-clutter my bookshelf and therefore de-clutter my mind.

And so now as I write this there are four large bags of books by my shelves ready to be taken to a used bookstore or a thrift store over the weekend. Something snapped in me last week and I sat down in front of my shelves and just started pulling books down and putting them into the bags and it was as if my mind just knew which ones I didn’t need anymore.

I will no longer buy a book because “this looks really interesting and I’ll read it someday.” I will no longer buy a book because it has a gorgeous cover. I will no longer buy a book just because it's been on my TBR for a while and I found a cheap copy.

The reason I wanted to post this is that I know there are other people who struggle with this ""collector"" mindset the same way I do where you get that little thrill of buying books to add them to your shelves and you justify it to yourself because, in the moment, it really does make you happy and you really think you will read it soon or someday in the future.

This is just my personal experience. If you own a home with a personal library with hundreds of books and that brings you joy then that is AWESOME. We're all different, and I'm having to face the fact that who I am as a reader has changed drastically, and that's okay.",FusRoDaahh,1h85uop,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h85uop/i_went_through_a_phase_where_i_collected_tons_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h85uop/i_went_through_a_phase_where_i_collected_tons_of/,2024-12-06 16:53:13,374,0.84,374,0,177,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85uop

books,The best thing that ever happened to me ...,"So…. this happened on a Sunday when I was extremely bored and I'm the kind of person who chooses books over anything to get rid of boredom. When I was scrolling through Goodreads, I laid eyes on a book with some kind of a crucifix on its cover. I immediately picked that book (this was approximately 2 weeks back). I knew it was a series and my initial plan was to read a single book. 

As I started the first book, within a few chapters I fell in love with the characters, Robert Hunter and Carlos Garcia. So after completing the first book in a day or two (which is way faster than my usual speed, considering I work on week days), I decided to proceed with the series. Now here I am, I finished the whole series in 2 weeks and I'm craving for more books by Carter. After this I can easily say that Chris Carter will forever be my favourite author and Robert Hunter, my favourite protagonist. 

Every book in the series was intriguing and brutal. In my opinion, if gore outweighs the actual content, it might become a negative in itself but here it works the opposite way. Apart from how the killer is found, the mystery behind why the crime is committed in a certain way and the motive for such brutality, are points of great interest in every book. 

Leaving these aside, there's a book in this series called An Evil mind. I was completely blown away by it. I never imagined that Carter could create an antagonist who is as powerful as Hunter.  But Lucien Folter overshadowed Hunter and he's the best antagonist according to me ( including every book and movie I have ever watched). 

I'm now anticipating the release of the next book in the series. I know it might take a year for the next book release so I'm planning to re-read the available books once more. I was not in a great mental state when I just started this series and Carter offered me the much needed distraction. Currently I'm at least one step better because of him and I'm grateful for that.",Alternative-Bit-999,1h8lpzr,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8lpzr/the_best_thing_that_ever_happened_to_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8lpzr/the_best_thing_that_ever_happened_to_me/,2024-12-07 05:37:58,9,0.61,9,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8lpzr

books,"Dark Evenings: ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" by Dean Koontz.","And now the fourth Dean Koontz book that I've been reading for the past few days is now complete tonight! ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" is that novel.

We meet Amy Redwing, a woman who has devoted her entire life to rescuing dogs. But there is a unique bond that she shares with a golden retriever named Nickie, a dog she had saved in a very dangerous encounter, one that is really deep.

But in one night, this loyalty will be put to the test, and they will prove to each other how far they can go--even when the stakes turn deadly.

This one's pretty similar to another Koontz novel ""Hideaway"", as it is a thriller mixed with the supernatural. It might not be as original as one would think, but I still found it pretty decent enough to find it enjoyable.

Koontz has written a lot, with some being either great or really decent, and ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" fits into the decent category. Most would say that his writing has become repetitive, but for me they're still enjoyable. Not really deep, but incredibly satisfying. And now that I've had my quota of Koontz for now, it's time to move on to another book by a different author, or authors in this case, as this one is written by two authors.",i-the-muso-1968,1h8je8d,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8je8d/dark_evenings_the_darkest_evening_of_the_year_by/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8je8d/dark_evenings_the_darkest_evening_of_the_year_by/,2024-12-07 03:20:23,8,0.7,8,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8je8d
books,God emperor of dune is so interesting ,"I loved this book. I loved leto’s ramblings and I loved moneo. And I loved the way the golden path is explained. 

But this book had a few major issues for me. 

The biggest is the dialogue. Half the time I had no idea wtf anyone was talking about. The other half, the dialogue felt so robotic. And the emotion is so unreadable. Also, I’ve never seen anyone use as many exclamation points as frank herbert. Especially when they’re not needed or when they don’t fit the scene and emotion. A character doesn’t cry but exclaims. A character can be trying to say something quietly but there’s an exclamation mark. It sends so many mixed signals that it’s hard to tell what’s happening. I swear there’s at least one exclamation point in every paragraph. 

The second is that everyone except Leto is very flat.  Hwi noree and Duncan and moneo and siona could have been so interesting but they are barely explored. And these characters barely show emotion besides anger. The only exception is Hwi. But she is written to be crying in response to almost anything that Leto says. No matter what he says. Leto could say “man, it sucks to be a dictator” and she just starts bawling for no reason. 

One last thing: Hwi and Duncan had zero chemistry. Idk why their love was even included. Especially because it makes no sense in the context of the plot and had no impact on the plot. Presumably Duncan met Hwi once “off screen.” And the next time we see them, they just have sex. Like wtf. That came out of nowhere. And it’s not like their love has any impact on the plot because their relationship is ignored by Leto. Siona doesn’t give a shit. And moneo acts like it’s blasphemy but doesn’t do anything to stop them other than just saying stop. 

Also I would have liked to see leto’s ‘peace’ explored a bit more. How did his atrocities compare to his father. Paul’s ascension to the throne caused the death of 61 billion. How much did leto’s stagnation of progress do? The stagnation of medicine, of ecological developments, of new helpful technology, etc.

Whether it's related to guilt over my participation in recent Black Friday sales, the need to make space for a proper kids' playroom, or a long-simmering reckoning against too many material possessions--I am considering significantly downsizing my book collection.

Literature (writing and reading) is largely my main hobby in life, but I am starting to look at my bookshelves and wonder, ""Do I really need that book?"" I recently began purchasing the odd ""fine press"" edition of favourite books (its own form of excess, I know, but hear me out) and it got me thinking about the worth I place on my \~1,000 books. Do I want to keep books that weren't life-changing, 5-star reads, just so I can hoard like some literary goblin who gets to point and say to guests, ""See, I read lots!""?

Has anyone else gone through a sort of reckoning like this? Did you sell them to recoup some of the costs over the years/decades, or just donate them? How did you go about downsizing--clear everything that wasn't an absolute favourite? Hold the ones that were 4 stars that others might enjoy? Hold onto classics just because they are classics? Hold onto rare or expensive or sentimental?

books,just finished “lonesome dove” and i am crying ,"i am so sorry for this rant but i have to get this off of my chest 😭😭

wow wow wow wow. i am completely in awe of this book. this is an understatement.

first off, i don’t really read western type of books. i mostly stick to classics, literary fiction, short stories, YA (every once in a while), etc. the only “western” author i read was cormac mccarthy. i LOVED “no country for old men” and “the road” (to be honest , those are the only books i read from mccarthy lol). and i also tend to read shorter books because of my attention span 😩

but every once in a while, i like to challenge myself. in the beginning of this year, i decided to try “war and peace” and was blown away by it.

i decided to finish this year off with a long book but i wasn’t sure which one. then i saw a bunch of people on my goodreads and reddit feed praising “lonesome dove.” i got curious. i figured that if i didn’t like it, i could always dnf.

let me just say—i never thought of dnfing this book. from the first sentence i was HOOKED!! the writing style was so vivid and raw without being tedious. mcmurtry’s writing style was honest and interesting. every single character had their own way of speaking and mannerisms it was incredible. all the characters were fleshed out; they came across like actual people from that time period. 

i loved all of the characters (except jake spoon). my favorite ones were gus, newt and lorena. i think that with these characters, mcmurtry’s writing style was the most powerful. i loved how he treated lorena with grace—he didn’t treat her like many of the men treated her (and other prostitutes). and on that note, he also treated minorities (like the native americans and black people) with respect—meaning, not rudely or even “special.” as a black woman reading this, i had to brace myself. i thought mcmurtry would paint the native americans, prostitutes and black people as either evil, mary sues who could do no wrong, or just victims. but he didn’t do that. he was realistic. just like the white men in the story, these minority groups had the potential for being good, neutral or bad. they were all humans. he was realistic. i hope this makes sense.

mcmurtry was so skillful that i felt like i was physically in the story with his characters, traveling with them, roping horses, etc. it was so good that i was thinking about learning how to ride a horse and channel my inner cowboy 🤠 

what i loved the most about this story was the narrative style. it wasn’t choppy. it was the perfect blend between dialogue and description. that was my biggest concern when i thought about reading this book. i was scared that this big book would have either just dialogue or tedious descriptions. but it was a perfect combination of both. i know this is minor to most people but this issue had led me to dnf so many books during my (short) lifetime.

i also liked how mcmurtry approached this time period. i’m not crazy about historical fiction (i tend to get bored), but he did a fantastic job. it made me curious to actually learn more about this time period.

mcmurtry captured leaving and staying in places so well. as someone who moved around, so much of his characters’ journey resonated with me. there was a sense of excitement for a new place and yet a loneliness in that that resonated with me. i might have cried during the last chapter.

and im so sad that now this journey is over. i was dragging my feet a little towards the last few chapters because i quite literally didn’t want to finish the book. but now it’s done. while i have left this beautiful story, i suspect that the story will not leave me.

and this quote below perfectly describes the book and my feelings about finishing it:

""It's funny, leaving a place, ain't it?"" he said. ""You never do know when you'll get back.""

books,Unreliability in Penance by Eliza Clark,"I really enjoyed this book and am continuing to think about it, but I'm realizing there isn't a lot of payoff for the framing narrative/unreliable narrator-- the points where he's being self-serving or antagonistic are usually pretty clear during his first-person sections and the interviews he conducts, and looking for distortions or lies in his invented sections hasn't borne anything for me. It seems like Clark is using him as a justification for the more straightforward prose sections &amp; as a good conduit for the themes (e.g. the reveal at the end that he &gt;!obtained and published the girl's first-hand accounts illegally!&lt;), but that overall his perspective doesn't influence the 'truth' of the story Clark is telling very much.

books,Dune: My Personal Journey,"Frank Herbert’s Dune series is one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written. It’s sprawling, philosophical, and deeply complex, full of political intrigue, ecological insights, and questions about power and destiny. What makes the series so remarkable, though, isn’t necessarily the strength of each individual book. None of them, for me, are among the best books I’ve ever read. But taken together, the *Dune* Frank Herbert’s *Dune* series is one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written. It’s sprawling, philosophical, and deeply complex, full of political intrigue, ecological insights, and questions about power and destiny. What makes the series so remarkable, though, isn’t necessarily the strength of each individual book. None of them, for me, are among the best books I’ve ever read. But taken together, the *Dune* series is absolutely one of the best series I’ve ever experienced. The sum is truly greater than its parts.

My journey with *Dune* has been a mix of awe, frustration, and moments of profound reflection. Add to that Denis Villeneuve’s stunning movie adaptations, and *Dune* has become more than just a series for me—it’s a world I’ve lived in, thought about, and will never forget.

# Dune: A Masterpiece of World-Building

The first book, *Dune*, is where it all begins, and it’s undeniably fantastic. Herbert’s ability to create a universe so layered, so alive, is unparalleled. Arrakis feels like a character in its own right, and the interplay between the Fremen, the spice, and the sandworms is unforgettable. Paul Atreides’ rise to power as the prophesied leader of the Fremen, Muad’Dib, is a fascinating and deeply human story set against a backdrop of galactic-scale politics and intrigue.

That said, while *Dune* is a towering achievement in science fiction, it doesn’t quite crack my personal “best books ever” list. It’s not perfect—it can be dense and slow in places—but it’s so unique, so rich, that it’s impossible not to be swept away by its vision.

Watching Denis Villeneuve’s *Dune: Part One* before reading the book brought that world vividly to life for me. I saw *Dune Part One* on a whim. I hadn’t heard of *Dune* before that as I was really just getting into reading at the time. The movie’s stunning cinematography, Hans Zimmer’s otherworldly score, and the pitch-perfect performances elevated the story. Seeing Arrakis, the spice fields, and the sandworms on the big screen made diving into the book much easier than it would have been otherwise.

# Dune Messiah: Smaller, But Powerful

The second book, *Dune Messiah*, takes the grandeur of *Dune* and turns it inward. It’s a quieter, more introspective story, following Paul Atreides as he grapples with the consequences of his rule and the prophecy that has shaped his life.

This book has a tragic quality that I really appreciated. Paul is no longer the bright young leader we met in *Dune*. He’s a man weighed down by the cost of his power, haunted by the violent acts committed in his name. It’s not as expansive or as immediately gripping as *Dune*, but it adds incredible depth to the series.

# Children of Dune: Uneven but Necessary

*Children of Dune* bridges the original trilogy and the dramatic shift that happens later in the series. It focuses on Paul’s children, Leto II and Ghanima, as they grapple with their father’s legacy and the path their lives must take.

This novel was a mixed bag for me. Some parts dragged, and the pacing felt off at times, but there were also flashes of brilliance—especially Leto II’s evolution into the figure who will dominate the series’ future. While I didn’t enjoy it as much as *Dune* or *Dune Messiah*, it contains important moments that make it a necessary part of the saga. One of the most powerful of these is Alia’s tragic conclusion. As the regent of the Imperium, she struggles to maintain control over her mind as the voices of her ancestors, particularly the malevolent influence of her grandfather, Baron Harkonnen, take over. Her internal battle becomes unbearable, and she descends into madness, growing paranoid and tyrannical. Ultimately, facing the loss of her power and the imminent threat of the Fremen turning against her, Alia chooses to end her life by jumping from the window of the Keep. This act is both a tragic surrender to her fate and a final attempt to free herself from the Baron’s control.

# God Emperor of Dune: A Bold Pivot

*God Emperor of Dune* is where the series takes a massive leap forward. Thousands of years have passed, and Leto II, now a human-sandworm hybrid, rules over humanity as a godlike figure.

This book is incredibly divisive, but I loved it. It’s philosophical, strange, and deeply introspective. Leto’s vision for humanity, his Golden Path, and his musings on power and sacrifice make for a fascinating, if slower, read. Herbert’s willingness to completely reimagine the series at this point is part of what makes *Dune* such an ambitious and singular work.

# Heretics of Dune: The Low Point

This is where the series stumbled for me. *Heretics of Dune* introduces new characters and factions, and the story feels disconnected from the earlier books. It was a slog to get through, and I found myself struggling to stay invested.

That said, it’s not skippable. It sets up the events of *Chapterhouse: Dune*, and without that connection, the final book wouldn’t have the same impact. Still, if it didn’t directly tie into the ending, I’d be tempted to tell readers to skip it.

# Chapterhouse: Dune: A Strong Finish

Thankfully, the series picks up again with *Chapterhouse: Dune*. This book focuses heavily on the Bene Gesserit, and their intricate scheming and power plays make for a compelling read. The story felt tighter and more engaging than *Heretics*, and it served as a satisfying conclusion to the series.

The final chapter, though, is what sticks with me the most. The mysterious old man and woman who appear at the end add an enigmatic layer to the story. It’s an open-ended, haunting conclusion that leaves you with more questions than answers—exactly the kind of ending that fits the sprawling, complex nature of *Dune*.

# The Movies: Dune: Part One and Part Two

Denis Villeneuve’s movies have been a revelation. *Dune: Part One* was a masterpiece, capturing the heart of the first half of the book with stunning visuals and a deep respect for Herbert’s world.

When I finally saw *Part Two*, it was everything I hoped it would be. The movie picks up seamlessly where the first left off, showing Paul’s transformation into Muad’Dib and the Fremen’s fight against the Harkonnens. The final confrontation with Feyd-Rautha was intense and satisfying, and the visuals were breathtaking.

Chani’s role was expanded beautifully, and her relationship with Paul felt authentic and poignant. The political tension, the weight of destiny, and the sheer spectacle of Arrakis came through so vividly. Zimmer’s score was once again extraordinary, and Villeneuve proved he could handle the more action-heavy second half of the story while keeping the depth intact. 

Although there were some major departures, I think Denis Villeneuve truly understands the spirit of Dune. His passion for the source material is clear to see when watching his films. These two adaptations were perfect in my opinion. I can't wait to see what he brings for Dune Messiah.

# Final Thoughts

The *Dune* series is an unforgettable journey. Each book has its strengths and weaknesses, but together, they form a singular, monumental work of science fiction. The individual novels may not rank among my all-time favourites, but as a series, *Dune* is one of the best I’ve ever read.

Villeneuve’s films have only enhanced that experience, bringing the world of Arrakis to life in ways I never imagined possible. Whether you’re reading the books, watching the movies, or doing both, *Dune* is an experience that stays with you long after it’s over—a testament to Herbert’s vision and the enduring power of science fiction. But this is a story for everyone, not just fans of science fiction. It’s a brilliant reflection of humanity and is a story worth investing your time in.",Sudden-Database6968,1h5c1lb,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5c1lb/dune_my_personal_journey/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5c1lb/dune_my_personal_journey/,2024-12-03 01:42:34,77,0.76,77,0,45,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5c1lb
books,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time - Thoughts after reading,"Initially, I was enjoying the book a lot. I liked the way Christopher thought - it was, in some ways, like a fresh breath of air. There was a point when I thought the book would get 5 stars from me...

Then I learned that Christopher's mother cheated, and that's bad. (I know it's not so black-and-white, but even after finishing the book, I couldn't find the mother redeemable.) A few pages later we learn the mother is actually still alive and the father hid her letters. I might be able to see where he was coming from, but that's just plain wrong. And killing a dog because your neighbor loves the dog more than you? Unforgiveable.

Yet it was obvious that the dad loved Christopher, so it was very frustrating to see him just shut his father out. And when Christopher ran away from home...I lost my sympathy towards him. (It was especially frustrating when he needed to catch a tube but was too terrified and kept missing them.)

I guess we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards the narrator, but I couldn't. I did feel bad for the father though (which may be contrasting to how I called his actions 'unforgiveable', but it is what it is). It's just funny (and frustrating) that what I thought would be a 5-star read ended up being a 2-star read.

At the end of the day, I do not get the hype around the book. Maybe I'm looking for someone in the comments to tell me that I'm wrong and the book is great because of xyz.

books,The Message by Ta-Nahisi Coates,"Ta-Nehisi Coates is a crucial writer for this era we find ourselves in now, in this chaotic year of 2024.  
  
When so much seems to be going wrong in the world, it’s important to have writers and artists lay out how the world is (and how the world should be), to interpret and express the contradictions and horrors of America, and of the world America has made.  
  
For some activists who are very tuned into certain current events, Coates’ book The Message won’t quite say anything new. But that isn’t really the point. It’s not a history book—it’s not meant to be a scholarly review of everything racist within America and in those countries propped up by American support.  
  
Rather, The Message is a personal book by a writer who overlays these issues through the filter of his own experiences. And that is where its true value lies.  
  
This memoir is made up of three essays, each more powerful than the last. In the first, Coates goes to Senegal to reflect on his African heritage. It’s a fascinating insight, and he gets into his own inner conflict over his lifelong connection to his very name. It’s a perspective on the African American experience not often explored: How Black African nationalism inspired his parents to give him the name Ta-Nehisi, and how he has had questioned the validity of that.  
  
The theme of racial pride by way of imagining past empires, some real and some fictional, it’s something he goes back to again and again. It gives the reader much to think about.  
  
At least there is some optimism as he finds himself pleasantly surprised by the development in Senegal. Even as that surprise comes with his own reckonings for being so instinctively pessimistic beforehand. If nothing else, it’s an excellent travelogue about a country seldom written about.  
  
The second essay is extremely topical, and more directly focused on the land of his own birth, in which he goes to South Carolina to visit those who have used his previous works to fight against censorship. It’s a study on how America has rewritten its own history for the sake of white supremacy, and how America continues to do so right now in so many Southern states. Sadly, in the wake of the last election, moral panics about DEI and CRT are as relevant as ever. Sometimes these fights are won, and Coates indeed speaks of how inspirational the power of writing can be, but overall there is a sense that the forces of justice are currently losing.  
  
In fact, there’s a feeling of profound sorrow prevalent in this book. A sense of loss, and even guilt, as Coates travels the world and finds so much failure in these systems that we live by. And that brings us to the final essay: He goes to Palestine. It covers more than half the book, and the majority of the discourse Coates is currently going through as well.  
  
It gets deep. Coates has strong things to say about Israel and the occupation. A careful and meticulous writer, his is a is a very well-thought out book that does not try to be bombastic. It is admittedly not meant to be some overarching and objective history lesson. As Coates explains, there are already plenty of Israeli points of views in the West. He is instead seeking out a chance to tell the Palestinian side, as fairly as possible.  
  
There is plenty of research herein. Coates can be a serious journalist when he needs to be. But again, the most poignant of these writings is simply the stories of going to Palestine and Israel, to Hebron and the settlements and East Jerusalem, and then explaining what happened there with humanity and empathy.  
  
When criticism of Israel comes up, there are always those who immediately bring up the Holocaust. And not without cause, it is certainly part of the context of the history of Zionism. So let me say that Coates does write very much about the history of anti-Semitism, of the legacy of the Holocaust and Nazis and of how Jews were absolutely singled out throughout the racist era of Europe in the 1800s and beyond. He goes back to this repeatedly throughout the book, quoting the early Zionists and contrasting on the sad irony of how so many did support colonialism and how so many white supremacists have supported Zionism.  
  
“Your oppression won’t save you,” is a key line. It doesn’t just refer to the Jews of history and the Israelis of today. It’s something that refers to everyone. The ultimate tragedy of history is that those who were oppressed often become the oppressors to others. He even mentions Liberia as an example, as no group is spared this lesson.  
  
Coates also writes about his guilt concerning his explosive 2014 Atlantic article, ‘The Case for Reparations.’ He then used postwar German reparations given to Israel as an example in his case, and now realizes how wrong he was for expecting nation-states to be accurate representatives on the suffering of individuals. He was never an expert on international affairs, and had always thought it was too complex to delve into. (I happen to think he’s too hard on himself with all the guilt, it’s unfortunate but he’s hardly unique in that. It’s ultimately a positive thing to grow and change as one learns more.)  
  
There is much writing about writing. As said, these are major world issues but this is still a personal memoir. He regrets putting so much faith in journalism, in expecting the institution of the Atlantic to truly make a difference. He speaks of his other books as his children, with plenty of flaws therein, and wonders if he has been true to himself all along with his mainstream writing career.  
  
Sadly, The Message has proven to be perhaps his timeliest book. Written before October 7th of last year and the subsequent—and brutal—Gaza war, it now matters so much. Personally, I’ve found his current media tour in promoting this book and discussing its controversies to be invaluable in bringing these issues to the forefront.  
  
Much has been already been written by others comparing the Israeli occupation of Palestine to the system of apartheid. And Coates does do his homework and researches well, speaking of Bantustans and ties to South Africa during the latter country’s oppressive past. Plenty of dates and quotes showing the history of Zionism and the development of the modern state of Israel. But what the book is truly about, is simply the people he meets and listens to. Simply the telling of their stories—and an ending on a final note lamenting the lack of Palestinian voices in the world of journalism.  
  
As a Black man from America, Coates cannot help but liken the occupation to Jim Crow. The comparisons are valid, and inevitable.  
  
At last, Coates returns to the themes from earlier in the book. About the narratives people tell themselves to justify who they are and what they have done.  
  
“What I saw in the city of David was so familiar to me. The search for self in the mythic past, filled with kings, and sanctified by an approximation of science.”  
  
It’s not just about Israel. It’s about African Americans, it’s about pride and what could have been if history went another way. It’s about Ta-Nehisi Coates’ own life, and it’s about the stories that were told to oppress his people and other peoples over the centuries.  
  
And, it’s certainly about America.",raelianautopsy,1h4w92m,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h4w92m/the_message_by_tanahisi_coates/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h4w92m/the_message_by_tanahisi_coates/,2024-12-02 14:32:05,22,0.53,22,0,50,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4w92m

books,I read The Song of Achilles and felt nothing ,"I was promised great love and a heartbreaking ending, and that’s the only reason i was putting off reading this book. It sounded like just the book that would devastate me. Don’t get me wrong, the book is certainly sad, but in a somber, drab way, not in a heartbreaking, stay with you for a long time after you finished it kind of way.

Throughout the entire book bad things just pile on for our protagonist Patroclus. There really aren’t many moments of reprieve, the dread is ever present in the book. The main thing i felt for him is pity and then annoyance for being so passive. The only time he ever showed any agency is when he was following Achilles around, making sure he stayed by his side. 

When they were in the mountains, with a god who could supposedly teach them anything, any skill, fighting or life, Patroclus apparently didn’t learn much of anything. They were in that cave in the mountains for years. Just the two of them and the teacher who could teach him anything…

The romantic relationship is not fleshed out. For the most part Achilles is an aloof character, we don’t really know the boy, and later the man, we see him through Patroclus’ eyes only. And from his perspective, everything is perfect, from his beauty, to his excellence, to his “mischief” and sense of humour. Also, apparently Achilles is somewhat of a pacifist in his early days. Now, I don’t know much about Greek mythology, but i know this just isn’t so lol.

The war sucked though. I would also hate if i had to go, so understood them there. Fuck Agamemnon and Menelaus, and fuck Paris and Helen of Troy too.

Like i said, this book is sad throughout, and even after both of them died, things somehow still managed to get worse.

If we didn’t get that resolution and small glimmer of hope in the last few minutes of the book, my rating would go from 3, to literally 1,5. 
This book didn’t devastate me into a heartbreak, but it slowly drowned me into numbness.",amazingamy19,1h48hn5,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h48hn5/i_read_the_song_of_achilles_and_felt_nothing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h48hn5/i_read_the_song_of_achilles_and_felt_nothing/,2024-12-01 17:32:31,516,0.75,516,0,278,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h48hn5

books,"I just ""read"" The Third Policeman by Flann O'Brien","The quotes are because I skipped the footnotes, so i'm not sure if i can say I read it since there were so many footnotes. 

I'm not sure how I feel about the book. joe is a delight and should be a national treasure, but disappears in the last 20% of the book. i only read this book because Terry Eagleton made it sound like such a creepfest in his book ""On Evil."" But it's not really creepy. It's pretty funny at times, but not enough of the time for it to not feel like a slog sometimes. I might also have been coming down with a low key head cold in the last 20% of the book, and that might have affected my perception of it. 

My question is: was the narrator actually evil? who was the main motivator behind the robbery and killing, divney or narrator? or am i asking the wrong questions here and missing some major point (since i skipped all the footnotes...)?

books,The dismal childhood of Becky Sharp - Vanity Fair ,"I’ve just finished Vanity Fair and loved it, one of the most fascinating portrayals of 19th Century society I’ve ever read. I loved Thackerays satirical voice as the narrator.

Becky Sharp is as interesting character as they come, I was alternately repulsed and charmed by her cunning and devious methods of getting her own way. I know it’s not made explicit in the book, but I got the impression that she may have been subject to sexual abuse as a child, which informs why she acts the way she does as an adult.

1) We’re told she had to coax and cajole all of the men her father was in debt to, and she was surrounded by her fathers adult friends from an early age

2) It’s said near the beginning that she was “a woman” from very early in her life

3) There’s a passage where it says she’s pondering sadly about the “dark times” in her childhood. This could refer only to poverty, but there are other ways to read it.

This tracks with how she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into serving her - this is all she knows about how to get by in the world. 

And it also makes sense with why she might hate Rawdon junior, because she resents him for having the childhood she never got to have.

Further, it makes sense why she is borderline obsessed with the Marquess of Steyne - a much older man who she may be drawn to due to her past trauma. Also, this is one of the only characters in the book who strikes genuine fear into her. This may be explained by him simply being one of the most powerful and cunning people ever in her circle, but again, there are other ways to read it.

I’m using none of this to excuse Becky ruining other characters lives, abusing and neglecting her son, betraying her husband, killing Jos(?!) etc, but it gave me an understanding of her character that made sense and assisted in my ability to empathise with her.

I’d be really interested to hear if anyone else has arrived at this conclusion. Or maybe this take is common! Amazing book, 5/5.

books,Do You Ever Picture a Different Ending for a Book?,"You know that feeling when you finish a book, and while you liked it, you can’t help but think, “What if it ended differently?” Maybe the characters made a choice you didn’t agree with, or the plot left too many loose ends.

For me, it was 1984. I get why the ending is the way it is, but part of me wonders how the story would have felt if Winston had actually succeeded in resisting the Party. Would it still be as powerful?

I want to explore Letty's motivations to turn her friends into the police by reenacting what potentially happened when she went to the Police Station:

**Letty**: Hello Officer, I want to report a crime.  My friends who I am complicit in murder with are plotting to stop the empire from waging unjustified war against China potentially saving the lives of 10s of thousands of people.  

**Officer**: Oh thats horrible, how are they planning on stopping this.  
  
**Letty**: They plan on passing out fliers in London to influence public opinion as well as writing members of parliament to get them to vote against the motion to go to war.  
  
**Officer**: Dastardly! We can't have that, tell me their location and we will raid them asap!  
    
**Letty**: Theyre at the Old Library. I just have two requests:  I'd like to join your raid and I'd like a gun.  
  
**Officer**: Do you even know how to use a gun?  
  
**Letty**:  I'm the daughter of an admiral who believes women shouldn't be allowed to read and are only good for Marriage, of course he taught me to use a gun.  
  
**Officer**: As the daughter of an admiral if I put you in harms way and something happened I would be hanged, correct?  
  
**Letty**: Yes absolutely.  
  
**Officer**: Very well, here's a gun, I'd like you on the vanguard of the raid.  I think its best if you confront your friends with a gun.

books,The Divine Farce by Michael S. A. Graziano -Very Short Review,"5-Stars!

This book was a recommendation from Goodreads because I enjoyed A Very Short Stay in Hell by Steven L Peck. The cover kind of grabbed me and the description hooked me:

“Three strangers are condemned to live together in darkness, crushed together in a concrete stall so small that they can never sit down. Liquid food drips down from above. Waste drains through a grid on the floor. So begins one of the strangest, most surreal comments on the human experience, on love and hatred and the human ability to find good in any situation, no matter how difficult.”

I’m not the best at reviewing books, honestly the description above from the back cover sets up the story perfectly. The writing is very descriptive and the prose are amazing vivid and disturbing. The world the author paints is a nightmare and yet…there’s definitely beauty in the filth. 

How much did I love this book? It arrived on my doorstep this morning at around 09:00, I was reading it by 09:10. It’s now 13:40 and I’ve finished the book (it’s only 125 pages) and I’m now rushing to tell you all it’s a page turner for sure! I’ve never sat down and read a book from cover to cover in one sitting, not even a short one like this. I was truly captivated.
