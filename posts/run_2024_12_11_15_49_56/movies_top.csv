Stuck in a boring “desk” assignment while pining for the love of spunky club manager Anata, Danny is thrilled when The Company pulls him back in the field, but only to train Gen Z newcomer Wihlborg, a prodigy assassin with a bad attitude. The mismatched pair is asked to eliminate a competing crime syndicate but uncover their employer’s true motive: removing the old guard in a full takeover. The Company didn’t anticipate that Danny's experience coupled with the kid’s brilliance would create such an unlikely bond between the two. Along with Anata’s crucial help, the duo takes matters into their own hands to take down The Company and that age has no limits!

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-astonishes-young-bob-dylan-james-mangolds-thrilling-musical-drama-1236199254/):

&gt;At the center of this all is a remarkable performance by Timothee Chalamet who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lyp-synching or blending of voices between actor and subject. It is all Chalamet in the same way *Walk The Line* was all Phoenix and Witherspoon, and *Coal Miner’s Daughter* was all Spacek.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-james-mangold-1236081991/) (70):

&gt;Whatever script flaws there are in terms of structure, plot momentum and an opaque central character, *A Complete Unknown* offers rewards in its lived-in performances and in the exhilarating music sequences that propel it forward. For many audiences with an affection for Dylan’s music and the era in general, that will be enough.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (39/100):

&gt;A superficial illustration of the artist’s allure, interspersed with endless, increasingly comical shots of people watching him perform and smiling beatifically.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation) (100):

&gt;Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It’s all rise, but troubled and unclear. You might not buy Chalamet’s Dylan at first; I didn’t, until that Guthrie bedside scene. There is amazing bravado in this performance.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/10/bob-dylan-movie-review-a-complete-unknown/76857860007/) (3.5/4):

&gt;“A Complete Unknown” is that rare biopic that leaves you wanting to watch it again *and* go on a Spotify deep dive, and you're apt to find new respect both for Dylan as a bluesy contrarian and Chalamet as a top-shelf thespian of his generation.

[Collider](https://collider.com/a-complete-unknown-review/) (80):

&gt;James Mangold's A Complete Unknown explores the music of Bob Dylan with fantastic care and a great performance by Timothée Chalamet.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan) (70):

&gt;Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold takes his hands off the steering wheel for A Complete Unknown, resulting in a Bob Dylan biopic that takes unpredictable turns. Rather than connecting the dots between how the world influenced him (and how he influenced it in turn), the film frames his enormous musical sea changes as personal drama for his peers. It’s formally straightforward, but its focus on the characters in Dylan’s life – rather than the musician himself, played by Timothée Chalamet – turn him into an enigma, for better or worse.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-complete-unknown-bob-dylan-movie-review-b2661910.html) (60):

&gt;Despite the drip-fed reminders of contemporary history (the Cuban Missile Crisis! the Kennedy assassination! Weren’t the Sixties wild, man!), A Complete Unknown struggles to fully engage with Dylan’s relationship to that intersection between politics and music.

Written and Directed by James Mangold:

&gt;The film follows the life and career of musician [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) from January 1961, when he moves from Minnesota to New York City, to his 1965 concert at the [Newport Folk Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival), resulting in [controversy over the use of electric instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy).",MarvelsGrantMan136,1hb6hbb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hb6hbb/a_complete_unknown_review_thread/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hb6hbb/a_complete_unknown_review_thread/,2024-12-10 17:02:33,181,0.82,181,0,125,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1hb6hbb

Today I can now announce the winner for Turkey: To be honest, I'm not familiar with ***Bir Zamanlar Anadolu’da*** (engl.: *Once Upon A Time in Anatolia*) yet, but it really s to touch the heart of this project and to provide an as entertaining as accurate look into the country.

When it comes to the next country, some would say that it is particularly important nowadays that films can offer us a real insight into the country's current condition: I'm talking about **Ukraine**. But please take note: Since *20 днів у Маріуполі* (engl.: *20 Days in Mariupol*) would actually be an obvious suggestion as a prominent documentary film, I would like to explicitly point out  what was always implicitly clear to everyone in the previous rounds, namely that documentaries are excluded from [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). Apart from that, the following two rules apply as always:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Hunting Matthew Nichols (2024),"I just caught this Hunting *Matthew Nichols* (2024) at the Whistler Film Festival last weekend and really wanted to put it on people's radars, especially if you love horror. [https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols](https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols)

I did not know ANYTHING about this movie before I went in to see it and that's the best way to experience it. It won me over because the story about this woman searching for her missing brother is interesting. The atmosphere is dripping. Literally because they filmed in December on Vancouver Island, showcasing really dark, rainy and super foreboding/dread tone. The deeper they get into the woods the eerier it gets. It's strangely grounded and absorbing. It's decently-shot, but what I appreciate is it's a nice slow burn. It builds and builds to one of the tensest, scariest movies I've seen in years. Closest I can compare is UNCUT GEMS,  in style, realism and oh-my-GOD tension.

It's a locally produced Vancouver indie so a lot of the audience had heard about it through family, friends or colleagues, myself included. I showed up 20 minutes early and most movies at the Whistler film fest don't have crazy lines. This one day. I barely got in via the rush line, they had 10 spots open and I was the eighth. So it was a full up theatre.

I myself sometimes watch long films at home in 2 or 3 parts, perhaps with short breaks in between, but I've noticed that you actually get out of the film a little when you take a 20-minute break (obviously we're not talking about urgency, but the case in which you voluntarily decide to take breaks).

I don't want a score to tell me what to think. But if it's there at all, it should unobtrusively underscore the action. I understand some will say that's the same thing, but I promise you it's not, at least not the way I mean it. But that's not the point of this. 

I just watched Pickpocket and the score seems weirdly at odds with the mood of the action.

Anyone else find the music oddly… buoyant?

And I can't say I've ever had this experience with another movie. There are scores I hate (Midnight Cowboy anyone?) but not because they're jarringly at right angles to the action, but because I just don't like them.

movies,What if Sergio Leone made Leningrad: The 900 Days?,"Question, What if Sergio Leone never died and managed to make Leningrad: The 900 Days?

On what I am saying, While finishing work on Once Upon a Time in America in 1982, Leone was impressed with Harrison Salisbury's non-fiction book The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad, and he planned on adapting the book as a war epic. Although no formal script had been completed or leaked, Leone came up with the opening scene and basic plot. According to the documentary Once Upon a Time, Sergio Leone, the film opened in medias res as the camera goes from focusing on a Russian hiding from the Nazis' artillery fire to panning hundreds of feet away to show the German Panzer divisions approaching the walls of the city. The plot was to focus on an American photographer on assignment (whom Leone wanted to be played by Robert De Niro) becoming trapped in Russia as the German Luftwaffe begin to bombard the city. Throughout the course of the film, he becomes romantically involved with a Russian woman, whom he later impregnates, as they attempt to survive the prolonged siege and the secret police, because relationships with foreigners are forbidden. According to Leone, ""In the end, the cameraman dies on the day of the liberation of the city, when he is currently filming the surrender of the Germans. And the girl is aware of his death by chance seeing a movie news: the camera sees it explode under a shell .... ""

By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire $100 million in financing from independent backers, and the film was to be a joint production with a Soviet film company. He had convinced Ennio Morricone to compose the film score, and Tonino Delli Colli was tapped to be the cinematographer. Shooting was scheduled to begin sometime in 1990. The project was canceled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film.

Now, Since Sergio Leone never had a script, it's hard to know whether the film would go, but I think, given Leone's track record, I really think this film would've a been another masterpiece. I am just sadden that Sergio died just only 2 days before he was to sign on to this film, and one thing that amazes me is that Leone managed to acquired 100 Million just for this project, probably making it one of the most expensive film projects is it actually got made?

movies,2000s Cliche lines/tropes,"Hello all! About a while back on social media, there was a steady stream of jokes involving early 2000s movies, marvel movies, etc. where people would act and recreate cliched scenes we’ve all seen before such as: 

“He’s right behind me… isn’t he?” 

Or people stacking on top of each other to watch something from afar, 

or even the classic “I’ve got it! I’ve got it… guess I don’t have it.” Type of line.

Long story short: I’ve created a one act comedy play based on those joke lines and I’d like to try my hand at making it into a two act play for a local writing competition. Problem is, the trend is far over and I’d like to open it up to you guys for inspiration!

What’re generic cliched lines or tropes from early 2000s movies that you guys remember? 

On top of that: Was there ever a plot twist or character archetype that was so constantly used that you expected it to be in a story created around that time?

movies,"Looking for Horror/Thriller Slasher ""Extremity"" Movies ","Movies like *Inside* (2007), *The Loved Ones*, *Frontiers*, *The Hills Have Eyes,* or any other kind of violent splatter film that is either consistent or reserved in its levels of violence. It doesn't have to be limited to New French or of a particular movement.

Preferably though absolutely not just limiting to, movies where a group or a select few individuals have to escape or defend themselves against larger, stronger, or outnumbered foes like in *Green Room*, *You're Next*, and *Dog Soldiers.* 

If the movies have some kind of cross into the action field but still have horror themes and elements like *I Saw The Devil*, they are also welcome.

You are welcome to, but preferably not on this specific post, to also submit more overall action thrillers like *The Night Comes For Us* but try and limit it towards more leaning still on horror if you can.

movies,Ariana DeBose needs a better agent,"TL;DR: Ariana DeBose's movies after WSS aren't very good. Hopefully that changes soon. If not then she needs to give her agent the boot.

This isn't something only exclusive to her (looking at you Tom Holland, though things are looking up for you), but I'm shocked by how drastic of a downturn Ariana DeBose's career took after West Side Story. That movie put her in the spotlight and even won her an Oscar! Yet every movie she's been in after that has been panned by both audiences and critics.

I.S.S was the first movie she stared in after WSS, which released on January 2023. For the uninformed January is seen as a dumping month for movies which studios think won't do well. That movie bombed at the box office despite a low $13 million budget and received average reviews.

Then she voiced the main character in Wish. I think we all know what happened with that movie. It flopped, making $255 million on a $175–200 million budget. Don't forget movies need to make 2.5x their budget to make a profit. I remember a lot of people on social media and irl making fun of the movie's animation, story and songs. It was seen as an embarrassment to Disney, especially since it was meant to celebrate their 100th anniversary.

In 2024 she starred in Agrylle. The movie was meant to launch a new franchise but it bombed and was ridiculed by critics and audiences. I know many people see it as a low point in Vaughn's career. Tbf her role in that movie was very minor but still.

This likely went under your radar as it's a streaming movie released on Amazon Prime but she stared in a horror movie called House of Spoils where she plays an evil chef I think. Cool premise but unfortunately it's produced by Blumhouse and you know how all their recent output has been like lately. It didn't make much splash but from what I can tell it was received quite negatively by both critics and audiences.

Later this month the 8 people still invested in Sony's Spider-Manless Cinematic Universe will be seeing her again in Kraven the Hunter. Tbh I actually think this movie's reception won't too bad, or at least not as bad as Morbius and Madame Web. I can totally see people calling it a fun turn-off-your-brain popcorn flick. But I really doubt it'll get higher than a 65% on the tomatometer.

Finding out that she was going to be in Kraven the Hunter was what prompted me to write this ridiculously long post (that and the fact that I have a lot of free time.). To be completely hyperbolic, this was what broke me and caused me to write all this out. I admit that I've never seen a single movie she's been in but I have seen clips of WSS and she was phenomenal in it. She's a scene stealer man, not just because she looks absolutely stunning but because of her amazing acting and singing. She deserves a better career man. I'd hate to see such talent be reduced to such poor and ill-fitting roles.

Not all hope is lost for her tho, next years she'll be in Love Hurts, also staring Ke Huy Quan. I have really high hopes for that movie as I love Ke Huy Quan and the premise sounds really fun! She's also staring in two other upcoming movies which don't have release dates yet. Those may be good. Who knows. I hope they are. If all three of her upcoming movies end up terrible then she ought to fire her agent cause man is she squandering her skills and potential. Of course I'm not saying gonna end up in poverty if she keeps getting bad movie roles but I do think it's odd she hasn't been in a single hit since WSS.

movies,What do you think will happen when the Hobbit enters the public domain?,"J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth franchise began way back in 1937, with the release of the Hobbit. The Hobbit has been adapted twice, once back in 1977 as an animated movie, and again as a live action trilogy, between 2012 and 2014. 

However, something that often goes unnoticed, is that we're creeping up on the date in which the Hobbit novel, will be available to the public domain. In 2034, the original Hobbit novel will enter the public domain, at least according to an article I read recently. 

Given how people had issues with both the original animated adaptation and the Peter Jackson trilogy, I'm curious to know what you think of the idea that anyone will be able to try adapting the Hobbit for themselves. Do you think it's a bad idea, or could we see a more faithful adaptation come about as a result? Or do you think the market will get over-cluttered with poor retellings of the story?

I myself see a lot of potential here. A fledgling studio could use the Hobbit to turn their fortunes around for instance, or a rival major studio to WBD, could try beating them at their own game. Universal Studios, who owns the rights to the LEGO movie franchise, could easily do their own LEGO adaptation of the original book if they so wanted to. Even if the worst comes to pass and the Hobbit gets adapted into a horror movie, like Steamboat Willie and Winnie the Pooh already have, I'd still be down for a horror movie about Middle-earth. I still think that could work wonders if handled correctly.

movies,"Another ""The Prestige"" post asking for some clarification","Hi everyone! I know... 9 years late to the party hahaha. I love this movie so much I had to watch it twice in once sitting.

I won't lie... I was looking for a suggestion to ""Now You See Me"" as I enjoy the over the top heist movies that don't take themselves too seriously (think Rick and Morty heist hyperbole and not Fast and Furious). I saw the movie ""The Prestige"" pop up multiple times, but since it was often coupled by overt animosity towards the person asking for movie recommendations similar to ""Now You See Me"", I had assumed it was a sarcastic recommendation, and thus also accidentally mistook the suggestion for ""The Purge"", thinking these people where being malicious with their recommendations; but I digress.

The actual question I have involves the jail scene, in which Jess visits Alfred accompanied by Lord Caldlow; whom we immediately learn is actually Angier. They have a heated transaction, and Alfred frantically grabs Jess's attention and says, ""I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise. I promise. Look"" and after he pulls the red ball out from behind her ear, he repeats, ""I promise"" and ends the transaction with, ""I love you. I love you. I love you Jess."" We're not privy to the details, but we learn that in fact, Alfred is a portmanteau of the first names of the twin Borden brothers Albert and Frederick, so that means either Albert or Frederick is in jail. Well... to be accurate, we learn that Alfred is actually the single identity born from the shared lives of the twin Borden brothers, without really learning any names. These names I've learned from extensive Google warrioring. Anyway, I'm led to believe that Frederick is the one in jail, especially since he opens by saying to Jess, ""I've missed you so much. Fallon's missed you too. We both have."" Meaning that the one in jail is not Jess's father, and that leads me to believe it is then Frederick, who is the who who has been cold to Sarah Borden, Albert's wife.

I guess I'm just confused because If Frederick is the one who is in jail, and is the one who is ultimately hanged, I just find it odd that he showed such an overwhelming amount of love and concern for Jess. Especially since he was incapable of showing that affection towards his sister in law, which led her to her eventual suicide. That didn't seem like an act to me. It didn't feel like he was just trying to use her to garner sympathy enough to get out of jail. It didn't feel like he was acting for the sake of the daughter. The scene to me felt very real, and very self-less might I add. It feel like he was truly worried about her well being and how she would cope after him. I think the magic trick with the ball—a signature ""Borden"" gesture, was meant to reassure her in a familiar, comforting manner, maintaining the illusion of stability knowing that he was at an end the moment he learned of Caldlow's true identity. And that, is where I'm confused, if that's true, why would he have that kind of feeling towards his niece. Why did he comfort her so desperately when he could even do the same for Sarah?

Oh, I guess as I further think on this as I try to organize my thoughts into a coherent Reddit post, I again want to point at his coldness towards Sarah; and I want to supplement that with the fact that he \*immediately\* chased Olivia after Sarah's passing, leading to her leaving him as well. She was unsettled by how little her death affected him, and how quickly he moved on to his mistress. To me, this leads me to believe that Frederick is not much of an actor. I don't believe he's able to fake love, and that reinforces my thought that what he shows towards Jess is genuine and true; and again, I just want to know why? Unless of course, it was not Frederick in the jail cell.",Aerothix,1hbkl85,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,2024-12-11 03:40:15,0,0.41,0,0,26,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbkl85
movies,I'm still confused by 'The Platform' and 'The Platform 2',"I have seen both movies, but I'm still confused on a couple of things (I'm going to reference both):

* The platform shoots to the top really fast, but what happens when the platform approaches Level 0? Does it slow down or does it immediately stop?  If it immediately stops then I don't think either the child or the panna cotta at the end of the first movie would be intact if either was sent up. The child would likely go splat on the ceiling like a squashed berry. The panna cotta wouldn't be intact either. Otherwise, the platform would need to slow down as it approaches the top, whereby some prisoners could possibly attempt to jump on? I guess this is a plot point that is just never explained?
* Does a child being placed at the bottom level at the end of the second movie confirm that the child at the bottom in the first movie was NOT in fact imaginary? THAT was the possible ending that really happened, and not the other one with the panna cotta being sent up?
* There are cannibals beneath the pit which survive on dead bodies and their parts that fall down the hole? And who are these cannibals? Are these all prisoners that descended to the bottom of the pit with a child over time? 
* Lastly, so either the platform suddenly stopping or the cannibals at the bottom are the things that make the prison completely escape proof? So if a prisoner rides the platform down to the very bottom they are simply killed by the cannibals? Or if they have a child they are just pulled off by the cannibals, the prisoner joins the cannibals, and the child is sent up and is supposedly not killed at the top by the sudden deceleration? 

Am I understanding it all correctly? Or is this just terrible writing?

movies,Biggest Filmmaker ,"Who according to you are among the Top 5 Biggest ( most influential ) filmmakers in the world currently , of this era ( 2007-present ) ?



According to me -

1. Christopher Nolan - Probably the most famous and commercially/critically successful filmmaker of this Era .
With movies like The Dark Knight , Inception , Interstellar , Dunkirk , Oppenheimer under his belt , I certainly presume that no one even comes close to his invincibility .




2. Bong Joon Ho - With masterpieces like Mother , Snowpiercer , Okja , and Parasite , he nearly misses the first spot solely on the basis of lack of global recognition compared to Nolan. But definitely on the same level on the basis of the quality of content when compared to Nolan.




3. Martin Scorsese  - This era has been sort of a second phase of Scorsese's cinematic journey imo. It feels as if in the current phase of Scorsese , he is not making movies for them to be great classics but just for enjoying the privilege of creating real "" old school "" cinema in a world which is largely dominated by movies which feels more like factory produced products for consumer's satisfaction.
His Shutter Island , Wows , Silence , The Irishman , and Killers of the flower moon are 
' breeze of fresh air ' .





4. Wes Anderson   - One of the most unique filmmakers of recent times , his distinctive style and artistic approach has cemented his position among the great comedy filmmakers of all time.

I know a lot of actors get tied up in contracts and are forced to do bad movies, but in this stage of his career, is De Niro really still tied up with contractual obligations? Idk maybe he is i don’t really know how these things work but it seems counterintuitive for him at this point to sign those kinds of contracts when he could probably easily get a high quality role at any point. 

The other factor could be money, which for De Niro obviously seems off, but I guess we don’t truly know bros financial situation. 

Idk I guess the general question is why an actor would do a bad movie for any reason other than contractual obligation or a pay day",unitedstatessenat0r,1hblmfm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hblmfm/why_do_a_list_actors_do_small_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hblmfm/why_do_a_list_actors_do_small_movies/,2024-12-11 04:37:54,0,0.24,0,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hblmfm
movies,Hollywood leading men?,"Does anyone else feel like there is no leading men with longevity anymore?

Supposed ‘A’ listers like Brad Pitt and George Clooney only make smug jazzy rat pack rip offs (Wolfs) then dissapear for years.

Everyone else seems to be in 5 movies in a year while hot property then its on to the next one…

Ryan Gosling, then Chris Pratt, then Adam Driver, then Oscar Isaac, now Timothee Chalamet, next Barry Keogan.

Now Aaron Taylor Johnson is everywhere just as he is ‘rumoured’ to be James Bond (I’d like to see a 70s skinny Mod style Bond)",OwnCurrent6817,1hb7mus,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hb7mus/hollywood_leading_men/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hb7mus/hollywood_leading_men/,2024-12-10 17:51:04,0,0.24,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hb7mus
movies,Can we talk about Apple TV movies?,"This week I saw three Apple TV movies:

Napoleon

Killers of the Flower Moon

The Instigators.

Whilst The Instigators was a tragic waste of talent, the first two imo were both resounding successes. Both fine, magnificent movies cinematically speaking. I’d read bad things about both (too long, inaccurate etc) but on a purely cinematic level, both these movies delivered and I applaud Apple TV for these. 

I’m genuinely excited what Apple TV can offer. The only downside is that I can only watch it in my iPhone as when viewed on my television the picture breaks up. That’s quite a major problem especially as Ridley Scott has publicly voiced his disapproval of watching movies on phones. 

Anyway, I think I might watch Blitz next. I have reservations about this one too but, seriously, after The instigators, surely it won’t be on that level of badness. It looks as if it will offer something of substance at the very least.

movies,The Substance is way too long for what it is and suffers greatly for it.,"Don't get me wrong Demi and Dennis' performances were great and the movie was thematically strong and has some of the best use of practical effects I've seen in recent film. However, the damn movie is just too long. It's not hard to surmise what will happen once the exposition is through. Demi will recapture her youth but only a week at a time, or else? Surely she won't disobey those orders! Surely ""Remember, you are one"" is not a foreboding warning that underlines the entire theme of the movie? And there's nothing wrong with telegraphing your thematic intentions and then leaning into them, but when you do that you need to make it snappy. The middle section of the movie drags so hard because you know what's coming the whole time and instead of getting that, you get stiff dialog and a few gross out scenes. It felt like sitting at the dinner table watching the food get cold. It's being heralded for its message, which is a good one, but it's also not a complicated one and it DEFINITELY did not need almost 150 minutes to be delivered.


I'll also mention that I get what the idea was with all of the intense sexualization of Sue, but the movie falls into the trap of being popular for the things it's trying to denigrate. Sex sells and that sucks for women, but also, let's make an over the top sexualized movie and hey, look, people love it. It ends up feeling like virtue signaling mixed with hipocracy via naivete.
