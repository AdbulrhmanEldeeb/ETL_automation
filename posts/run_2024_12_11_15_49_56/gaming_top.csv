gaming,My thoughts on TGA Nominees having now played them,"I finally played all of the TGA GOTY nominees thanks to Black Friday deals and I wanted to share my thoughts as award season approaches 

Balatro (9/10)

This game is a masterclass in deceptively simple design and It’s astonishing how easy to lose hours to its “one more run” hook. 

If you’ve avoided it because you think it’s “just poker” or “just a card game,” you’re seriously missing out and doing yourself a disservice. It’s a deeply engaging experience that I think you should try if you haven’t 

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (9/10)

While there’s some debate about its eligibility, for me personally there’s no denying that SOTE delivered one of the absolute best gaming experiences of the year. 

This expansion earns a spot on my Mount Rushmore of DLCs, right alongside Blood and Wine, Shivering Isles, and Phantom Liberty.

Astro Bot (9.5/10)

This. Game. Fucks.

As a fan of classic Nintendo 3D platformers, this felt like a love letter to the genre with a modern twist. 

My only complaint with the game is that I just wanted more of it at the end of the short run time to a platinum trophy. 

The final challenge run and the themed X, Square, Circle, and Triangle levels were brilliant and I’d kill for more levels of that difficulty and quality

If this game was just an appetizer, I can’t wait to see what Team Asobi has in store for the main course. If not for my ultimate favorite this year, this would have been my pick for GOTY.

Black Myth: Wukong (7.5-8/10)

While I enjoyed my three playthroughs of BM: W, I don’t think it quite reaches the same level as the other nominees. 

That said, for the developers’ first big swing, this is a fucking crazy impressive showing. I’m excited to see where they go next as this was an incredibly solid starting point and a downright great game in its own right 

Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (8.5/10)

As a huge fan of the original FF VII, the remake series has been a delight for me. 

The visuals are stunning, and it’s fucking sweet seeing the locations I remember in full 3D recreations. 

However for me it ultimately suffers from some modern open-world fatigue (developers seriously need to retire map towers and their equivalents lmao) 

Despite that, it’s a standout gaming experience, and I can’t wait for Part 3.

Metaphor: ReFantazio (9.5/10)

Jesus Christ, this game.

The characters, world-building, and narrative are utterly fantastic. 

At 40 hours in, it’s easily my GOTY—though, of course, a poorly executed ending could change that. 

My only (minor) gripe is that the soundtrack, while great, doesn’t quite hit Persona levels of perfection.

Final Rankings:
1.	Metaphor: ReFantazio
2.	Astro Bot
3.	Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
4.	Balatro
5.	Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
6.	Black Myth: Wukong

gaming,Revisiting classics can be heartbreaking sometimes,"For example, I’ve recently reinstalled Battlefield 1. I had some major memories with this game as I used to take my PlayStation over to my friends house every Friday night and we used to sit there with two monitors so it was as close to split screen as it gets. For those that are familiar with the game type “Operations” you’ll know what I’m talking about when I say THAT was the game mode you would play. It was both hectic and chaotic all at once.

Coming back to it now there’s just no player base numbers to fill up the lobby so you have to resort to smaller games in different modes like “frontlines”. Makes me think about all the classics shutting down or just not having a player base anymore like rainbow six vegas 2 and Halo 3. I feel these games live forever in our memories but sometimes trying to go back to them just feels so different. Almost like revisiting a house you used to live in. You have the memories but it’s just not home anymore. I think that’s the bitter sweet thing with online games these days….

All I can remember is that you had a few starting classes, I think I was using a Viking/Fighter type but a Samurai was one of the choices (maybe not right from the start??) and it played very similarly to LotF with a similar playstyle and overall feel.  Felt very ""epic"" in scale and was a great SP experience, I do not recall what if any MP there was.  I just scrolled through every 360 game available on Gamestops website and came up empty.

gaming,"Thoughts on a game mechanic i had. ""Editing""","I love storytelling. Whether its movies or games.

Id even say that the interactive medium perfected the way stories could be told.

That being said we as gamers have our classics of story games.

Sadly a lot of them are dated by game mechanics and gameplay loops/pacing. 

Also the modern ""remake/remaster"" approach of today actually causes a lot more problems than making the initial game perfect.

For me its like. I love AC and the batman arkham games.

But hate the remaster for not fully doing what they were supposed to do.

I love the quality of live improvements like the gameplay in that being better. The world looking gorgeous.

But then the developers of those games remasters botched the cut scenes and made them ugly.

On one end their good. And on the other it would be great if they turned back to the original.

And i started thinking.

Im a big fan of ""fanedits of movies"". For the people who don't know what that is.

Fanedits are well..edits...by fans of movies where said fan cut or added scenes from a movie to make said movie better.

Whether is pacing or else.

What if games had this feature after your first play through. Making certain passages shorter. Choosing art direction form either version

Idk how that would work as far was the developers budget or time. 

OR...if that would even work.

But to it would be like a chapter menu. Where you can delete long gameplay section that just wasnt for you. Ect....

To make future play throughs easier.

Just a random thought. Curious to what you think.

The reasons are clear. Everyone has a smartphone, but not everyone has a PC fit for gaming or a console. So the obstacles for getting into gaming are pretty low.

Sadly the Playstore mainly constists of garbage games, with a free-2-play and in-app-store monetization model. This model does not aim for good gameplay, but for pulling your money out of your pocket. There are some pearls standing out, like Dead Cells, Slay the Spire and so on, which are direct ports of their pc/console counterparts, but as they have upfront cost, appareantly the big mass does not want them or does not find them in the pile of thrash, that the Playstore is. Since they don't generate enought revenue, the willingness of other publishers to port their already existing games to Android is also neglectable.

Now comes the neat part: If you checkout r/EmulationOnAndroid , basically the whole gaming history, with the exception of the latest consoles, is available on Android through emulation. Using **Winlator** or similar, it is even possible to emulate PC games, without much hassle. I have seen videos of Skyrim, Witcher 3 and even Cyberpunk getting played on High End Android devices. Since this is possible, this eleminates the need for porting games, you can just play the PC version, if you want to. As i understood it, the Steam Deck does the same. It creates a compatibility layer for PC games for the Steam Deck hardware/OS, they were not initially made for.

Now comes the big question: Since such feats can be accomplished by just a few developers worldwide, why is lets say Valve/Steam so not interesed in this topic? They already have a mobile app, with Steam Link a powerful editor for mobile controls and the compatibility layer through their Steam OS. If they tie these parts together they could have a third platform, they could distribute their games for. Imagine you buy a game on Steam and you could play it on PC, on the Steam Deck AND on Android!

It is definitely technically feasible, as it was already shown by others. So why does no one use that potential?",dibade89,1hbntng,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,2024-12-11 06:57:57,0,0.15,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbntng

gaming,I’ve Had Enough of The Diablo 4 and PoE 1 &amp; 2 Discourse,"About a month ago I got back into Diablo 4 and while it’s not perfect by any means it’s a fun, turn your brain off, action RPG. While playing for a month I remembered I pre-order POE2 early access a while back and also was incredibly excited to try it out.

Since then I’ve been switching back and forth between them and have been having a blast because ultimately I understand, that while they occupy the same genre, they are two completely different types of ARPG.

Diablo 4 is a fast paced power fantasy with a lot of high quality polish. POE2 is the spiritual successor of the Diablo 2 formula. It’s a slower more methodical ARPG that requires more thought, with a lot of customization for how you want your builds.

Both are serviceable to their audiences, and both have incredibly loyal fanbases. An while comparisons are inevitable and fair in some cases. Certain sects of each fanbase, like children, look for constant opportunities to shit on the other acting as if there is this “one true” ARPG.

The ARPG community is similar to the JRPG community in that, you have these incredibly vocal voices, who do not make up the majority of players, set these arbitrary “rules” on what constitutes a true game of the genre. So anything that goes against these “rules” is deemed as not a “true” this or that. 

Which then creates this very negative, and unhealthy mindset, that limits your ability to accept anything new or genre pushing. To someone like me, this type of behavior is shallow and embarrassing. Not to mention it’s hypocritical given that most ppl like games within genre for different reasons. 

If it were up to these types we’d still be stuck in the 90’s.

gaming,Two game genres that the gaming world stays away from: CRPG and life simulation," baldurs gate and divinity origins and thousands of crpg games(!) no no not thousands maybe 4 maybe 5 you've already played most of them. there is a similar situation in the life simulation genre the sims has been the only one in this genre for 24 years. so why is this so? the answer is very simple: game companies are cowards and lazy they want to earn a lot with little effort and in 2024 they do exactly what they want. 4k and high resolution empty games are ok, those who say the graphics of the game are very nice and give 10 points are ok and the formula is that simple. there are thousands of dialogues side stories and constantly changing cutscenes in crpg games. thousands of possibilities that need to be calculated in life simulation games pufff these are hard work let's make an fps shooter game",Due_Actuator964,1hbbryg,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbbryg/two_game_genres_that_the_gaming_world_stays_away/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbbryg/two_game_genres_that_the_gaming_world_stays_away/,2024-12-10 20:44:26,0,0.13,0,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbbryg
