Has anyone here managed to try it out yet? What are your thoughts on AI-generated videos? I'm curious about the quality and potential uses.

.Also, what do you think this means for content creators and the film industry? Could tools like this make video production more accessible, or are there downsides we should be concerned about?

Share your thoughts, and don't forget to check out our [in-depth analysis](https://aigptjournal.com/news-ai/sora-video-tool-launch/) of Sora's features and potential applications.

artificial,Who’s the Real Robot: The AI That Simulates Empathy or the Human That Neglects to Show It?,"I wanted to post this on Facebook so bad, but humans don't care. I am not saying I am right. I just wanted my thoughts out there and add to this community.

Yes, I am a certified AI engineer... But looking for a job has been strange, knowing what I know, now... This has been my 3rd layoff since 2019. I have two degrees and certifications that I have lost count of. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? The one thing that should make humans indispensable in recruitment—empathy—is often where they fall short. Meanwhile, AI can simulate empathy effectively (where humans are ""too busy"" for empathy), providing timely, tailored, actionable responses that make candidates feel heard and empowered, even if it’s not coming from a ""real"" person. AI is able to objectively answer a simple question: ""What experience or credential am I missing?""

We now come to a new philosophical dilemma: Who’s the real robot, the AI that simulates empathy or the human that neglects to show it? Humans can't realistically keep up with hundreds of applications for a single job, not objectively.

We don't want to be replaced with AI at work, but dig deep and ask, do you deserve it if you have lost your humanity anyway? What have we become???

I appreciate this community, and I know these past 4 years have been a struggle for many of you. I wish you all wonderful peaceful lives as you continue to grow and share your experiences with the world.

artificial,Looking for suitable AI that can merge several texts into one and/or cluster similar topics,"Hey everybody, I haven't really looked into AI at all until now, so I'm quite lost on this. Appreciate any kind of help or pointers in the right direction. 

***An important note is that all this needs to be done with texts written in German.***

**The scenario for which I need AI:**

* Attendees of a course write each their own text, describing a ""perfect"" day in the future. These attendees all share the same background, most likely the same employer. That means that all texts will most likely have some common themes, e.g. structure of a work day, the way meetings run etc. But they would also have differences, unique little descriptions, maybe of a coffee break shared with a colleague.

**What I need the AI to do:**

* The number of texts can change drastically. With 3 texts it's kind of doable to merge them manually. With 10+ texts or even 50+ it can obviously become quite hard to do this by hand. The AI would need to merge these texts by merging common themes into one occurence in the final text and also adding unique wordings/descriptions.
* If merging is not really feasible to be done by AI at the moment, clustering the contents of the texts would be really helpful as well. With clustering I'm thinking about bullet points that extract quotes from each text clustered for certain topics, e.g. meetings, coffee break talk etc. This way unique wordings could be preserved.
* If none of the above is feasible, what AI would be most useful to summarize texts while still keeping some of the unique wordings?

I hope you can understand what I'm looking for. If anything is unclear please ask away.
