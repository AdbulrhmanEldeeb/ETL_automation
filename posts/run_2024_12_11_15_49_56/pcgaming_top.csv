* Recruit powerful Cabinet Members who grant unique abilities to help you govern 💼
* Navigate Parliament sessions and elections to secure your re-election 🗳️
* Enjoy fresh, dynamic city-building challenges with each playthrough

We’ve infused the game with elements of Singapore’s culture, architecture, and folklore, and we’re excited to share our home’s uniqueness with the world. Our goal is to create a game that celebrates Singapore, similar to how other cultures (like Japan) have influenced games globally.

We’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback as we continue development. Wishlist *Majulah* now on Steam and join us on this exciting journey!

pcgaming,The RE Engine is so damn good,"I'm playing Resident Evil 4 remake on mid to high settings at a constant 60fps on a gtx1060 and an old ass i52500k. Same for RE2/3 remakes, 7, Village, even DMC5

MT framework was also crazy good at running great on not up to date hardware 

and the games look insanely good

idk, just wanted to mention that cause I think it sometimes gets overlooked, wish Capcom would lend it out. They really got amazing at PC ports pretty early for a Japanese company.",asharkmadeofsalsa,1hb5wl4,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hb5wl4/the_re_engine_is_so_damn_good/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hb5wl4/the_re_engine_is_so_damn_good/,2024-12-10 16:38:23,0,0.37,0,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hb5wl4

pcgaming,Did PC gaming use to not be very popular in some parts of the world?,"Hello everyone. I am Polish. I have been playing on PC since I was a kid. It seems to me that Poland is predominantly a country that games on PC. I have always believed that PC gaming IS the default way to game.

However, it appears to me that this probably hasn't been the case in other countries?

As an example, Americans pretty much only refer to games made between 2000 and 2011 as, ""a PS2 game"" or ""an Xbox 360 game"" even if said game had a PC release. Most of the discourse regarding gaming around that time revolves around the PS2, the 360, the GameCube, etc.

Also, most Americans seem to know console games like Ocarina of Time (which I will admit I have no clue what that game even is) but they probably have no idea what games like Baldur's Gate or Baldur's Gate 2 are, because they released on PC.

Thoughts?

pcgaming,Why are people surprised when Ubisoft F's them? they've been doing this for 10+ years. ,"Here's a list over the last 10 years. Did I miss anything?

2014

AC Unity -  Nightmare launch with missing faces, floating NPCs, and performance issues. They gave out free DLC to apologize.

Watch Dogs -  The E3 2012 demo vs. the final game was straight-up catfishing. Graphics downgrade was real.

2015

Rainbow Six Siege -  Always-online, even for solo play, annoyed everyone. Later, they tried censoring blood and gambling stuff for China and backtracked after fans raged.

AC Syndicate -  PC version was buggy as hell at launch.

2016

The Division -  Classic Ubisoft—server outages at launch and hackers ruining the Dark Zone.

Far Cry Primal -  Turns out it reused the map from *Far Cry 4*. People noticed.

2017

For Honor -  Always-online DRM and insane grind unless you shelled out for microtransactions.

AC Origins -  Stacked Denuvo + VMProtect DRM tanked performance on PC.

2018

Far Cry 5 -  Same formulaic Ubisoft open-world design. Fans were over it.

The Crew 2 -  Why does a racing game need to be always-online?

2019

Ghost Recon Breakpoint -  Buggy, boring, loaded with microtransactions. Backlash was so bad they delayed future projects.

2020

AC Valhalla -  Buggy launch + XP boosters in a single-player game.

Hyper Scape -  Their attempt at a battle royale flopped hard.

Toxic Workplace Scandal -  Major harassment allegations—lots of execs resigned, but change has been slow.

2021

Far Cry 6 -  Same old Ubisoft formula + microtransactions in a $60 game.

XDefiant -  Yet another generic shooter no one asked for.

2022

Prince of Persia Remake -  Revealed with graphics that looked a decade old. Delayed indefinitely after backlash.

Skull &amp; Bones -  Development hell. Still no one knows what it’s supposed to be.

2023+

XDefiant -  Keeps getting delayed due to certification issues. Not a great sign.

Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 -  Officially the longest development hell ever. Who knows if it’ll even release?

Ubisoft Formula -  Open-world fatigue is real. Every game feels like the same map-clearing simulator.",ResultIntelligent856,1hbsov0,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hbsov0/why_are_people_surprised_when_ubisoft_fs_them/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hbsov0/why_are_people_surprised_when_ubisoft_fs_them/,2024-12-11 12:47:40,0,0.46,0,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbsov0
