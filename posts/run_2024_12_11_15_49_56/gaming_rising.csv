gaming,Secret Level (Amazon Prime),"I've just watched the first four episodes of [Secret Level](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33204697/), and I love it! It's a very cool, playful series, an homage to the games it features by \~10 minute episodes. I haven't played Sifu or New Worlds (episodes 2 and 3), but I've played a lot of Unreal Tournament and the UT episode really respects the game series and its history.
