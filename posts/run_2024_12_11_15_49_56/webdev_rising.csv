webdev,"I’m afraid to open source the data for my website, should I be?","I have made a free price comparison website for SaaS dev tools. And as the different categories and all the providers keep growing it will reach a point where keeping this up to date stops scaling time wise for me alone.

The project is still small-ish, but its growing and the requests for adding and updating data is growing as well.

So I’m thinking of open sourcing the pricing data so others can contribute if they want to, to keep the data up to date, and letting people add new categories or providers themselves.

But my worries is that in the day of AI assistants like v0 and bolt, the data source will be used to copy my little site and that it will be overtaken by others.

Is this a legit worry, or is the potential upside of having the tool grow and be a good resource for the community too great?

The target audience is developers so most of them can copy this pretty easily, its not complicated code. It’s the gathering of data that stops the copies I think.

I’ve been thinking of adding APIs for adding data as well, but I dont really think people will use that, what do you think?

The last resort would be to set up scraping to keep the data updated, not really a path I want to take.",skorpioo,1hbvi13,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hbvi13/im_afraid_to_open_source_the_data_for_my_website/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hbvi13/im_afraid_to_open_source_the_data_for_my_website/,2024-12-11 15:06:28,0,0.5,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbvi13
