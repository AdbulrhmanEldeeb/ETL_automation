devops,Shifted from a dev role to infra/devops role. Have been much much much more stressed since then,"As the title , I have been much much more stressed after shifting to devops. Partly because things are new for me so I am not always 100% sure about what I am pushing. And partly because of the tight deadlines and too much work and the fact that one small mistake from you could lead to a downtime. 

Are all companies like this? I have to work 11-12 hours and often on weekends too to meet the deadlines. And I believe I work faster than most of my colleagues.

devops,Useful DevOps projects at work,"I was just wondering if anyone has done any useful projects at work that has helped their teams a lot.

My entire company is migrating our kubernetes pipeline into an internal platform, so a lot of my helm knowledge is now rendered useless as we're using our internal k8s ""language"" (honestly it's terrible but whatever). This is managed by a developer team and I can only request features now, but not actually work on it (example: we should be using KEDA for autoscaling, but we simply have to wait until they convert helm into our internal language, then have them support it in our pipeline).

To shorten what we own is simply the actual deployments themselves, creating alerts/monitoring (but these tools are actually internal and we moved away from prometheus/grafana), 3rd party communications with our LLM Vendors, infrastructure costs.

So now I'm trying to do some work around this, like automating our verifications. But other than that, I really don't know what else I can do except clearly defining and documenting our processes. I just want to be a DevOps engineer again, not some technical writer or glorified deployment fodder for our engineers.

And yes, I'm just looking for new jobs, but also trying to strengthen my resume while I'm still at this company.

TLDR: Restricted by internal platform to do any real DevOps work.",XDPokeLOL,1hbmt69,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hbmt69/useful_devops_projects_at_work/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hbmt69/useful_devops_projects_at_work/,2024-12-11 05:49:14,12,0.83,12,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbmt69

devops,Seeking Career Advice: Mid-Level DevOps Looking for Less Stressful Path,"I have been working as a mid-level DevOps engineer for about four years now. Before that, I spent 10 years as a network engineer. I don't see a path to becoming a senior engineer due to my character. I'm very sensitive to stress, and I can't imagine handling serious production-related projects.

I also have two young children who require a lot of energy from both me and my wife, so I'm not in a position to pursue labs, certifications, or further expand my knowledge. Most days, I'm dealing with a foggy brain from lack of sleep and fatigue. I'm not naturally curious as an engineer, and every ticket feels more like a chore than a fun problem to solve.

At 40 years old, I feel it's time to do something different, but I can't afford to start over with a junior salary due to our family's expenses and mortgage.

I'm seeking recommendations on what to do in my position. Ideally, a managerial path would be best, but I lack experience as a shift leader or team leader and don't have the necessary soft skills.

I need to find a role that doesn't require continuous education and training. Any recommendations are welcome.

devops,Junior status updates,"To keep this short, I am a junior , working on a migration of our services. About 90% the way there but this project has dragged on months, literal months. We have a partner(external) team we work with who host it for us. We have limited permissions in their environments. 

We were able to get TEST up and running but working on PROD has dragged. From production freezes to, TF Debugging , to folks being out. Project has dragged. 

Iâ€™m not an expert but Iâ€™m trying and trying to avoid reaching out to my leader as heâ€™s kind of just let me do my own thing on this, and hasnâ€™t really checked in either. I know others like our tech lead, who I report to on stand ups provides updates but not sure how often. 

I am a bit frustrated with how some of this is being handled by our partner team. 

Does it make sense to check in and let my leader know where we stand, we donâ€™t necessarily communicate on the day to day but they do oversee my progress and I do check in with them for technical questions or discussions once a month or so. If I do check in and provide an update, my fear is seemingly like I am pushing the blame on others - when I am no expert myself.
