learnprogramming,Which route makes more sense for OO?,"# Preface

Overseer object that oversees production of *blank*. Builder object that builds a component. From my novice experience with OO and google, I think that what `Overseer` should do is tell each builder to build their component `Builder.build()` and `Overseer` doesn't care how it gets done. `Overseer` will then likely put the components together, or something else... But my issue is that *some* `Builder` objects need specifications whilst others don't.

Thinking of SOLID, and Interface Segregation amongst other things, doesn't that mean that only objects that require information have the implementation to do so? Maybe I could do this with interfaces alone, but my problem is thus: should `Builder` objects make calls to `Overseer` after being told to `.build()`?

# Example 1

* Overseer: Build this component.  `Builder.build()`
* Builder: Okay. What colour is it?
* `Overseer.order.get_colour()`
* Overseer: Blue.
* Builder: Okay. What material is it? `Overseer.order.get_material()`
* Overseer: Stone.
* Builder: Done.  `return component`

This is probably worded horribly, but I hope my point comes across.

# Example 2

* Overseer: Build this component. It needs to be blue and to be made of stone. `Builder.build(order.get_colour(), order.get_material())`
* Builder: Okay, but I don't care what colour it is.
* Builder: Done.

Which example makes more sense? I don't get OO (started in C, then Python and I'm aware that Python is not a OO language) and don't know if I'm thinking in the right way.

To me, example 1 makes sense because then `Overseer` does not care how stuff gets done, but in example 2 it would *have* to care because it would have to keep track of which `Builder` object uses what information... right?",Warmspirit,1hbvwz0,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,2024-12-11 15:25:22,1,0.67,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbvwz0

_Background_ 
- I am studying data science at university.                                                         
- I know the basics of programming in both C and Java.
- In C, I’ve reached topics like file handling, lists, and pointers.
- In Java, I’ve learned up to the same level but have also covered object-oriented programming.
- I’m aware that I’m missing algorithms and data structures. 
- I already have a good understanding of the logic behind programming.
- I know SQL

_Goal_
- Becoming a decent programmer/very employable/being able to build things on my own

Need Help to Bridge the Gap!,"I’m a software engineer from a tier-3 college, currently working at a tier-3 company as a .NET developer. Sometimes, when I look at the interview processes of top product-based companies, they seem overwhelmingly challenging and far beyond my current skills and understanding.

It makes me wonder—why don’t we, as engineers with similar levels of experience, have the same technical capabilities?

For instance, topics like data structures and system design, which are commonly asked in these interviews, often feel like fairy tales to many of us. But the reality is, mastering them is essential to becoming a competent and competitive software engineer in today’s industry.

My question is: how can a working professional with an average understanding of these concepts bridge the gap to reach that level of expertise? What structured approach should we follow to solidify our fundamentals and grow to a point where we can confidently compete in the current tech landscape?

learnprogramming,Should I consider switching to C++ from Rust for learning purposes?,"So for context, I'm a college student currently specializing in cyber security and I've been into computer science for a very long time and have being studying these concepts for a decently long time now. During this time I've tried out a bunch of different languages, mostly because I got bored (which isn't the best idea but younger me was stupid). For the past year-ish I've been using rust, which has been a amazing experience for the most part. I really enjoyed working concepts of errors as values and optional types for return values, which I had seen for the first time in a language. The only complaint I've had so far is the difficulty curve with rust. For my studies, its probably a good thing to start maintaining decent ranks in competitive programming websites like LeetCode, and rust is hard to work with for these problems, at least for me at this point. I've considered trying out C++ instead, but coming from rust, C++ just feels 'rustic' to put it simply, lacking features like errors as values which I've come to adore and probably can't live without anymore. It is, however, easier to get things done in C++ since I don't have to have to wrestle with the borrow checker at every turn.

I'm quite conflicted at this point. I could either continue using Rust and hope to simply get good enough to work with it, or switch to and learn C++, which will be pain coming from rust, having to give up such amazing features that rust has.

I was hoping I could get some pointers on what I should do in this situation by people that know more about the field in general than me.
