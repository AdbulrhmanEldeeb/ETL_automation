learnprogramming,Should I consider switching to C++ from Rust for learning purposes?,"So for context, I'm a college student currently specializing in cyber security and I've been into computer science for a very long time and have being studying these concepts for a decently long time now. During this time I've tried out a bunch of different languages, mostly because I got bored (which isn't the best idea but younger me was stupid). For the past year-ish I've been using rust, which has been a amazing experience for the most part. I really enjoyed working concepts of errors as values and optional types for return values, which I had seen for the first time in a language. The only complaint I've had so far is the difficulty curve with rust. For my studies, its probably a good thing to start maintaining decent ranks in competitive programming websites like LeetCode, and rust is hard to work with for these problems, at least for me at this point. I've considered trying out C++ instead, but coming from rust, C++ just feels 'rustic' to put it simply, lacking features like errors as values which I've come to adore and probably can't live without anymore. It is, however, easier to get things done in C++ since I don't have to have to wrestle with the borrow checker at every turn.

I'm quite conflicted at this point. I could either continue using Rust and hope to simply get good enough to work with it, or switch to and learn C++, which will be pain coming from rust, having to give up such amazing features that rust has.

I was hoping I could get some pointers on what I should do in this situation by people that know more about the field in general than me.

learnprogramming,"Graduating Soon and Preparing for 2025 Recruiting Season – Looking for Advice on Learning, Career Path, and Certifications!

","Hi guys,

I’m graduating from the University of Miami this spring with a degree in **Econ** (minor in Finance), and I’ve been diving into Python over the last month. So far, I’ve worked through the **beginner, arrays, and hash tables modules** on LeetCode, and I’m also doing a **DSA course on Udemy** and a **Python for Finance course**. My plan is to eventually build something cool (maybe a financial model) for my GitHub.

Here’s where I’m at:

* **LeetCode:** I’ve finished arrays and hash tables! I’m starting to get medium problems but still struggle to solve them completely on my own.
* **Python Projects:** Trying to come up with ideas—thinking something finance-related that could help me stand out.
* **Timeline:** I’ve got about 9 months until 2025 recruiting kicks off in September. Over the summer, I want to tackle side projects or even volunteer work to build up my skills and experience.

Also, I’m 25—am I too old to be starting in tech? I’d love to hear if anyone else has been in a similar boat and how they made it work.

I’d really appreciate any advice on:

1. **What to learn next:** What should I focus on in DSA and Python to keep improving?
2. **Career path tips:** I love the mix of finance and tech—what roles or projects would make me a stronger candidate?
3. **Certifications or resume boosters:** Are there any certs or must-have skills I should add to my plan?

I know the job market is tough, but I’m trying to use this time to get myself in the best shape possible for recruiting. Any advice, ideas, or resources would mean a lot.

learnprogramming,What should I start with ? ,"I’m a first-year CS-AI student, and next semester I’ll be taking ""Programming I"" in Java. Right now, I have some free time and want to use it to learn the basics of a programming language over the next month, spending 4-5 hours a day on it. I’m thinking of starting with C++ because a senior recommended it. They said the syntax is similar to Java, so I’d be preparing for Java while also learning C++. But I’ve heard that jumping between languages without mastering one first isn’t a good idea.

Should I just start with Java since I’ll need it for my course, or is it okay to start with C++ now and come back to Java later? I’d prefer to try C++ first, but I’m not sure if that’s the best move or if it’ll just be a waste of time.

2.) Some of the parameters are customizable, so I'd rather have a little website that allows the other person be able to adjust some parameters and generate the images on the fly. Is Django the best way to get this done? If so, should I host it on a VPS or is there a simpler place to run this web app?

learnprogramming,"If I don't want a career in programming, is it better for me to learn Python than anything else?","I am not looking for a career in programming but I think it's a very important skill to have. Whether it's because I want to develop codes for myself for ease of life or any business purposes etc.. etc.. 

But I am someone who tends to master what I get involved in. I know the common question is c++ or Python, but for someone in my position who doesn't want a career in programming, is learning c++ worth the time involved?

I'm completely new to coding but I'm quite technical so I'm not that lack luster.

I'd be eager to learn.

Advice is appreciated thank you.

learnprogramming,Should I learn C++?,"Hey I'm a first year undergraduate doing a Bachelors in Computer Science. I've been programming for quite a while now and I really love it... or so I thought. I realise now that I'm not very interested in most of the hot areas like machine learning, web/app development or game development in Unity, etc. What I'm actually interested in is stuff that makes me really think like programming puzzles, or maybe making a physics engine, making an algorithm visualiser, making a compiler, etc.

And I realised that maybe C++ is a good language because it seems like most of the things I'm interested in (compilers, graphics programming, OS) are done using it. But I've also heard that it's a very complicated language and takes a long time to learn well enough to land a good job in it. But I want to be able to get a decent internship and job by the end of my degree.

So what would be the best thing for me to do?

learnprogramming,Why Do Engineers from Tier-3 Colleges Struggle to Compete in Product-Based Company Interviews? Need Help to Bridge the Gap!,"I’m a software engineer from a tier-3 college, currently working at a tier-3 company as a .NET developer. Sometimes, when I look at the interview processes of top product-based companies, they seem overwhelmingly challenging and far beyond my current skills and understanding.

It makes me wonder—why don’t we, as engineers with similar levels of experience, have the same technical capabilities?

For instance, topics like data structures and system design, which are commonly asked in these interviews, often feel like fairy tales to many of us. But the reality is, mastering them is essential to becoming a competent and competitive software engineer in today’s industry.

My question is: how can a working professional with an average understanding of these concepts bridge the gap to reach that level of expertise? What structured approach should we follow to solidify our fundamentals and grow to a point where we can confidently compete in the current tech landscape?

learnprogramming,Has reading SICP helped you improve in your day job?,"Hi everybody! So I recently started reading SICP and just finished the first chapter ([link to my exercise solutions if anyone is interested](https://github.com/iagombermudez/sicp_book)).

So far, the book has helped me to fully understand the concept of recursion and to be very comfortable using it. During my time as a comsci student I had to complete many assignments that require the use of recursion, but nothing compared to what you need to do in this book since recursion is basically your only tool to create loops.

Another concept that I think is key is the concept of abstraction, which has been repeated across the entire chapter. However, I think this might be more useful if you don't have a lot of experience programming. I think it's still a good concept to review though, and one important thing that the book reiterates is that you don't need to abstract everything (something that I tend to forget from time to time lol).

So if any of you have gotten past the first chapter and would like to give your opinion on if it's worth to read it solely from a perspective of improving as a software engineer, I would love to hear from you!

So far, I think I will continue reading it just because I find it interesting and the exercises are entertaining, but maybe I won't finish the entire book since it's very time consuming (for reference, reading the first chapter and completing all the exercises took me around 2 weeks of daily studying for around one hour and a half).",Iamabrmdz,1hbgo6d,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbgo6d/has_reading_sicp_helped_you_improve_in_your_day/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbgo6d/has_reading_sicp_helped_you_improve_in_your_day/,2024-12-11 00:21:05,4,0.83,4,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbgo6d

What I am trying to achieve is, high-level, a user taps a button and that triggers a webhook, but without redirecting the user anywhere or opening a blank page/tab - the button should just work like a trigger/toggle.

I've tried (I think) the various combinations or HTTP and HTTPS, reverse proxy, portforward, POST vs GET, no-cors etc.

I know the webhook, link, server etc are all working as I can use the webhook link just in a browser - hit ender - and it triggers without a problem, so it's beyond me why it's so hard to achieve the same thing at button push.

I get various errors (depending on which iteration I've tried re: above) but the most common (from browser console) include

Hopefully what I'm trying to do is possible! and simply, with a little tweak, but if not - just for FYI - the webhook url is https, as is the site the button will be on. The Mixed content error is just a result of my trying to find the right combination (as above), so it pops up whenever I use a miss-matched HTTP/S combination.

I fiddled around with postman and got it working with a powershell script. But what would be the professional way to do this? Write a middleware? Use M365 Powerplatform?

learnprogramming,Is Leetcode a good tool for problem solving training?,"Hi there. I'm a second year CS student and during our C++ class we were offered to do an Advent of Code for some bonus points. I've had no problems with university level programming, done several easy pet projects and are now participating at mode complex one. But the advent has shown that I'm not good at solving problems - some mates says something like it was easy one, but for me it was no so easy and almost all of my solutions are long, with quite sophisticated logic to follow or have terrible time complexity. Also next semester there will be DSA course so from my perspective it looks like the good idea to start grinding Leetcode. However I have little to zero knowledge of DSA (I know arrays, lists, some kinds of trees, stacks, queues, recursion, several search algos, but nothing about hash tables and more complex ds and no serious knowledge of algos). Is Leetcode a good idea in situation like that? If it's no so good one, what should I do to become better?

learnprogramming,New to Web Development - Need help,"
Hello everyone,

I’m very new to web development (rookie alert! 😅). I’ve learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript for a year now at University but we haven’t.. well I’d assume go in depth and details of every part there is to know, but I’m currently working on building a website for someone I know just for fun—kind of as a surprise for them!

One of the things I’d like to add to the website is an admin page. For example, I’ve got an events page, and I want the site owner to be able to easily add events (title, image, description, etc.) through this admin page. Once they submit the form, it will push the new event to the events page. I’ve read a bit about CMS (Content Management Systems) and think it might be the answer, but I’m not sure

If anyone has experience with this and is willing to guide a newbie, I’d be super grateful! I’m using Visual Studio Code for my development and would love any tips, resources, or guidance you can offer.

Also, I know I’m a rookie, so any feedback or help would mean a lot. If anyone is willing to personally message me to walk me through it and maybe making this website come true, I’d really appreciate it!

learnprogramming,Really struggling with programming ,"Hey. I’ve wanted to learn programming for years and I kind of know the basics but whenever it gets to doing anything on my own I just get completely overwhelmed. I’ve gone from language to language not really mastering 1, and now im studying it for university I’m not sure how to even out my time or what to do with my own programming desires. I’ve nearly finished my first semester and I still don’t really feel like I know what I’m doing. I guess my end goal is to be able to make games, but right now I’m learning python at university but I was learning C++ on my own before. My brain is pretty scrambled right now so if anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it.",Royal_Buu,1hb40rf,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hb40rf/really_struggling_with_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hb40rf/really_struggling_with_programming/,2024-12-10 15:16:06,1,1.0,1,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hb40rf
