books,Fahrenheit 451 and Martial Law in South Korea,"Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books. Different people have different thoughts on what it's about. Is it about censorship? Is it a critique of Television? What makes it great is how versatile it is.  



One of the things that I think gets missed sometimes is what it can tell us about the nature of authoritarianism. First, however, I want to talk about some key scenes.  



On the second page of the story, Montag is heading home and we're told that he ""let the escalator waft him into the still night air."" Later, Mildred is listening to music through her ""tamped-shut ears, and her eye all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.""  


In each of these early scenes, air plays an important role in characterizing both Montag and Mildred. In Montag's case, him being wafted up the escalator shows his lack of agency. Later we learn he only even became a fireman because someone suggested he should be one. He didn't actually choose for himself. This is where he is at the beginning of the story, a man who isn't even aware of his lack of agency. I think many of us living in the world as it is feel similarly. It's easy to say, what can *I* do to make a difference? Why even bother trying? The more we think like this, the less we assert our agency, the less we're able to utilize our free will.  
 

In Mildred's case, this air imagery conveys her apathy. She can't be bothered to breathe because she is so bored and discontent. She knows something is wrong but can't put her finger on it, and that's why she takes too many sleeping pills and has to have her stomach pumped.  


Both of these scenes serve to show the impact living in an authoritarian, dystopian hellscape can have on people. It hollows you out and leaves you stuck, unable to pinpoint what's wrong and even less able to do something about it if you could.  



Here's where it ties into authoritarianism and tyranny. Fire is the symbol of authoritarian power in this world/story. The firemen are the enforcers, they're meant to be feared and respected. When the power of authoritarian rule makes itself felt on any citizen deemed problematic, that power is manifested through fire.  
 

So what Bradbury is saying is that the flame of authoritarianism/tyranny is sustained on the air of apathy and lack of agency.  
 

I think in light of how the people of South Korea stood together and said ""fuck this shit,"" and how quickly they organized and how immediate their success was, it's worth pointing out this subtle, easily missed, nugget of wisdom from Bradbury. We need to remember that people who strive to erect an authoritarian, tyrannical government designed for their own benefit depend on the indifference of the masses.",flyingjesuit,1hbw1yc,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,2024-12-11 15:31:32,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbw1yc

books,Should I Have Been Allowed to Read That?,"What was the most inappropriate thing you had read by the time you were 15 or 16? Some things I had read by that age include the following: 

- Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) 

- Flowers in the Attic

- Interview with a Vampire (which my science teacher asked to borrow after I was done?)

- Almost everything Stephen King had written up through 1987

- The Happy Hooker 

(It doesn't fit in with scandalous list above, but I was also obsessed with Erma Bombeck starting around age 11 or 12. I desperately wanted to be seen as the world-wearied housewife and mother of two that I, a pre-teen boy, apparently so identified with.)

So, tell me what yours are: 

Do you remember what it felt like reading the book? 

Did you feel like you were getting away with anything? 

Did you feel as if you had to keep this reading secret? 

Or were you reading this stuff openly? 

Do you get the sense that your parents also maybe had a list of books they had access to at too young an age? (If so, I'd love to hear what those are, too.)

books,Average Books Read Per Year by Country 2024,"As an Italian, I’ve grown accustomed to hearing a common lament: *“No one reads anymore.”* It's a phrase that echoes through discussions about cultural habits, often paired with reports of dwindling readership statistics. So you can imagine my surprise when I recently stumbled upon a report claiming that Italy ranks fifth in the world for readership. Naturally, this raised a mix of curiosity and skepticism—can such a claim be trusted, or is it an anomaly amidst the usual narrative? While I remain cautious about the source, it did prompt me to reflect on the broader landscape of reading habits.

I’d love to hear from you: in your country, do you also sense a decline in readership, or perhaps a shift in the way people engage with books? Is there a growing preference for digital formats, or are traditional books still holding their ground? I find this topic fascinating, especially since it speaks not only to our personal habits but to the cultural and educational priorities of our societies. What’s your perception?

books,"Why is Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince, seen as controversial?","I read a poor translation of it 16 years ago, while in high school, and basically took nothing away from it. 

I recently bought a new copy, with a different translation, and reread it with a more adult perspective, and I'm both more and less confused than ever.

Less confused, because as a lover of history, I understand that Machiavelli was ""subtly"" throwing shade at quite a few people in Italy's ruling class, but more confused because there's nothing in there that should be deemed controversial by modern readers.

Aside from actual military advice, like the relevance of fortress cities like Pistoia, the stockpiling of military equipment, and supplies, the rest of the book is very basic in its advice.

* Treat your friends graciously, pay special attention to allies who may become enemies, and ensure you keep them on your good side. 

* Be good to your people. 

* Try to be charismatic. 

* Know the value of those around you, and leverage it. 

* Don't be a dick for no reason. 

* Don't let people walk over you. 

* ""Speak softly but carry a big stick"" (be a good diplomat, but be ready to go to war if you need to).

* If you need to deal with opposition, make sure it's dealt with decisively so they don't harbour resentment and come back later to try and harm you again.

Basically, the majority of the book is either advice your parents should have given you in high school, or advice you learn watching children's cartoons. I mean there's literally a part in there about being crafty like a fox, and strong as a lion... you could put that into a child's storybook, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone did.

books,[Swiss Family Robinson] Rereading this book as a modern reader was WILD ,"*Disclaimer: I've not read too many ""classics"" for most of my life, the only other exception aside from this book is Dracula, most of the time I read nonfiction. Please pardon if I'm not too familiar with the ""genre conventions"".* 



Back when I was about 10 or 12 years old, I had a copy of Swiss Family Robinson that eventually got ruined by me spilling a glass of milk on it. I have always been fascinated by survival stories of various kinds and had a fascination with zoology, so young me (as much as I could recollect) absolutely loved the book. Anyways, three weeks ago I decided to purchase a copy to see if it has held up after all these years. 

**Oh boy.** 

For the most part, despite being influenced by Robinson Crusoe with its castaway and survival setting, it really stood out to me the sheer lack of \*strife\* the family experienced. Aside from the initial event of the shipwreck and having to survive on an exotic tropical landscape, the family for the most part lives very comfortable lives as the island itself seems to spawn whatever kind of flora and fauna that would help them live comfortable lives. In the edition that I read, there are kangaroos, buffaloes, hippopotamus and a whole bunch more on a single island. 

What was even more darkly hilarious is that the characters never once lampshade on how weird this was, rather opting to shoot and consume any animals they come across (understandable given the context but lmao). A constant barrage of ""see new animal, shoot animal because we own this island now and we can do it"". 

The family themselves were ""interesting"". I'm gonna be honest, the dad was what I could only described as the ""platonic ideal"" of what a M A N should be. Not only he was so religiously devoted that he could quote the Bible rivaling that of a senior clergyman, but knows about every plants and animals, their uses and can build practically anything. The children were well, just there, mostly to make things happen by running around doing shenanigans. The mother meanwhile was barely a character, mostly there to smooth out whichever things that stumps the father. Overall though, there was a distinct lack of character arcs for any of them, no new revelations about each other, no one gets changed by anything that happened. They got stuck on that island for years, and left it none the worse for wear.

Ultimately, I'd say that the online reviews I read before reading the book really was correct, it TRULY FELT like a product of its time. The specifics are too much for a post, but the overall constant occurrence of overt religious theming of the family's mass exploitation of nature because god gave them dominion of it and the whole ""ideal parental figures"" as I've mentioned above. For me, it encapsulates quite a fair bit of the common worldview at the time it is written, but there were points where it felt like quasi-absurdist humor at times. In conclusion for those that wants to read/reread it, it was a fun read but be prepared for some occasional ""weirdness"".
