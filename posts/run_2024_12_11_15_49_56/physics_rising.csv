Physics,Are boomerangs infinite propulsion?,"Sit on a bike, throw it backwards, move forward due to the propulsion, catch the boomerang as it comes back to you, absorb that kinetic energy again to accelerate you forward again. Throw it backwards again as propulsion, speed up, catch it again, speed up. Etc etc.

I specifically mean propulsion without losing mass. Obviously you lose energy, so let's say we have a solar powered robot throwing it",Ok_Eagle8991,1hbw8vk,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hbw8vk/are_boomerangs_infinite_propulsion/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hbw8vk/are_boomerangs_infinite_propulsion/,2024-12-11 15:39:55,0,0.15,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hbw8vk

Physics,I ran a little experiment because my laptop fan was making a lot of noise,"Hypothesis: By creating a high ambient airflow around my laptop using a room fan at maximum RPM, I can help its internal cooling system remove hot air more efficiently, potentially reducing fan noise and improving cooling performance.

Experiment:  I placed my laptop in a position where my room fan directed maximum airflow over it. The idea was that the increased airflow would reduce the stagnation of hot air around the laptop, allowing its fans to work less intensely.

Result:  It worked. The laptop fans became noticeably quieter. My hypothesis was correct—better external airflow helps a laptop's cooling system perform more efficiently. (I checked after I turned off my fans ofcourse). 

I think is because there is more being flown away from the laptop than more coming out.   
What would the physicists say? Why would this be?
