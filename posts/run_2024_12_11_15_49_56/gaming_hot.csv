gaming,My thoughts on TGA Nominees having now played them,"I finally played all of the TGA GOTY nominees thanks to Black Friday deals and I wanted to share my thoughts as award season approaches 

Balatro (9/10)

This game is a masterclass in deceptively simple design and It’s astonishing how easy to lose hours to its “one more run” hook. 

If you’ve avoided it because you think it’s “just poker” or “just a card game,” you’re seriously missing out and doing yourself a disservice. It’s a deeply engaging experience that I think you should try if you haven’t 

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (9/10)

While there’s some debate about its eligibility, for me personally there’s no denying that SOTE delivered one of the absolute best gaming experiences of the year. 

This expansion earns a spot on my Mount Rushmore of DLCs, right alongside Blood and Wine, Shivering Isles, and Phantom Liberty.

Astro Bot (9.5/10)

This. Game. Fucks.

As a fan of classic Nintendo 3D platformers, this felt like a love letter to the genre with a modern twist. 

My only complaint with the game is that I just wanted more of it at the end of the short run time to a platinum trophy. 

The final challenge run and the themed X, Square, Circle, and Triangle levels were brilliant and I’d kill for more levels of that difficulty and quality

If this game was just an appetizer, I can’t wait to see what Team Asobi has in store for the main course. If not for my ultimate favorite this year, this would have been my pick for GOTY.

Black Myth: Wukong (7.5-8/10)

While I enjoyed my three playthroughs of BM: W, I don’t think it quite reaches the same level as the other nominees. 

That said, for the developers’ first big swing, this is a fucking crazy impressive showing. I’m excited to see where they go next as this was an incredibly solid starting point and a downright great game in its own right 

Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (8.5/10)

As a huge fan of the original FF VII, the remake series has been a delight for me. 

The visuals are stunning, and it’s fucking sweet seeing the locations I remember in full 3D recreations. 

However for me it ultimately suffers from some modern open-world fatigue (developers seriously need to retire map towers and their equivalents lmao) 

Despite that, it’s a standout gaming experience, and I can’t wait for Part 3.

Metaphor: ReFantazio (9.5/10)

Jesus Christ, this game.

The characters, world-building, and narrative are utterly fantastic. 

At 40 hours in, it’s easily my GOTY—though, of course, a poorly executed ending could change that. 

My only (minor) gripe is that the soundtrack, while great, doesn’t quite hit Persona levels of perfection.

Final Rankings:
1.	Metaphor: ReFantazio
2.	Astro Bot
3.	Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
4.	Balatro
5.	Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
6.	Black Myth: Wukong

gaming,Revisiting classics can be heartbreaking sometimes,"For example, I’ve recently reinstalled Battlefield 1. I had some major memories with this game as I used to take my PlayStation over to my friends house every Friday night and we used to sit there with two monitors so it was as close to split screen as it gets. For those that are familiar with the game type “Operations” you’ll know what I’m talking about when I say THAT was the game mode you would play. It was both hectic and chaotic all at once.

Coming back to it now there’s just no player base numbers to fill up the lobby so you have to resort to smaller games in different modes like “frontlines”. Makes me think about all the classics shutting down or just not having a player base anymore like rainbow six vegas 2 and Halo 3. I feel these games live forever in our memories but sometimes trying to go back to them just feels so different. Almost like revisiting a house you used to live in. You have the memories but it’s just not home anymore. I think that’s the bitter sweet thing with online games these days….

gaming,"Thoughts on a game mechanic i had. ""Editing""","I love storytelling. Whether its movies or games.

Id even say that the interactive medium perfected the way stories could be told.

That being said we as gamers have our classics of story games.

Sadly a lot of them are dated by game mechanics and gameplay loops/pacing. 

Also the modern ""remake/remaster"" approach of today actually causes a lot more problems than making the initial game perfect.

For me its like. I love AC and the batman arkham games.

But hate the remaster for not fully doing what they were supposed to do.

I love the quality of live improvements like the gameplay in that being better. The world looking gorgeous.

But then the developers of those games remasters botched the cut scenes and made them ugly.

On one end their good. And on the other it would be great if they turned back to the original.

And i started thinking.

Im a big fan of ""fanedits of movies"". For the people who don't know what that is.

Fanedits are well..edits...by fans of movies where said fan cut or added scenes from a movie to make said movie better.

Whether is pacing or else.

What if games had this feature after your first play through. Making certain passages shorter. Choosing art direction form either version

Idk how that would work as far was the developers budget or time. 

OR...if that would even work.

But to it would be like a chapter menu. Where you can delete long gameplay section that just wasnt for you. Ect....

To make future play throughs easier.

Just a random thought. Curious to what you think.

My biggest issue is a lot of these games shouldn’t even be released because they’re early alpha builds at best. Damn near unplayable due to numerous bugs and glitches. I know deadlines and impatient shareholders are some reasons for early access releases. I just wish devs would go back to the way things used to be and release the finished game on launch.

gaming,Why doesn't Steam get involved in Android Gaming/Emulation?,"Mobile gaming is appareantly the biggest market in gaming: [Global increase State of Mobile Gaming Industry | GO-Globe](https://www.go-globe.com/state-of-mobile-gaming-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20the%20Mobile,2.8%20billion%20mobile%20gamers%20worldwide.). The reasons are clear. Everyone has a smartphone, but not everyone has a PC fit for gaming or a console. So the obstacles for getting into gaming are pretty low.

Sadly the Playstore mainly constists of garbage games, with a free-2-play and in-app-store monetization model. This model does not aim for good gameplay, but for pulling your money out of your pocket. There are some pearls standing out, like Dead Cells, Slay the Spire and so on, which are direct ports of their pc/console counterparts, but as they have upfront cost, appareantly the big mass does not want them or does not find them in the pile of thrash, that the Playstore is. Since they don't generate enought revenue, the willingness of other publishers to port their already existing games to Android is also neglectable.

Now comes the neat part: If you checkout r/EmulationOnAndroid , basically the whole gaming history, with the exception of the latest consoles, is available on Android through emulation. Using **Winlator** or similar, it is even possible to emulate PC games, without much hassle. I have seen videos of Skyrim, Witcher 3 and even Cyberpunk getting played on High End Android devices. Since this is possible, this eleminates the need for porting games, you can just play the PC version, if you want to. As i understood it, the Steam Deck does the same. It creates a compatibility layer for PC games for the Steam Deck hardware/OS, they were not initially made for.

Now comes the big question: Since such feats can be accomplished by just a few developers worldwide, why is lets say Valve/Steam so not interesed in this topic? They already have a mobile app, with Steam Link a powerful editor for mobile controls and the compatibility layer through their Steam OS. If they tie these parts together they could have a third platform, they could distribute their games for. Imagine you buy a game on Steam and you could play it on PC, on the Steam Deck AND on Android!

It is definitely technically feasible, as it was already shown by others.

- Multiplayer. Not so much in MMO, maybe MMOlite, or something that doesn't rely on multiplayer, but supports it and is an integral part of the game.
- Character Customization. Doesn't have to be super in depth.
- Somewhat active community. I don't want to play a game that's practically dead. 


OPTIONAL FEATURES:

- PvP. I can take it or leave it but it will be cool if it had something like it.

This game is one of the most brilliant games I ever played. And a short one, which I appreciate having now a toddler. 
What a wonderful time to be alive to play such an awesome piece of art. Lucas Pope if you ever read this, I'll pay you a drink, whenever.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

For me this game was as marking as Outer Wilds, or Subnautica. Two games with surprising aspects you shouldn't know about prior to playing them.

gaming,I’ve Had Enough of The Diablo 4 and PoE 1 &amp; 2 Discourse,"About a month ago I got back into Diablo 4 and while it’s not perfect by any means it’s a fun, turn your brain off, action RPG. While playing for a month I remembered I pre-order POE2 early access a while back and also was incredibly excited to try it out.

Since then I’ve been switching back and forth between them and have been having a blast because ultimately I understand, that while they occupy the same genre, they are two completely different types of ARPG.

Diablo 4 is a fast paced power fantasy with a lot of high quality polish. POE2 is the spiritual successor of the Diablo 2 formula. It’s a slower more methodical ARPG that requires more thought, with a lot of customization for how you want your builds.

Both are serviceable to their audiences, and both have incredibly loyal fanbases. An while comparisons are inevitable and fair in some cases. Certain sects of each fanbase, like children, look for constant opportunities to shit on the other acting as if there is this “one true” ARPG.

The ARPG community is similar to the JRPG community in that, you have these incredibly vocal voices, who do not make up the majority of players, set these arbitrary “rules” on what constitutes a true game of the genre. So anything that goes against these “rules” is deemed as not a “true” this or that. 

Which then creates this very negative, and unhealthy mindset, that limits your ability to accept anything new or genre pushing. To someone like me, this type of behavior is shallow and embarrassing. Not to mention it’s hypocritical given that most ppl like games within genre for different reasons. 

If it were up to these types we’d still be stuck in the 90’s.

gaming,Easy open world games like Mario Odyssey?,"My five year old son loves video games and while I’ve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I’ve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There’s basically no way to play that game wrong. It’s a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There’s a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.

We’ve tried some other games to varying success, but I’m looking for more options. We are also somewhat system agnostic as I have the means to provide him with different systems.

1. Kirby and the forgotten lands: probably his second favorite. Very youngster friendly. However, it’s not a sandbox and the linear nature frustrated him sometimes (no going backwards, game forces you in a certain direction).

2. Super Mario world 3d and bowser’s fury: the difficulty was a bit too high for 3d world after the first world and suffers the same linear design issue. Bowsers fury was great but ultimately short for him.

3. Animal crossing new horizons: youngster friendly art and design but honestly not in game play. It seems simple, but is heavy on reading and understanding the motivations of progression (paying off your house, earning money, etc.) it also has the issue of not being able to start from scratch and my island is already pretty decked out. He can start his own tent but the island is still the same as my decked out one.

4. Yoshi’s crafted world: great difficulty for kids but again… not open world

5. Captain Toad Tracker: fun bit too difficult as the puzzles get harder

6. Sonic frontiers: way to clunky. He lost interest pretty much right away because of terrible controls.

7. Zelda: breath of the wild: too difficult for him for progression

8. Pokémon: his reading needs to be polished a bit more for him to really get it.

9. Spider-Man: Miles Morales: hilariously is super fun for him to just swing around the city. He even started getting good at fighting, but the puzzles grind him to a halt and then I have to play all those parts.

Anybody have any suggestions that I’ve missed?

I mainly just played competitive Minecraft, like Ranked Bedwars and co, but It's taken a toll on me in certain ways. I don't want to quit gaming yet, as I'm still relatively young (I'm under 21).

Now I never played ay of the ""great classics"" most people played in 2010 upwards. I don't have the beefiest PC either, so I'm looking for story mode games that aren't too new and demanding on your device either. The only one I've heard of is Titanfall, which I'll most likely get today. It doesn't have to be a calming game, but something I can pause, come back to, and feel like I'm in a movie too.

Again, even it's a classic that most people of played, I most likely haven't, so feel free to share anything",RiverHe1ghts,1ha6deo,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ha6deo/selfpost_asking_for_game_recommendation_moving/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ha6deo/selfpost_asking_for_game_recommendation_moving/,2024-12-09 09:54:40,6,0.57,6,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1ha6deo

gaming,Can someone explain the Indiana Jones hype right now?,"I downloaded it yesterday on my Xbox, and I have to say it’s a pretty mediocre experience for me so far. But the consensus seems to be that it’s going to be GOTY, with people just giving high praise to it.  I feel like I’m missing out on something that’s keeping me from enjoying it. 

My major complaints with this game are that it feels more like an interactive story where I sometimes get to open doors by pressing X and then moving my thumbstick to the left.  When I finally get to see some actual gameplay, it’s mostly stealth. Indiana Jones should be an adventure game, not a stealth game.   Combat when it happens is okay but there’s way better combat in games out there. 

The one thing I do like about combat is there’s lots of options for weapons just lying around that can be easily picked up.  Another thing that’s really the only thing keeping me playing is that the story feels like a real Indiana Jones story, so I keep playing just to find out what happens next. 

Anyway I’m not here to hate on the game, I’m just trying to find out why people love it so much. If I understood that maybe I’d enjoy it more too.  In the meantime I feel like this is a game I’ll play once and never pick up again.

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: my thoughts,"Funny no one is talking about it yet. I play on GFN turning everything up to ""supreme"" (I guess ultra is not good enough anymore). It is a very nice looking game. No expense spared (quoting from another Spielberg movie).

Using the opening scene of the first movie as a tutorial is ingenious. Puzzles and actions are good, but I do not think that is what is going to make or break the game. I am hoping for great set pieces and a good story (which is what the reviews said it has).

I have xbox game pass ultimate, so this is already include in the sub but so far (which admittedly I am not that deep into the game yet) I like it.

I think we need more single player, well written narrative based, AAA adventure games. A very much fresh take from the online service games that become more like a job, or the souls like ""can't-beat-without-practice-for-weeks"" beat-them-ups.

gaming,Multiplayer Teamwork/Minigame Game Recommendations?,"I have grown exhausted of all the ""kill the other people!"" Games. A lot of them are great, well made games. Don't get me wrong. But, I am sick of the sweat. The skill ceilings and the absurd amount of stress they can sometimes bring about instead of joy. I work a full-time job and have fully accepted I will never be on the same level as someone who's either naturally gifted (which I am not), or has the majority of their day to practice (which I do not). So, I ask in hopes that some of you might have some amazing recs!

When I say MP Teamwork, I mean things like Vermintide 2. Deep Rock. Ready or Not. Phasmophobia. The list goes on forever, but I hope you get what I mean. The mission of the game is not ""Kill the other people!"" It is ""All of you are on the same team, working towards the same goal."" Or hell, the examples I listed were just violent (for a lack of a better word) games. Chill games like Party Animals, or other ""minigame"" style experiences are also welcome!

Multiplayer is my favorite type of game to play. I am incredibly anti-social in real life despite wanting social interaction, so it's nice to sit back and play games with other people. It creates this sphere where I am interacting and hanging out with others, but there's really no pressure, and it's a bubble I like to exist in. Thus my preference for it over singleplayer games. But, trying to find games like the ones I'm searching for-outside of the ones I already listed-feels like pulling teeth. I appreciate any recs you might have, or if you just gave this a look over, I appreciate it all the same.

gaming,This New Indy Game Has Led Me To Believe a Good 007 Game May Be Possible,"Put some time into this new Indy game today and I gotta say that they've really nailed the feel of ""being"" Indiana Jones. The game's cleverness and great storyline (so far) have me feel like I'm in the midst of a real Indiana Jones movie, and it's easily the best Indy content of the 2000s. I'm enjoying it so much that it got me thinking of another movie franchise that I have been wishing could return to the glory days..... 007.

  
GoldenEye is obviously considered a high mark of the series and the N64 era, but I, as a fan of the series, even enjoyed the Nightfire, Agent Under Fire and even the terrible multiplayer of Quantum of Solace on the 360. Bond, like Indiana Jones, is a great protagonist/seires that when written well, could have an amazing return to console. While movie licensing has typically meant awful games for the past few decades, this launch is giving me hope that out there is an opportunity to ""be"" James Bond in a well-developed and modern adaptation that I think is sorely missing from our current gaming world. Ideally, if we could see something that grabs a little inspiration from the Hitman games as well, I could die a happy man! That being said, thanks Betheseda for this great return to my childhood and here's to hoping someone gives us our ""License to Thrills"".
