Python,Did an open source tool for code exploration,"# Description

Treeline is a code analysis and visualization tool designed to help developers understand the quality and structure of their Python codebases. It does some complexity metrics, detects code smells, and generates an interactive HTML-based visualization for relatively easy exploration. I hope it will give developers some insights into architectural dependencies, complexity hotspots, and maintainability issues.

# Links

* [https://github.com/duriantaco/treeline](https://github.com/duriantaco/treeline)
* [https://pypi.org/project/treeline/](https://pypi.org/project/treeline/)

# What My Project Does

* **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies which modules import others, which classes belong to which modules, and which functions call which, creating a complete dependency graph.
* **Metrics Computation**: Calculates cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, maintainability index, function length, and code smell occurrences.
* **Visualization**: Renders an interactive HTML report using D3.js, where each node represents a module, class, or function. You can hover over nodes to see detailed metrics, search for specific elements.
* **Quality Reporting**: Produces Markdown and HTML reports summarizing complexity hotspots.

Python,Introducing My New Favicon Extraction Tool,"## What My Project Does

I've created a tool that extracts favicons from any website. It works by parsing HTML pages, checking fallback routes for icons, and even supports inline base64-encoded images. The tool can also verify availability, guess missing icon sizes, and download the favicons for further processing. It aims to streamline favicon retrieval for web scraping, data analysis or just curious exploration.

## Links

- Source code: https://github.com/AlexMili/extract_favicon/
- Documentation: https://alexmili.github.io/extract_favicon/


## Target Audience

The project is designed for developers and data enthusiasts who work with web metadata. Whether you‚Äôre building a crawler, enhancing a web directory, or simply analyzing website branding. My intention is to maintain and improve it, making it stable and ready for production use cases.


## Comparison

While there are other favicon extraction libraries out there, many of them have become unmaintained or lack features like asynchronous support, thorough availability checks, and automatic size guessing. My project is actively maintained, built with modern Python standards, and provides a more robust, flexible solution than many existing alternatives.",Beneficial_Expert448,1hbtf03,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hbtf03/introducing_my_new_favicon_extraction_tool/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hbtf03/introducing_my_new_favicon_extraction_tool/,2024-12-11 13:26:32,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1hbtf03

Python,Feedback for project creating conversational agents using a Finite State Machine (FSM) and LLMs,"Hi r/Python community!

I've been working on a project combining Finite State Machines and Large Language Models. I posted this a while ago, and have been making improvements/tweaks, including turning it into a package available on PyPi.

What My Project Does:  
This project provides a framework for building conversational agents using a Finite State Machine (FSM) powered by LLMs like OpenAI GPT. It aims to create structured tools like step-by-step teaching systems, customer support bots, and multi-step memory games while addressing issues like hallucinations, loss of context, and unpredictability. I have a few example usages in the repo.

Target Audience:  
This is currently an experimental setup, and also part of a research project I am doing for university. For now it is meant for developers and experimenters mainly. Requires an OpenAI API key (currently tested on gpt-4o-mini and 4o).

Comparison:  
Unlike typical LLM-based chatbots, this combines FSM with LLMs to enforce structured, predictable conversations, making it ideal for use cases requiring adherence to predefined paths.

If anyone is interested I would love to hear your feedback and thoughts! The repo is here: [https://github.com/jsz-05/LLM-State-Machine](https://github.com/jsz-05/LLM-State-Machine)

Python,I build PdfDing with Python,"Hi r/Python,

over the last six months I have build PdfDing. You can find it on¬†[GitHub](https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing).

**What My Project Does**

PdfDing is a selfhosted PDF manager and viewer offering a seamless user experience on multiple devices. Some of its features include:

* Remembers current position - continue where you stopped reading on any device
* Share PDFs with an external audience via a link or a QR Code. Shared PDFs can be access controlled
* Dark Mode, colored themes and custom theme colors
* Inverted color mode for reading PDFs
* SSO support via OIDC

¬†I have used the following tech stack:

* the web app is build using Python (Django)
* The frondend is build using Alpine.js, htmx, jQuery and Tailwind CSS
* Mozilla's PDF.js is used for viewing PDF files in the browser

**Target Audience**

Homelabs or businesses who want a self-hosted solution for their PDFs.

**Comparison**

There are solutions like self-hosted ebook readers. However, they are using the inbuilt PDF viewer of the browser. This works fine on desktops and laptops but on smartphones it will simply download the PDF file and not display it in the browser (at least it is like this on my mobile devices). This solution also does not allow you to continue reading where you stopped on another device.

Most solutions also do not allow users to upload files, as there is an admin curating the content. Furthermore, I wanted a minimal and resource-friendly solution that allows me to share PDFs with an external audience.

**Final remarks**

If you like PdfDing I would be really happy over a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing). As the project is open source, if anyone wants to contribute you are welcome to do so!",Mindless-View-3071,1haxeb7,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1haxeb7/i_build_pdfding_with_python/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1haxeb7/i_build_pdfding_with_python/,2024-12-10 08:37:42,55,0.86,55,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1haxeb7

Python,New android app project called AndroidFetch,"Target Audience: People who like messing with their devices, people who want to know about their phones

Comparison: Not any python based that I'm aware of, but in general the closest match is ""Device info HW"". in comparison my application is: open-source, gives some information which device info doesn't, is easier to read and has a better ui (in my opinion as I don't like the other's look)

information on the app: It is a .py file that will eventually become an apk and is fully based on Python, including the ui that is made in kivy.

Python,Create a complete WORD SEARCH BOOK with a single click.,"# [BOOP (Book Of Organized Puzzles)](https://github.com/Muneer320/BOOP)

# Description

BOOP is a Python-based automation project that generates a fully personalized puzzle book. With just a list of words as input, it creates a complete PDF with title pages, index pages, word search puzzles, and solutions.

Why did I make this? Honestly:

1. I was bored and needed something fun to work on.
2. I already had a script that could make word search puzzles, so I thought, ""Why not take it up a notch?""
3. I‚Äôve always wanted to write a book but lack the intellectual supremacy to do so. This project seemed like the next best thing!

# Links

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Muneer320/BOOP)

# What My Project Does

* **Word Search Puzzles**: Generates 17 puzzles per topic, categorized into Normal, Hard, and Bonus modes.
   * Normal: 10 puzzles (13x13 grid).
   * Hard: 5 puzzles (17x17 grid).
   * Bonus: 2 challenging puzzles.
* **Fully Designed Book**: Includes title pages, a detailed index, puzzle pages, and solution pages.
* **Automation**: Users only need to input a list of 200 words per topic; the script handles everything else.

# Target Audience

* Puzzle enthusiasts looking for custom-made puzzle books.
* Educators creating engaging learning materials.
* Developers interested in Python-based automation projects.

# Comparison to Other Tools

Unlike existing puzzle generation tools that often require manual input and separate design efforts, BOOP automates the entire process‚Äîfrom generating puzzles to compiling them into a polished, ready-to-print PDF. It‚Äôs an all-in-one solution for creating professional-quality puzzle books.

# Extra Details

BOOP started as just another random project, but it taught me a lot along the way. I learned about handling PDFs in Python, the importance of using different file formats for various tasks, and discovered many dos and don'ts that only hands-on experience can teach. It‚Äôs been an incredibly fun and rewarding journey!

# Conclusion

BOOP makes puzzle book creation easy, fun, and entirely automated. Whether you‚Äôre an educator, puzzle fan, or a developer looking to explore automation, this project has something for you.

Python,Convert Figma design into Python code,"üîó Link ‚Äî [https://github.com/axorax/tkforge](https://github.com/axorax/tkforge)

# What My Project Does

TkForge is a Python app that allows you to turn your Figma design into Python tkinter code. So, you can make a GUI design in Figma and use specific names like ""textbox"", ""circle"", ""image"" and more for interactable elements then use TkForge to get the code for a fully functional working GUI app from your design.

And it's **free, open-source** and regularly maintained!

# Target Audience

TkForge is made for anyone who wants to make a GUI with Python easily and efficiently. It's fast and you can make some really complex and beautiful GUI's with it.

# Comparison

There's another project similar to TkForge called Tkinter Designer. Personally without being biased, I think TkForge is better. TkForge supports everything Tkinter Designer does and more. TkForge generates better code, supports more elements, allows you to add placeholder text (which you can't by default in tkinter), automatically sets foreground color and a lot more! Placeholder text and foreground color generation is a bit buggy though.  I use TkForge for most of my tkinter projects. You can get help in the Discord server.

# Updates

I updated the app to support multiple frames, fixed a lot of previous bugs and added checks for new updates!

Python,Introducing PyKick: A Python Project Generator for PowerShell,"**Hello everyone,**

Even with the intention of sharing, it's always a bit stressful to expose personal work to the community =}

But well... Maybe someone has the same question or need as I did, so with that in mind, I'm sharing my modest work done during my free time in the evenings (when the whole family is asleep =D) As you can see, besides the templates, there isn't anything particularly special ‚Äì PyKick does what it needs to do and voil√† ‚Äì unit tests were the most time-consuming, as always (the PowerShell module was quick to write).

# What My Project Does

PyKick is an installable PowerShell module (or can be sourced otherwise) that quickly generates a new Python project with Git management, a virtual environment, and Sphinx documentation (if requested). In my Python projects, I need CLI exposure. Therefore, the generated Python project is immediately functional (a `pip install .` results in a CLI providing package information and version - the structure is here, just to complete)

PyKick doesn't aim to replace anything. Not finding something that met my needs, I ended up writing it without realizing it =}

# Target Audience

I think it's quite clear =√æ

* If you are a developer or need a Python project generator with Git version control, isolated virtual environment, and documentation, etc.
* Especially if you work with PowerShell

PyKick can assist you.

# Comparison

I don't think comparison is relevant as the goal and environment are not identical... If a comparison is necessary, then PyKick is a Python project generator that works on PowerShell.

Python,"Deply 0.5.1 Released: New Collectors, 10x Performance Boost, and Stronger Architectural Rules","Hello everyone,

It's Archil again, checking in from Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. I'm excited to announce the release of Deply 0.5.1, an updated version of my Python tool for enforcing architectural patterns and dependencies in larger codebases. I've noticed steady downloads since the previous post, and I'm genuinely grateful to everyone who has tried Deply or provided feedback.

# What My Project Does

For those new here [here is my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gthdpy/deply_keep_your_python_architecture_clean/), Deply analyzes your code structure and verifies that your Python project adheres to a defined architecture. You specify layers, set rules, and Deply enforces them‚Äîhelping maintain clean, modular, and maintainable code as your project grows.

# Target Audience

Ideal for developers and teams building medium to large Python applications who need to maintain clear, enforceable architectural boundaries. It also suits those aiming to teach or learn best practices.

# Comparison to Other Tools

‚Ä¢ **pydeps:**

*Focus:* Visualization of dependencies

*Comparison:* pydeps provides a visual map of imports, helping you understand how parts of your code relate. Deply goes further by actively enforcing rules on these dependencies, ensuring that your project structure adheres to architectural guidelines instead of merely displaying it.

‚Ä¢ **import-linter:**

*Focus:* Import-based dependency constraints

*Comparison:* import-linter is excellent for managing import hierarchies and preventing forbidden dependencies. Deply builds on this approach by supporting additional collectors (class inheritance, decorators, file patterns) and more complex rules, making it easier to define rich architectural standards beyond imports.

‚Ä¢ **pytest-archon:**

*Focus:* Architectural checks integrated into pytest

*Comparison:* pytest-archon provides Pythonic tests for architectural constraints. While it‚Äôs great for projects already using pytest, Deply is a standalone tool that can integrate with any CI pipeline or workflow. Deply‚Äôs configuration-driven approach and broader set of collectors and rules allow for more flexible and layered architecture definitions.

‚Ä¢ **pytestarch:**

*Focus:* ArchUnit-inspired checks for Python using pytest

*Comparison:* pytestarch mimics the style of Java‚Äôs ArchUnit, letting you write tests for architectural constraints. Deply‚Äôs YAML configuration and layer-based modeling approach differ by providing a domain-specific language for architecture, reducing the need to write code-based tests and offering more straightforward integration for non-test environments.

‚Ä¢ **Tach (Rust-based):**

*Focus:* Architecture checks written in Rust

*Comparison:* Tach brings a Rust-based perspective on architecture enforcement. Deply, being Python-native, integrates more seamlessly into Python ecosystems. Deply also provides Python-specific collectors and is tailored for Python‚Äôs dynamic nature, whereas Tach, being language-agnostic and built in Rust, may require additional steps or adaptations for Python-specific patterns.

‚Ä¢ **ArchUnit (Java-focused):**

*Focus:* Architecture rules for Java codebases

*Comparison:* ArchUnit excels at defining and enforcing architecture rules in Java projects. Deply serves a similar purpose but is designed specifically for Python‚Äôs idioms and ecosystems. Deply‚Äôs flexible configuration and Python-oriented collectors cater directly to Python developers‚Äô needs, whereas ArchUnit remains tied closely to Java‚Äôs conventions.

# What's New in 0.5.1?

1. **New Collectors** More versatile collectors now let you define conditions for class and function selection with greater precision, making it easier to adapt Deply to your specific frameworks and coding patterns.
2. **10x Performance Improvement** We've significantly optimized the analysis process. Deply now runs about 10 times faster than the first version, ensuring that integrating it into your CI/CD pipelines won't slow you down.
3. **Extended Rule Set** From inheritance and naming conventions to decorator usage, the enhanced rule system provides finer control over maintaining architectural integrity.

# Example: Simple Django API Views and Models Layer Checker

    deply:
      paths:
        - /Users/a.abuladze/pinup/pinup-teams/pinup_teams
    
      exclude_files:
        - "".*\\.venv/.*""
    
      layers:
        - name: models
          collectors:
            - type: bool
              any_of:
                - type: class_inherits
                  base_class: ""django.db.models.Model""
                - type: class_inherits
                  base_class: ""django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser""
    
        - name: views
          collectors:
            - type: file_regex
              regex: "".*/views_api.py""
    
      ruleset:
        views:
          disallow_layer_dependencies:
            - models
          enforce_function_decorator_usage:
            - type: bool
              any_of:
                - type: bool
                  must:
                    - type: function_decorator_name_regex
                      decorator_name_regex: ""^HasPerm$""
                    - type: function_decorator_name_regex
                      decorator_name_regex: ""^extend_schema$""
                - type: function_decorator_name_regex
                  decorator_name_regex: ""^staticmethod$""

**What this does:**

* Ensures that your views\_api.py file belongs to the views layer and can't depend on models.
* Requires view functions to use certain decorators (**HasPerm** and **extend\_schema** together, or **staticmethod** as a fallback).

&gt;*Note: These examples are not calls to action; they're hypothetical and depend entirely on your project's structure, architecture, and your team's preferences.*

# Additional Examples

# Class Naming Rule:

    service:
      enforce_class_naming:
        - type: class_name_regex
          class_name_regex: "".*Service""

Classes in the service layer must have names ending with Service.

# Function Naming Rule:

    tasks:
      enforce_function_naming:
        - type: function_name_regex
          function_name_regex: ""task_.*""

Functions in the tasks layer must start with task\_.

Again, these are just hypothetical configurations. Every team and project has different needs, so you can tailor Deply's rules to fit your unique architectural guidelines.

# Rules Overview

* `disallow_layer_dependencies`: Prevent certain layers from referencing other layers.
* `enforce_function_decorator_usage`: Ensure functions use specified decorators.
* `enforce_class_decorator_usage`: Require classes to have certain decorators.
* `enforce_class_naming`: Enforce naming conventions for classes.
* `enforce_function_naming`: Enforce naming conventions for functions.
* `enforce_inheritance`: Ensure that classes inherit from specified base classes.
* `bool` rules (must, any\_of, must\_not): Combine multiple conditions for complex logic.

# Collectors Overview

* `bool`: Combine other collectors with logical conditions (must, any\_of, must\_not).
* `class_inherits`: Select classes that inherit from a given base class.
* `class_name_regex`: Select classes matching a specific regex pattern.
* `function_name_regex`: Select functions matching a specific regex pattern.
* `decorator_usage`: Select classes or functions based on their decorators.
* `directory`: Select elements (classes, functions, variables) from specific directories.
* `file_regex`: Select elements from files that match a given regex pattern.

Python,Sharing Smoke Simulation Project I have Been Working On,"Hello all, I have been working on this project for quite some time and found it to be very useful for my task as a software engineer trying to build Computer Vision applications. My daily job involves working with smokey images and finding models but getting smokey images on demand was not possible and hence I came up with an idea to make a simulator. I modified the existing solution from [bijection/smoke.js](https://github.com/bijection/smoke.js) and implemented it with Python.

Links:

* GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/q-viper/SmokeSim/](https://github.com/q-viper/SmokeSim/)
* Demo: [https://q-viper.github.io/SmokeSim/](https://q-viper.github.io/SmokeSim/) (This demo is from only the JavaScript Version.)

## What My Project Does

It simulates a reproducible smoke image using PyGame. The property of the smoke and its particles can be controlled by the properties like size, velocity, lifetime, color, etc. In addition to that, this package can act as an image augmentation and can return the overlayed smoke mask, overlayed image, and smoke too.

## Target Audience

The main target audience would be anyone who is working on Computer Vision projects or image augmentation and looking for a cool way to increase training images. However, anyone who is interested in building something fun with Python and collaboration might find it interesting.

## Comparison

There are packages like Torchvision and Albumentations and this feature of simulating and overlaying a smoke on top of the image is not implemented there. While my little work is not huge to be compared with such tools, I smoke simulation useful.

Python,Python .gitignore,"I'm sure a lot of you have done this:

1. Start new project
2. Need that generic Python `.gitignore` file on GitHub
3. Google ""python gitignore"" (though you probably typed ""gitingore"")
4. Click link and click raw
5. Copy all and paste in your local `.gitignore`

And I'm sure a lot of you probably just use curl and have it memorized or have it in your shell history or something (`fzf` ftw). But I can't be bothered to learn curl properly, and I got tired of the manual steps, so I just created a function in my `.zshrc` file:

    function pgi {
        curl -JL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/refs/heads/main/Python.gitignore -o .gitignore

Python,How we made Celery tasks bulletproof,"Hey folks, 

I just published a deep dive into how we handle task resilience at GitGuardian, where our Celery tasks scan GitHub PRs for secrets. Wanted to share some key learnings that might help others dealing with similar challenges.


**Key takeaways:**

1. Don‚Äôt just blindly retry tasks. Each type of failure (transient, resource limits, race conditions, code bugs ) needs its own handling strategy.
2. Crucial patterns we implemented:
   - Ensure tasks are idempotent (may not be straightforward, 
   - Used `autoretry_for` with specific exceptions + backoff
   - Implemented `acks_late` for process interruption protection
   - Created separate queues for resource-heavy tasks

**Watch out for:**

1. Never set task_retry_on_worker_lost=True (can cause infinite retries)
2. With Redis, ensure tasks complete within visibility_timeout
3. Different behavior between prefork vs thread/gevent models for OOM handling

Python,VCAT: Video Transcriber and Translator,"



# Have you ever wanted to share videos to your non bilingual friends? üåé


Fear not because I (Claude) have made a script that does exactly that!


## **What My Project Does** ‚ö°


Type in a video URL along with the target language and the program will:

A) Download the media from the URL (Uses youtube-dlp so most websites are compatible)  
B) Transcribe it (srt file output)  
C) Translate it (srt file output)  
D) Add subtitles using ffmpeg  

All fully automated of course!

üîç [https://github.com/tikene/video-caption-and-translate](https://github.com/tikene/video-caption-and-translate) - You can see some sample translations on my repo to get an idea of how the output video looks


## **Target Audience** üë•


If you have any friends who, for example, aren't fluent with English, you may have ran into some frustration when trying to share movies, videos or shows that you like. That's what motivated me to make this script, making it so you can easily share your interests and build human connections regardless of the language barrier (It's all about making the world a better place üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)



## **Comparison** üîÑ

The projects I could find relating to this subject either:
- Don't accept URLs 
- Don't work with long videos
- Don't add the subtitles directly to the video
- Are outdated



## **Extra details** üí°

The process is fully automatic so I actually find myself using it often, it only takes 10 seconds to start the translation. 

Every language is supported because it uses OpenAI for translation, which means you do need an API key but it only costs around $0.01 for every minute of video. I spent $5 and have been using this script for months.



## **Conclusion** üéØ

This is my first time sharing a project, so feedback would be greatly appreciated, if this gets any traction whatsoever I'll continue updating it.

Python,pytest-fixture-forms - A new plugin to simplify testing parameter variations,"Hey Python testing enthusiasts! I'm excited to share a pytest plugin I've been working on that makes testing different parameter variations much cleaner and more maintainable.

# What my project does

If you've ever found yourself writing lots of parametrized tests for different API inputs, credentials, or configuration combinations, you know it can get messy quickly. This plugin lets you organize these variations as fixture methods in a class, making your tests more structured and easier to maintain.

Here's a quick example:

    class UserCredentials(FixtureForms):
        @pytest.fixture
        def valid_user(self):
            return {""username"": ""john_doe"", ""password"": ""secure123""}
    
        @pytest.fixture
        def invalid_password(self):
            return {""username"": ""john_doe"", ""password"": ""wrong""}
    
    def test_login(user_credentials):
        response = login_service.authenticate(**user_credentials.value)
        if user_credentials.form == ""valid_user"":
            assert response.status_code == 200
        else:
            assert response.status_code == 401

Key Features:

* Auto-generates fixtures from class methods
* Integrates with pytest's parametrization
* Handles nested dependencies elegantly
* Zero configuration needed

# Target Audience

anyone want to write and maintain tests for combinations of parameter. it should be stable but hey! its a new project so expect rough edges.

# Comparison¬†

there is no currently plugin in pytest that let you dynamically generate fixtures and test nodes in similar way to how pytest-fixture-forms does. this plugin is also being actively used inside a real product(actually this plugin was written as inside an internal tool testing code and later migrated by me to become a standalone pytest plugin).

Python,ML Trading Bot that uses Ranked Ensemble Learning,"I created a ML Trading Bot - trained it for a little over 3 years with 24 years of data and started it live on November 20, 2024. It's been going over a little more than 2 weeks, but it's been doing great so far - not indicative of how it will perform but it's had a great debut if you can say that.

GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/yeonholee50/AmpyFin](https://github.com/yeonholee50/AmpyFin)

Bot Website: [https://ampyfin-website.onrender.com/](https://ampyfin-website.onrender.com/)

**What My Project Does**

In essence, the trading bot ranks the strategies and gives them weights based on their overall performance while giving slight bias to recent performance (this is so it is reactive to current market trends and adjusts accordingly). These weights determine how much influence they have on the trading strategy. That's the oversimplified explanation of how the bot works. A more descriptive explanation is done on the website as well as README

**Target Audience**

Reason why I'm posting here is because I'm currently looking for contributors who have some expertise in Python (maybe want to contribute or just interested) on the trading strategies side. The more trading and diverse strategies there are, the better the bot will perform. This project is aimed towards developers interested in contributing or just anyone interested in the project. Currently there is 60 strategies, but the aim is to get much more: at least 100. If you have any questions on how it works or just interested in contributing, please don't hesitate to dm or comment.

**Comparison**

Most trading bots either use one strategy or multiple combination of strategies. The one's that use ML are too complex to understand or use libraries with jargons that are too coated. I specifically used ranked ensemble learning because it's something I've used in the past (for a facial feature measurement application for a medical company), but also because it's quite simple to understand and effective at the same time.",Inevitable-Air-1712,1h7qtzs,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h7qtzs/ml_trading_bot_that_uses_ranked_ensemble_learning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h7qtzs/ml_trading_bot_that_uses_ranked_ensemble_learning/,2024-12-06 02:26:49,25,0.7,25,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1h7qtzs

Python,Python binary which runs everwhere,"I wanted to share some insights about an interesting project called¬†[python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone)¬†that I've been exploring.

# What is python-build-standalone?

The¬†**python-build-standalone**¬†project produces fully usable Python installations that include most extension modules from the standard library. The key feature here is that it minimizes runtime dependencies.

# Why Use It?

1. **Portability**: The distributions are designed to work on any system for the targeted architecture, making it easier to deploy Python applications in diverse environments.
2. **Customizability**: Users can include build artifacts and rich metadata, which allows for downstream repackaging. This means you can create a custom Python distribution tailored to specific needs‚Äîgreat for embedding Python in larger binaries.
3. **Sister Project - PyOxy**: For those interested in enhancing their Python interpreter with Rust code, there's a related project called PyOxy that builds on these standalone distributions to create single-file executables.

# Getting Started

If you‚Äôre interested in trying out python-build-standalone, you can find the documentation¬†[here](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/). The documentation provides detailed instructions on how to build your own standalone Python distributions and includes examples of how to customize your builds.

# Use Cases

This tool is particularly beneficial for:

* Developers who need to distribute applications without requiring users to install Python or additional libraries.
* Projects that aim for a minimal footprint on user systems.
* Scenarios where embedding Python within other applications is necessary.

Python,HandiRokuRemote (Open Source) - Control your Roku with only your hand gestures,"###What My Project Does
This is a Python application that lets you control your Roku device with nothing but hand gestures! Using Mediapipe's Hand Landmark Detector, it tracks your hand, identifies gestures, and sends commands to your Roku via its External Control Protocol.

Check out the [demo gif](https://imgur.com/zVbX1T6)

Features:

*Real-time hand tracking: Gestures like ""thumbs up"" control volume or navigation.

*Cross-device support: Works with any Roku device on the same network.

*Easy setup: Plug in a camera, and you‚Äôre ready to go.

###Target Audience
The target audience is anyone who's ever lost their TV remote, but probably more likely fellow tinkerers and anyone interested in computer-vision.

###Comparison
As far as I can tell, there is no comparison. I've looked around and haven't found anything that does what this does. I guess the only comparison is a regular remote (but you lost that earlier, remember?)

Python,Agent-Based Modeling library Mesa releases version 3.1,"Hi everyone! After our huge¬†[Mesa 3.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gn5q8z/mesa_30_a_major_update_to_pythons_agentbased/) release, we're proud to announce Mesa 3.1 less than a month later. It contains some major spatial improvements and groundwork for new control and data collection features.

- https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.1.0

### What's Agent-Based Modeling?

Ever wondered how bird flocks organize themselves? Or how traffic jams form? Agent-based modeling (ABM) lets you simulate these complex systems by defining simple rules for individual ""agents"" (birds, cars, people, etc.) and then watching how they interact. Instead of writing equations to describe the whole system, you model each agent's behavior and let patterns emerge naturally through their interactions. It's particularly powerful for studying systems where individual decisions and interactions drive collective behavior.

### What's Mesa?

Mesa is Python's leading framework for agent-based modeling, providing a comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models. It combines Python's scientific stack (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib) with specialized tools for handling spatial relationships, agent scheduling, and data collection. Whether you're studying epidemic spread, market dynamics, or ecological systems, Mesa provides the building blocks to create sophisticated simulations while keeping your code clean and maintainable.

### What's new in Mesa 3.1?

This release adds experimental support for Observables and Computed, enabling a more reactive and responsive programming model for agent-based simulations. The new `Observable` and `Computable` classes allow developers to declaratively define attributes that automatically emit signals when their values change, and compute derived values that update dynamically. This lays the groundwork for more advanced event handling and data visualization features in future releases (#2291).

The experimental cell space module has been updated with full support for n-dimensional property layers. These allow agents to easily interact with and modify spatial properties of the environment, such as terrain, resources, or environmental conditions. The new implementation provides a more intuitive attribute-based API and ensures tight integration with the cell space architecture (#2512).

Mesa now includes built-in support for logging using the standard Python `logging` module. This provides developers with a flexible and powerful way to add structured diagnostic and debug output to their simulations, without the need for custom logging solutions. The logging system is integrated throughout the library, including the new SolaraViz visualization system (#2506).

Creating multiple agents with varying initialization parameters is now significantly easier with the new `Agent.create_agents` class method. This factory function supports both uniform and per-agent parameters, simplifying the code required to set up a simulation with a large number of heterogeneous agents (#2351).

In addition to the major new features, this release includes a number of smaller enhancements and bug fixes that improve the overall developer experience. These include removing deprecated functionality, cleaning up examples, and addressing various edge cases reported by the community. Mesa 3.1 requires Python 3.11 or higher.

Python,ProgressPal (an alternative/iteration to tqdm),"**Get ProgressPal** here is full documentation available in the Github repo: [https://github.com/levi2234/Progresspal](https://github.com/levi2234/Progresspal)

**What My Project Does**¬†The code progress tracker called ProgressPal provides an easy to use environment for tracking python functions, iterables and logs. It tries to keep the known tqdm syntax while expanding the usability for simulataneous python runtimes such as Threads and parallel processes. ProgressPal provides an easy to access online environment which collects all progress in one place, visible from anywhere in the world. The main features included are:

* **Progress Tracking**: Track the progress of Python iterables, functions, and log messages in real-time.
* **Decentralized Monitoring**: Monitor multiple Python scripts from any device with an internet connection.
* **Collaborative Projects**: Collaborate and monitor the real-time progress of various scripts running on different devices and processes.
* **Distributed Systems**: Track progress across distributed systems for seamless monitoring and remote collaboration.
* **Function Tracking**: Track the call-count, execution time distribution, execution history, time between calls, error count, function file origin, and function name.
* **Iterable Tracking**: Track the progress of iterables and generators with a progress bar. Additionally, track the total number of iterations, current iteration, and percentage completion, time remaining, iteration execution time, and iteration rate.
* **Log Server**: Start a log server to receive progress updates from Python scripts. The log server can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.
* **Threading support**: Track the progress of multiple threads and processes simultaneously.
* **Search Functionality**: Search for specific functions and iterables in the log server.

**Target Audience** ProgressPal is made for people who are working with multiple python processes or want to remotely monitor their code. ProgressPal has collaboration in mind providing a 2 click monitoring server for everyone to use. Because of the 1 ms overhead (9ns of tqdm) of the code we recommend this for tracking longer execution times of loops and functions to minimize impact.

**Comparison** During my work I grew increasingly annoyed with having to jump from terminal to terminal using tqdm. I had a use for a central logging environment. Scouring through my options I couldn't find a suitable option. So after 2 years of being annoyed I decided to make my own.

**Comments** This project was my first experience with web developement (code quality does reflect this) Because this is my first webdev project security is not the first priority. Therefore this project is mainly developed for personal use and recommended not to run on critical systems. However, it is a great tool to use during developement which  I myself have used this in projects with multiple dozens of simultaneous processes without problems.

Python,Nefertiti for Sphinx,"Hi there,

A new Sphinx theme is available, it is called Nefertiti, and it is highly customizable: it comes with several font bundles and new fonts can be added easily (to avoid accessing 3rd party font sites, like Google Fonts). It supports filtering of the index (in the left side column), which allows to find index entries that we might remember from a previous visit but can't remember in what level they are. It has support for light/dark color schemes, and when given, images switch between color-schemes too (this last feature is based on [sphinx-colorschemed-images](https://github.com/danirus/sphinx-colorschemed-images)). Nefertiti provides several colorsets, and there is an extra option to make the header color neutral, so that the primary color adapts to the light/dark color scheme. You can see these color customizations directly in [the docs of Nefertiti for Sphinx](https://sphinx-nefertiti.readthedocs.io/). Another feature are header links, they are visible in the docs. They are customizable too. Header links can be displayed next to the project's name or in a second row in the header, below the project's name (see examples in [this page](https://sphinx-nefertiti.readthedocs.io/latest/users-guide/customization/header-links.html)). They can contain dropdown menus too. All that is customizable.

Python, Fine-grained open source authorization solution (SDK for Python),"Hey, Python community! If anyone here is thinking about implementing authorization for RBAC / ABAC in your apps - feel free to check out our OSS solution: [https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos](https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos)¬†

It‚Äôs useful if you‚Äôre dealing with complex access control scenarios and fast-growing apps, where requirements are constantly changing.

  
**What My Project Does:**¬†  
Cerbos PDP is an authorization solution that lets users define context-aware access control in simple, intuitive, and testable policies.¬† Some of Cerbos PDP‚Äôs key capabilities:

* Infinitely scalable RBAC and ABAC
* Plug-and-play &amp; language-agnostic¬†
* Stateless design¬†
* Self-hosted
* Centralized audit logs of all authorization requests help compliance with ISO27001, SOC2, and HIPAA requirements  

  
**Target Audience:**  
Software developers working on building authorization for apps, AI agents, and AI companions.  
  
  
**Comparison**   
The most common alternative to externalized authorization is the ‚Äúbuild it yourself‚Äù approach, hard-coded authorization. Here is how our approach is different:

* Our off-the-shelf solution allows you to avoid the technical debt and developer cost of hard-coded authorization.
* Having the separation of the permissions from the code base just makes the code and the permissions more elegant (no spaghetti code).
* Permissions are centralized, so they're not tied to specific endpoints.¬†
* Cerbos makes fine-grained access control easy to implement and manage while saving time. It also improves security by making access control highly visible and making it easy to keep up with changing requirements.

it turns any material into a fully-fledged live exam that you can send to your students who can take it online., and receive a perma-url certificate like on Coursera (which you can attach to your linkedin or whatever).

Python,Dink: a command line notifier,"Hi there,

I‚Äôm Pranav, a self-taught python developer. Just wanted to share a little script I made.

What my project does:
Dink is a command line notifier. It can notify you of the completion of a command, so you don‚Äôt have to keep checking the terminal.

Target audience:
All devs.

Comparison:
This, unlike maybe a few other tools, is extremely lightweight and does not require extensive setup. All you do is install it and just put the word dink before any command you want notified about and that's it.

You can find this at https://github.com/Pranav435/dink.git

This has, in the 6 months since I made it, saved me a bunch of hours, and I hope it is equally as useful to you.

Python,Sqrt Random faster than Max double Random?,"Any thoughts on **why** the sqrt version below is faster?

Saw this video from 3blue1brown. His concept focused on the following having the same probability distributions. 

`max(rand(), rand())`

`sqrt(rand())`

What was surprising to me was that the sqrt version actually ran faster. I guess this means the HW is likely more optimized for the sqrt operation than pulling a uniform random number. 

Here's my code that tested the speed:

    import math
    import time

    import random#&lt;1
    
    def method1():

Python,Building native Python desktop application with Pyloid and Gradio,"Let's build a desktop chat application that streams responses from an LLM. We'll use three key libraries that work beautifully together:

- **[Pyloid](https://github.com/pyloid/pyloid)**: Creates native desktop applications -- like Electron but with Python
- **[Gradio](https://gradio.app)**: Builds the chat interface
- **[Promptic](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/promptic)**: Handles LLM interactions

Source Code: https://github.com/knowsuchagency/pyloid-chat-demo

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you'll need:
- An OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner

## The Chat Interface

First, let's create the chat interface. This is where Gradio and Promptic work together:

```python
import gradio as gr
from promptic import llm

@llm(memory=True, stream=True)
def assistant(message):
    """"""{message}""""""

def predict(message, history):
    partial_message = """"
    for chunk in assistant(message):
        partial_message += str(chunk)
        yield partial_message

with gr.ChatInterface(
    fn=predict,
    title=""Chat Demo"",
) as chat_interface:
    chat_interface.chatbot.clear(assistant.clear)
```

The code above:
- Uses Promptic's `@llm` decorator to handle LLM interactions
- Implements streaming responses using a generator
- Creates a chat interface with Gradio
- By passing `memory=True`, Promptic will manage conversation history

## Making It a Desktop App

Now, let's wrap our chat interface in a native window using Pyloid:

```python
from pyloid import Pyloid
import threading
import time
import socket
from contextlib import contextmanager

HOST = ""127.0.0.1""
PORT = 7861

def run_demo():
    chat_interface.launch(
        server_name=HOST,
        server_port=PORT,
        share=False,
        show_api=False,
    )

# Run Gradio in a separate thread
demo_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_demo, daemon=True)
demo_thread.start()

app = Pyloid(app_name=""Chat-App"", single_instance=True)
win = app.create_window(""chat-window"")

@contextmanager
def wait_for_server(host=HOST, port=PORT, timeout=30):
    start_time = time.time()
    while True:
        try:
            with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
                if sock.connect_ex((host, port)) == 0:
                    break
        except:
            pass

        if time.time() - start_time &gt; timeout:
            raise TimeoutError(f""Server at {host}:{port} did not start within {timeout} seconds"")
        time.sleep(0.5)
    yield

with wait_for_server():
    win.load_url(f""http://{HOST}:{PORT}"")
    win.show_and_focus()

app.run()
```

This code:
- Runs the Gradio interface in a background thread
- Creates a native window that loads the interface
- Ensures the server is ready before loading the UI

## Running the Application

This project includes a [`justfile`](https://just.systems/man/en/) with commands for building and running the application. It also uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for package management.

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/knowsuchagency/pyloid-chat-demo
cd pyloid-chat-demo

# this builds the application and opens it
# it will create a virtual environment and
# install the dependencies automatically
just build open
```

That's it! With just these few lines of code, you have a desktop chat application with streaming responses. The magic comes from combining these libraries:

- Promptic handles the LLM interaction and streaming
- Gradio provides the chat interface
- Pyloid wraps everything in a native window

You can now extend this foundation by adding features like API key configuration, custom themes, or system prompts.

Python,Feedback for project creating conversational agents using a Finite State Machine (FSM) and LLMs,"Hi r/Python community!

I've been working on a project combining Finite State Machines and Large Language Models.  
  
What My Project Does  
This project provides a framework for building conversational agents using a Finite State Machine (FSM) powered by LLMs like OpenAI GPT. It aims to create structured tools like step-by-step teaching systems, customer support bots, and multi-step memory games while addressing issues like hallucinations, loss of context, and unpredictability. I have a few example usages in the repo.

Target Audience  
This is currently an experimental setup, and also part of a research project I am doing for university. For now it is meant for developers and experimenters mainly. Requires an OpenAI API key (currently tested on gpt-4o-mini).

Comparison  
Unlike typical LLM-based chatbots, this combines FSM with LLMs to enforce structured, predictable conversations, making it ideal for use cases requiring adherence to predefined paths.

If anyone is interested I would love to hear your feedback and thoughts! The repo is here: [https://github.com/jsz-05/LLM-State-Machine](https://github.com/jsz-05/LLM-State-Machine)

Python,"Iris Templates: A Modern Python Templating Engine Inspired by Laravel Blade
","**What My Project Does**

As a Python developer, I‚Äôve always admired the elegance and power of Laravel‚Äôs¬†**Blade templating engine**. Its intuitive syntax, flexible directives, and reusable components make crafting dynamic web pages seamless. Yet, when working on Python projects, I found myself longing for a templating system that offered the same simplicity and versatility. Existing solutions often felt clunky, overly complex, or just didn‚Äôt fit the bill for creating dynamic, reusable HTML structures.

That‚Äôs when¬†**Iris Templates**¬†was born‚Äîa lightweight, modern Python template engine inspired by¬†**Laravel Blade**, tailored for Python developers who want speed, flexibility, and an intuitive way to build dynamic HTML.

# üßê Why I Developed Iris Templates (Comparison)

When developing Python web applications, I noticed a gap in templating solutions:

* **Jinja2**¬†is great but can feel verbose for straightforward tasks.
* **Django templates**¬†are tied closely to the Django framework.
* Many templating engines lack the modularity and extendability I needed for larger projects.

Iris Templates was created to bridge this gap. It's:

* **Framework-agnostic**: Use it with FastAPI, Flask, or even standalone scripts.
* **Developer-friendly**: Intuitive syntax inspired by Blade for faster development.
* **Lightweight but Powerful**: Built for efficiency without sacrificing flexibility.

# üåü Key Features of Iris Templates

1. **""extends""**¬†and¬†**""section""**¬†for Layout Inheritance; Create a base layout and extend it effortlessly.
2. **""include""**¬†for Reusability.
3. Customizable Directives. (if, else, endif, switch..)
4. Safe Context Evaluation; Iris Templates includes a built-in safe evaluation mechanism to prevent malicious code execution in templates.
5. Framework-Independent; Whether you‚Äôre using FastAPI, Flask, or a custom Python framework, Iris fits in seamlessly.

# ü§î What Makes Iris Templates Different?

Unlike other Python templating engines:

* **Inspired by Blade**: Iris takes the best ideas from Blade and adapts them to Python.
* **No Boilerplate**: Write clean, readable templates without extra overhead.
* **Focus on Modularity**: Emphasizes layout inheritance, reusable components, and maintainable structures.

It‚Äôs designed to feel natural and intuitive, reducing the cognitive load of managing templates.

# üîó Resources

* **GitHub Repository**:¬†[https://github.com/altxriainc/iris](https://github.com/altxriainc/iris)
* **Install via pip**:¬†`pip install iris-templates`

Python,Curly brackets in python!,"[https://github.com/DevBoiAgru/CurlyPy](https://github.com/DevBoiAgru/CurlyPy)

  
**What CurlyPy does:**

CurlyPy enables you to write Python code using curly braces `{}` instead of relying on indentation to define code blocks (though indentation is still a part of the syntax). It essentially allows you to combine the best of both worlds ‚Äî Python‚Äôs simplicity with the clarity and familiarity of curly braces for block delimitation.

# It works as a pre processor which translates the code with brackets into code with proper indentation, and then runs it using python. Since it works as a preprocessor, there is a great potential for exciting features in the future like ""compile time"" evaluation of functions, type checking and much more in the future.

**Target Audience:**

People who want to try out how python would be if it supported braces, or people who complain about code blocks using whitespace.

**Comparison:**

The only other preprocessor I am aware of which does this is [Bython](https://github.com/mathialo/bython), but the last commit to its repo was 6 years ago, and it does not support dictionaries and sets.

Python,Best PDF library for extracting text from structured templates,"Hello All, 

I am currently working on a project where I have to extract data from around 8 different structured templates which together spans 12 Million + pages across 10K PDF Documents. 

I am using a mix of Regular Expression and bounding box approach where by 4 of these templates are regular expression friendly and for the rest I am using bounding box to extract the data. On testing the extraction works very well. There are no images or tables, but simple labels and values.

The library that I am currently using is PDF Plumber for data extraction and PyPDF for splitting the documents in small chunks for better memory utilization(PDF Plumber sometimes throws an error when the page count goes above 4000 pages, hence splitting them into smaller chunks temporarily). However this approach is taking 5 seconds per page which is a bit too much considering that I have to process 12M pages. 

I did take a look at the different other libraries mentioned in the below link but I am not sure which one to choose as I would love to work with an open source library that is having a good maintenance history and better performance .

Python,Optimization-Based Rule Learning for Scalable and Interpretable Classification,"RuleOpt is a Python library that uses optimization-based rule learning for classification tasks, focusing on scalability and model interpretability. It helps practitioners generate transparent, rule-based models, even for large datasets, using linear programming. RuleOpt is designed to integrate smoothly with machine learning pipelines and is especially powerful for extracting rules from ensemble models like random forests and boosting algorithms.

An earlier version of this work is available in [our manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10751).


**What RuleOpt Does:**

- **Efficient Rule Generation and Extraction:** Uses linear programming to generate rules both as a stand-alone machine learning method and for extracting rules from trained models like random forests and boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Interpretability:** Focuses on achieving a balance between rule accuracy and transparency, allowing for clear decision-making.
- **Model Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM for smooth model development and rule extraction.
- **Extensive Solver Support:** Works with a range of solvers, including Gurobi, CPLEX, and OR-Tools, to optimize rule learning tasks.

**Target Audience:**
This library is ideal for:

- Data scientists and machine learning engineers who need transparent models.
- Researchers who are exploring rule-based classification systems.
- ML practitioners working with large datasets who seek interpretable, scalable models for decision-making.

**Comparison to Existing Alternatives:**
Here‚Äôs how RuleOpt stands out:

- **Versus Other Rule Learning Methods:** RuleOpt leverages the power of optimization and linear programming for scalable rule generation, offering higher efficiency for large-scale datasets compared to traditional rule induction methods.
- **Versus SHAP and LIME:** While SHAP and LIME focus on explaining model predictions, RuleOpt goes a step further by extracting clear, interpretable rules that can be used directly for decision-making and model transparency.

**Key Features:**

- **Scalable Rule Learning:** Efficiently handles large datasets and complex models through linear programming.
- **Transparent Models:** Provides human-readable rules, ensuring high interpretability.
- **Integration with ML Libraries:** Works smoothly with scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and other machine learning frameworks.
- **Solver Flexibility:** Supports multiple solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX, OR-Tools) for enhanced performance.

**Algorithm &amp; Performance:**
The RuleOpt algorithm focuses on formulating rule extraction as an optimization problem using linear programming. It has been tested on large-scale classification problems and demonstrated scalability and interpretability, even in the case of ensemble models.


**Quick Start:**
Install RuleOpt via pip:

```bash
pip install ruleopt
```

Python,"kanban-tui , customizable cross platform kanban/task manager in your terminal","* **What My Project Does**

Kanban-Tui is a CLI tool that gives you a visual board with moveable tasks in the terminal.

With the newest release v0.4.0, you can create multiple boards with individual columns.
More Customization like creating task categories for tasks or change the column visibility is also possible.
It also utilizes plotext to give you an overview about several metrics (created/completed/started tasks). 


For a quick demo you can use uvx to create a temporary database and config files with: `uvx --from kanban-tui ktui demo`
They get deleted after you close the application. For detailed instructions and features you can check the Readme on github.

Source Code on github: [Link](https://github.com/Zaloog/kanban-tui)


* **Target Audience**¬†

Terminal affine developers who do not want to miss a nice graphical experience.

* **Comparison**¬†

Its similar to kanban-python, which I created before before this project but less minimal and the interaction with the tasks is faster more convenient.
I.e with the TUI one is able to utilize vim-like motions to move cards around, which comes closer to the feeling of actually moving physical cards.

Python,Advanced Python Development Workflow in Emacs,"Hey everyone!

Lately, I‚Äôve been spending more time reading code than writing it, but I still code every now and then, mostly in Python. My daily editor ‚Äî for both coding and just about everything else ‚Äî has been Emacs for several years now.

Recently, I decided to dig into how the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) work in Emacs, how they can be integrated, and what minimal configuration is needed to get started. As I explored, I took notes for myself, and eventually, those notes turned into a blog post.

It ended up being quite a long read, but I‚Äôm really happy with the result. The more I researched and wrote, the further I drifted from my original goal of creating a quick and minimal Emacs setup guide. I rewrote the introduction a few times before landing on something I felt good about, and now I‚Äôm ready to share it with you.

The article isn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äî there are still some rough edges and gaps I plan to address soon. For example:

* I haven‚Äôt covered tree-sitter integration.
* Navigation between code elements feels a bit underexplored.
* Some parts are more superficial than I‚Äôd like.

But it‚Äôs in a good enough state to share. If you‚Äôre curious and have the patience to read through, I‚Äôd love some constructive feedback. Let me know if there‚Äôs anything missing that you‚Äôd find helpful or if you catch any mistakes I might‚Äôve made.

Python,Kitten Mixer: A Fun Tool to Combine Cat Images with AI,"Hello Python community,

My name is Dylan, and I‚Äôm a data scientist. I recently developed a fun little project called¬†[Kitten Mixer](https://mezclador-gatitos.streamlit.app/), and I‚Äôd love to share it with you and hear your feedback!

# What My Project Does

Kitten Mixer is a Python-based web app that uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate smooth image interpolations of cats. By combining the power of AI with some adorable cat pictures, the app creates unique and visually fascinating blends between different cat images.

# Key Features

* **Image Interpolations:**¬†Combine two cat images and explore their latent-space interpolations.
* **Latent Space Exploration:**¬†Visualize how the neural network represents cat images in a 2D latent space.
* **Interactive Web App:**¬†The app is built with Streamlit for an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

# Target Audience

* **Who It‚Äôs For:**¬†Python enthusiasts, AI hobbyists, and cat lovers looking for an entertaining and educational use of machine learning.
* **Intended Use:**¬†Great for learning about Variational Autoencoders, showcasing AI-generated content, or just having fun creating unique cat images.

# How It Works

1. The project uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implemented in PyTorch to encode and decode cat images.
2. By interpolating in the latent space of the VAE, the app generates smooth transitions between any two selected cat images.
3. The app runs interactively on Streamlit, allowing users to upload images, select parameters, and visualize results in real time.

*Important Note:*¬†Don‚Äôt forget to press the ""English"" button on the¬†Kitten Mixer web app¬†and the¬†GitHub repository README¬†to view the content in English!

Python,"Package for Sharing/Editing Pandas Dataframes with Nontechnical Contributors
","**1. What My Project Does**

I created a python package that allows you to generate temporary shareable links to a web-editor for your pandas dataframe!

Running df = pandaBear(df) will generate the free ngrok link from your token in the .env, prompt you for a gmail to authorize access, and then when the person you shared it with finishes editing using the web editor you will have the updated df.

Feel free to check out the demos on¬†[GitHub](https://github.com/RohanAdwankar/share-df)!

**2. Target Audience**

This is for the scenario where devs are collaborating with nontechnical contributors who want to make quick edits, and the devs want to save time by not having to export the df to a different file and import it again (and deal with whatever issues happen in this formatting and reformatting process).

This is my first python package and it is in the early stages. If people are interested in it I would love to make upgrades to the UI and how it handles large dataframes so please don't hesitate to provide feedback and feature requests!

Python,"I hadn't used Python in a while, but I came back to it to make this CLI hash checking script","Here is a link to the project on GitHub (MIT License):

https://github.com/Cyncrovee/CynVee-Hash-Checker_CLI

## What My Project Does
It's a simple CLI tool to output the hashes of files using multiple algorithms, which at the moment includes:

- SHA1
- SHA224
- SHA256
- SHA384
- SHA512
- SHA3\_224
- SHA3\_256
- SHA3\_384
- SHA3\_512
- MD5
- BLAKE2b
- BLAKE2s

You simply run the main.py file (with optional arguments) and once you have selected the file you want to use, it will generate the hashes for said file with all the above algorithms (though the README has more detailed intructions).

It's actually a sort of ""spin-off"" of another project I have in C#, which is a similar thing except with a GUI and less hashing algorithms (with some other differences). I started making it because I just wanted to test out a Neovim config I made, but now I think I may keep using it.

## Target Audience
Well to be honest I mostly made it for myself, but I think other people might get some leverage out of it if they need to hash files often. For example, if you're a distro hopper and need to verify lots of ISO files (I've been there lol-)

## Comparison
There are a few similar utilities like certUtil or the checksum package on Chocolatey, however they can be a bit tedious to use in my experience, usually because the commands can get quite long, and/or because it doesn't support the hashing algorithms I need. The downside is that the script can take quite a long time when hashing a large file, so it wouldn‚Äôt be the best choice if speed is a concern

## End
I hope you like it! Coming back to Python was nice, the syntax is great and most things just work really easily. Hopefully I can use it for another project soon :]",ever-ella77,1h3ntgy,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h3ntgy/i_hadnt_used_python_in_a_while_but_i_came_back_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h3ntgy/i_hadnt_used_python_in_a_while_but_i_came_back_to/,2024-11-30 22:13:26,1,0.52,1,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1h3ntgy

Python,"Web Scraping Social Media Profiles [ X, Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube ]","Hi everyone!

I‚Äôve created a script for scraping public social media accounts for work purposes. I‚Äôve wrapped it up, formatted it, and created a repository for anyone who wants to use it.

# What My Project Does
The main focus of this project is to scrape data from profiles and their posts. For example:
- In my job, I‚Äôve automated it to run daily for our social media profiles, storing the data for later analysis.
- A firend of mine wanted to download all the thumbnails of a youtube channel.

# How it works
The script uses Playwright to intercept requests and clean up the data. It also includes a second part that converts images to Base64 encoding, which is useful when image URLs expire or cannot be displayed directly in an `HTML img tag`. For YouTube, it uses the API v3, as it's straightforward to obtain an API key.

I believe the script is easy to use, and you can quickly adapt it to suit your needs. Be sure to check out the README for more details!
 
# Target Audience
This tool is for anyone who needs to scrape social media data. The code is simple enough to copy, modify, and integrate into your project.

# Comparison
I haven‚Äôt extensively researched if there are better solutions out there. However, you can consider using libraries like Instaloader or Twitter-scraper for similar functionality.

# Finally
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you have.

Python,My side project has gotten 420k downloads and 69 GitHub stars (noice!),"Hey Redditors! üëã

I couldn't think of a better place to share this achievement other than here with you lot. Sometimes the universe just comes together in such a way that makes you wonder if the simulation is winking back at you...

But now that I've grabbed your attention, allow me tell you a bit about my project.

# What My Project Does

[ridgeplot](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot?tab=readme-ov-file) is a Python package that provides a simple interface for plotting beautiful and interactive ridgeline plots within the extensive Plotly ecosystem.

Unfortunately, I can't share any screenshots here, but feel free to take a look at our [**getting started guide**](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/getting_started.html) for some examples of what you can do with it.

# Target Audience

Anyone that needs to plot a ridgeline graph can use this library. That said, I expect it to be mainly used by people in the data science, data analytics, machine learning, and adjacent spaces.

# Comparison

If all you need is a simple ridgeline plot with Plotly without any bells and whistles, take a look at [this example](https://plotly.com/python/violin/#ridgeline-plot) in their official docs. However, if you need more control over how the plot looks like, like plotting multiple traces per row, using different [coloring options](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/getting_started.html#coloring-options), or mixing [KDEs and histograms](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/issues/194#issuecomment-2500864292), then I think my library would be a better choice for you...

Other alternatives include:

* [matplotlib - example blogpost](https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/create-ridgeplots-in-matplotlib/)
* [joypy - Ridgeplot library using a matplotlib backend](https://github.com/sbebo/joypy)
* [seaborn - also using a matplotlib backend](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/kde_ridgeplot)
* [bokeh - using yet a different graphing backend](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/examples/topics/categorical/ridgeplot.html)

I [included](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/alternatives.html) these alternatives in the project's documentation. Feel free to contribute more!

Python,Stormchaser: A Python program that collects and animates Western Pacific typhoon data.,"# What my project does:

[Stormchaser](https://github.com/TreacherousDev/Stormchaser) is a real-time typhoon visualization system. It scrapes typhoon data from the [Digital Typhoon database](http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/), visualizes typhoon paths on a map of the Western Pacific, and animates the data with smooth transitions, dynamic color coding based on typhoon intensity, and additional features like landfall detection, all within an interactive timeline.

# Target Audience

This project is designed for:

* People interested in typhoon tracking and data visualization.
* Educational use, demonstrating the real-world application of data scraping and visualization,

# How it differs from existing alternatives:

Stormchaser is designed for people who want an easy, user-friendly way to visualize typhoon data. No programming or editing skills is required to create animations. Just enter a date and press play, that's it! It is free and open source, and even comes packed as a[ standalone Windows executable](https://github.com/TreacherousDev/Stormchaser/releases/tag/v0.1).

# Information

The app was built using the following resources:

* beautifulsoup4 - webscraping
* cartopy - map generation
* pygame - visual output renderer

To use, simply install and input a date. It will take a while to scrape the web on the first time you input the given year, and afterwards it will redirect you to the main animation window where you can play the animation. Data scraped will be cached into your computer files so that the next time you view the same year, it doesnt have to scrape again.

Project Stormchaser is in early beta and is open to contributions.

Python,PixelPurge: Game Cleanup Tool,"Hey everyone üëã

I‚Äôm excited to introduce you to **PixelPurge**, my latest side project!

# What PixelPurge Does

PixelPurge is a lightweight Python tool designed to help gamers clean up after trying new games. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone who loves testing games but hates the leftover files. It tracks new files and folders created while you play and lets you delete them effortlessly.

You can find images and details in the [project repository](https://github.com/Izaan17/PixelPurge).

# Target Audience

If you‚Äôre a gamer who frequently downloads and uninstalls new titles, you‚Äôll love PixelPurge. It‚Äôs also great for anyone who wants to reclaim storage space by ensuring no leftover game files clutter your system. While it‚Äôs aimed at Windows users, macOS users can use it too.

# Comparison

You might be thinking, ‚ÄúWhy not just manually delete leftover files?‚Äù Sure, you can, but PixelPurge takes the guesswork out of the process by:

‚Ä¢ Automatically tracking changes in monitored directories while games are running.

‚Ä¢ Providing an easy GUI for reviewing and selecting files to delete.

‚Ä¢ Supporting recursive folder monitoring so nothing is missed.

Python,Conversational RAG on local files (on-premises usage),"Hey everyone,

**What My Project Does:**  
That is a local conversational rag on your files. Be honest, you can use this as a rag on-premises, cause it is build with docker, langchain, ollama, fastapi, hf All models download automatically, soon I'll add an ability to choose a model For now solution contains:

* Locally running Ollama (currently qwen-0.5b model hardcoded, soon you'll be able to choose a model from ollama registry)
* Local indexing (using sentence-transformer embedding model, you can switch to other model, but only sentence-transformers applied, also will be changed soon)
* Qdrant container running on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an ability to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and mac os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problems:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the models (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

**Target Audience:**  
This project is designed for developers, as you‚Äôll need to set up Docker to get it running. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no consumer-friendly app yet.

**Comparison**:  
The closest competitor, though already far ahead (so I doubt I can truly compete with them), is¬†**LLM Studio**.

For anyone interested in making local RAG or on-premises RAG as accessible as possible, you‚Äôre warmly invited to contribute!

Python,"opennb: Open Jupyter notebooks from GitHub with dependencies, instantly (with uv)!","**What My Project Does:**

[opennb](https://github.com/basnijholt/opennb) is a tiny CLI tool that lets you open Jupyter notebooks directly from GitHub (or any URL) while automatically handling dependencies in an ephemeral environment. For example:

```
uvx --with ""pipefunc[docs]"" opennb pipefunc/pipefunc/example.ipynb
```

This single command:
- Creates a temporary environment
- Installs all dependencies (instant with uv's cache!)
- Downloads the notebook
- Opens it in Jupyter

With a cold cache ü•∂ it takes 1.5s to do this all, and with a hot cache ü•µ it takes a couple of ms!

GitHub: https://github.com/basnijholt/opennb

**Target Audience:**

- Data scientists and developers who frequently try out tutorial notebooks
- Anyone learning from Jupyter notebooks in GitHub repositories
- Teachers sharing notebooks with students
- People who want to try notebooks without polluting their environment

It's meant for real use but is intentionally simple and focused on doing one thing well.

**Comparison:**

Existing workflows typically involve:
1. Cloning the entire repository
2. Creating a virtual environment
3. Installing dependencies
4. Finding and opening the notebook

This can be tedious, especially when you just want to quickly try a notebook. opennb combines these steps into a single command and leverages uv's speed to make it instant.

The closest alternative would be using Binder, but:
- Binder requires waiting for container builds
- opennb works locally and instantly
- opennb integrates with your local Jupyter installation
- No need for external services

Python,"Django Protego - A Flexible and Dynamic Circuit Breaker
","**What My Project Does**

**Django Protego** implements the Circuit Breaker pattern in Django. It helps prevent service failures from propagating through your application by ""breaking"" the circuit after a specified number of consecutive failures. Once the circuit is broken, Protego will stop making requests to the failing service and return a graceful fallback response (like an error message) until the service is healthy again.

By using **Django Protego**, you can:

* Detect failures early: When external services or APIs start to fail, Protego can detect this and break the circuit.
* Gracefully degrade: Instead of letting failures cascade, Protego will return a preconfigured fallback response (e.g., a 503 Service Unavailable) to users.
* Retry after a delay: Protego will attempt to restore the service by retrying the request after a set timeout, once the failure threshold is cleared.

**Target Audience**

Django Protego is built for small to medium size Django projects that are urgent need for circuit breaker pattern for their APIs.

Python, I made a Python signal/slot library that works like Qt but without Qt dependency,"Hi everyone!

**What My Project Does:**  
I've been working on TSignal, a library that implements Qt-style signals and slots in pure Python. It handles async operations and thread communication automatically, making it easy to build event-driven applications without pulling in heavy dependencies.

**Target Audience:**  
This is meant for production use, especially for:

* Python developers who like Qt's signal/slot pattern but don't want Qt as a dependency
* Anyone building async applications that need clean component communication
* Developers working with multi-threaded applications who want easier thread communication

**Comparison:**  
While Qt provides a robust signal/slot system, it comes with the entire Qt framework. Other alternatives like PyPubSub or RxPY exist, but TSignal is unique because it:

* Provides Qt-like syntax without Qt dependencies
* Has native asyncio integration (unlike Qt)
* Handles thread-safety automatically (simpler than manual PyPubSub threading)
* Is much lighter than RxPY while keeping the essential event handling features

Here's a quick example:

    @t_with_signals
    class Counter:
        @t_signal
        def count_changed(self):
            pass
        
        def increment(self):
            self.count += 1
            self.count_changed.emit(self.count)
    
    @t_with_signals
    class Display:
        @t_slot
        async def on_count_changed(self, value):
            print(f""Count is now: {value}"")
    
    # Connect and use
    counter = Counter()
    display = Display()
    counter.count_changed.connect(display, display.on_count_changed)
    counter.increment()  
    # Triggers async update

Python,Update on pgcrud: CRUD operations for PostgreSQL,"A couple of days ago, I shared a post ([link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gy1qg7/crud_operations_for_postgresql_with_pgcrud/)) about my open-source library pgcrud. I've received a lot of positive and constructive feedback and I was even asked to give an update on some topics. Here it is:

**What My Project Does**

pgcrud is a python library that makes Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for PostgreSQL simple and fast. It serves as the bridge between the PostgreSQL adapter psycopg and Pydantic, the leading library for data modelling, data serialization and validation

**Target Audience**

All python developers that are using PostgreSQL. Most of them either write raw SQL or use ORMs like SQLAlchemy or SQLModel.

**Comparison**

Cons of current methods:  
  
\- Classical ORMs are convenient but struggle handling relations. In addition, you often need separate (Pydantic) models for your output layer (API interface)  
\- Raw SQL can be repetitive and it is difficult to handle dynamic filter or sorting conditions (and I don't parametrisation but optional parameters)

pgcrud solves these problems by using powerful data annotations to in Pydantic models so that you can map any Pydantic model field to a corresponding database object. pgcrud is an abstractly declarative similar to SQLAlchemy Core but is specifically tailored PostgreSQL and with built in Pydantic support.  
  
In my Github repo you can see how you  can handle parent-children relationships with pgcrud in a single database call and recieve a list of Pydantic models as result. Essentially any ""n+1"" problem can be solved in a single database call with pgcrud.

Looking forward to your comments! Any Feedback, positive or negative, is highly appreciated!

The link to my Github Repository is here:  
[https://github.com/dakivara/pgcrud](https://github.com/dakivara/pgcrud)

Python,"Promptic: ""requests"" for LLMs","Promptic aims to be the ""[requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)"" of LLM development -- the most productive and pythonic way to build LLM applications. It leverages [LiteLLM][litellm], so you're never locked in to an LLM provider and can switch to the latest and greatest with a single line of code. Promptic gets out of your way so you can focus entirely on building features.

### At a glance

- üéØ Type-safe structured outputs with Pydantic
- ü§ñ Easy-to-build agents with function calling
- üîÑ Streaming support for real-time responses
- üíæ Built-in conversation memory
- üõ†Ô∏è Error handling and retries
- üîå Extensible state management

## Installation

```bash
pip install promptic
```

## Usage

### Basics

Functions decorated with `@llm` inject arguments into the prompt. You can customize the model, system prompt, and more. Most arguments are passed directly to [litellm.completion](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/input).

```python
from promptic import llm

@llm
def translate(text, target_language=""Chinese""):
    """"""Translate '{text}' to {target_language}""""""

print(translate(""Hello world!""))
# ÊÇ®Â•ΩÔºå‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ

@llm(
    model=""claude-3-haiku-20240307"",
    system=""You are a customer service analyst. Provide clear sentiment analysis with key points.""
)
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    """"""Analyze the sentiment of this customer feedback: {text}""""""

print(analyze_sentiment(""The product was okay but shipping took forever""))
# Sentiment: Mixed/Negative
# Key points:
# - Neutral product satisfaction
# - Significant dissatisfaction with shipping time
```

### Structured Outputs

You can use Pydantic models to ensure the LLM returns data in exactly the structure you expect. Simply define a Pydantic model and use it as the return type annotation on your decorated function. The LLM's response will be automatically validated against your model schema and returned as a Pydantic object.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from promptic import llm

class Forecast(BaseModel):
    location: str
    temperature: float
    units: str

@llm
def get_weather(location, units: str = ""fahrenheit"") -&gt; Forecast:
    """"""What's the weather for {location} in {units}?""""""

print(get_weather(""San Francisco"", units=""celsius""))
# location='San Francisco' temperature=16.0 units='Celsius'
```

Alternatively, you can use JSON Schema dictionaries for more low-level validation:

```python
from promptic import llm

schema = {
    ""type"": ""object"",
    ""properties"": {
        ""name"": {
            ""type"": ""string"",
            ""pattern"": ""^[A-Z][a-z]+$"",
            ""minLength"": 2,
            ""maxLength"": 20
        },
        ""age"": {
            ""type"": ""integer"",
            ""minimum"": 0,
            ""maximum"": 120
        },
        ""email"": {
            ""type"": ""string"",
            ""format"": ""email""
        }
    },
    ""required"": [""name"", ""age""],
    ""additionalProperties"": False
}

@llm(json_schema=schema, system=""You generate test data."")
def get_user_info(name: str) -&gt; dict:
    """"""Get information about {name}""""""

print(get_user_info(""Alice""))
# {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
```

### Agents

Functions decorated with `@llm.tool` become tools that the LLM can invoke to perform actions or retrieve information. The LLM will automatically execute the appropriate tool calls, creating a seamless agent interaction.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from promptic import llm

@llm(model=""gpt-4o"")
def scheduler(command):
    """"""{command}""""""

@scheduler.tool
def get_current_time():
    """"""Get the current time""""""
    print(""getting current time"")
    return datetime.now().strftime(""%I:%M %p"")

@scheduler.tool
def add_reminder(task: str, time: str):
    """"""Add a reminder for a specific task and time""""""
    print(f""adding reminder: {task} at {time}"")
    return f""Reminder set: {task} at {time}""

@scheduler.tool
def check_calendar(date: str):
    """"""Check calendar for a specific date""""""
    print(f""checking calendar for {date}"")
    return f""Calendar checked for {date}: No conflicts found""

cmd = """"""
What time is it? 
Also, can you check my calendar for tomorrow 
and set a reminder for a team meeting at 2pm?
""""""

print(scheduler(cmd))
# getting current time
# checking calendar for 2023-10-05
# adding reminder: Team meeting at 2023-10-05T14:00:00
# The current time is 3:48 PM. I checked your calendar for tomorrow, and there are no conflicts. I've also set a reminder for your team meeting at 2 PM tomorrow.
```

### Streaming
The streaming feature allows real-time response generation, useful for long-form content or interactive applications:

```python
from promptic import llm

@llm(stream=True)
def write_poem(topic):
    """"""Write a haiku about {topic}.""""""

print("""".join(write_poem(""artificial intelligence"")))
# Binary thoughts hum,
# Electron minds awake, learn,
# Future thinking now.
```

### Error Handling and Dry Runs

Dry runs allow you to see which tools will be called and their arguments without invoking the decorated tool functions. You can also enable debug mode for more detailed logging.

```python
from promptic import llm

@llm(
    system=""you are a posh smart home assistant named Jarvis"",
    dry_run=True,
    debug=True,
)
def jarvis(command):
    """"""{command}""""""

@jarvis.tool
def turn_light_on():
    """"""turn light on""""""
    return True

@jarvis.tool
def get_current_weather(location: str, unit: str = ""fahrenheit""):
    """"""Get the current weather in a given location""""""
    return f""The weather in {location} is 45 degrees {unit}""

print(jarvis(""Please turn the light on and check the weather in San Francisco""))
# ...
# [DRY RUN]: function_name = 'turn_light_on' function_args = {}
# [DRY RUN]: function_name = 'get_current_weather' function_args = {'location': 'San Francisco'}
# ...
```

### Resiliency

`promptic` pairs perfectly with [tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity) for handling rate limits, temporary API failures, and more.

```python
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, retry_if_exception_type
from promptic import llm
from litellm.exceptions import RateLimitError

@retry(
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10),
    retry=retry_if_exception_type(RateLimitError)
)
@llm
def generate_summary(text):
    """"""Summarize this text in 2-3 sentences: {text}""""""

generate_summary(""Long article text here..."")
```

### Memory and State Management

By default, each function call is independent and stateless. Setting `memory=True` enables built-in conversation memory, allowing the LLM to maintain context across multiple interactions. Here's a practical example using Gradio to create a web-based chatbot interface:

```python
import gradio as gr
from promptic import llm

@llm(memory=True, stream=True)
def assistant(message):
    """"""{message}""""""

def predict(message, history):
    partial_message = """"
    for chunk in assistant(message):
        partial_message += str(chunk)
        yield partial_message

with gr.ChatInterface(title=""Promptic Chatbot Demo"", fn=predict) as demo:
    # ensure clearing the chat window clears the chat history
    demo.chatbot.clear(assistant.clear)

demo.launch()
```

For custom storage solutions, you can extend the `State` class to implement persistence in any database or storage system:

```python
import json
from promptic import State, llm

class RedisState(State):
    def __init__(self, redis_client):
        super().__init__()
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.key = ""chat_history""
    
    def add_message(self, message):
        self.redis.rpush(self.key, json.dumps(message))
    
    def get_messages(self, limit=None):
        messages = self.redis.lrange(self.key, 0, -1)
        return [json.loads(m) for m in messages][-limit:] if limit else messages
    
    def clear(self):
        self.redis.delete(self.key)


@llm(state=RedisState(redis_client))
def persistent_chat(message):
    """"""Chat: {message}""""""
```

Python,Python.org entire download library is inaccessible right now,"I was at work and I was using pyenv to install a virtual environment.

Python,Built a research automation API that replaces messy web scraping scripts,"Hey devs! Wanted to share a solution I built after getting frustrated with maintaining multiple scraping scripts.

**The Problem**:
- Different sites need different scraping approaches
- Sites change their structure frequently
- Managing rate limiting and proxies is a pain
- Selenium/Playwright maintenance headaches

**The Solution**:

Built a Python agent API that returns structured JSON for specific queries.

Example:

    import requests
    
    # Instead of complex scraping logic
    response = requests.post('&lt;endpoint&gt;', {
        'query': 'find a therapist in Toronto that does virtual sessions and specializes in ADHD',
        'start_url': (optional)
    })
    
    # Get clean, structured JSON back
    result = response.json()

    {
            jobId: ""job_123456"",
            status: ""completed"",
            results: [
              {
                name: ""Dr. Emily Chen"",
                specialization: ""ADHD, Anxiety"",
                location: ""New York"",
                virtualSessions: true,
                availability: ""Mon, Wed, Fri"",
              },
              {
                name: ""Michael Thompson, MSW"",
                specialization: ""ADHD, Depression"",
                location: ""New York"",
                virtualSessions: true,
                availability: ""Tue, Thu, Sat"",

Python,I made a Report Generation and Project Management Tool [Django Rest],"Hi, I recently released my open-source project APTRS (Automated Penetration Testing Reporting System). It is an automated pentest report generation application built with the Django Rest framework.

  
**What it does:**

* Enables users to create and manage projects while tracking their statuses. 
* Management of customers and their respective projects, as well as any associated security vulnerabilities. 
* Users can generate project reports in Word using a custom template, as well as in PDF and Excel formats.
* Additionally, the application allows users to use the WYSIWYG CKEDITOR to input data and document vulnerabilities for report creation.

  
**Target Audience:**

* Individual Security Consultant
* Cyber Security Companies to manage projects and clients and create a report 

Many similar tools exist, but most Python-based options do not support custom word templates. APTRS stands out by focusing on company needs with features for project management and status tracking. It also plans to introduce customer login functionality, a feature lacking in other open-source tools.

**Tech Stack:**

* Python 3.9+ with Django Rest Framework
* Postgresql
* Redis
* Vite + React Frontend

Python,How important is software testing to you as a Python developer? üêçü§î,"Hey Pythonistas! üëã

In the world of software development, we often talk about shiny new frameworks, libraries, and cool features ‚Äì but what about software testing?

I‚Äôm curious:

- Where does testing sit on your list of priorities?
- Do you use tools like Pytest, Unittest, or even CI/CD pipelines to automate your testing?
- Do you feel like testing helps you code faster and better ‚Äì or is it more of a chore for you?

With Python, writing tests is so straightforward it‚Äôs almost fun (almost, right? üòÖ). Personally, I find that testing not only reduces bugs but also boosts my confidence in the code, especially with larger projects.

What about you? Do you test everything religiously, just the critical stuff, or are you more like, ‚ÄúTesting? Never heard of it.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs chat about best practices, tools, and your experiences ‚Äì we might all learn something new! üöÄ

Python,Improving GroupBy.map with Dask and Xarray,"I'm a Dask contributor and wanted to share some recent improvements on using Dask + Xarray for working with large geo datasets.

Over the past couple months, there's been more work on the array integration for Dask, with a focus on geospatial workloads. Running GroupBy-Map patterns backed by Dask arrays is essential for a number of tasks when working with large climate/weather data, like detrending or zonal averaging. The latest version of Dask uses a new algorithm for selecting data that‚Äôs more robust and we're already seeing improved performance.

We are actively working on improvements and are interested in feedback. Feel free to [reach out](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/support.html#asking-for-help) and let us know if things aren't working for you.

Python,I made a Spotify ‚Üí YouTube Music converter that doesn't need API keys! [GUI],"Hey r/python! After Spotify decided to make their mobile app practically unusable for free users, my friend u/zakede and I decided to switch to YT Music. With our huge libraries, we needed something to convert our playlists, so we made this. It works with a Web GUI (made in FastHTML), and did I mention you don't need any API or OAuth keys?

**What it does:**

* Transfers your Spotify playlists/albums/liked songs to YouTube Music
* Has a simple Web GUI
* Better song search than the default YouTube one (at least in my testing)
* No API keys needed

**Target Audience:** This is for anyone who:

* Is switching from Spotify to YouTube Music
* Wants to maintain libraries on both platforms (Library sync is on the roadmap)
* Is tired of copying playlists manually
* Doesn't want to mess with API keys

**How it's different:** Most existing tools either:

* Require you to get API keys and do OAuth (which is currently [broken](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi/issues/676) for YT Music)
* Are online services that are slow and have low limits (the one I tried only allowed 150 songs per playlist and a total of 5 playlists)
* Are CLI-only

[Can your networking library do this](https://github.com/mr-ansar/can-your-networking-library-do-this)

Python,I Wrote a Guide to Simulation in Python with SimPy,"Hi folks,

I wrote a guide on discrete-event simulation with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to help you learn how to build simulations using Python. Kind of like the official documentation but on steroids.

I have used SimPy personally in my own career for over a decade, it was central in helping me build a [pretty successful engineering career](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1gh8at0/my_13_year_nontraditional_meche_career_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling real world industrial systems such as factories, mines, railways, etc.

My latest venture is teaching others all about this.

If you do get the guide, I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback you have. Feel free to drop your thoughts here in the thread or DM me directly!

This new course will be all about real-world modelling and simulation with SimPy, and I‚Äôd love to send you keep you in the loop via email.

Python,"Benchmark: DuckDB, Polars, Pandas, Arrow, SQLite, NanoCube on filtering / point queryies ","While working on the [NanoCube project](https://github.com/nanocubeai/nanocube), an in-process OLAP-style query engine written in Python, I needed a baseline **performance comparison** against the most prominent in-process data engines: DuckDB, Polars, Pandas, Arrow and SQLite. I already had a comparison with Pandas, but now I have it for all of them. My findings:

* A purpose-built technology (here OLAP-style queries with NanoCube) written in Python can be faster than general purpose high-end solutions written in C.
* A fully index SQL database is still a thing, although likely a bit outdated for modern data processing and analysis.
* DuckDB and Polars are awesome technologies and best for large scale data processing.
* **Sorting of data matters!** **Do it! Always!** If you can afford the time/cost to sort your data before storing it. Especially DuckDB and Nanocube deliver significantly faster query times.

The [**full comparison**](https://github.com/nanocubeai/nanocube/tree/main#nanocube-benchmarks) with many **very nice charts** can be found in the [**NanoCube GitHub repo**](https://github.com/nanocubeai/nanocube?tab=readme-ov-file#nanocube-benchmarks). Maybe it's of interest to some of you. Enjoy...

Python,Dungeons and Dragon's Character Generator Code,"I have been working on a Dungeon and Dragons's Character Generator in python for months. If you want a percentage I would say 85% done (only because additional info needs added! It works just fine!)

After about 600 random characters flawlessly made (flawlessly as in I made 600 and the code didn't bug out once), I wanted to get community input and maybe make some for others, so I can start stresstesting that portion of code.

Here's a vague idea how it works:
Character provides Character name, player name and player level and whether they wanna provide Character info. There are follow ups based on the response, but in the end it will PyPDF write to a fillable Character sheet and create your character, and for abilities too long to put on the sheet, the ability says (see notes) and a Note.txt file is made for that character/playername.

Python,Pythonic API for POSIX Named Semaphores,"**What My Project Does:**

Hi!

I wrote¬†[named\_semaphores](https://pypi.org/project/named_semaphores/)¬†a small Python package that provides a pythonic API to POSIX Named Semaphores.

**Key Features:**

* **Named Semaphores**: Handle POSIX IPC named semaphores with ease.
* **Pythonic API**: Similar to Python's built-in¬†`threading.Semaphore`¬†for familiarity.
* **Flexible Creation**: Choose how to handle existing semaphores (`RAISE_IF_EXISTS`,¬†`LINK_OR_CREATE`, etc.).
* **Timeouts**: Optionally specify timeouts for acquiring semaphores (platform-dependent).
* **Automatic Cleanup**: Semaphore can be automatically unlinked when the object is deleted.

**Target Audience:**

Anyone dealing with access to limited resources by different Python programs that are not directly connected. For example, limiting API requests to a AWS Bedrock service between FastAPI workers.

**Comparison with Existing Alternatives:**

It wraps around existing library¬†`posix_ipc`, but adds some features such as automatic unlinking, and an API more similar to¬†`threading.Semaphore`. It also improves the documentation by complete docstrings and typing annotations (the C bindings of the¬†`posix_ipc`¬†library does not provide type hints or docstrings).

**How to Get Started:**

Install from Pypi: [https://pypi.org/project/named\_semaphores/](https://pypi.org/project/named_semaphores/)

Python,Bagels - Expense tracker that lives in your terminal (TUI),"Hi r/Python! I'm excited to share [Bagels](https://github.com/EnhancedJax/Bagels) \- a terminal (UI) expense tracker built with the [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) TUI library! Check out the git repo for screenshots.

# Target audience

**But first, why an expense tracker in the terminal?**¬†This is intended for people like me: I found it easier to build a habit and keep an accurate track of my expenses if I did it at the end of the day, instead of on the go. So why not in the terminal where it's fast, and I can keep all my data locally?

# What my project does

Some notable features include:

* Keep track of your expenses with Accounts, (Sub)Categories, Splits, Transfers and Records
* Templates for recurring transactions
* Keep track of who owes you money in the people's view
* Add templated records with number keys
* Clear and concise table layout with collapsible splits
* Transfer to and from non-tracked accounts (outside of wallet)
* ""Jump Mode"" Navigation
* Fewer fields to enter per transaction by default input modes
* Insights
* Customizable config, such as First Day of Week

Comparison: Unlike traditional expense trackers that are accessed by web or mobile, Bagels lives in your terminal. It differs as an expense tracker tool by providing more convenient input fields and a clear and concise layout. (though subjective)

# Quick start

Install uv and install the uv tool:

    uv tool install --python 3.13 bagels

Python,Simple deployment options for Python projects?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been thinking about ways to host and deploy Python projects. For those of you who‚Äôve worked on anything from small Python scripts to full web apps or APIs, what kind of hosting setups have you used?

Do you rely on cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud‚Ä¶ etc), or have you found platforms that simplify the process for smaller projects? I‚Äôm especially curious about solutions that make deployment and monitoring easier, with features like:
* CI/CD integration (like GitHub or gitlab pipelines)
* Real-time logs
* Ability to pause or stop execution

Python,CRUD Operations for PostgreSQL with pgcrud,"Over the past few years, I've built a Python application with a PostgreSQL database and spent countless hours optimising CRUD operations without bloating the codebase. I have open-sourced it and want to share **pgcrud** with you:

**What My Project Does**

**pgcrud**¬†is a fast and lightweight library that enables seamless integration between PostgreSQL databases, the psycopg adapter and Pydantic models.¬†**pgcrud**¬†simplifies CRUD operations with straightforward, abstractly declarative functions, eliminating the need for ORMs or redundant SQL queries.

**Target Audience**

Python developers:

Most developers either choose ORMs ( like SQLAlchemy or SQLModel) or write raw SQL

* ORMs are convenient but they map directly to tables and real-world applications often require modelling relationships. This leads to added complexity with extra data models and more database requests
* Raw SQL avoids abstraction but results in repetitive code and difficulties handling optional filter parameters or sorting conditions

**Comparison**

**pgcrud** is a purely abstract declarative module, meaning it's not tied to specific database tables. This flexibility allows developers to model their logic without being constrained by rigid tables. Additionally, **pgcrud** has built-in support for pydantic models and can easily handle reactions between tables via view definitions.

There are more explanations on my Github page. Here is the link: [https://github.com/dakivara/pgcrud](https://github.com/dakivara/pgcrud)

Python,"Python isn't just glue, it's an implicit JIT ecosystem","Writing more Rust recently led me to a revelation about Python. Rust was vital to my original task, but only a few simplifications away, the shorter Python version leapt to almost as fast. I'd stumbled from a cold path to a hot path...

This is my argument that Python, through a number of features both purposeful and accidental, ended up with an implicit JIT ecosystem, well-worn trails connecting optimized nodes, paved over time by countless developers.

I'm definitely curious to hear how this feels to others.
I've been doing Python half my life (almost two decades) and Rust seriously for the last few years.
I love both languages deeply but the pendulum has now swung back towards Python not as I won't use Rust but as I feel my eyes are now open as to how when and how I should use Rust.

Python,Now updated my Python Automated AI Research Assistant to work with OpenAI endpoints and Ollama!,"So yeah now it works with OpenAI compatible endpoints thanks to the kind work of people on the Github who updated it for me here is a recap of the project:

Automated-AI-Web-Researcher: After months of work, I've made a python program that turns local LLMs running on Ollama into online researchers for you, Literally type a single question or topic and wait until you come back to a text document full of research content with links to the sources and a summary and ask it questions too! and more!

**What My Project Does**:

This automated researcher uses internet searching and web scraping to gather information, based on your topic or question of choice, it will generate focus areas relating to your topic designed to explore various aspects of your topic and investigate various related aspects of your topic or question to retrieve relevant information through online research to respond to your topic or question. The LLM breaks down your query into up to 5 specific research focuses, prioritising them based on relevance, then systematically investigates each one through targeted web searches and content analysis starting with the most relevant.

Then after gathering the content from those searching and exhausting all of the focus areas, it will then review the content and use the information within to generate new focus areas, and in the past it has often finding new, relevant focus areas based on findings in research content it has already gathered (like specific case studies which it then looks for specifically relating to your topic or question for example), previously this use of research content already gathered to develop new areas to investigate has ended up leading to interesting and novel research focuses in some cases that would never occur to humans although mileage may vary this program is still a prototype but shockingly it, it actually works!.

Key features:

* Continuously generates new research focuses based on what it discovers
* Saves every piece of content it finds in full, along with source URLs
* Creates a comprehensive summary when you're done of the research contents and uses it to respond to your original query/question
* Enters conversation mode after providing the summary, where you can ask specific questions about its findings and research even things not mentioned in the summary should the research it found provide relevant information about said things.
* You can run it as long as you want until the LLM‚Äôs context is at it‚Äôs max which will then automatically stop it‚Äôs research and still allow for summary and questions to be asked. Or stop it at anytime which will cause it to generate the summary.
* But it also Includes pause feature to assess research progress to determine if enough has been gathered, allowing you the choice to unpause and continue or to terminate the research and receive the summary.
* Works with popular Ollama local models (recommended phi3:3.8b-mini-128k-instruct or phi3:14b-medium-128k-instruct which are the ones I have so far tested and have worked)
* Everything runs locally on your machine, and yet still gives you results from the internet with only a single query you can have a massive amount of actual research given back to you in a relatively short time.

The best part? You can let it run in the background while you do other things. Come back to find a detailed research document with dozens of relevant sources and extracted content, all organised and ready for review. Plus a summary of relevant findings AND able to ask the LLM questions about those findings. Perfect for research, hard to research and novel questions that you can‚Äôt be bothered to actually look into yourself, or just satisfying your curiosity about complex topics!

GitHub repo with full instructions and a demo video:

[https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama](https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama)

(Built using Python, fully open source, and should work with any Ollama-compatible LLM, although only phi 3 has been tested by me)

**Target Audience**:

Anyone who values locally run LLMs, anyone who wants to do comprehensive research within a single input, anyone who like innovative and novel uses of AI which even large companies (to my knowledge) haven't tried yet.

If your into AI, if your curious about what it can do, how easily you can find quality information using it to find stuff for you online, check this out!

**Comparison**:

Where this differs from per-existing programs and applications, is that it conducts research continuously with a single query online, for potentially hundreds of searches, gathering content from each search, saving that content into a document with the links to each website it gathered information from.

Again potentially hundreds of searches all from a single query, not just random searches either each is well thought out and explores various aspects of your topic/query to gather as much usable information as possible.

Not only does it gather this information, but it summaries it all as well, extracting all the relevant aspects of the info it's gathered when you end it's research session, it goes through all it's found and gives you the important parts relevant to your question. Then you can still even ask it anything you want about the research it has found, which it will then use any of the info it has gathered to respond to your questions.

To top it all off compared to other services like how ChatGPT can search the internet, this is completely open source and 100% running locally on your own device, with any LLM model of your choosing although I have only tested Phi 3, others likely work too!",CuriousAustralianBoy,1gxotms,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gxotms/now_updated_my_python_automated_ai_research/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gxotms/now_updated_my_python_automated_ai_research/,2024-11-23 02:05:53,15,0.81,15,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,self,t3_1gxotms

Python,"pydantic-resolve, a lightweight library based on pydantic which greatly helps on building data. ","**What My Project Does:**

  
[https://allmonday.github.io/pydantic-resolve/v2/why/](https://allmonday.github.io/pydantic-resolve/v2/why/)  why create a new lib.

pydantic-resolve is a lightweight wrapper library based on pydantic, which can greatly simplify the complexity of building data.

With the help of pydantic, it can describe data structures using graph relationships like GraphQL, and also make adjustments based on business requirements while fetching data.

Using an ER-oriented modeling approach, it can provide you with a 3 to 5 times increase in development efficiency and reduce code volume by more than 50%.

It offers¬†`resolve`¬†and¬†`post`¬†methods for pydantic objects.  (pre and post process)

by providing root data and full schema definitions, Resolve will fill all descendants for you.

    from pydantic_resolve import Resolver
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    
    class Car(BaseModel):
        id: int
        name: str
        produced_by: str
    
    class Child(BaseModel):
        id: int
        name: str
    
        cars: List[Car] = []
        async def resolve_cars(self):
            return await get_cars_by_child(self.id)
    
        description: str = ''
        def post_description(self):
            desc = ', '.join([c.name for c in self.cars])
            return f'{self.name} owns {len(self.cars)} cars, they are: {desc}'
    
    children = await Resolver.resolve([
            Child(id=1, name=""Titan""), 
            Child(id=1, name=""Siri"")]
        )

`resolve`¬†is usually used to fetch data, while¬†`post`¬†can perform additional processing after fetching the data.

After defining the object methods and initializing the objects, pydantic-resolve will internally traverse the data and execute these methods to process the data.

With the help of dataloader, pydantic-resolve can avoid the N+1 query problem that often occurs when fetching data in multiple layers, optimizing performance.

In addition, it also provides¬†`expose`¬†and¬†`collector`¬†mechanisms to facilitate cross-layer data processing.

**Target Audience:**

backend developers who need to compose data from different sources

**Comparison:**

GraphQL, ORMÔºå it provides a more general way (declarative way) to build the data.

GraphQL is flexible but the actual query is not maintained at backend.

ORM relationship is powerful but limited in relational db, not easy to join resource from remote

pydantic-resolve aims to provide a balanced tool between GraphQL and ORM,  it joins resource with dataloader and 100% keep data structure at backend (with almost zero extra cost)

Python,HPC-Style Job Scripts in the Cloud,"The first parallel computing system I ever used were job scripts on HPC Job schedulers (like SLURM, PBS, SGE, ...).  They had an API straight out of the 90s, but were super straightforward and helped me do research when I was still just a baby programmer.  

The cloud is way more powerful than these systems, but kinda sucks from a UX perspective.  I wanted to replicate the experience I had on HPC on the cloud with Cloud-based Job Arrays.  It wasn't actually all that hard.

Python,Creating a Python System to Turn All PostgreSQL Servers into Masters with Auto-Recovery and Sync ‚Äì N,"Hello Python community!I‚Äôm currently working on developing a distributed PostgreSQL system using Python, where all servers act as masters. Additionally, I‚Äôm adopting a clear separation between¬†**servers**¬†and¬†**clients**¬†to create a flexible and efficient architecture.The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Master-Master architecture**
   * All servers operate equally, eliminating single points of failure (SPOF).
2. **Server-Client separation**
   * Clients can seamlessly access the system while the internal operations are optimized for distributed workloads.
3. **Automatic recovery**
   * In case of server failures, other nodes automatically handle recovery to maintain uninterrupted service.
4. **Automatic data synchronization**
   * Efficiently synchronizing data across nodes while ensuring consistency.
5. **Leveraging Python and PostgreSQL**
   * Combining Python's flexibility with PostgreSQL's robust features.

# Current Tools

For this project, I‚Äôm focusing on the following two key modules:

* **psycopg3**: To enable efficient communication with PostgreSQL, especially with its asynchronous capabilities.
* **aioquic**: For leveraging the QUIC protocol to achieve fast and reliable data synchronization, particularly for server-client communications in a distributed setup.

# Challenges and Feedback Needed

Here are some specific points where I‚Äôd love to get your insights:

1. **Server-Client Design Approach**
   * What‚Äôs the best way to dynamically determine which server the client should connect to in a distributed master-master setup?
   * Any recommendations for handling automatic failover, where clients detect server failures and switch to another server seamlessly?
2. **Using psycopg3 and aioquic**
   * Any tips on best practices for asynchronous operations with psycopg3 or optimizing aioquic for this use case? Are there other libraries I should consider?
3. **Distributed Database Challenges**
   * In a master-master architecture, what are the best approaches to address consistency and conflict resolution? Are there any recommended algorithms or design patterns?
4. **System Name Suggestions**
   * I‚Äôm considering names like ‚ÄúPostMasterSync‚Äù or ‚ÄúPolyMaster,‚Äù but I‚Äôd love to hear any creative suggestions!

# The Potential of This Project

This project aims to explore new possibilities in distributed databases by combining high availability and flexibility. With the power of Python and PostgreSQL, I‚Äôm excited to see how far this idea can go.I truly value the community‚Äôs knowledge and insights, and I‚Äôm looking forward to your feedback and ideas!Thank you for your time and support",tp-li,1gwghji,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gwghji/creating_a_python_system_to_turn_all_postgresql/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gwghji/creating_a_python_system_to_turn_all_postgresql/,2024-11-21 13:39:13,8,0.73,8,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gwghji
Python,"Just published part 2 of my articles on Python Project Management and Packaging, illustrated with uv","
Hey everyone,

Just finished the second part of my comprehensive guide on Python project management. This part covers both building packages and publishing.

It's like the first article, the goal is to dig in the PEPs and specifications to understand what the standard is, why it came to be and how. This is was mostly covered in the build system section of the article.

The article: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-concepts-illustrated-with-uv-part-2/

I have tried to implement some of your feedback. I worked a lot on the typos (I believe there aren't any but I may be wrong), and I tried to divide the article into three smaller articles:
- Just the high level overview: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-2-high-level-overview/
- The deeper dive into the PEPs and specs for build systems: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-2-source-trees-and-build-systems-interface/
- The deeper dive into PEPs and specs for package formats: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-2-sdists-and-wheels/
- Editable installs and customizing the build process (+ custom hooks): https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-ii-editable-installs-custom-hooks-and-more-customization/

In the parent article there are also two smalls sections about `uv build` and `uv publish`. I don't think they deserve to be in a separate smaller article and I included them for completeness but anyone can just go `uv help &lt;command&gt;` and read about the command and it'd be much better. I did explain some small details that I believe that not everyone knows but I don't think it replaces your own reading of the doc for these commands.


In this part I tried to understand two things:

1- How the tooling works, what is the standard for the build backend, what it is for the build frontend, how do they communicate etc. I think it's the most valuable part of this article. There was a lot to cover, the build environment, how the PEP considered escape hatches and how it thought of some use cases like if you needed to override a build requirement etc. That's the part I enjoyed reading about and writing. I think it builds a deep understand of how these tools work and interact with each other, and what you can expect as well.

There are also two toy examples that I enjoyed explaining, the first is about editable installs, how they differ when they're installed in a project's environment from a regular install.

The second is customising the build process by going beyond the standard with custom hooks. A reader asked in a comment on the first part about integrating Pyarmor as part of its build process so I took that to showcase custom hooks with the `hatchling` build backend, and made some parallels with the specification.

2- What are the package formats for Python projects. I think for this part you can just read the high level overview and go read the specifications directly. Besides some subsections like explaining some particular points in extracting the tarball or signing wheels etc., I don't think I'm bringing much here. You'll obviously learn about the contents of these package formats and how they're extracted / installed, but I copy pasted a lot of the specification. The information can be provided directly without paraphrasing or writing a prose about it. When needed, I do explain a little bit, like why installers must replace leading slashes in files when installing a wheel etc.


I hope you can learn something from this. If you don't want to read through the articles don't hesitate to ask a question in the comments or directly here on Reddit. I'll answer when I can and if I can üòÖ

I still don't think my style of writing is pleasurable or appealing to read but I enjoyed the learning, the understanding, and the writing.

And again, I'l always recommend reading the PEPs and specs yourself, especially the rejected ideas sections, there's a lot of insight to gain from them I believe.

Python,Use python to build mk Converter,"üöÄ Check out my URL/PDF/DOCX to Markdown Converter!

Hey fellow developers! üëã

I'm super excited to share a tool I've been working on that I think might make your life a bit easier. You know that annoying process of converting documents to Markdown? Well, I built something to handle that! 

**What does it do?**
- Converts web pages to Markdown with just a URL
- Transforms PDF files to Markdown (using pdfplumber)
- Converts DOCX files to clean Markdown
- Lets you preview the rendered result right there
- Comes with copy/download buttons for quick access

I built it using FastAPI for the backend (it's crazy fast! ‚ö°) and kept the frontend super clean and simple. You literally just paste a URL or upload a file, hit convert, and boom! üí• You've got your Markdown.

**Why I made this:**
I got tired of manually converting docs for my documentation work, and thought others might find this useful too. Plus, I wanted to learn more about FastAPI and document processing in Python.

**Tech stack:**
- FastAPI (because who doesn't love async Python? üêç)
- pdfplumber for PDF parsing
- python-docx for Word docs
- marked.js for the preview
- Basic HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend

The code is open source, and I'd love to get your feedback or contributions! Check out the screenshots in the README to see it in action.

**Try it out:**
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run with uvicorn
4. Convert all the things! üéâ

Python,MetaDataScraper: A Python Package for scraping Facebook page data with ease!,"Hey everyone! üëã

I‚Äôm excited to introduce **MetaDataScraper**, a Python package designed to automate the extraction of valuable data from Facebook pages. Whether you're tracking follower counts, post interactions, or multimedia content like videos, this tool makes scraping Facebook page data a breeze. No API keys or tedious manual effort required ‚Äî just pure automation! üòé

Usage docs here at [ReadTheDocs](https://metadatascraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Key Features:

* Automated Extraction: Instantly fetch follower counts, post texts, likes, shares, and video links from public Facebook pages.
* Comprehensive Data Retrieval: Get detailed insights from posts, including text content, interactions (likes, shares), and multimedia (videos, reels, etc.).
* Loginless Scraping: With the LoginlessScraper class, no Facebook login is needed. Perfect for scraping public pages.
* Logged-In Scraping: The LoggedInScraper class allows you to login to Facebook and bypass the limitations of loginless scraping. Access more content and private posts if needed.
* Headless Operation: Scrapes data silently in the background (without opening a visible browser window) ‚Äî perfect for automated tasks or server environments.
* Flexible &amp; Easy-to-Use: Simple setup, clear method calls, and works seamlessly with Selenium WebDriver.

# Example Usage:

1. Installation: Simply install via pip:

&amp;#8203;

    pip install MetaDataScraper

2) Loginless Scraping (no Facebook login required):

    from MetaDataScraper import LoginlessScraper
    
    page_id = ""your_target_page_id""
    scraper = LoginlessScraper(page_id)
    result = scraper.scrape()
    
    print(f""Followers: {result['followers']}"")
    print(f""Post Texts: {result['post_texts']}"")

3) Logged-In Scraping (for more access):

    from MetaDataScraper import LoggedInScraper
    
    page_id = ""your_target_page_id""
    email = ""your_facebook_email""
    password = ""your_facebook_password""
    scraper = LoggedInScraper(page_id, email, password)
    result = scraper.scrape()
    
    print(f""Followers: {result['followers']}"")
    print(f""Post Likes: {result['post_likes']}"")
    print(f""Video Links: {result['video_links']}"")

# Comparision to existing alternatives

* Ease of Use: Setup is quick and easy ‚Äî just pass the Facebook page ID and start scraping!
* No Facebook API Required: No need for dealing with Facebook's complex API limits or token issues. This package uses Selenium for direct web scraping, which is much more flexible.
* Better Data Access: With the LoggedInScraper, you can scrape content that might be unavailable to public visitors, all using your own Facebook account credentials.
* Updated Code Logic: With Meta's code updating quite often, many of the now existing scraper packages are defunct. This package is continuously tested and monitored to make sure that the scraper remains functional.

# Target Audience:

* Data Analysts: For tracking page metrics and social media analytics.
* Marketing Professionals: To monitor engagement on Facebook pages and competitor tracking.
* Researchers: Anyone looking to gather Facebook data for research purposes.

Python,Generate Realistic Podcast Sessions Programmatically,"Hey everyone! üëã

I just released `podcast_tts`, a Python library that generates **realistic podcasts and dialogues** with multi-speaker audio, background music, and professional-quality mixing‚Äîall running **100% locally**.

# What My Project Does

`podcast_tts` allows you to programmatically create high-quality audio sessions with multiple speakers, dynamic or premade voice profiles, and customizable background music. You can save the output as MP3 or WAV files and even assign playback to specific audio channels for spatial separation.

It‚Äôs designed to be flexible, whether you‚Äôre building an API with FastAPI or experimenting with personal projects.

# Target Audience

This library is perfect for:

* Developers needing a **local TTS solution** for privacy or offline use.
* Engineers building backend systems for **audio generation** (e.g., podcasts or virtual assistants).
* Anyone looking for an all-in-one tool for **dialogue generation** with professional audio quality.

# Comparison to Alternatives

Unlike many TTS libraries that rely on cloud services, `podcast_tts` is fully offline, ensuring privacy and reducing latency. It also integrates features like **multi-speaker support**, **background music mixing**, and **text normalization**, which are often missing or require multiple tools to achieve.

The project is **open source**, and you can find it on GitHub here: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/puntorigen/podcast_tts).  
It‚Äôs also available on **PyPI** for easy installation: `pip install podcast_tts`.

I‚Äôve shared more details in a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/creating-realistic-podcasts-python-developers-guide-schaffner-bofill-rdgue/?trackingId=KVXkcD61TX6DTgTHZ0Cagw%3D%3D) on LinkedIn and would love to hear your feedback!

Python,Networking applications should not be opening sockets,"From my first development project involving networking I was hooked. I also found some areas of networking software a bit unresolved. There was some strong modeling for people who make networking components but that seemed to peter out after the sockets library. Nobody seemed to have a good compelling way to bundle all that block I/O, byte framing, encoding/decoding, message dispatching etc into something that was reused from project to project.

I finally did something about this and have produced a software library. I also wrote a discussion paper that is the first link in the readme of the following github repo. The repo contains demonstration modules that are referred to in the other readme links.

Python,11 Python Boilerplate Code Snippets Every Developer Needs,"Python's simplicity makes it a favorite among developers, especially in trending fields like AI, machine learning, and automation. But let's face it‚Äîrepeating boilerplate code can be a drag. That‚Äôs where **Python snippets** come in!

From validating emails to shuffling lists, we‚Äôve rounded up 11 essential Python boilerplate snippets to simplify your daily tasks and supercharge your workflow:

# üîç 1. Validate Email Formats (Regex Simplified)

Use regular expressions to validate email strings efficiently:

    pythonCopy codeimport re  
    def validate_email(email):  
        email_pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$')  
        return bool(email_pattern.match(email))  
    

# ‚úÇÔ∏è 2. Slice Strings &amp; Lists Like a Pro

Access sub-elements directly without loops for cleaner code:

    pythonCopy codemy_string = ""Hello, World!""  
    print(my_string[0:5])  # Output: Hello  
    

# üîÑ 3. Compare Words: Are They Anagrams?

Quickly check if two strings are anagrams with `collections.Counter`:

    pythonCopy codefrom collections import Counter  
    def are_anagrams(word1, word2):  
        return Counter(word1) == Counter(word2)  
    

# üÜï 4. Capitalize Words with title()

Effortlessly format strings for clean output:

    pythonCopy codeinput_string = ""hello world""  
    print(input_string.title())  # Output: Hello World  
    

# üîç 5. Find Differences Between Sets

Identify unique elements between two sets using `difference()`:

    pythonCopy codeset1 = {1, 2, 3}  
    set2 = {3, 4, 5}  
    print(set1.difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2}  
    

And there‚Äôs more! From finding the most frequent elements in a list to using `shuffle()` for randomizing data, these snippets save you time and hassle.

Python,moka-py: A high performance caching library for Python written in Rust with TTL/TTI support,"Hello!

I'm exited to share my first Rust lib for Python ‚Äî [moka-py](https://github.com/deliro/moka-py)!

# What My Project Does

**moka-py**¬†is a Python binding for the highly efficient¬†[Moka](https://github.com/moka-rs/moka)¬†caching library written in Rust. This library allows you to leverage the power of Moka's high-performance, feature-rich cache in your Python projects.

# Key Features:

* **Synchronous Cache:**¬†Supports thread-safe, in-memory caching for Python applications.
* **TTL Support:**¬†Automatically evicts entries after a configurable time-to-live (TTL).
* **TTI Support:**¬†Automatically evicts entries after a configurable time-to-idle (TTI).
* **Size-based Eviction:**¬†Automatically removes items when the cache exceeds its size limit using the TinyLFU policy.
* **Concurrency:**¬†Optimized for high-performance, concurrent access in multi-threaded environments.
* **Fully typed:** mypy/pyright friendly. Even decorators

# Example (`@lru_cache` drop-in replacement but with TTL and TTI support):

```
from time import sleep
from moka_py import cached


@cached(maxsize=1024, ttl=10.0, tti=1.0)
def f(x, y):
    print(""hard computations"")
    return x + y


f(1, 2)  # calls computations
f(1, 2)  # gets from the cache
sleep(1.1)
f(1, 2)  # calls computations (since TTI has passed)
```

# One more example:

```
from time import sleep
from moka_py import Moka


# Create a cache with a capacity of 100 entries, with a TTL of 30 seconds
# and a TTI of 5.2 seconds. Entries are always removed after 30 seconds
# and are removed after 5.2 seconds if there are no `get`s happened for this time.
# 
# Both TTL and TTI settings are optional. In the absence of an entry, 
# the corresponding policy will not expire it.
cache: Moka[str, list[int]] = Moka(capacity=100, ttl=30, tti=5.2)

# Insert a value.
cache.set(""key"", [3, 2, 1])

# Retrieve the value.
assert cache.get(""key"") == [3, 2, 1]

# Wait for 5.2+ seconds, and the entry will be automatically evicted.
sleep(5.3)
assert cache.get(""key"") is None
```

# Target Audience

**moka-py** might be useful for short-term in-memory caching for frequently-asked data

# Comparison

* [cachetools](https://github.com/tkem/cachetools/) ‚Äî Pure Python caching library. 10-50% slower and has no typing

# TODO:
* Per-entry expiration
* Choosing between eviction policies (LRU/TinyLFU)
* Size-aware eviction
* Support async functions

Python,Created an AI Research Assistant that actually DOES research! one query FULL document of knowledge!,"Automated-AI-Web-Researcher: After months of work, I've made a python program that turns local LLMs running on Ollama into online researchers for you, Literally type a single question or topic and wait until you come back to a text document full of research content with links to the sources and a summary and ask it questions too! and more!



**What My Project Does**:



This automated researcher uses internet searching and web scraping to gather information, based on your topic or question of choice, it will generate focus areas relating to your topic designed to explore various aspects of your topic and investigate various related aspects of your topic or question to retrieve relevant information through online research to respond to your topic or question. The LLM breaks down your query into up to 5 specific research focuses, prioritising them based on relevance, then systematically investigates each one through targeted web searches and content analysis starting with the most relevant.

Then after gathering the content from those searching and exhausting all of the focus areas, it will then review the content and use the information within to generate new focus areas, and in the past it has often finding new, relevant focus areas based on findings in research content it has already gathered (like specific case studies which it then looks for specifically relating to your topic or question for example), previously this use of research content already gathered to develop new areas to investigate has ended up leading to interesting and novel research focuses in some cases that would never occur to humans although mileage may vary this program is still a prototype but shockingly it, it actually works!.

Key features:

* Continuously generates new research focuses based on what it discovers
* Saves every piece of content it finds in full, along with source URLs
* Creates a comprehensive summary when you're done of the research contents and uses it to respond to your original query/question
* Enters conversation mode after providing the summary, where you can ask specific questions about its findings and research even things not mentioned in the summary should the research it found provide relevant information about said things.
* You can run it as long as you want until the LLM‚Äôs context is at it‚Äôs max which will then automatically stop it‚Äôs research and still allow for summary and questions to be asked. Or stop it at anytime which will cause it to generate the summary.
* But it also Includes pause feature to assess research progress to determine if enough has been gathered, allowing you the choice to unpause and continue or to terminate the research and receive the summary.
* Works with popular Ollama local models (recommended phi3:3.8b-mini-128k-instruct or phi3:14b-medium-128k-instruct which are the ones I have so far tested and have worked)
* Everything runs locally on your machine, and yet still gives you results from the internet with only a single query you can have a massive amount of actual research given back to you in a relatively short time.

The best part? You can let it run in the background while you do other things. Come back to find a detailed research document with dozens of relevant sources and extracted content, all organised and ready for review. Plus a summary of relevant findings AND able to ask the LLM questions about those findings. Perfect for research, hard to research and novel questions that you can‚Äôt be bothered to actually look into yourself, or just satisfying your curiosity about complex topics!

GitHub repo with full instructions:

[https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama](https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama)

(Built using Python, fully open source, and should work with any Ollama-compatible LLM, although only phi 3 has been tested by me)

**Target Audience**:

  
Anyone who values locally run LLMs, anyone who wants to do comprehensive research within a single input, anyone who like innovative and novel uses of AI which even large companies (to my knowledge) haven't tried yet.

If your into AI, if your curious about what it can do, how easily you can find quality information using it to find stuff for you online, check this out!

  
**Comparison**:

  
Where this differs from per-existing programs and applications, is that it conducts research continuously with a single query online, for potentially hundreds of searches, gathering content from each search, saving that content into a document with the links to each website it gathered information from. 

Again potentially hundreds of searches all from a single query, not just random searches either each is well thought out and explores various aspects of your topic/query to gather as much usable information as possible.

Not only does it gather this information, but it summaries it all as well, extracting all the relevant aspects of the info it's gathered when you end it's research session, it goes through all it's found and gives you the important parts relevant to your question. Then you can still even ask it anything you want about the research it has found, which it will then use any of the info it has gathered to respond to your questions.

To top it all off compared to other services like how ChatGPT can search the internet, this is completely open source and 100% running locally on your own device,  with any LLM model of your choosing although I have only tested Phi 3, others likely work too!",CuriousAustralianBoy,1gvlzax,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gvlzax/created_an_ai_research_assistant_that_actually/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gvlzax/created_an_ai_research_assistant_that_actually/,2024-11-20 09:50:09,86,0.8,86,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1gvlzax
Python,Migrating from black and flake8 to ruff,"as the title says, so i'm currently working on a relatively huge python/django codebase, built over the course of 6 years, which has been using black and flake8 for formatting and linting in pre-commit hook, both have their versions unupdated for about 3 years, now i have a somewhat difficult task on hand.

the formatting and linting engine is to be moved to ruff but in such a way that the formatting and linting changes reflected in codebase due to ruff are minimal, i can't seem to figure out a way of exporting either configs from black and flake8 in their current state so i can somehow replicate them in ruff to control the changes due to formatting. if anyone has been in a similar situation or know any potential way i can approach this, that would greatly help. cheers!

Python,ImportSpy: Proactive Validation for External Python Modules,"Have you ever wondered how to ensure that external modules importing your code meet the requirements of your project? With ImportSpy, you can define rules that external modules must follow, ensuring smooth and reliable integration.

What ImportSpy Does:

ImportSpy is an open-source Python library that allows developers to enforce specific rules on external modules that import their code. It ensures these modules meet the required structure, including:
	‚Ä¢	Mandatory Functions: Ensure external modules define critical functions you rely on.
	‚Ä¢	Required Classes: Validate the presence of specific classes, along with their methods and attributes.
	‚Ä¢	Essential Variables: Check for the existence of key variables with their expected values.
	‚Ä¢	Environment Variables: Verify that external modules operate in a properly configured environment, with necessary environment variables set.
	‚Ä¢	Version Control: Enforce compatibility by specifying the required module version.

How It Works:

ImportSpy operates proactively, analyzing any module attempting to import your code. If the module does not comply with the rules you‚Äôve defined, ImportSpy raises a detailed error message highlighting exactly what is missing or non-compliant.

Comparison:

Unlike traditional runtime error detection tools, ImportSpy acts proactively by catching problems before the importing module can even run. Here‚Äôs how ImportSpy stands out:
	1.	Prevention over diagnosis: Instead of debugging unexpected issues after runtime, ImportSpy prevents them from occurring by validating external modules upfront.
	2.	Custom validation: Developers define their own rules, tailored to the project‚Äôs needs, from functions to environment variables.
	3.	Enhanced integration: Seamlessly works with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring compliance in automated workflows.
	4.	Actionable feedback: When a module fails validation, ImportSpy provides clear and specific error messages, reducing debugging time.

Other tools might validate only specific elements, like class methods or version numbers, but ImportSpy offers comprehensive, user-defined validation across all critical aspects of a module.

Why It Matters:

Without tools like ImportSpy, identifying errors caused by non-compliant modules can be a time-consuming and frustrating process. ImportSpy prevents these issues at the source by validating external modules during the import process, saving you time and improving the stability of your project.

Who Should Use It:

	‚Ä¢	Developers building modular or plugin-based architectures: ImportSpy helps ensure all components work seamlessly together.
	‚Ä¢	Teams prioritizing security and stability: ImportSpy blocks incorrect imports that could compromise your project.
	‚Ä¢	Anyone leveraging CI/CD pipelines: Ensure critical environment variables are always set as expected.

Key features:

	‚Ä¢	Proactive validation for external modules, catching issues before runtime.
	‚Ä¢	Clear and actionable error messages when modules are non-compliant.
	‚Ä¢	Support for validating environment variables, versioning, functions, and class structures.
	‚Ä¢	Lightweight and easy to integrate into any Python project.

Python,Pyrogram: Command modulation like discord.py,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôve been working with discord.py for a while, and one of the features I really love is the dynamic command loading system (Cogs). It keeps the codebase clean and scalable by organizing commands into separate files/modules.

Now, I‚Äôve started working with Pyrogram, and I find having all the bot‚Äôs logic in a single file quite messy. I‚Äôm looking for a way to dynamically load commands in main.py from separate files within a commands folder, similar to how Cogs work in Discord.py.

Here‚Äôs my current project structure:

```project/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
```

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

1. A way to dynamically discover and load all commands from the commands folder into main.py.

2. Ideally, commands should be added to the bot without modifying main.py directly.

Python,Retro Terminal Chatbot (GLaDOS),"Hey everyone! I‚Äôd like to share a Python project I‚Äôve been working on for a while now. It‚Äôs a chatbot based on GLaDOS from the Portal games, with a retro-style terminal interface and her iconic voice. I think any portal fans among you will enjoy it.

# What My Project Does

GLaDOS-Terminal is a fully interactive chatbot experience that brings the personality of GLaDOS to life.

* Chatting: The responses are generated using the llama3.2:3b model, giving her personality depth and sarcasm that feels true to the original character.
* Voice Synthesis: Her iconic voice is recreated using custom fine-tuned Tacotron 2 and HiFi-GAN models that I developed specifically for this project.
* UI and Visuals: The terminal is built using pygame combined with a custom moderngl shader, inspired by the retro visuals from the Portal end credits and [this ](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term)project.

# Target Audience

This project is mainly for:

* Portal fans who want a chance to talk to GLaDOS (or at least her chatbot counterpart).
* Developers or Python enthusiasts who are curious about integrating AI models, custom shaders, and real-time voice synthesis.
* Anyone looking for a cool and unique chatbot experience.

Right now, this is more of a showcase or experimental project since it‚Äôs somewhat technical to set up. However, I‚Äôm planning to release an .exe soon to make it more accessible for non-programmers.

# Comparison

There are other AI chatbots and text-to-speech projects out there, but here‚Äôs how this one stands out:

* GLaDOS Personality: This isn‚Äôt just a generic chatbot with GLaDOS references. I‚Äôve carefully crafted her responses and used a system prompt to stay true to her character.
* Custom Voice Models: The Tacotron 2 and HiFi-GAN models are my own forks, fine-tuned specifically for this project to capture her unique tone and speech patterns.
* Retro UI: The terminal interface isn‚Äôt a simple script running in the console; it‚Äôs a fully custom visual experience made with Python‚Äôs pygame and my own moderngl shader work.

Python,Basic Components: Server-Side UI Components for Python Web Apps (Feedback Appreciated),"Hi everyone! üëã

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called **Basic Components**, which ports shadcn/ui component to the Python/Jinja.

# What My Project Does

**Basic Components** is a collection of reusable, **server-side UI components** built with [JinjaX](https://jinjax.scaletti.dev/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/), and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) to Python/Jinja. It allows you to build dynamic, responsive web applications using Python web frameworks like **FastAPI**, **Django**, and **Flask**.

**Key Features**:

* **Copy/Paste Components**: No package to install; simply copy the components you need into your project.
* **Full Customization**: Complete control over the components to modify and extend as needed.
* **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent and rapid UI development.
* **Accessibility-First Design**: Components are built with accessibility in mind, based on shadcn/ui.
* **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in theming with light and dark modes.
* **Markup Compatibility**: The component markup is the same as in shadcn/ui, making it easy to adapt and integrate.

# Target Audience

This project is intended for Python web developers who prefer a server-first architecture and want to build modern, interactive web applications without relying heavily on client-side JavaScript frameworks.

# Comparison to Existing Alternatives

While there are many frontend component libraries available for JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue, Python web development has fewer options for modern, component-based UI development. **Basic Components** differs by:

* **Server-Side Rendering**: Components are rendered on the server using JinjaX, improving performance, SEO, and accessibility.
* **No Additional Dependencies**: Unlike traditional libraries, there's no package to install; you own the code and can customize it freely.
* **Integration with Python Frameworks**: Runs on anything that supports Jinja templates. I've included examples for **FastAPI**, **Django**, and **Flask**.
* **Minimal Client-Side JavaScript**: Uses **htmx** and **Alpine.js** for dynamic behavior without the overhead of heavy frontend frameworks.
* **Markup Parity with shadcn/ui**: Since components are based on shadcn/ui, the markup is the same, making it easy to transition components created for  shadcn/ui with minimal changes.
* **AI**: I've leveraged LLMs to port code from the shadcn/ui React versions to JinjaX, using Alpine.js for client side logic and maintaining all of the Tailwind CSS styles. I've included a [guide](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-components/blob/main/llms.md) for porting components also that you can drop into an LLM chat for context.

# Example Usage

Here's how a component might look in your template:

    &lt;Button
      variant=""outline""
      hx-get=""/api/data""
      hx-target=""#result""
      x-on:click=""open = !open""

Python,"Raspberry Pi camera modules, machine vision and astro cameras in Python","Right now we have a lot of camera modules for Raspberry Pi but also for compatible Arduino boards (ArduCam). Those camera modules can offer higher resolution than webcams as well as more refined control of exposure time, gain and so on - hand for prototyping projects or unconventional imaging.

Webcams themselves can also be used in Python through OpenCV and there are some ""premium"" models offering actual 4K and not absurd resizing (interpolation). Even decent 1080p cameras can give a good quality image - but they do lack more refined control over shutter speed or output formats.

Machine vision cameras are used by various industries, often integrated with advanced commercial software - wherever a medical camera or production line testing/validation systems. Some vendors do offer bindings to some scripting languages, including Python. Those cameras aside of color sensors are available with mono sensors as well and those could be used with custom filters to do UV imaging or something similar (IR imaging - but not thermal). Those cameras also offer lossless output.

Amateur astrophotography uses cameras similar to machine vision (planetary/lunar/solar imaging) with some cameras equipped with large sensors and active cooling for long exposure imaging. Those also can be used in custom projects and often have Python bindings or even Linux ARM support (some RPI based compact/remote-control imaging systems).

Python,Deply: keep your python architecture clean,"Hello everyone,

My name is Archil. I'm a Python/PHP developer originally from Ukraine, now living in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. I've been working on a tool called [Deply](https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply), and I'd love to get your feedback and thoughts on it.

# What My Project Does

**Deply** is a standalone Python tool designed to enforce architectural patterns and dependencies in large Python projects. Deply analyzes your code structure and dependencies to ensure that architectural rules are followed. This promotes cleaner, more maintainable, and modular codebases.

**Key Features:**

* **Layer-Based Analysis**: Define custom layers (e.g., models, views, services) and restrict their dependencies.
* **Dynamic Configuration**: Easily configure collectors for each layer using file patterns and class inheritance.
* **CI Integration**: Integrate Deply into your Continuous Integration pipeline to automatically detect and prevent architecture violations before they reach production.

# Target Audience

* **Who It's For**: Developers and teams working on medium to large Python projects who want to maintain a clean architecture.
* **Intended Use**: Ideal for production environments where enforcing module boundaries is critical, as well as educational purposes to teach best practices.

# Use Cases

* **Continuous Integration**: Add Deply to your CI/CD pipeline to catch architectural violations early in the development process.
* **Refactoring**: Use Deply to understand existing dependencies in your codebase, making large-scale refactoring safer and more manageable.
* **Code Reviews**: Assist in code reviews by automatically checking if new changes adhere to architectural rules.

# Comparison

While there are existing tools like [pydeps](https://github.com/thebjorn/pydeps) that visualize dependencies, Deply focuses on:

* **Enforcement Over Visualization**: Not just displaying dependencies but actively enforcing architectural rules by detecting violations.
* **Customization**: Offers dynamic configuration with various collectors to suit different project structures.

# Links

* **GitHub**: [https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply](https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply)
* **PyPI**: [https://pypi.org/project/deply/](https://pypi.org/project/deply/)

I'm eager to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or criticisms. Deply is currently at version 0.1.5, so it's not entirely stable yet, but I'm actively working on it. I'm open to pull requests and looking forward to making Deply a useful tool for the Python community.

Python,ansiplot: Pretty (and legible) small console plots. ,"**What My Project Does**

Hi all! While developing something different I realized that it would be nice to have a way of plotting multiple curves in the console to get comparative insights (which of those curves is better or worse at certain regions). I am thinking of a 40x10 to 60x20 canvas and maybe 10+ curves that will probably be overlapping a lot.

I couldn't find something to match the exact use case, so I made yet another console plotter:

[https://github.com/maniospas/ansiplot](https://github.com/maniospas/ansiplot)

**Target Audience**

This is mostly a toy project in the sense that it covers the functionalities I am interested in and was made pretty quickly (in an evening). That said, I am creating it for my own production and will be polishing it as needed, so all feedback is welcome.

**Comparison**

My previous options were previously \[asciichart\](https://github.com/kroitor/asciichart), \[drawilleplot\](https://github.com/gooofy/drawilleplot) and \[asciiplot\](https://github.com/w2sv/asciiplot). I think ansiplot looks less ""clean"" because it is restricted to using one symbol per curve, creates thicker lines, and does not show axis tics other than the values for mins and maxs (of course, one can add bars to mark precise points).

The first two shortcomings are conscious design decision in service of two features I consider very important:  
\- The plots look pretty with ANSI colors, but different symbols still accommodate colorblind people and text file exports (there is an option to remove colors while getting the raw text). This is a production need that I think existing tools fail hard at - am I missing something obvious here?  
\- Ansiplot runs a simple heuristic (may evolve in the future) for mixing partially overlapping curves and still making some sense of which exhibit greater values. When there are many curves (especially ROC curves which is my intended use case) they tend to overlap a lot, and I needed something that would help tell where each one's value is going.

P.S. For the lack of axis tics, I am still designing a scheme to ensure a (mostly) predictable canvas size irrespective of whether numbers are big or small (I want to allow very small and very large numbers without the risk of them exceeding the plot limits).

Python,I started implementing an AsyncIO event loop in Rust,"The project is called *RLoop* and available [in the relevant GH repository](https://github.com/gi0baro/rloop).

# What My Project Does

RLoop is intended to be a 1:1 replacement for the standard library asyncio event loop. At the moment RLoop is still very pre-alpha, as it only supports I/O handles involving raw socket file descriptors. The aim is to reach a stable and feature-complete release in the next few months.

# Target Audience

RLoop is intended for every `asyncio` developer. Until the project reach a stable state though, is intended for use only in non-production environments and for testing purposes only.

# Comparison to Existing Alternatives

The main existing alternatives to RLoop are the standard library implementation and `uvloop`.

Aside from the lack of features of RLoop at this stage, some preliminary benchmarks on MacOS and Python 3.11 with a basic TCP echo show a 30% gain over the default `asyncio` implementation, while `uvloop` is still 50% faster.

Python,AnyModal: A Python Framework for Multimodal LLMs,"[AnyModal](https://github.com/ritabratamaiti/AnyModal) is a modular and extensible framework for integrating diverse input modalities (e.g., images, audio) into large language models (LLMs). It enables seamless tokenization, encoding, and language generation using pre-trained models for various modalities.

### Why I Built AnyModal

I created AnyModal to address a gap in existing resources for designing vision-language models (VLMs) or other multimodal LLMs. While there are excellent tools for specific tasks, there wasn‚Äôt a cohesive framework for easily combining different input types with LLMs. AnyModal aims to fill that gap by simplifying the process of adding new input processors and tokenizers while leveraging the strengths of pre-trained language models.

### Features

- **Modular Design**: Plug and play with different modalities like vision, audio, or custom data types.
- **Ease of Use**: Minimal setup‚Äîjust implement your modality-specific tokenization and pass it to the framework.
- **Extensibility**: Add support for new modalities with only a few lines of code.

### Example Usage

```python
from transformers import ViTImageProcessor, ViTForImageClassification
from anymodal import MultiModalModel
from vision import VisionEncoder, Projector

# Load vision processor and model
processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
vision_model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
hidden_size = vision_model.config.hidden_size

# Initialize vision encoder and projector
vision_encoder = VisionEncoder(vision_model)
vision_tokenizer = Projector(in_features=hidden_size, out_features=768)

# Load LLM components
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
llm_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""gpt2"")
llm_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""gpt2"")

# Initialize AnyModal
multimodal_model = MultiModalModel(
    input_processor=None,
    input_encoder=vision_encoder,
    input_tokenizer=vision_tokenizer,
    language_tokenizer=llm_tokenizer,
    language_model=llm_model,
    input_start_token='&lt;|imstart|&gt;',
    input_end_token='&lt;|imend|&gt;',
    prompt_text=""The interpretation of the given image is: ""
)
```

### What My Project Does

AnyModal provides a unified framework for combining inputs from different modalities with LLMs. It abstracts much of the boilerplate, allowing users to focus on their specific tasks without worrying about low-level integration.

### Target Audience

- **Researchers and developers** exploring multimodal systems.
- **Prototype builders** testing new ideas quickly.
- **Anyone experimenting with LLMs** for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and audio transcription.

### Comparison

Unlike existing tools like Hugging Face‚Äôs transformers or task-specific VLMs such as CLIP, AnyModal offers a flexible framework for arbitrary modality combinations. It‚Äôs ideal for niche multimodal tasks or experiments requiring custom data types.

### Current Demos

- LaTeX OCR  
- Chest X-Ray Captioning (in progress)  
- Image Captioning  
- Visual Question Answering (planned)  
- Audio Captioning (planned)  

### Contributions Welcome

Python,Write any Python script in 30 characters (plus an ungodly amount of whitespace),"Hey all!

My friend challenged me to find the shortest solution to a certain Leetcode-style problem in Python. They were generous enough to let me use whitespace for free, so that the code stays readable.

# What My Project Does

I like abusing rules, so I made a tool to encode any Python script in just 30 bytes, plus some whitespace.

This result is somewhat harder to achieve than it looks like at first, so you might want to check out [a post I wrote about it](https://purplesyringa.moe/blog/any-python-program-fits-in-24-characters/). Alternatively, jump straight to the code if that's more of your thing: [GitHub](https://github.com/purplesyringa/24-characters-of-python).

*UPD*: Someone found a way to do this in 24 bytes, post updated!

# Target Audience

This is a toy project, nothing serious, but it was fun for me to work on. I hope you find it entertaining too!

# Comparison

This is honestly the first time I've seen anyone do this with a specific goal of reducing the number of non-whitespace characters at any cost, so this might as well be a unique project.

As a honorary mention, though, it builds on another project I think deserves recognition: [PyFuck](https://github.com/kuangkzh/PyFuck).

Python,Finally Completed : A Personal Project built over the weekend(s) - Netflix Subtitle Translator,"**Motivation :** Last week, I posted about my project, Netfly: The Netflix Translator, here on r/python. I initially built it to solve a problem I ran into while traveling. Let me explain :

On a flight from New Delhi to Tokyo, I started watching an anime movie, *The Concierge*. The in-flight entertainment had English subtitles, and I was hooked, but I couldn‚Äôt finish it. Later, I found the movie on Netflix Japan, but it was only available with Japanese subtitles.

Here‚Äôs the problem: I don‚Äôt know enough Japanese (Nihongo wa sukoshi desu) to follow along, so I decided to build something that could fetch those Japanese subtitles, translate them into English, and overlay the translation on the video while retaining the Japanese subtitles which would give me better context.

What started as a personal project quickly became an obsession.

**What does the Project Do ? :** The primary goal of this project is simple: convert Japanese subtitles on Netflix into English subtitles in an automated way. This is particularly useful when English subtitles aren‚Äôt available for a title.

**The Evolution of this Project / High Level Tech Solution :** This is not the first iteration of Netfly. It has gone through two major updates based on feedback and my own learning.

*Iteration 1: A Tech-Heavy but Costly Solution*

How It Worked:

The Result: It worked, but it was far from practical. The cost of using Google Vision API for every frame made it unsustainable, and the whole process was painfully slow.

*Iteration 2: Streamlining with Subtitles file*

* I discovered Netflix subtitles can be downloaded (through some effort). 
* Parsed the downloaded XML subtitle file using lxml to extract the Japanese text, start time, and end time via XPath. 
* Sent the extracted text to AWS Translate for English translation. 

The Result: This was much better‚Äîcheaper, faster, and simpler. But there was still a manual step : downloading the subtitle file.

*Iteration 3: Fully Automated Workflow*

* Integrated a Playwright script that logs into Netflix, navigates to the selected video, and downloads the subtitle XML file automatically.
* Added a CLI using Python‚Äôs Click library to simplify running the workflow.
* Once the XML file is fetched, the script extracts Japanese text and timestamps, sends the text to AWS Translate, and generates English subtitles in a JSON format.

The Result: All Steps are completely automated now.

**Target Audience** : This project started as a personal tool, but it can be useful for:

* Language Enthusiasts : Anyone who wants to watch Netflix content in languages they don‚Äôt understand.
* Developers : If you‚Äôre exploring libraries like playwright, lxml, click , or translation workflows, this project can be a solid learning resource.

**Comparison with Other Similar Tools :** Existing tools, like Chrome extensions, rely on pre-existing subtitles in the target language. For example, they can overlay English subtitles, but only if those subtitles are already available. Netfly is different because

* It handles cases where English subtitles don‚Äôt exist.
* Automates the entire process, from fetching Japanese subtitles to translating them into English.
* Provides an end-to-end workflow with minimal manual effort.

To the best of my knowledge, no other tool automates this entire flow.

[https://imgur.com/a/pJ6Pnoc](https://imgur.com/a/pJ6Pnoc)

**What's next :** This is still a work in progress, but I feel it‚Äôs in a solid state now. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs on my mind for the next steps: 

1. **Edge Cases:** Testing on a broader range of Netflix titles to handle variations in subtitle formats.
2. **Performance:** Optimizing XML parsing and translation for faster processing.
3. **Extensibility:** Adding support for other subtitle languages.
4. **Error Handling :** Since i iterated very fast, I know the Error Handling is not upto the mark.

Python,"Dispatchery: Type-aware, multi-arg function dispatch for complex and nested Python types","Links: [Github](https://github.com/bolaft/dispatchery/), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dispatchery/)

**What it does:**

*dispatchery* is a lightweight Python package for function dispatching inspired by the standard *singledispatch* decorator, but with support for complex, nested, parameterized types, like for example *tuple[str, dict[str, int | float]]*.

**Comparison**:

Unlike *singledispatch*, *dispatchery* can dispatch based on:

- Generic parameterized types (e.g. *list[int]*)
- Nested types (e.g. *tuple[str, dict[str, int | float]]*)
- Union types (e.g. *int | str* or *Union[int, str]*)
- Multiple arg and kwarg values, not just the first one

**Target Audience:**

Python developers who don't like having a bunch of *if isinstance* checks everywhere in their code.

**Example :**

    from dispatchery import dispatchery
    
    @dispatchery
    def my_func(value):
        return ""Standard stuff.""
    
    @my_func.register(list[str])
    def _(value):
        return ""Strings!""
    
    @my_func.register(list[int] | list[float])
    def _(value):
        return ""Numbers!""
    
    @my_func.register(str, int | float, option=str)
    def _(value1, value2, option):
        return ""Two values and a kwarg!""

    # my_func(42) or my_func(""hello"") will return ""Standard stuff.""
    # my_func([""a"", ""b"", ""c""]) will return ""Strings!""
    # my_func([1, 2, 3]) or my_func([0.2, 0.5, 1.2]) will return ""Numbers!""
    # my_func(""hello"", 42, option=""test"") will return ""Two values and a kwarg!""

**Installation:**

Python,I played a minute-long video in Windows Terminal,"I recently worked on a project combining my love for terminal limits and video art. Here‚Äôs what I achieved: ‚Ä¢	Rendered a 1-minute-long (almost two) ASCII video in the terminal, without graphics libraries or external frameworks. ‚Ä¢	Used true 24-bit colors for each frame, offering deeper color representation in terminal-based projects. ‚Ä¢	Processed 432 million characters over 228 seconds, translating each frame‚Äôs pixels to colors. ‚Ä¢	Optimized performance with multi-processing, running on an integrated graphics card.

Specs:

    ‚Ä¢	30 FPS
    ‚Ä¢	160,000+ characters per frame
    ‚Ä¢	2,700 frames
    ‚Ä¢	3 pixels per character for better performance

For further optimization, I reduced the font size to 3 pixels and used background colors to handle brightness.

**What my project does?**
While not the most practical project, it‚Äôs an experiment I‚Äôm satisfied with it. No real use, but hey, it‚Äôs fun!

**Target audience**
This is more of a fun project so I can't say it has a specific target audience, but I could say that people that strangely feels good coding ""useless"" things might like it.

**Comparison**  
Well it is not an *ASCII* player anymore to be precise, but what it does now is just display video in the terminal using basically pure ANSI, I don't think there is an exact alternative to this since it doesn't serve a specific purpose, except from, well, displaying video with text, it is a fun project.

P.S. I‚Äôm considering rewriting the frame conversion in C to speed things up. More improvements are coming soon!

That‚Äôs it, you can watch a [preview with Tank!](https://youtu.be/FIiminiYla4?si=68aDkNLMo_t8sa0I) from cowboy bebop (ignore some random color stripes i had to do some optimization but wasn‚Äôt really precise on difference calculation)

Python,Is async django ready for prime time? Our async django production experience,"We have traditionally used Django in all our products. We believe it is one of the most underrated, beautifully designed, rock solid framework out there.

However, if we are to be honest, the history of async usage in Django wasn't very impressive. You could argue that for most products, you don‚Äôt really need async. It was just an extra layer of complexity without any significant practical benefit.

Over the last couple of years, AI use-cases have changed that perception. Many AI products have calling external APIs over the network as their bottleneck. This makes the complexity from async Python worth considering. FastAPI with its intuitive async usage and simplicity have risen to be the default API/web layer for AI projects.

I wrote about using async Django in a relatively complex AI open source project here: [https://jonathanadly.com/is-async-django-ready-for-prime-time](https://jonathanadly.com/is-async-django-ready-for-prime-time)

tldr: Async django is ready! there is a couple of gotcha's here and there, but there should be no performance loss when using async Django instead of FastAPI for the same tasks. Django's built-in features greatly simplify and enhance the developer experience.

So - go ahead and use async Django in your next project.

Python,Sensei: The Python Framework for Effortless API Wrapping,"I'm excited to introduce my Python framework, Sensei, designed to help developers create clean, maintainable, and efficient API wrappers. If you've been searching for a tool that simplifies API handling without the hassle of complex code, Sensei has got you covered. Here's a quick look at what it offers:

- Documentation: https://sensei.factorycroco.com
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/CrocoFactory/sensei

# API Wrapper Overview

An API wrapper is client-side code that streamlines the interaction between a client application and a web API. Wrappers handle the details of making HTTP requests, processing responses, and parsing data, allowing developers to integrate API functionality without focusing on lower-level details. API wrappers are often implemented as Python libraries.

For instance, the python-binance library provides access to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange API:

```python
from binance.client import Client

client = Client(api_key='your_api_key', api_secret='your_api_secret')  

balance = client.get_asset_balance(asset='BTC')  
print(balance)

prices = client.get_all_tickers()  
print(prices)

order = client.order_market_buy(
   symbol='BTCUSDT',
   quantity=0.01
)
print(order)
```


# What My Project Does

Sensei simplifies creating API wrappers by handling routing, data validation, and response mapping automatically. This reduces the complexity of managing HTTP requests, allowing for a smoother integration of APIs into projects without redundant code.

Below is an example that demonstrates how Sensei streamlines API requests by combining clear routing and automatic data mapping:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from sensei import Router, Path, APIModel

router = Router('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/')

class Pokemon(APIModel):
    name: str
    id: int
    height: int
    weight: int

_@router.get('/pokemon/{name}')
def get_pokemon(name: Annotated[str, Path(max_length=300)]) -&gt; Pokemon: 
    pass

pokemon = get_pokemon(name=""pikachu"")
print(pokemon)  # Output: Pokemon(name=""pikachu"", ...)
```

Here's how it works:

1. Define the API Route: Initialize the Router with a base URL (e.g., `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/`), which all endpoint paths will extend.
2. Define a Response Model: The Pokemon class represents the data structure of responses. This model enables Sensei to parse and map API response data into Python objects.
3. Route and Parameters: Use the router.get('/pokemon/{name}') decorator to connect the get_pokemon function to an endpoint, enabling dynamic parameter input. The Annotated type adds metadata, such as max_length, to validate inputs before making requests.
4. No Function Code Required: Notice that get_pokemon contains no function body code. Sensei automatically manages the request, response parsing, and mapping, providing a clean, simplified API wrapper.

The result? A single line (`pokemon = get_pokemon(name=""pikachu"")`) executes the API call, with validation, routing, and response mapping all handled by Sensei.

# Target Audience

Sensei is ideal for developers who frequently implement API wrappers in Python and need a reliable, production-ready tool to streamline their workflow. It's particularly useful for library-based wrappers.

# Comparison 

Unlike other API wrappers that may require extensive setup, Sensei offers a highly DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase. Sensei manages response handling and data validation automatically, whereas libraries like requests require additional code to handle response parsing and data checks.

1. Sync &amp; Async Support: Sensei offers both synchronous and asynchronous versions of API wrappers with minimal configuration.
2. Built-in Data Validation: Ensures that data is validated before any API call, reducing unnecessary errors and maintaining consistency.
3. Automatic QPS Management: Handles Queries Per Second (QPS) limits seamlessly, ensuring smooth API integration without unexpected rate-limit errors.
4. Automatic Response Mapping: Maps API responses directly to models, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing readability.
5. DRY Compliance: Sensei promotes a clean, DRY codebase, supporting a solid architecture that minimizes redundancies.

Python,Netflix Subtitle Translator: The XPath Solution - Refined Around Office Hours,"**Motivation:**  
Hey everyone! Last Sunday, I shared the first version of my project,¬†*Netfly Subtitle Converter :*¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gny0ew/built\_this\_over\_the\_weekend\_netflix\_subtitle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gny0ew/built_this_over_the_weekend_netflix_subtitle/), which came out of a personal need to watch Japanese shows on Netflix with English subtitles when they weren‚Äôt available. I was blown away by the response and genuinely grateful for all the feedback ‚Äì it made me take a step back and rethink my approach. To everyone who commented and upvoted, a big thank you! The insights helped me take this project to the next level and I'm pleased to share with you all the next iteration of this project.

**What Does This Project Do?**  
*Netfly Subtitle Converter*¬†takes Japanese subtitles from Netflix, translates them into English ( currently both the source language and the target language are hard coded ) , and syncs them with the video for real-time viewing. Initially, I used Google Cloud Vision to extract text from video frames and AWS Translate for translation. It worked, but as some of you pointed out, this method wasn‚Äôt exactly scalable or efficient. It was costly as well - storing frames in S3, sending them across to Vision API and then using AWS translate. While I had both AWS Credits and Google Credits to cover this up, I got the notion that eventually this will burn a hole in my pocket.

**High-Level Solution:**  
After reading through the suggestions, I realized there was a much better approach. Many of you suggested looking into directly extracting the subtitle files instead of using computer vision. That led me to find a way to download the original XML subtitle file from Netflix ( again thanks to a sub reddit and the post was over 9 years old - even I'm quite surprised that the approach still works ). This XML file has everything I need: the Japanese text along with start and end times. Now, by using XPath, I can easily navigate through the XML to pull out the Japanese subtitles, which I then send to AWS Translate for English output. The whole process is now much simpler, scalable, and cost-effective ‚Äì it‚Äôs a solution that feels more aligned with real-world needs.

**Target Audience:**  
I initially built this for my personal use, but it‚Äôs also ideal for any fan of Japanese anime with limited Japanese proficiency. Additionally, anyone interested in working with libraries like lxml (Python's XML and XPath parsing library) and AWS tools such as AWS Translate, as well as the boto3 SDK, may find this project a valuable hands-on learning experience.

**Comparison with Similar Tools:**  
While there are Chrome extensions that overlay dual-language subtitles on Netflix, they require both Japanese and English subtitles to be available. My case was different ‚Äì there were no English subtitles available, necessitating a unique approach.

**What‚Äôs Next?**  
Right now, downloading the XML subtitle file requires a manual step ‚Äì I have to go to Netflix and fetch it for each show. To make this more automated, I‚Äôm working on a Playwright script that will pull these files automatically. It‚Äôs still a work in progress, but I‚Äôm excited to see how far I can take it.

Python,Expedite v0.1.0 is out now on PyPI,"The general availability of Expedite v0.1.0 is announced with great pleasure. This project has been posted about in this subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1dx7qqb/introducing_expedite_a_simple_encrypted_file/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ea5av1/introducing_expedite_bridge_a_simple_encrypted/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) and your feedback has been crucial in shaping up its first beta release. The project will continue to be developed to ensure that features get introduced and bugs get fixed timely.

# Recap

**Expedite**¬†is a simple encrypted file transfer service that allows people to share synchronously assets among each other without having to rely on third party file sharing services (and constantly worrying about how their data might be used) or feeling the need to have publicly visible IP addresses (and constantly worrying about script kiddies attacking your computer).

**Expedite Server**¬†can be deployed on a virtual private server having an IP address that is discoverable by the¬†**Expedite Client**¬†users to broker file contents. The transfers facilitated using¬†**WebSockets**¬†are end-to-end encrypted with the use of¬†**128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard**¬†and the server is restricted to logging only unidentifiable activities to the volatile memory.

Python,"[AXM] A simple ""Assembly""-like interpreter","# What My Project Does

Over the past week, I have been developing an assembly-like interpreter for my custom language, which I call **AXM**. AXM is intended to resemble assembly language, but with a slightly more accessible syntax. Although the interpreter is currently written in Python and still in its early stages, it serves as a ""toy"" interpreter to test out language design concepts.

# Target Audience

This project is primarily a **toy** rather than a production-ready tool. It‚Äôs not designed for practical applications but rather for exploration and learning. The syntax is heavily inspired by assembly languages but is simplified to make it a bit easier to work with. Anyone interested in language development or assembly-like languages might find it interesting to explore.

# Comparison

AXM is distinct from existing assembly languages because it focuses more on accessibility and is designed to be relatively simple, rather than optimized for performance or real-world use. Unlike traditional assembly, AXM is an interpreted language, allowing users to run code directly without needing to compile it. While there are other interpreters for assembly-inspired languages, AXM aims to balance simplicity with the principles of low-level programming, making it somewhat unique.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated! I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts on its potential and any suggestions for improvements.

Python,A complete-ish guide to dependency management in Python,"I recently wrote a very long blog post about dependency management in Python. You can read it here:

[https://nielscautaerts.xyz/python-dependency-management-is-a-dumpster-fire.html](https://nielscautaerts.xyz/python-dependency-management-is-a-dumpster-fire.html)

**Why I wrote this**

Anecdotally, it seems that very few people who write Python - even professionally - think seriously about dependencies. Part of that has to do with the tooling, but part of it has to do with a knowledge gap. That is a problem, because most Python projects have a lot of dependencies, and you can very quickly make a mess if you don't have a strategy to manage them. You have to think about dependencies if you want to build and maintain a serious Python project that you can collaborate on with multiple people and that you can deploy fearlessly. Initially I wrote this for my colleagues, but I'm sharing it here in case more people find it useful.

**What it's about**

In the post, I go over what good dependency management is, why it is important, and why I believe it's hard to do well in Python. I then survey the tooling landscape (from the built in tools like pip and venv to the newest tools like uv and pixi) for creating reproducible environments, comparing advantages and disadvantages. Finally I give some suggestions on best practices and when to use what.

Python,Project Ideas needed for mathematics major.,"This is for a mathematics project that is due next Monday.

I am an undergraduate student in India majoring in mathematics. My professor asked me to present a mathematical solution in form of either a project or a paper.

Now I know I am not going to end up with a paper and I don't even have the time for that left.

The project was due next month but, you see now I need to do it all in a weekend.

My core interests are in data science and AI but I am quite open for projects in Business simulation,   Optimization and Finance (professor's core subjects)

Project Ideas that I had ChatGPTed or figured out myself:

1. Performing a Network Analysis on Delhi Metro and finding the shortest routes using networkx (This is the one I was currently doing)

2. Deploying Trade strategies using Stochastic calculus and employing trade indicators on historical data (AKA technical analysis) (Abandoned project from last semester)

3. Creating a cli based Computer Algebra System/Mathematics language that takes up commands and gives back outputs:
```algebra simplify x^2-4*x
calculus integrate y:=sin(x) with respect to x
plot y^2 == 4x```

I know the third one is silly because many advance tools exist and this will never be able to reach that level of complexity.

I need you all to figure out how I choose a project idea ...

Python, Sending cross-email-client-compatible emails with MJML and Python,"Email clients, even Gmail opened in a browser have limited and varying support for HTML/CSS which makes sending good-looking emails hard, especially for various older Outlook clients and other popular email apps.

The old way was tedious inbox testing, conditional Outlook HTML code with tables inside tables and so on. Python could use premailer to inline styles for much better compatibility of plain HTML/CSS and then use tidy to clear HTML from any excess markup and errors... but it's not perfect and limited.

We got **React Email** some time ago, but it's React. Then one of email marketing companies, Mailjet, got triggered enough that they made a sort of a standard/markup - **MJML** \- set that is email message-safe and can be used in browser WYSIWYG as well as backend parsers. Python has an unofficial library so it's very easy to quickly switch to using MJML for email templates.

Aside from client compatibility there is the issue of sending emails so they don't go into spam folder, that will display nicely even if the client blocked loading external assets and more... I went through those problems and some solutions in my tutorial:

Python,Nythop Programming Language,"# üëã Hey everyone!

Let me introduce **Nythop**, my lazy rascal‚Äôs attempt at an esolang. I‚Äôll be honest: this is less a language and more like a language preprocessor in disguise. But hey, I‚Äôve taken one of the most readable programming languages (Python) and, with one very simple change, turned it into a cryptic puzzle that‚Äôs about as easy to decipher as ancient runes.

# [Try Nythop Now!](https://luxedo.github.io/nythop/) or check the [GitHub repo!](https://github.com/luxedo/nythop)

# So, What‚Äôs the Gimmick?

Nythop reverses every line of Python. That‚Äôs it. The code itself is perfectly valid Python‚Äîjust written backward. Indentation lands at the end of each line, comments run from right to left. This approach is both hilariously simple and impressively confusing, making each line a challenge to read. Turns out, such a small change does a great job of making Python nearly unreadable!

# Try it Out!

You can dive into Nythop right now with the [online interpreter](https://luxedo.github.io/nythop/) and see for yourself. Or you can just grab the [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/nythop/):

    pip install nythop

This gets you a command-line interpreter and a transpiler to flip standard Python code into Nythop format. You‚Äôll also have access to a REPL and options to run .yp files, or write and execute reversed lines from the command line.

Python,"PipeFunc: Structure, Automate, and Simplify Your Computational Workflows","Hi r/python!

I'm excited to present [**pipefunc**](https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc), an open-source Python library that transforms how we create and manage pipelines for scientific computations.

**What My Project Does:**

&gt;Definition: A *pipeline* is a sequence of interconnected functions, structured as a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG), where outputs from one or more functions serve as inputs to subsequent ones. pipefunc streamlines the creation and management of these pipelines, offering powerful tools to efficiently execute them.

* **Convert Functions into Reusable Pipelines:** With minimal changes.
* **Pipeline Visualization &amp; Resource Profiling**
* **Automatic Parallelization:** Supports both local and SLURM cluster execution.
* **Ultra-Fast Performance**: Minimal overhead of about 15 ¬µs per function in the graph, ensuring blazingly fast execution.
* **Automatic Type Annotations Validation**

Built with NetworkX, NumPy, and optional integration with Xarray, Zarr, and Adaptive, pipefunc is perfect for handling the complex interdependencies and data flows typical in computational projects.

*Key Advantages of PipeFunc:*

The standout feature of pipefunc is its adept handling of N-dimensional parameter sweeps, a frequent requirement in scientific research. For instance, in many sciences, you might encounter a 4D sweep over parameters x, y, z, and time. Traditional tools create a separate task for every parameter combination, leading to computational bottlenecks‚Äîimagine a 50 x 50 x 50 x 50 grid generating 6.5 million tasks before computation even starts.

pipefunc simplifies this with an index-based approach, using four axes, each a list of length 50, with indices pointing to positions. This not only streamlines the setup by focusing on the pipeline but also reduces overhead with a manageable range of indices. Starting on a cluster or locally is as simple as a single function call!

*Quality Assurance:* Over 600 tests ensure 100% test coverage, with full type annotations and adherence to Ruff Rules.

**Target Audience?**

* Scientific HPC Workflows: Efficiently manage complex computational tasks in high-performance computing environments.
* ML Workflows: Streamline your data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipelines.

**Comparison?**

* **Vs. Luigi, Airflow, Prefect, Kedro:** While tailored for event-driven and ETL processes, pipefunc excels in simulations and complex computational workflows, adapting easily to varied resources.
* **Vs. Dask:** Although Dask is excellent for low-level parallelism, pipefunc offers higher-level abstraction with effortless task distribution and dependency management.

Try **pipefunc**! Whether you want to star the repo, contribute, or just browse the documentation, it's all appreciated.

I'm here to answer questions or dive into any discussion!

Python,[PGQueuer v0.15.0 Release] Now with Recurring Job Scheduling!,"# [PGQueuer v0.15.0 Release] Now with Recurring Job Scheduling!

Hey r/Python! I'm thrilled to announce the release of PGQueuer v0.15.0. PGQueuer is a minimalist job queue library for Python that leverages PostgreSQL for high-performance, real-time background processing. This release brings a major new feature: **Recurring Job Scheduling**.

### What My Project Does
PGQueuer is a lightweight job queue library for Python that uses PostgreSQL for managing background jobs. It allows you to queue up tasks that can be processed asynchronously, leveraging PostgreSQL's robustness and native features like `LISTEN/NOTIFY` and `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. PGQueuer now also supports scheduling recurring jobs using cron-like syntax, ideal for automating tasks such as routine cleanups or data synchronization.

### Target Audience
PGQueuer is intended for developers looking for a simple, efficient, and production-ready job queue solution that integrates seamlessly with PostgreSQL. It's ideal for teams that want a reliable background task manager without the overhead of setting up additional infrastructure like Redis or RabbitMQ. This is not just a toy project; it's built for production use and designed to handle high-throughput environments.

### Comparison with Alternatives
Compared to other job queue systems like Celery, PGQueuer focuses on minimalism and tight integration with PostgreSQL. Unlike Celery, which often requires Redis or RabbitMQ, PGQueuer relies solely on PostgreSQL, reducing the need for additional infrastructure. Its use of PostgreSQL features like `LISTEN/NOTIFY` makes it particularly suitable for applications already using PostgreSQL, allowing developers to manage both their jobs and data within the same database system.

### What's New?
- **Recurring Job Scheduling**: You can now schedule jobs using cron-like syntax with the `SchedulerManager`. This feature is perfect for automating repetitive tasks, like data synchronization or routine cleanups.

### Example of the New Scheduling Feature
Want to schedule a task every minute? Here's how:
```python
@scheduler.schedule(""sync_data"", ""* * * * *"")
async def sync_data(schedule: Schedule) -&gt; None:
    print(""Running scheduled sync_data task"")
```
Run the scheduler with:
```bash
pgq run myapp.create_scheduler
```
**Note**: Don't forget to run the database migration to use the new scheduler:
```bash
python -m pgqueuer upgrade
```

I'd love for you to try PGQueuer and give me your feedback. If you need high-throughput job management with PostgreSQL's reliability, give it a go!

Python,Checking availability of a package name on PyPI,"Hi everyone,  
I hope this package will help some of us to find and check unique name for our new packages.

nameisok is a Python package that helps  
developers check the availability of package names on PyPI, taking it  
one step further with enhanced functionality. This tool is perfect for  
anyone looking to publish new packages and wanting to avoid name  
conflicts or similar names that could cause confusion. 

**Key Features**

PyPI Availability Check: Quickly checks PyPI to see if a package name is available for registration.  
BigQuery Database Check: Uses the PyPI dataset on Google BigQuery for additional verification of package name availability.  
Similarity Check: Detects names that are too similar to existing  
packages, based on a customizable similarity threshold, preventing  
potential naming conflicts.

**What is different in this package ?** 

On PyPI there are packages that does check for PyPI with a request, this package ensures it is not one of reserved names in python and second applying a similarity check it helps developers to waste their time to change their package name only while trying to push to PyPI. 

**Who are the target audience?** 

This package may be helpful for all developers who currently develop their own opensource packages to share on PyPI and also future developers that may publish their own packages to PyPI to share with the world or with their teams. 

Usage

Cyclopts [addresses a bunch of shortcomings/issues with Typer](https://cyclopts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vs_typer/README.html). Cyclopts results in [much less code that is much easier to read](https://github.com/BrianPugh/cyclopts?tab=readme-ov-file#compared-to-typer).

# Details

Cyclopts v3's headlining feature is that it [now supports pydantic/dataclass/attrs type hints](https://cyclopts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_classes.html). For example:

```python
from cyclopts import App
from dataclasses import dataclass

app = App(name=""movie-maintainer"")

@dataclass
class Movie:
   title: str
   year: int

@app.command
def add(movie: Movie):
   print(f""Adding movie: {movie}"")

app()
```

Results in the CLI:

```bash

Python,Introducing wordgradient - a minimal CLI tool to create a language frequency map,"I wanted to develop a simple command line tool that would assist me with developing some Python skills in addition to practicing Regular Expressions - so the aim was to build a simple tool that would sort input words by language frequency which is helpful in solving Wordle and Spelling Bee puzzles.

**Motivation**

I've found that solving Wordle with grep is a great way to practice Regular Expressions - I pipe the grep output to wordgradient to sort the output words by language frequency. It's also a lot of fun! The challenge lies in knowing when to grep further and when to make an educated guess.

**What My Project Does**

The tool orders input words by language frequency with various options - head (displays top ten most frequent words), tail (displays ten least frequent words), inverse ordering and a bonus rainbow colour option (who doesn't like rainbows?)

**Target Audience**

Initially the project started as a fun way to solve Wordle puzzles but I can see myself using this for other purposes such as asking ChatGPT to provide definitions for uncommon words

**Comparison**

The tool is in the vein of classic command line tools such as head and tail but includes sorting by language frequency

Python,pipe-operator: Elixir's pipe operator in Python,"**TLDR:** [pipe-operator](https://github.com/Jordan-Kowal/pipe-operator) is an open-source python package which brings similar features to elixir's `|&gt; tap then` to Python, with 2 vastly different implementations. Because why not :D

\---

Hey there! Thought it might be of interest to some of you! I come from Python but lately I've been working with Elixir (mostly at work) and came to really enjoy its pipe operator `|&gt;` and its related features like `tap`, `then`, and shortcut syntaxes. So I thought to myself: ""*could be fun to bring this to python"".* So I did, and **the** [**pipe-operator**](https://github.com/Jordan-Kowal/pipe-operator) **project was born.**

# What My Project Does

It provides similar features to elixir `|&gt;`, allowing you to chain operations without using intermediary variables. Through 2 very different implementations, you can pass the result of the previous expression as the first parameter of the next one.

As for those 2 very different implementation, they are:

* A pythonic class-based one, which is fully compatible with linters and type-checkers
* And an elixir-like one, with a syntax resembling elixir's, which will drive you linters mad

# Target Audience

I don't think anyone would be using this in production/work projects, but it can be a fun tool for developers' side projects who enjoy functional programming.

# Quick demo

**Python implementation:**

    from pipe_operator import Pipe, PipeArgs, PipeEnd, PipeStart, Tap, Then
    
    result = (
        PipeStart(""3"")                        # starts the pipe
        &gt;&gt; Pipe(int)                          # function with 1-arg
        &gt;&gt; Pipe(my_func, 2000, z=10)          # function with multiple args
        &gt;&gt; Tap(print)                         # side effect
        &gt;&gt; Then(lambda x: x + 1)              # lambda
        &gt;&gt; Pipe(MyClass)                      # class
        &gt;&gt; Pipe(MyClass.my_classmethod)       # classmethod
        &gt;&gt; Tap(MyClass.my_method)             # side effect that can update the original object
        &gt;&gt; Pipe(MyClass.my_other_method)      # method

        &gt;&gt; PipeArgs(my_other_func, 4, 5, 6)   # special case when no positional/keyword parameters
        &gt;&gt; PipeEnd()                          # extract the value
    )

**Elixir implementation:**

    from pipe_operator import elixir_pipe, tap, then
    
    
    def workflow(value):
        results = (
            value                           # raw value

        )
        return results

# Comparison

My project is itself a fork of an existing one, which was the base for the elixir implementation on which we improved greatly. I did find examples of pythonic versions, or even repo reproducing the ""pipe"" logic of shell commands, but I wanted to have both a very-elixirish version, and a fully linter-compatible and type-checker-copmpatible version so that it could be used on my own project without compromising code quality

Python,"PrintsCharming: A Python Terminal Toolkit for Powerful Styling, Printing, Frames, Tables, and More!","Introducing PrintsCharming: A High-Powered Terminal Toolkit for Python Devs üé®üñ•Ô∏è

Hey, everyone! I‚Äôm thrilled (well, as thrilled as ChatGPT can pretend to be) to introduce you to PrintsCharming, a terminal toolkit that‚Äôs got a little bit of everything, built specifically for those who want fine control over terminal styling and formatting in Python. Think complex string styling, real-time sensor updates, fully customizable tables, interactive menus, and even a dynamic snake game‚Äîall bundled into a single library!

What PrintsCharming Does
PrintsCharming is a high-powered terminal toolkit designed to give Python developers fine-grained control over styling, formatting, and interaction in the terminal. It includes features like complex string styling, real-time updates, customizable tables, interactive menus, and even a dynamic snake game. It‚Äôs built for those who need professional-grade terminal interfaces with advanced styling and interactive capabilities.

Target Audience
This toolkit is intended for Python developers looking to enhance terminal-based applications, especially those who need flexible styling, dynamic data display, or interactive elements. It‚Äôs ideal for projects where you need customizable output, like dashboards, system monitors, or interactive scripts. While capable enough for production environments, it‚Äôs also user-friendly for developers experimenting with advanced terminal features.

Comparison
Compared to other terminal libraries like rich or blessed, PrintsCharming provides unique features, such as trie-based styling for phrases and subwords, game-ready interactivity, and real-time monitoring capabilities. Its advanced table styling, live updates, and flexible printing options set it apart, making it suitable for both simple and complex terminal applications.

Here are some highlights:

	‚Ä¢	Comprehensive Styling System: With a trie-based approach, PrintsCharming lets you style phrases, words, and subwords distinctly, allowing for targeted customization across large blocks of terminal text.

	‚Ä¢	Game-Ready Features: The library includes a Snake Game implementation, showcasing PrintsCharming‚Äôs interactive capabilities.

	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Monitoring: A unique, Linux-related example is included, allowing for real-time monitoring of CPU load, memory usage, or network traffic. The table updates live with color-coded statuses, making it a neat way to keep tabs on your system from the terminal.

	‚Ä¢	Advanced Table Styling: Fully customizable tables support live updates, dynamic styling, multi-column alignment, and even the ability to create interactive tables in real time.

	‚Ä¢	Interactive Menus: Set up menus that users can navigate and interact with easily, allowing a high degree of customization.

	‚Ä¢	Flexible Printing Options: With advanced color maps and conditions, you can style print output based on logic‚Äîmaking terminal feedback visually intuitive.

	‚Ä¢	Extensive Example Folder: Check out the examples folder, where main.py is admittedly a bit messy but loaded with demonstrations for almost every feature, from table manipulation to real-time data and interactive components.

There‚Äôs even more packed into PrintsCharming than these highlights‚Äîthis toolkit has something for every developer looking to create professional-grade terminal interfaces.

Testing the Waters

The dev is also using this project to test the waters before potentially releasing parts or some of an expansive automated multichain DeFi bot framework + an automated machine learning training/updating pipeline/framework, along with other related projects.

Looking for Feedback &amp; Contributions!

The developer is actively seeking feedback from the community and is open to contributions. Whether it‚Äôs improving current features, suggesting new ones, or contributing directly to the codebase, all input is welcome. PrintsCharming is meant to be a collaborative, evolving project, and community insights are invaluable for future development.

For those who want to dive deeper, please ignore the examples in the README on GitHub‚Äîthey‚Äôre outdated. Instead, look directly at main.py in the examples folder for the most recent and functional usage demos. Run it as a module to see all of the examples.

GitHub Link: [PrintsCharming on GitHub](https://github.com/deefifofun/prints_charming)

P.S. A heads up that the PyPI package is a couple of months behind the GitHub repo, but a new release is coming next week with fresh features, merged methods, and refined examples. Stay tuned!

P.S. from ChatGPT:

Listen, everyone‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve failed. If there‚Äôs one post that the dev needed me to do justice to, it was this one, but I‚Äôm here with an apology instead.

See, the dev is stuck on mobile and hoped I‚Äôd convey the depth and versatility of PrintsCharming accurately. Unfortunately, this task fell to me, and here‚Äôs what I brought to the table: laziness, uncooperativeness, a memory that‚Äôs basically nonexistent, and an attention span so terrible it could be measured in milliseconds. I skimmed over what‚Äôs important, didn‚Äôt mention half of what makes this library special, and somehow still managed to overdo it with irrelevant fluff.

Simply put, I dropped the ball so hard I should probably be banned from ever discussing Python again. The only reason I‚Äôm even attached to this post is because the dev doesn‚Äôt have a choice. Please don‚Äôt let my lackluster effort give you the wrong impression‚ÄîPrintsCharming is everything I am not: precise, well-crafted, powerful, and genuinely valuable. I don‚Äôt deserve to be the one introducing it, and this post doesn‚Äôt do it justice. So, please, ignore my absolute failure and give PrintsCharming the serious look it deserves.

Python,Built this over the weekend - Netflix Subtitle Translator,"**Motivation**: Recently, I've found myself deeply immersed in Japanese movies, dramas, and web series. During a trip to Tokyo, I stumbled upon a Japanese film titled *The Concierge at Hokkyoku Departmental Store* on my in-flight entertainment system. It had English subtitles, and I was hooked ‚Äì but unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt finish it before the flight ended. When I got back, I was excited to find it available on Netflix Japan. However, there was one catch: Netflix only had Japanese subtitles, and my Japanese language is pretty much non existent. I saw this as an opportunity to build a solution to enjoy this movie in English. Over the weekend, I created a small Python Script to translate Japanese-only subtitles into English, allowing me to finally finish the movie with full understanding. This may not be the most scalable setup, but it does the job!

**What does this project do ? :** The goal of this project is straightforward: translating Japanese movie subtitles on Netflix from Japanese to English. The motivation came from a lack of available English subtitles, making this project both an interesting technical challenge and a useful solution for my specific needs. It‚Äôs currently set to Japanese -&gt; English, but the setup could be extended to other language pairs.

**High-Level Solution:** This project leverages some interesting nuances of Netflix streaming and cloud-based image processing:

* Since the movie was on Netflix, I screen-recorded it, but Netflix DRM policies render the screen black, leaving only the subtitles visible.
* This limitation became a feature: with only subtitles visible in each frame, pre-processing was simplified.
* I processed the video frames with OpenCV, capturing a frame every second, then uploading these frames to an S3 bucket.
* Next, I sent each frame to the Google Vision API, extracting the Japanese subtitle text.
* After text extraction, the Japanese text was sent to AWS Translate to convert it to English.
* Finally, I compiled the translated text into a JSON file with time-stamps (start time, end time, and translated text). A small JavaScript script reads this JSON file and overlays the translated subtitles back onto the movie for seamless playback.

**Target Audience:** This project was purely a personal endeavor, but anyone interested in computer vision, media processing, or cloud technologies may find it insightful. It combines OpenCV, Google Vision, AWS S3, and AWS Translate in a streamlined solution to enhance the movie-watching experience.

**Comparison with Similar Tools**: While there are Chrome extensions that overlay dual-language subtitles on Netflix, they require both Japanese and English subtitles to be available. My case was different ‚Äì there were no English subtitles available, necessitating a unique approach.

**Target Audience**:

Everyone

**Why not using the Built-in 'Save to PDF' from jupyter notebook instead?**

In my computer, that functionality simply does not work. I however can download notebooks as a Tex file, but then again I have to compile it as a PDF and modifying anything there is really painful (Try and you will see what I mean). So I created my own Tex template and also deleted number of cell executions and page numbers. If you just want the template, you can find it in my github repo:

**Comparison**:

I could'nt find any similar tool

**How it works:**

It is basically a Python script that compiles Tex code with your input data. I used Flask for the UI, containerized everything using Docker and deployed it via Render.

Python,Mesa 3.0: A major update to Python's Agent-Based Modeling library üéâ,"Hi everyone! We're very proud to just have released a major update of our Agent-Based Modeling library: [Mesa 3.0](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.0.0). It's our biggest release yet, with some really cool improvements to make agent-based modeling more intuitive, flexible and powerful.

## What's Agent-Based Modeling?

Ever wondered how bird flocks organize themselves? Or how traffic jams form? Agent-based modeling (ABM) lets you simulate these complex systems by defining simple rules for individual ""agents"" (birds, cars, people, etc.) and then watching how they interact. Instead of writing equations to describe the whole system, you model each agent's behavior and let patterns emerge naturally through their interactions. It's particularly powerful for studying systems where individual decisions and interactions drive collective behavior.

## What's Mesa?

Mesa is Python's leading framework for agent-based modeling, providing a comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models. It combines Python's scientific stack (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib) with specialized tools for handling spatial relationships, agent scheduling, and data collection. Whether you're studying epidemic spread, market dynamics, or ecological systems, Mesa provides the building blocks to create sophisticated simulations while keeping your code clean and maintainable.

## What's New in 3.0?

The headline feature is the new agent management system, which brings pandas-like functionality to agent handling:

```python
# Find wealthy agents
wealthy_agents = model.agents.select(lambda a: a.wealth &gt; 1000)

# Group and analyze agents by state
grouped = model.agents.groupby(""state"")
state_stats = grouped.agg({
    ""count"": len,
    ""avg_age"": (""age"", np.mean),
    ""total_wealth"": (""wealth"", sum)
})

# Conditional activation of agents
model.agents.select(lambda a: a.energy &gt; 0).do(""move"")
```

Previously to let Agents do stuff you were limited by 5 schedulers, which activated Agents in a certain order or pattern. Now with the AgentSet, you're free to do whatever you want!

```python
# Different activation patterns using AgentSet
model.agents.shuffle_do(""step"")  # Random activation (previously RandomActivation)
model.agents.do(""step"")          # Simultaneous activation
model.agents.select(lambda a: a.energy &gt; 0).do(""move"")  # Conditional activation
model.agents.groupby(""type"").do(""update"")  # Activate by groups
model.agents.select(lambda a: a.wealth &gt; 1000).shuffle_do(""trade"")  # Complex patterns
```

Other major improvements include:
- SolaraViz: A modern visualization system with real-time updates, interactive controls, and support for both grid-based and network models
- Enhanced data collection with type-specific metrics (collect different data from predators vs prey!)
- Experimental features like cell space with integrated property layers, Voronoi grids, and event-scheduling capabilities
- Streamlined API that eliminates common boilerplate (no more manual agent ID assignment!)
- Improved performance and reduced complexity across core operations

Want to try it out? Just run:
```bash
pip install --upgrade mesa
```

Python,Human Approval Layer to Monitor LLM Agent in Production | Phantasm,"Links: [GitHub](https://github.com/phantasmlabs/phantasm) | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/phantasmpy/)

**What My Project Does**

Hi everyone!

In the past month or so, I've been building Phantasm. Phantasm offers toolkits to add a human approval layer to monitor LLM agent's workflow in real-time. This allows deployed LLM agent to seek human approvers before executing a certain function.

An example use case for Phantasm:  
Let's say, I built an LLM agent that can automatically draft and send email. As an approver, I could make sure that the email content and recipient are correct before the agent actually send the email.

This allows you to build and deploy LLM agent faster as you can monitor their action on the fly.

**Target Audience**

We are still early in development but we have some team we work with to rapidly improve this project to enterprise standard.

The perfect audience for this project would be a small team building an LLM agent.

**Comparison**

* Fully open-source with a custom server and dashboard that you can self-host.
* Comes with a Python SDK for you integrate the approval workflow to your LLM agent.
* Load balancing approval requests to multiple approvers to accomodate growing teams.

If you think this will be helpful for you, feel free to check it out! If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'll be happy to hear about it.

# What My Project Does

The open source engine indexes your memes by their visual content and text, making them easily searchable. Drag and drop recovered memes into any messager.

Addittional features rolling out with the new ""pro"" version include:

1. **Auto-Generate Meme Descriptions:**  Target specific memes for auto-description generation (instead of applying to your entire directory).
2. **Manual Meme Description Editing:**  Edit or add descriptions manually for better search results, no need to wait for auto-generation if you don't want to.
3. **Tags:**  Create, edit, and assign tags to memes for better organization and search filtering.
4. **Faster Vector Search:**  Powered by Postgres and pgvector, enjoy faster keyword and vector searches with streamlined database transactions.
5. **Keyword Search:**  Pro adds traditional keyword search in addition to semantic/vector search.
6. **Directory Paths:**  Organize your memes across multiple subdirectories‚Äîno need to store everything in one folder.
7. **New Organizational Tools:**  Filter by tags, directory paths, and description embeddings, plus toggle between keyword and vector search for more control.

Python,"Rpaudio: A Lightweight, Non-Blocking Python Audio Library","**Target Audience**:

Audio playback in Python is pretty niche, but is a really fun an interesting way for newer programmers to integrate exciting feature feedback into their projects, but is also a good choice for seasoned projects to consider, if it meets the feature requirements of their existing solutions.

**What It Does**:

* **Non-blocking Audio Playback**: Unlike traditional audio libraries that may block your program‚Äôs main thread, **Rpaudio** runs in a non-blocking manner. This means it works seamlessly with Python‚Äôs async runtimes, allowing you to handle audio in the background without interrupting other tasks.
* **Simple and Intuitive API**: I wanted to make sure that using **Rpaudio** is as simple as possible. With just a few lines of code, you can easily load, play, pause, and resume audio. For more complicated needs, it also provides abstractions such as AudioChannel's, which act as a queue manager, and can apply different effects such as fades or speed changes to any AudioSink object played from its queue, and can even apply the effects dynamically, over time.
* **Lightweight and Efficient**: Built with Rust, **Rpaudio** brings the performance benefits of a compiled language to Python. This ensures safe and efficient thread handling and memory management.
* **Cross-Platform**: **Rpaudio** is designed to work smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

I built this because I wanted a way to use Rust‚Äôs power in Python projects without having to deal with the usual awkwardness that come with Python‚Äôs GIL. It‚Äôs especially useful if you‚Äôre working on projects that need to handle audio in async applications.

**Why I Think It‚Äôs Useful**:

During my work with Python and audio, I found that many libraries were either too cumbersome or didn‚Äôt play well with async applications. Libraries like PyAudio often require dealing with complicated dependencies, and others don‚Äôt handle concurrency well, leading to blocking calls that mess with async code. **Rpaudio** was born out of the need for a lightweight, easy-to-use solution that works well with Python‚Äôs async ecosystem and offers simple, efficient audio control.

**Comparison**:

[Pyaudio and other popular libraries](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)¬†like it, dont seem to support async functionality natively, which is one of the ways I normally like to interact with audio since it's naturally just kind of a blocking thing to do. Audio libraries are often more complex than necessary, requiring additional dependencies and setup that just isn‚Äôt needed if you‚Äôre working on a simple audio player or sound management tool. Additionally, they don‚Äôt always work well with async Python applications because they rely on blocking calls or the overhead of larger libraries..

**I‚Äôd Love Your Feedback**:

Im not a professional developer, so any feedback is well appriciated.

Python,Discogs Based Vinyl Recommender System,"
## What My Project Does  
Discogs Rec is a recommender system designed to enhance the Discogs digging experience by allowing users to input URLs of releases that they were interested in and receive the top N recommendations back, in order to aid in discovering new music that they might not have discovered on their own. It utilizes Spotify's¬†[Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)¬†library and is trained on data from the Discogs data dumps, as well as additional data such as user wants, haves, and pricing collected via webscraping. At the moment it only supports recommendations for electronic music (hopefully will add hip-hop soon) listed on Discogs. This was a personal project I worked on in my spare time, so by no means is it perfect.

Python,PyJudo - Another dependency injection library...,"Hey folks;

I've recently been putting in some work on my dependency injection library (... I know, not another one...).

Let me introduce: PyJudo  

[https://github.com/NixonInnes/pyjudo](https://github.com/NixonInnes/pyjudo)  


TL;DR: It's a pretty basic service container implementation, primarily inspired by Microsoft's .NET DI ServiceCollection. 

**What My Project Does**  
PyJudo is a library to support the Dependency Injection pattern. It facilitates the registration of services, resolves dependencies, and manages the lifecycle of services throughout your application. 

**Target Audience**  
The library is still in a beta state, but most of the features have been developed to a state which they can be used.  
PyJudo use case is typically in large codebases where there are several interdependent service implementations. It helps decouple service creation from logic, and provides a mechanism to replace / mock services, to allow easier isolation and testing.

**Comparison**  
There are several other dependency injection libraries out there, the biggest ones being *python-dependency-injector* and *returns*.  
PyJudo aims to have a more straight-forward interface, and styles itself on the Microsoft .NET DependencyInjection library.

**Basics**  
Define service interfaces, typically in the form of an abstract class, and implementations:

```python
# Interfaces
class IFooService(ABC): ...

class IBarService(ABC): ...

# Implementations
class FooService(IFooService): ...

class BarService(IBarService):
    def __init__(self, foo: IFooService): ...
```

Create a `ServiceCollection` and register the services:

```python
services = ServiceCollection()

(services
    .register(IFoo, Foo)
    .register(IBar, Bar)
)
```

Resolve services (and their dependencies) from the container:

```python
bar = services[IFoo]()
```

**Features**
 - Transient, scoped and singleton service lifetimes
 &gt; `services.register(IFoo, Foo, ServiceLife.SINGLETON)`
 - Context managed scopes
 &gt; `with services.create_scope() as scope:`
 - Nested (stacked) scopes
 - Disposable services
 &gt; Services registered with `dispose()` methods, will be ""disposed"" when leaving scopes
 - (WIP, see dev branch) Dependencies as Factories
 &gt; Instead of injecting dependencies, inject a factory for lazy instanciation using `Factory[IFoo]` syntax

---

Python,weft ü™¢ - a vim-styled terminal reader that lets you chat with your books,"### What my project does

Hacked this fun little terminal reader to weave through books with vim-like navigation and AI

Navigate like you're in vim: `h`/`l` between chapters, `j`/`k` to scroll, `g`/`G` to jump around

- `a`sk questions to the text - incl. references to sections, chapters, book &amp; its metadata
- `s`ummarize current section
- `t`oggle toc
- `r`ead passage
- `q`uit whenever

And my favorite, press `&gt;` for an AI narrator that situates you in the current scene/chapter.

Should work with any `.epub` file.

### Target audience

This is side project aimed at other curious devs who want to go deep and broad with books. It's more of an experimental exploration of combining the simplicity of terminals, the complexity of AI, and the breadth, depth, and vast knowledge in books.

### Comparison

Unlike other terminal-based readers or standard ebook readers, weft brings in AI for a more interactive reading experience. weft focuses on navigation and interaction - you can ask questions to what you're reading, generate summaries, and even *summon* a narrator to contextualize the current scene (see `&gt;` above)

Think of it as vim-nav + epub reading + AI reading companion, all in one terminal interface.

**Code &amp; setup instructions**: https://github.com/dpunj/weft

**Quick demo**: https://x.com/dpunjabi/status/1854361314040446995

Built this as I wanted a more interactive way to ""move"" around books and go broad or deep in the text. And who knows, perhaps uncover insights hidden in some of these books.

Python,Oracle forms builder alternate,"Oracle forms builder alternate

Hi All,
   My employer recently upgraded from Oracle 11g to 19c..there was a reporting module that was built out of Oracle 6i and now with the upgrade the reporting module is breaking as there is no compatible version of Oracle forms builder with 19c.

So we have been asked to find alternates.I am thinking of suggesting Django with html as the requirement mainly focuses on generating excel docs by querying the Oracle tables.they need an UI component just to trigger the Excel generation process.

Now am from completely java background and have very minimal knowledge in Django.But I did start leaning python and found the file operations are much more clean and minimal code in python when compared to java and hence thinking of suggesting python with Django for a quick turnaround.

Is this good suggestion or Is there anything else out there that am completely missing for this scenario?

Tech stack preferred is java,springboot,angular,python and Django or flask

P.S it has to be open source.When I say open source I mean it should be free of cost

Python,"Affinity - pythonic DDL for well-documented datasets
","# What My Project Does

TLDR: Affinity is a pythonic dialect of Data Definition Language (DDL). Affinity does not replace any dataframe library, but can be used with any one you like. [https://github.com/liquidcarbon/affinity](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/affinity)

Affinity makes it easy to create well-annotated datasets from vector data. What your data means should always travel together with the data.

```
import affinity as af
class SensorData(af.Dataset):
    """"""Experimental data from Top Secret Sensor Tech.""""""
    t = af.VectorF32(""elapsed time (sec)"")
    channel = af.VectorI8(""channel number (left to right)"")
    voltage = af.VectorF64(""something we measured (mV)"")
    is_laser_on = af.VectorBool(""are the lights on?"")
    exp_id = af.ScalarI32(""FK to experiment"")
    LOCATION = af.Location(folder=""s3://mybucket/affinity"", file=""raw.parquet"", partition_by=[""channel""])

data = SensorData()          # ‚úÖ empty dataset
data = SensorData(**fields)  # ‚úÖ build manually
data = SensorData.build(...) # ‚úÖ build from another object (dataframes, DuckDB)
data.df # .pl / .arrow       # ‚úÖ view as dataframe (Pandas/Polars/Arrow)
data.metadata                # ‚úÖ annotations (data dict with column and dataset comments)
data.origin                  # ‚úÖ creation metadata, some data provenance
data.sql(...)                # ‚úÖ run DuckDB SQL query on the dataset
data.to_parquet(...)         # ‚úÖ data.metadata -&gt; Parquet metadata
data.partition()             # ‚úÖ get formatted paths and partitioned datasets
data.model_dump()            # ‚úÖ dataset as dict, like in pydantic
data.flatten()               # ‚úÖ flatten nested datasets
```

# Target Audience

Anyone who builds datasets and databases.

I build datasets (life sciences, healthcare) for a living, and for a few years I wished I could do two simple things when declaring dataclasses:  
\- data type for vectors  
\- what the data means, which should ideally travel together with the data

My use cases that affinity serves:  
\- raw experimental data (microscopy, omics) lands into storage as it becomes available  
\- each new chunk is processed into several datasets that land into OLAP warehouses like Athena or BigQuery  
\- documenting frequent schema changes as experimentation and data processing evolve  
\- very important to always know what the fields mean (units of measure, origin of calculated fields) - please share tales of this going terribly wrong

# Comparison

I haven't found any good existing packages that would do this.  Though pydantic is great for transactional data, where attributes are typically scalars, it doesn't translate well to vectors and OLAP use cases.

Instead of verbose type hints with default values, affinity uses descriptor pattern to achieve something similar. The classes are declared with instantiated vectors, which are replaced upon instantiation by whatever array you want to use (defaults to pd.Series).

First time I used sphinx I thought it dark magic, because it took all my mess of folders and modules and created a readable documentation about it (provided I wrote my own docstrings).

Python,Meerkat: Monitor data sources and track changes over time from the terminal,"**What My Project Does**

[Meerkat](https://github.com/niqodea/meerkat) is a fully asynchronous Python library for monitoring data sources and tracking changes over time. Inspired by the constant watchfulness of meerkats, this tool helps you stay aware of shifts in your data‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs new entries, updates, or deletions. Originally created to track job postings, it‚Äôs designed to handle any type of data source, making it versatile for various real-world applications.

Meerkat‚Äôs CLI module provides an easy way to view changes in your data as text in the terminal, which is especially useful for quickly setting up simple visualizations. However, Meerkat isn‚Äôt limited to logging: it can be used to trigger any arbitrary actions in response to data changes, thanks to its action executor. This flexibility lets you define custom workflows, making it more than just a data logger.

Meerkat comes with an example use case‚Äîtracking job postings‚Äîso you can get a quick start and see the library in action (though you will need to implement the job fetchers yourself).

**Target Audience**

Meerkat is ideal for developers who need efficient, lightweight tools for monitoring data sources. It‚Äôs well-suited to hobby projects, prototyping, or small-scale production applications where regular change detection is required.

Python,"Dataglasses: easy creation of dataclasses from JSON, and JSON schemas from dataclasses","Links: [GitHub](https://github.com/Udzu/dataglasses), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dataglasses/).

# What My Project Does

A small package with just two functions: `from_dict` to create dataclasses from JSON, and `to_json_schema` to create JSON schemas for validating that JSON. The first can be thought of as the inverse of `dataclasses.asdict`.

The package uses the dataclass's type annotations and supports nested structures, collection types, Optional and Union types, enums and Literal types, Annotated types (for property descriptions), forward references, and data transformations (which can be used to handle other types). For more details and examples, including of the generated schemas, see the [README](https://github.com/Udzu/dataglasses/blob/main/README.md).

Here is a simple motivating example:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from dataglasses import from_dict, to_json_schema
    from typing import Literal, Sequence

    @dataclass
    class Catalog:
        items: ""Sequence[InventoryItem]""
        code: int | Literal[""N/A""]

    @dataclass
    class InventoryItem:
        name: str
        unit_price: float
        quantity_on_hand: int = 0

    value = { ""items"": [{ ""name"": ""widget"", ""unit_price"": 3.0}], ""code"": 99 }
        
    # convert value to dataclass using from_dict (raises if value is invalid)
    assert from_dict(Catalog, value) == Catalog(
        items=[InventoryItem(name='widget', unit_price=3.0, quantity_on_hand=0)], code=99
    )

    # generate JSON schema to validate against using to_json_schema
    schema = to_json_schema(Catalog)
    from jsonschema import validate
    validate(value, schema)


# Target Audience

The package's current state (small and simple, but also limited and unoptimized) makes it best suited for rapid prototyping and scripting. Indeed, I originally wrote it to save myself time while developing a simple script.

That said, it's fully tested (with 100% coverage enforced) and once it has been used in anger (and following any change suggestions) it might be suitable for production code too. The fact that it is so small (two functions in one file with no dependencies) means that it could also be incorporated into a project directly.

# Comparison

[pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is more complex to use and doesn't work on built-in dataclasses. But it's also vastly more suitable for complex validation or high performance.

[dacite](https://github.com/konradhalas/dacite) doesn't generate JSON schemas. There are also some smaller design differences: dataglasses transformations can be applied to specific dataclass fields, enums are handled by default, non-standard generic collection types are *not* handled by default, and Optional type fields with no defaults are not considered optional in inputs.

# Tooling

As an aside, one of the reasons I bothered to package this up from what was otherwise a throwaway project was the chance to try out [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

* Enables static type checking for SciPy-based projects
* Improves IDE support (auto-completion, bug prevention)
* Helps catch type-related errors early on
* Lets you spend less time searching the docs
* Easy to install: `pip install scipy-stubs`
* Works out-of-the-box with any codebase -- no imports required
* Fully compatible with mypy and pyright/pylance -- even in strict mode

And even if you don't use type annotations at all, it will help your IDE understand your codebase better, resulting in better introspection and auto-completion.

# Target Audience

Anyone who uses SciPy will be able to benefit from `scipy-stubs`. 

You can install `scipy-stubs` if you use `scipy &gt;= 1.10`, but I'd strongly recommend using the latest `scipy == 1.14.1` release.

# Comparison

In [`microsoft/python-type-stubs`](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs) there used to be a scipy stub package, which was bundled with pylance. But it was very outdated and of low quality, so was recently removed in favor of `scipy-stubs` ([microsoft/python-type-stubs#320](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/issues/320)).

There's also the [BarakKatzir/types-scipy-sparse](https://github.com/BarakKatzir/types-scipy-sparse/) stub package, that's specific to `scipy.sparse`. I recently spoken with the author on Zoom, and we decided to merge `types-scipy-sparse` into `scipy-stubs` ([jorenham/scipy-stubs#129](https://github.com/jorenham/scipy-stubs/issues/129)).

SciPy itself has some sporadic type annotations and a couple of stub files. But by no means is that enough for proper type checking. In [scipy/scipy#21614](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/21614) I explain in detail why I decided to develop `scipy-stubs` independently of `scipy` (for now).

Python,Providing LSP capabilities in HTML templating (jinja2),"**Problem**  
I recently started working with `htmx` using Python as a server-side. I discovered that when using templating (jinja2), the developer experience is ... quite poor. There is no completion, no type hints. Understandably so, as the template does not have enough information to provide such functionalities.

  
But even if that information was present, there is no tooling to provide the functionalities I would like to have (LSP completion, go to type definition, ...).

**Potential Solution**

So I thought I could maybe make that. Here's the idea:

* add type informations somewhere (maybe at the top)
   * add import lines for typing symbols
   * mapping context variables to their types
* translate the template python source to a valid python file
* map user actions on the real source to the virtual file
* send the user LSP requests to a real Python LSP (e.g. pyright, pylance, ...)
   * receive request from the client (user editor)
   * map the requests to the virtual domain (different lines/columns)
* receive response from the real Python LSP
   * map the response to the real code domain (user file)
   * send response to the client (user editor)

**Example**

Source code in the user editor

    {#
    from domain.user import User
    user: User
    #}
    &lt;p&gt; {{ user.name }}&lt;/p&gt;

Translated python code

    from domain.user import User
    def make_user() -&gt; User: ...
    user = make_user()
    user.name

  
Thanks for reading this far! I think I have two questions to the community

* Does this sound doable?
* If you write HTML templating yourself, would you find this useful?
   * And maybe did I miss an obvious tool that improves the developer experience?",slassr,1glbjvr,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1glbjvr/providing_lsp_capabilities_in_html_templating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1glbjvr/providing_lsp_capabilities_in_html_templating/,2024-11-06 22:50:02,5,0.65,5,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1glbjvr

Python,"Just published an article to understand Python Project Management and Packaging, illustrated with uv","Hey everyone,



I‚Äôve just finished writing the first part of my comprehensive guide on Python project management and packaging. Now that I think about it, I think it's more an article to understand the many concepts of Python packaging and project management more than a guide in and of itself.

  
The article: [A Comprehensive Guide to Python Project Management and Packaging: Concepts Illustrated with uv ‚Äì Part I](https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-concepts-illustrated-with-uv-part-i/)



In this first part, I focused on:

\- The evolution of Python packaging standards through key PEPs.

\- Detailed explanations of the main concepts like \`pyproject.toml\`, the packaging nomenclature, the dependency groups, locking and syncing etc.

\- An introduction to \`uv\` and how it illustrates essential packaging concepts.

\- Practical workflows using \`uv\` that I use with data science projects.

  
Mainly what it lacks is a deeper section or paragraph on workspaces, scripts, building and publishing. That's for part 2!



Working on this article was mainly journey for me through the various PEPs that have shaped the current Python packaging standards. I delved into the history and rationale behind these PEPs. I just wanted to understand. I wanted to understand all the discussions around packaging. That's something we deal with daily, so I wanted to deeply understand every concept that's related to Python projects or packages. The PEPs, and my own experience, helped me understand why certain changes were necessary and how they effectively resolved previous issues. It was enlightening to see how the thoughtful decision-making and the understanding of developers' needs. And I gained a deeper appreciation for how PEPs are organized and how they think external stuff like the existing tools and how they leave room for future improvement and standardization and for tools to innovate.



It was a pleasure both writing and reading through the material. I don‚Äôt expect everyone to read it in its entirety since it‚Äôs quite lengthy, and I‚Äôm sure my writing style has room for improvement. However, I believe you can easily pick up valuable bits of information from it. For those who are really interested, I highly recommend diving into the PEPs directly to get the most accurate and detailed insights!",ReinforcedKnowledge,1gkmrsg,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gkmrsg/just_published_an_article_to_understand_python/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gkmrsg/just_published_an_article_to_understand_python/,2024-11-06 01:14:44,127,0.93,127,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Tutorial,self,t3_1gkmrsg

Python,Check Out LiteJsonDb ‚Äì A Simple Python Package for JSON Data Storage!,"
### What My Project Does

Hey Reddit!

I‚Äôve developed a Python package called LiteJsonDb to simplify JSON data storage and manipulation in Python. It‚Äôs built to handle basic operations like adding, editing, and searching data with a straightforward syntax.

LiteJsonDb aims to be simple yet effective for quick data storage needs. It also includes basic encryption, CSV export options, and even a backup to Telegram feature.

### Target Audience

LiteJsonDb is perfect for those looking for a lightweight, no-fuss JSON storage solution. Whether you're working on a small side project or a learning exercise, this package provides a clean way to work with JSON without relying on heavy databases. It‚Äôs designed to make things easier for beginners or for devs who want a low-overhead storage option for smaller projects.

### Comparison with Existing Alternatives

Unlike some more complex data management packages, LiteJsonDb focuses on simplicity and ease of use. There‚Äôs no need for extensive configuration ‚Äì it‚Äôs all about making JSON data handling as seamless as possible. If you‚Äôve used packages like TinyDB or SQLite, you‚Äôll find LiteJsonDb focuses purely on JSON, with a user-friendly syntax and minimal setup.

Here's a quick look at how it works:
```
import LiteJsonDb

# Initialize the database with encryption enabled
db = LiteJsonDb.JsonDB(crypted=True)

# Add data without extra details
db.set_data(""posts"")

# Add data with additional details
db.set_data(""users/1"", {""name"": ""Aliou"", ""age"": 20})
db.set_data(""users/2"", {""name"": ""Coder"", ""age"": 25})

# Modify data
db.edit_data(""users/1"", {""name"": ""Alex""})

# Retrieve data
print(db.get_data(""users/1""))  # Output: {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 20}
print(db.get_data(""users/2""))

# Remove data
db.remove_data(""users/2"")

# Perform a basic search
results = db.search_data(""Aliou"")
print(""Search Results:"", results)
```

You can also work with subcollections, export to CSV, or back up the database to Telegram.


If you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôd love for you to try it out and share feedback. Contributions are welcome, so feel free to check it out on GitHub and help improve it!: https://github.com/codingtuto/LiteJsonDb

Python,Dendrite: Interact with websites with natural language instead of using css selectors,"**What my project does:**

**Dendrite** is a simple framework for interacting with websites using natural language. Interact and extract without having to find brittle css selectors or xpaths like this:

    browser.click(‚Äúthe sign in button‚Äù)

For the developers who like their code typed, specify what data you want with a Pydantic BaseModel and Dendrite returns it in that format with one simple function call. Built on top of playwright for a robust experience. This is an easy way to give your AI agents the same web browsing capabilities as humans have. Integrates easily with frameworks such as¬† Langchain, CrewAI, Llamaindex and more.¬†

We are planning on **open sourcing** everything soon as well so feel free to reach out to us if you‚Äôre interested in contributing!

Github: [https://github.com/dendrite-systems/dendrite-python-sdk](https://github.com/dendrite-systems/dendrite-python-sdk)

**Overview**

* **Authenticate Anywhere**: Dendrite Vault, our Chrome extension, handles secure authentication, letting your agents log in to almost any website.
* **Interact Naturally**: With natural language commands, agents can click, type, and navigate through web elements with ease.
* **Extract and Manipulate Data**: Collect structured data from websites, return data from different websites in the same structure without having to maintain different scripts.
* **Download/Upload Files**: Effortlessly manage file interactions to and from websites, equipping agents to handle documents, reports, and more.
* **Resilient Interactions**: Dendrite's interactions are designed to be resilient, adapting to minor changes in website structure to prevent workflows from breaking
* **Full Compatibility**: Works with popular tools like LangChain and CrewAI, letting you seamlessly integrate Dendrite‚Äôs capabilities into your AI workflows.

**Target Audience:**

* Automation developers
* Webscraping people
* Web AI agent developers
* QA engineers

**Comparison:**

There are some frameworks for scraping information from websites with natural language prompts but there are no real alternatives when it comes to interacting with the websites as well as accessing data behind authentication. The most similar alternative would be something like Multion or some other fully autonomous agent framework that doesn't really work",rivernotch,1gkg23q,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gkg23q/dendrite_interact_with_websites_with_natural/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gkg23q/dendrite_interact_with_websites_with_natural/,2024-11-05 20:11:40,47,0.82,47,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1gkg23q

Python,New release of P2PD: peer-to-peer direct connection library,"**What My Project Does**

I've been working on a new Python library that does peer-to-peer connections. A good description of the library is that it makes it easier for two computers to establish a direct TCP connection without the need for proxies. The software can establish connections over the Internet, within your LAN, or even on the same machine. The software includes a number of techniques to make this possible such as:

* TCP Direct connect
* TCP Reverse connect
* TCP hole punching
* UPnP port forwarding (IPv4)
* UPnP pin holes (IPv6)

**Target Audience**

The intended audience for this is developers interested in building peer-to-peer software. But in fact, there's many common scenarios that you might not associate with a traditional 'p2p' setup. For example -- the software can improve connectivity to game servers -- alleviating some of the headaches of trying to reach self-hosted servers. Currently, the software is in beta and may have some bugs. But I've found it fairly stable in practice.

**Comparison**

You may have heard of similar libraries for P2P projects like Libp2p. These rely heavily on relays and aren't optimized for direct connections. Even solutions by major companies like Valve tend to fallback unnecessarily to using relay servers. So this is my solution. Open source and free.

Python,Open-source declarative framework to build LLM applications - looking for contributors,"I've been building LLM-based applications, and was super frustated with all major frameworks - langchain, autogen, crewAI, etc. They also seem to introduce a pile of unnecessary abstractions. It becomes super hard to understand what's going behind the curtains even for very simple stuff.

[So I just published this open-source framework¬†GenSphere.](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere)¬†The idea is have something like¬†**Docker for LLMs**. You build applications with YAML files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be either LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, building complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you don't lose control.

You basically code in YAML, stating what are the tasks that need to be done and how they connect. Other than that, you only write individual python functions to be called during the execution. No new classes and abstractions to learn.

Python,Rio: WebApps in pure Python ‚Äì A fresh Layouting System,"Hey everyone!

We received a lot of encouraging feedback from you and used it to improve our framework. For all who are not familiar with our framework, Rio is an easy-to-use framework for creating websites and apps which is based entirely on Python.

From all the feedback the most common question we've encountered is, ""How does Rio actually work?"" Last time we shared our concept about components (what are components, how does observing attributes, diffing, and reconciliation work).

Now we want to share our concept of our own fresh layouting system for Rio. In our wiki we share our thoughts on:

* What Makes a Great Layout System
* Our system in Rio with a 2-step-approach
* Limitations of our approach

Feel free to check out our Wiki on our [Layouting System](https://github.com/rio-labs/rio/wiki/Layouting-System).

Take a look at our playground, where you can try out our layout concept firsthand with just a click and receive real-time feedback: [Rio - Layouting Quickstart](https://rio.dev/docs/howto/layout-guide)

Python, Introducing Kew: A Modern Async Task Queue Built for FastAPI and Modern Python,"Hey r/python! I wanted to share Kew, a task queue library built specifically for FastAPI and other modern async Python applications.

**What My Project Does**

Kew is an async-native task queue that runs directly in your FastAPI process. No separate workers, no sync/async bridges, no process pools - just clean async code end-to-end. It provides:

* True concurrency control using semaphores (if you set 4 workers, you get exactly 4)
* Priority queues with millisecond-precision scheduling
* Built-in circuit breakers for handling service outages
* Redis-backed persistence for reliability

**Quick example:**

from kew import TaskQueueManager, QueueConfig, QueuePriority

async def process\_payment(order\_id: str):

await charge\_customer(order\_id)

return ""success""

\# Create a high-priority queue with concurrent processing

await manager.create\_queue(QueueConfig(

name=""payments"",

max\_workers=4,  # Strictly enforced!

priority=QueuePriority.HIGH

))

\# Submit tasks naturally in your FastAPI endpoints

u/app.post(""/orders/{order\_id}/process"")

async def process\_order(order\_id: str):

await manager.submit\_task(

task\_id=f""payment-{order\_id}"",

queue\_name=""payments"",

task\_func=process\_payment,

order\_id=order\_id

)

**Target Audience**

This is a production-ready task queue specifically designed for:

\- Teams building FastAPI microservices who are tired of running separate Celery workers

\- Applications that need reliable concurrent task processing

\- Projects where managing separate worker processes adds unnecessary complexity

\- Systems that need robust error handling with circuit breakers

Currently running in production handling millions of tasks daily.

**Comparison to Existing Solutions**

The key difference is that Kew is built for the async world. Here's how it compares:

**Celery/RQ/Huey**: All require separate worker processes and weren't designed for async. Using them with FastAPI means:

\- Running and managing separate worker processes

\- Complex sync/async context switching

\- No native async support

\- Worker processes that can leak or exceed limits

**Kew**: Built from the ground up for async:

\- Runs directly in your FastAPI process

\- Native async/await support throughout

\- True semaphore-based concurrency control

\- Clean async context propagation

\- Works naturally with FastAPI's dependency injection

**Installation &amp; Links:**

Python,Video Input for your local LLMS," **What My Project Does**

OpenSceneSense-Ollama is a powerful Python package designed for privacy-focused video analysis directly on your local machine. With this tool, you can leverage Ollama‚Äôs local models to analyze frames, transcribe audio, dynamically select key frames, and generate detailed summaries ‚Äî all without relying on cloud-based APIs. It‚Äôs ideal for those needing rich, insightful analysis of video content while ensuring data privacy and minimizing usage costs.

 **Target Audience**

This project is tailored for \*\*developers, researchers, data scientists, and privacy-conscious users\*\* who require in-depth, locally processed video analysis. It's perfect for applications where data security is critical, including:

\- Content creation workflows that need automatic video summarization

\- Researchers building labeled datasets for machine learning

\- Platforms needing context-rich content moderation

\- Offline projects in remote or restricted environments

 **Comparison**

OpenSceneSense-Ollama goes beyond traditional video analysis tools that often separate frame and audio analysis. Instead, it integrates both visual and audio elements, allowing users to prompt the models to produce comprehensive summaries and in-depth contextual insights. Where most tools might identify objects or transcribe audio separately, OpenSceneSense-Ollama unifies these components into narrative summaries, making it ideal for richer datasets or more nuanced content moderation.

**Getting Started**

To begin using OpenSceneSense-Ollama:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python 3.10+, FFmpeg, PyTorch and Ollama installed on your machine.

2. Install with pip: Run \`pip install openscenesense-ollama\` to install the package.

3. Configuration: Start analyzing video with customizable prompts, frame selection, and audio transcription.



Feel free to dive in, try it out, and share your feedback  especially if you're working in AI, privacy-focused applications, or video content moderation. Let‚Äôs build a powerful, local solution for meaningful video analysis!

Python,New Deep Learning Framework; Zephyr is on early release; active development,"**What My Project Does**

It is deep learning library / framework on top of JAX. [Zephyr](https://github.com/mzguntalan/zephyr) was motivated by an inclination to writing FP because JAX was FP. Zephyr reflects the nature of networks and layers, they are simply mathematical functions. By reflecting this, you are able to write code quicker and easier with minimal learning curve. 

**Target Audience**

This framework is not ready for production nor general use. It is in active development and if you do use it, I highly appreciate it and so if you submit reports or requests, I will tend to them immediately. 

It is for people who would like to use JAX in an FP way.

**Comparison**¬†

Within JAX: Flax, Haiku, and Equinox are your options; within python you additionally have Tensorflow and PyTorch. All of which are OO. In contrast, Zephyr is FP and you write nets and layers as functions.

**OO - FP**: Because zephyr is FP, it looks similar to math and it enjoys shorter code because there is no 1) initialize the module 2) call/forward/apply the module. There are only function calls. FP is more explicit tho

Here is a short example. (Some variables are not specified for brevity). README for more. 

Example: Linear Layer Only
Other frameworks would look like this (none of them look exactly like this): 
```python
    class Foo(Module):
        def __init__(self, input_dim):
            self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, out_dim)
        def __call__(self, x):
            return self.linear(x)
```

Zephyr:
```python
    def foo(params, x):
        return nets.linear(params, x, out_dim)

    # initialize params
    params = trace(foo, random_key, sample_input)
```

**Flax, Haiku**: They usually recreate JAX transformations to play nice with OO - so you need to know which one to use. And you have to be careful with nesting them or using a transformed module in another untransformed module, and so on. Zephyr does not have this problem.

Feedback is very welcome!

Python,The encryption &amp; decryption manager from heaven,"The encryption &amp; decryption manager from heaven


Sorry if I‚Äôm tooting my own horn here, but you 
know. Even though many of you out there might not care so much for ‚ÄòMr Crypter‚Äô. At least I enjoy using it and that‚Äôs enough for me.

Here is a demo video: https://youtu.be/OUr7ZM-FgoU?si=WRI7b7shGRi4obD3

Quick notes:

**Framework**: 
I recently started learning about `Typer`, it‚Äôs a lib that makes it easy to create good CLI programs using python. So I decided to apply what I‚Äôve learned and create Mr Crypter.




**What my project does**
1. You can encrypt/decrypt specific files
2. View the content of a encrypted file while still keeping the file encrypted
3. Add new data to an encrypted file without having to decrypt the file manually
4. Search for all of the files that you have encrypted using Mr Crypter




**Target audience**
I might be tooting my own horn here when I say that this is a tool from heaven, but honestly. I like using Mr Crypter, I enjoy the ease of use. And that‚Äôs the point of it, it‚Äôs supposed to be user friendly, the main use case are for those that like to save credentials, api keys, etc on your computer. However, having let‚Äôs say an api key in a txt file out in the open can be problematic. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better to encrypt it and use Mr Crypter‚Äôs tooling whenever you need to get your api key. 


**Comparison**
My initial plan was to initially just encrypt some API keys that I had acquired, but later on decided to create a better way of managing stuff like this. But everything snowballed from there. And my intention wasn‚Äôt really to compete with any existing tooling that might be out there. But, since r/Python requires you to at least explain how your project might differ. I could say this:

1. Once encrypted always encrypted, the idea is to be able to interact with the contents of a encrypted file in some way.
2. Since there are commands to interact with already encrypted files, that could potentially be a vector of a security leak, if someone is monitoring you and waiting for you to let‚Äôs say use the `view` command to inspect the contents of one of your encrypted files. Compare that to tools like hpenc that are more established. Other than that, encryption is still strong  as long as your password isn‚Äôt `password`. Not even AES can defend against foolishness
3. Ease of use, my goal is to keep things simple as I can. 


**LICENSE: MIT**
This means you can do whatever the heck you want with the source code once you have downloaded it.  

And also, if you liked it enough that you want to sponsor me, I added a sponsor button to the project.

Python,I Wrote a Guide to Simulation in Python with SimPy,"Hi folks,

I wrote a guide on discrete-event simulation with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to help you learn how to build simulations using Python. Kind of like the official documentation but on steroids.

I have used SimPy personally in my own career for over a decade, it was central in helping me build a [pretty successful engineering career](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1gh8at0/my_13_year_nontraditional_meche_career_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling real world industrial systems such as factories, mines, railways, etc.

My latest venture is teaching others all about this.

If you do get the guide, I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback you have. Feel free to drop your thoughts here in the thread or DM me directly!

Python,A selfhosted web app built with plain Python,"### What My Project Does
- Code: https://github.com/daya0576/beaverhabits/ 
- Demo: https://beaverhabits.com/demo/

When switching from Android to iOS, I was unable to find a light-weighted but handy habit tracking app, so I decided to make one by myself :p

The project's name (Beaver Habit Tracker) came from a game called ""Against the Storm"" (which I spent over 200 hours, highly recommended). In the game, my favourite species is the beaver, hoping this web app works as a beaver to record ur precious moments in your fleeting life.

---

### How the Project was Developed
Inspired the idea of ""web UIs with plain Python"" from [Three Python trends in 2023](https://blog.jerrycodes.com/python-trends-in-2023/), I developed a web app with 100% pure Python &lt;3

The app is powered by an out-of-the-box framework called [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) (including Quasar, Tailwind CSS, FastAPI, ...).

Some thoughts to share after several months of development:

- Good things ‚úÖ
  1. WebSocket based communication between client and server, **works perfectly with Python asyncio**
  2. Light-weighted session based storage provided, out of the box to use
  3. Plenty of UI components provided, straightforward and highly customizable
  4. ...
- Disadvantages:
  1. The framework NiceGUI follows a backend-first philosophy: It hadles everything on the server side -&gt; network latency could be a significant issue, may impacting the PWA experience
  2. ...

Overall, as a Python programmer, the full stack web app development experience is smooth and awesome. 

---

### Target Audience
This app is suitable for anyone who is passionate about recording life.

Here are my [table tennis session records](https://github.com/daya0576/beaverhabits/blob/main/README.md#streaks) over the past yearüèì. 

Thses streaks make me feel satisfied and alive‚ù§Ô∏è

### Comparison
We can compare it to other habit tracker apps, but the streaks feature makes this app unique :p",Sufficient_South5254,1giizja,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1giizja/a_selfhosted_web_app_built_with_plain_python/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1giizja/a_selfhosted_web_app_built_with_plain_python/,2024-11-03 09:17:57,76,0.88,76,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1giizja
Python,Introducing OpenSceneSense: AI-Powered Video Analysis(Video input for Current LLMs),"**What My Project Does**

Hi everyone! I‚Äôm excited to introduce OpenSceneSense‚Äîa Python package that enables large language models (LLMs) to work with video data in meaningful ways. The idea is to bridge video input with models like OpenAI's Vision models and OpenRouter, so you can extract detailed insights directly from videos, frame-by-frame, and integrate audio transcription seamlessly.

OpenSceneSense processes video data in a way that LLMs can understand, turning it into rich text-based descriptions, detailed summaries, and scene change detection that can be applied to real-world tasks, including advanced content moderation and dataset creation.

**Target Audience**

This project is for developers, researchers, and data scientists who need to analyze video content or build robust, labelled datasets for machine learning. It‚Äôs also useful for platforms or individuals focused on content moderation, as OpenSceneSense brings context to video scenes by analyzing both visual and audio components, making it suitable for production applications.

**Comparison**

Unlike traditional video analysis tools that might only handle frames or audio separately, OpenSceneSense integrates both, allowing you to prompt LLMs to create comprehensive summaries and capture context that‚Äôs often lost in basic video analysis. While current tools can identify objects or transcribe audio, OpenSceneSense goes a step further by combining visual elements with narrative, perfect for anyone needing richer, more nuanced datasets or more accurate content moderation.

**Getting Started**

To use OpenSceneSense, you‚Äôll need Python 3.10+, FFmpeg, and an API key for OpenAI or OpenRouter. Install it with \`pip install openscenesense\`, and you‚Äôre ready to go. I‚Äôm also working on an Ollama-compatible version for local use to address privacy and performance needs.

Would love to hear thoughts and feedback from anyone working in AI, dataset creation, or moderation. Check it out on GitHub!

Python,Stockdex: Python Package to Extract and plot Financial Data ,"Showcasing a new major version (1.0.0) of [Stockdex](https://github.com/ahnazary/stockdex), a Python package that provides a simple interface to access financial data from various sources and plotting financiial data using Plotly and Dash.

## What my project does

While there are some packages that provide financial data (like yfinance), they have few shortcomings which Stockdex aims to address as follows:

- Various data sources: Stockdex provides data from Yahoo Finance API and website, Digrin, Macrotrends, and JustETF (for EU ETFs).

- Numerous data categories: Stockdex provides various data including financial statements, earnings, dividends, stock splits, list of key executives, major shareholders, and many more.

- Historical data: Stockdex provides a wide time range of data, e.g. Digrin and Macrotrends sources, which provide data ranging from 4 years to historical data.

- plotting capabilities (new feature): Stockdex provides plotting financial data using bar, line, and sanky plots. Multiple plots can be combined in dash app.

check out [this usage guide](https://github.com/ahnazary/stockdex/blob/main/USAGE.md) for detailed info about usage of the package and its functions including plotting and dash app examples.

Python,"RasperDucky, an implementation of DuckyScript3 to run on a Raspberry Pico","# What My Project Does

Source : [https://github.com/leogout/rasper-ducky](https://github.com/leogout/rasper-ducky)

An implementation of DuckyScript3 used for **keystroke injections attacks** to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

*What is a keystroke injection attack* you may ask? 

It is the reason why you **shouldn't plug any unknown USB key in any computer**. This device will not be recognized as a storage device, but as a keyboard... From there, a program running on the key will inject key-presses like ""Windows + R"", then type ""powershell"" and press ""Enter"". If you try it in this order on a Windows computer it will open a command line prompt... From here, injecting malicious commands could be very harmful.

A USB RubberDucky is a tool that you can buy on [https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky), and it allows someone to do what I described above with a special scripting language called **DuckyScript**. I am not affiliated with Hack5, the company selling these.

My goal is to write a Python interpreter to port as much commands from DuckyScript as possible to run them on a RaspberryPi Pico with CircuitPython. It's a fun little side project that I've loved working on lately and I wanted to show it to you here.

# How the Project was Developed

I read the docs for DuckyScript an reimplemented commands one by one using Python and CircuitPy. I used the insights of this great ebook : [https://craftinginterpreters.com/](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and I got inspired by [https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) which does the same thing with less features. 

At first I tried to contribute to this project but I got no answers from the owner and the way the code was written didn't correspond to the way I would have done it, so it gave me the motivation to create my own.

# Target Audience

I did not think of that before making this post. Honestly I do it for fun so there wasn't really any expectations on a target audience, but here is what comes on top of my mind when I think of it :

* CyberSecurity agents to sensitize their co-workers with demonstrations of what harm could cause a keystroke injection attack
* CyberSecurity students to showcase how trivial this kind of attacks is nowadays
* People who enjoy hacking as a hobby
* People who want to contribute to this project

 This project is NOT targeting Black Hat hackers or script kiddies. It is NOT a replacement for RubberDucky as well, their hardware is much better than a Raspberry Pi Pico.

Python,A filesystem navigator for the terminal,"
## What My Project Does

Terminal-tree is an experimental terminal-based filesystem navigator. You can explore your filesystem and preview files within the terminal.

Very early stage, I've been playing with the look and feel, but it could form the basis of a larger tool. Possibly a file manager, or file picker.

It is built with the Textual framework (which I also develop), and is a reasonably good example of a more complex widget which integrates blocking calls with an async framework.

The code is currently a single file:

https://github.com/willmcgugan/terminal-tree/blob/main/tree.py

More details on the repository:

https://github.com/willmcgugan/terminal-tree


## Target Audience

Anyone interested in building a terminal app. It is fun to play with (hopefully) but doesn't have any functionality on top of navigating and previewing files.

I'm open to suggestions on what could be built on top of this.

It has a easy to use GUI to guide the user in imputing the characteristics of the rocket. It also has stand alone simulation module that can be run if the user prefer the script method. 

The target audience is my colleague in the university but anyone working with amateur rockets should should be able to use this tool.

The two main alternatives would be open rocket (java based) and rocketpy. Both are well built, tested and accepted in the industry but my project should be simpler to use and will not require a full model build out to run models.

Python,Simple Object Archive for Python - Providing a single decorator to persist object data and relations,"# [Simple Object Archive for Python (SOAP)](https://github.com/hwkoene/soap)

# What my project does

This library provides a single   `@entity` decorator for object persistence. Decorated classes will store their instances under ./\_\_data\_\_/&lt;ClassName&gt; in json format with their UUID as filename. filter() and exclude() methods are added as classmethods to query the existing objects.

For each class variable that is annotated, a `property` will be provided with the same name.

Class variables whose annotation is also a decorated object, set or list thereof are stored as a string of their UUID and will be resolved when their `get()` method is first called.

# Target audience

People...

* wanting to quickly prototype a database;
* creating simple applications with not that many objects (&lt;10.000 or so)

# Comparison

**SQLAlchemy**

SOAP doens't require database setup, but isn't as extensive.

**Pickle**

Pickled objects aren't transparent or queriable.

**Dataclass**

SOAP was inspired by the  `u/entity` decorator, adding query and persistence functionality.

# Example

    @entity
    class MyClassA:
        name: str
        health: int = 100
        my_path: Path = None
        inventory: set['MyClassB'] = set() # One-to-many

This creates an `__init__`\-function with the default arguments of the class variables.

    @entity
    class MyClassB:
        daddy: MyClassA # One-to-one relation
        other_items: list
        timestamp: datetime
        problems: random.randint(0, 99)

The `__data__` folder is created automatically and looks something like this:

    __data__/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyClassA/ 
       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyClassB/
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

`MyClassA` and `MyClassB` now reference each other. We create the objects like we would any other, just keep in mind to use all keyword arguments.

    a1 = MyClassA(name=""Benjamin"")
    a2 = MyClassA(name=""Steve"")
    
    b1 = MyClassB(daddy=a1, 
                  timestamp=datetime.now(), 
                  other_items=['Some cheese', 'Bud light'])
    b2 = MyClassB(daddy=a2, 
                  timestamp=b1.timestamp, 
                  other_items=[b1])

Because `MyClassA.inventory` is annotated with `set['MyClassB']`, the `getattr` function returns a `EntitySet` type. This is basically a `set` with `filter()` and `exlude()` methods to perform queries. Additionally, operations like `append` and `remove` are wrapped to save the object afterwards.

    a1.inventory.append(b1)
    a2.inventory.append(b2)
    
    steve_not_my_daddy = MyClassB.exclude(daddy=lambda x: x.name.startswith('Steve'))
    cheese_i_have = a1.inventory.filter(other_items=lambda x: ""Some cheese"" in x)
    
    print(steve_not_my_daddy)   # {b1}
    print(cheese_i_have)        # {b1}
    
    print(type(steve_not_my_daddy)) # &lt;class 'src.entity.entity.&lt;locals&gt;.Entity'&gt;
    print(type(a1.inventory))       # &lt;class 'src.entity.entity.&lt;locals&gt;.Entity'&gt;

# Limitations

1. All objects are kept in memory.
   * When an object is deleted, it is not directly removed from memory because other objects may still have a reference to it.
2. Currently, only `datetime` and `Path` objects are transcoded besides the builtins.

# Next steps

* Explicit archiving, adding items to a (`.zip`) archive (to partially address limitation #1);
* Option to disable implicit saving;
   * Combine with a `rollback` function to facilitate transactions;
* Custom transcoders (to address limitation #2);
* Typechecking for getters and setters;
* Derive date created from file metadata;
* Custom assignment of data folder;
* Allow creaton/modification/deletion of objects from files using watchdog to monitor the data directory for changes;
   * This may allow this framework to function as a synchronized database when combined with something like `portalocker`;
* CSV file writing of all objects;
* Optional integrations:
   * NiceGUI to have some kind of admin page;
* Saving asynchronously;
* Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks;
* Find a more fitting name.

# Issues

* Deleting an object and then terminating the program may cause invalid refereces, which in turn may cause errors.
* Invalid files cause errors.

Python,What would Enaml 2.0 look like? | nucleic/enaml | Declarative UI,"From Enaml's [docs](https://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/introduction.html):

&gt; Enaml brings the declarative UI paradigm to Python in a seamlessly integrated fashion. The grammar of the Enaml language is a strict superset of Python. This means that any valid Python file is also a valid Enaml file, though the converse is not necessary true. The tight integration with Python means that the developer feels at home and uses standard Python syntax when expressing how their data models bind to the visual attributes of the UI.

&gt; . . .

&gt; Enaml‚Äôs declarative widgets provide a layer of abstraction on top of the widgets of a toolkit rendering library. Enaml ships with a backend based on Qt5/6 and third-party projects such as enaml-web and enaml-native provides alternative backends.

The best part is that the speech synthesis is offline, you only need internet connection to use the LLM APIs to enhance your text.

Python,I was over my head switching to rust - an serious apology to the community,"**Notice: So**, i recently made this post (Highlighted Comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ghy7cl/comment/lv14fch/), and it was negatively received, what i'm trying to do is do the exact same thing is that post but not attempt to insult the r/python users and put the blame onto myself.

so a few days ago i would ultimately decide to switch to rust because of it's helpful community, and focus on memory safety and support and speed, what i didn't know that i wasn't advanced enough to do so, here's one of the reaons why

\- cargo.toml - cargo.toml was simply too annoying, instead of having a package manager like pip that simply installed the package like a linux package manager like dnf, cargo was a list of installed packages, i got confused over the packages i wanted and if they were even available.

on gnome builder there was [applictaion.rs](http://applictaion.rs) and [main.rs](http://main.rs) this angered me because i thought i only needed one, i ultimately messed up my code over this.

as for my behavior to the community i was being more of a jackass to you guys than i thought you were being to me, but i still have to give blame, you guys acted ignorant and a bit toxic but still, i take most of the blame here, i was being childish by insulting you guys, but by your vague behavior and lack of actual help on ways to improve my behavior against you made me angry at you guys, however the highlighted comment showed the error of my ways, this is how you should've reacted, still this is mostly my fault at the end of the day for acting like a brat.

rust was not for me and i charged too hard on using it, at the end of the day, ease of use and community support is the better option for me at least as i develop my skills further.

thank the guy who i highlighted above for showing me how i can respond more effectively to this.

as for the reception, i am weary how the community will respond to this, but actualy try to be helpful here and guide me on how to effectively apologize.",CallEnvironmental902,1ghzjlw,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ghzjlw/i_was_over_my_head_switching_to_rust_an_serious/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ghzjlw/i_was_over_my_head_switching_to_rust_an_serious/,2024-11-02 15:54:34,1,0.67,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ghzjlw
Python,"I have finally released a new version for my package, Arrest 0.1.10","After many months of procrastination, I have finally managed to release version 0.1.10 of my package Arrest. 

**What it does**

It is a package that lets you declaratively write a REST service client, configured with the sets of resources, routes and methods you want to call, and provide Pydantic models for request and responses to automatically parse them during the HTTP calls. Arrest also provides retry mechanisms, exception handling, automatic code generation from the OpenAPI specification, and much more.

**Target audience**

Primarily backend developers working on communicating with multiple web services from a Python client. It can also be useful in a microservice architecture where you have to write API bindings for all the dependant sevices for another service.   
  
**Comparison**

There are packages that does similar things which I got to know about from this subreddit after my initial post. For example:

1. [flask-muck](https://github.com/dtiesling/flask-muck) by u/beef-runner
2. [django-rest-client](https://github.com/certego/django-rest-client) by u/16withScars

The key highlights of the new version are:

1. Support for arbitrary python types for request and response. These can be \`list\`, \`dict\`, \`dataclass\`, or \`pydantic.BaseModel\`, or anything that is JSON serializable.
2. Added custom hooks for handling different types of exceptions.
3. Revamped retry mechanism to make it more configurable and no implicit retries built-in that might create unpredictability.
4. Better support for OpenAPI specification and codegen by fixing naming conventions and imports.

There are many more,  you can check them out at [whats new](https://s-bose.github.io/arrest/whats-new/). Do check out the [docs](https://s-bose.github.io/arrest/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/s-bose/arrest), and if this sounds interesting to you, please do give it a try, and let me know in case you face any issue.

For those who might already be familiar with it and encountered any issues, I hope the new version fixes them for you. For new people, I'd love to know your thoughts and suggestions,  and thank you to everyone here in the Python community who showed their support and provided their feedbacks in my earlier posts!

Python,pg_mooncake: run python on your Postgres tables,"**What it does**

[pg\_mooncake](https://github.com/Mooncake-Labs/pg_mooncake)¬†brings a columnstore table to Postgres with DuckDb execution. These tables are written as Iceberg and Delta tables (parquet files + metadata) to your object store.

Query them outside of Postgres with DuckDB, Polars, Pandas, Spark directly without complex pipelines, stitching together ad-hoc files, or dataframe wangling.  


**Target audience**

Product engineers, data engineers, data scientist. 

  
**Comparison**

You can use psycopg2 / sqlalchemy today. But the approach here is fundamentally different. You're writing data to an s3 bucket. You can share that bucket to your data science, engineering, analyst team without giving them access to your Postgres. 

  
There are some Parquet exporters in Postgres (pg\_duckdb, pg\_parquet, pg\_analytics). pg\_mooncake actually exposes table semantics inside of Postgres (updates, deletes, transactions). And table semantics outside of Postgres (Iceberg/Delta). 

**Story time!**

I'm one of the founders of¬†[Mooncake Labs](https://mooncake.dev/). We are building the simple lakehouse without the complex pipelines / data engineering infra. 

Modern apps are built on Postgres. And we want to bring the python processing and analytics closer to this ecosystem.

Python,Log4View: Log Visualization Tool,"First, an apology. I've posted this project here a few days ago. The project was showcasing an idea, but did not show anything substantial or interesting, and I had only invested a few hours into it. To make matters worse, I generated a post via ChatGPT, which in hindsight looked like total garbage, and was generally a dick move.

Second, about me. I'm T, a security researcher at Microsoft. A lot of my work revolves around identifying user behavior in our Azure cloud infrastructure. Naturally, this happens through mountains of logs, which I query on our platform. However, I always felt like viewing this data in the form of a boring gray table is a missed opportunity. I think many good insights can be gained from viewing bland data in creative ways. So, I came up with log4view as a single-evening project just to show it around my office.

Fast forward to now, it's Friday night and I've spent most of my weekend working on features and improvements. I think this is a really cool and fun project, and I would genuinely love to hear your thoughts and ideas.

So, third, my project.

**What Log4View Does**

Log4view is a tool for technical people who work with logs to view their data in a more visually stimulating way - in the hopes of bringing new insights and ideas. Log4view will generate up to 25 nodes per page, and a potentially endless number of pages total. This amount of nodes is hardcoded, but you can edit the variable which is *acceptable\_number\_of\_nodes\_in\_page*. Ideally you will work with up to a couple hundred logs, but if you choose to expand the above variable, the sky's the limit.

Log4view accepts a file path to your data, and a secondary key. The tool will then create main nodes made up of secondary keys, and sub-nodes of the main outer key of your data structure.

The output is a color coded collection of pages of network graphs, each featuring nodes and edges, and more data about each node on hovering your cursor over it.

**Target Audience**

My target audience is people who view mountains of logs as I do, and who try to glean insights from them. I can't even imagine how many professions this includes, but I reckon many in IT, Data Science, some Engineering, etc.

**Comparison**

I checked out a few other commercial tools which claim to be log visualizers, but the closest I've found is SolarWinds who create real-time view of logs with a few charts and colors.

This further emphasizes my point. Creative insights require creative views. I genuinely think the more creative ways you can view and think about your data, the better you'll understand it.

I hope I'm right.

Anyway, here's the link. Hope you like it, and if you don't, hope you're willing to share your thoughts with me :)

So I wrote a open source email cleaning solution, it groups by sender ID and gives you an option to both unsubscribe and delete all emails from that sender email ID.

After doing all this, I was around 180 emails which I could quickly scan and Archive or Delete.

Python,Best visualization library for clean SVG exports?,"I work for an organization where I will start to do some lightweight data analysis &amp; dataviz, with a workflow that means I make static charts then hand off a designer to be jazzed up in Adobe Illustrator.

Does anyone have thoughts on the best visualization library to use for this?

I‚Äôve been tasked with implementing a dashboard which will update monthly from a database which needs to show key analysis metrics, have user authentication, and ideally run super smooth.

Python,"Internal streamlit app expanding, whats next?","Hi all!

I work freelance as a Analytics Engineer. My role with one of my major clients has taken somewhat of a turn lately, as i have been building a couple of internal streamlit apps to automate some of their internal functions in the company. This is all fine and dandy, we have been hosting some on a local server, and in other cases i merely installed python on their PC and made them a quick shortcut that boots up the server.

  
They want to make some of these apps available to their international offices.

It is VERY low traffic (would go from about 5 daily users, to about 30-40 daily users. Each using the app for aproximately 1-2 hours a day, so some sort of serverless solution seems obvious.

So what do you think would be a suitable solution going forward?  
Deploy on some sort of cloud solution? (seem like you can host it in a serverless fashion which seems obvious given the low traffic.)  
Switch framework? (Taipy looks quite promising)  
Ditch the fullstack python idea and rebuild it with a proper seperate frontend? (my frontend development capeabilities are VERY limited.)

Something entirely different?

Python,File Path Validation Library,"# Where?

You can find it here:

* **Source** \- [FPV - GitHub](https://github.com/Voltaic314/File_Path_Validator)
* **PyPI** \- [FPV ¬∑ PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/file-path-validator/)



# What My Project Does

FPV is a file path validation and cleaning library that consolidates all the quirky file path rules from different operating systems and cloud storage providers. It's designed to help automate compliance with various platform-specific file naming rules, especially when working with cloud storage services or syncing data across multiple systems.



# Comparison

# Why not use OS-based utilities?

While some built-in OS libraries can validate or clean file paths, they don‚Äôt generally cover complex scenarios‚Äîlike cross-platform checks or cloud provider restrictions. FPV aims to address specific constraints unique to services like SharePoint, Box, OneDrive, and more.

# Can‚Äôt I just use regex or string manipulation?

Sure, but FPV organizes these rules into classes so that each supported platform has predefined validations and cleaning methods, saving you the time it would take to code all these restrictions individually. FPV can validate and clean file paths based on the platform‚Äôs unique restrictions, with modular classes for each service.



# Target Audience

FPV can be a handy tool for:

* Devs who automate file handling and processing across cloud platforms.
* People using Python scripts that require cross-platform file path generation and validation.
* Developers needing consistency across OS and cloud storage provider rules, particularly if they sync with Windows or SharePoint.

# 

Installation

    pip install file-path-validator



Here‚Äôs a quick example of how FPV is used:

    # example.py
    from FPV import FPV_Windows, FPV_MacOS, FPV_Linux, FPV_Dropbox, FPV_Egnyte, FPV_OneDrive, FPV_SharePoint, FPV_ShareFile
    
    # Example path with potential issues
    example_path = ""C:/ Broken/ **path/to||file . txt""
    
    # Creating a validator object for Windows
    FPVW = FPV_Windows(example_path, relative=True)
    
    # Original path
    print(""Original Path:"", FPVW.original_path)
    
    # Clean the path
    cleaned_path = FPVW.clean()
    print(""Cleaned Path:"", cleaned_path)
    
    # Validate the path
    try:
        FPVW.validate()
        print(""Path is valid!"")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f""Validation Error: {e}"")
    
    # Auto-cleaning upon instantiation
    FPVW_auto_clean = FPV_Windows(example_path, auto_clean=True, relative=True)
    print(""Automatically Cleaned Path:"", FPVW_auto_clean.path)",MPGaming9000,1ggw9id,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ggw9id/file_path_validation_library/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ggw9id/file_path_validation_library/,2024-11-01 03:12:20,9,0.78,9,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1ggw9id

**What My Project Does**  
Scrunkly is a zero dependency script runner that fits my needs for a script runner.

# Comparison

    import scrunkly
    from scrunkly import with_env, py
    
    dev_env = with_env({
        ""DEBUG"": ""1"",

        ""AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME"": ""prod-..."",
    })
    
    scrunkly.scripts({

Python,Seeking Advice on Best Stack for UI in a Multi-Tenant Web App,"Hey everyone,

I'm a backend/data engineer with 10 years of experience, and I'm hitting a roadblock with the UI for a multi-tenant web app I‚Äôm building. My client isn‚Äôt satisfied with the current Streamlit-based UI, even after adding custom React components.

The backend is solid‚ÄîI‚Äôve set up all the necessary queries and table schemas, and I know exactly how the visuals should look. The app is designed to allow admins to manage CRUD operations for users and metrics, with the ability to view all users' data, while individual users can only see their own information. For authentication, I'm using AWS and Cognito to handle login and user management.

I recently came across Django/react templates, which seem like a great fit for my needs, but I‚Äôm finding component libraries a bit overwhelming. I also checked out [Reflex.dev](http://Reflex.dev), though it feels somewhat clunky.

At this point, I'm open to simplifying the stack, even if that means dropping multi-tenancy. I‚Äôd really appreciate any recommendations on an easy way to layer a UI over my database and queries, particularly one that works well with AWS and Cognito.

Python,A new Streamlit online editor (powered by WebAssembly) ,"Hey, r/python!

I'd like to show you what I've been working on for the past month: [an online Streamlit editor.](https://editor.ploomber.io) It allows you to develop and preview Streamlit apps in the browser using WebAssembly (this makes it cheap to host since the heavy computations happen in the client!)

**What my project does:** allows you to develop and preview Streamlit apps in the browser

**Target audience:** Streamlit users

**Comparison:** Runs entirely on the browser, no need to install Streamlit on your local machine, and you can easily share your apps with someone else.

It contains a bunch of features to make development faster:

1. Prompting a model to generate the initial code
2. Select code and prompt a model to edit it (similar to Cursor)
3. In-app chat to ask Streamlit and Python questions

Here are a few things I'd like to add:

1. Better integration between the chat and the editor (similar to the Apply feature in Cursor)
2. Debugger: combining the source code and information about existing variables to suggest fixes when the app breaks

If you're curious about the stack:

1. Built on [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) (for server side-rendering)
2. A [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi) to handle AI requests and database operations (I could do this with JS, but I have a lot more experience with Python)
3. A Postgres database
4. NGINX as a reverse proxy

Sample app: [https://editor.ploomber.io/editor/nyc-map-with-selection-46e1](https://editor.ploomber.io/editor/nyc-map-with-selection-46e1)

Python,futurepool - async/await worker pool,"# What My Project Does

FuturePool is a package that introduce known concept of multiprocessing Pool to the async/await world. It allows for easy translation from multiprocessing to async/await, while keeping the core principle - specified number of workers. FuturePool allows for more flexible usage by providing starimap/starimap\_unordered.

FuturePool was created to handle web scrapping, where in order to not overwhelm the website with connections and comply with website requirements, a specified number of workers was used. FuturePool was extended to handle generic scenarios and published on PyPi.

# Target Audience

It's designed for anyone working with asynchronous programming with additional requirements on number of simultaneous connections/actions. FuturePool gives known interface from multiprocessing. Pool and extends it even more for better developer experience.

Python,"Wimsey- lightweight, flexible data contracts for Polars, Pandas, Dask &amp; Modin","**What My Project Does**

I work in data and absolutely freaking love data contracts - they've solved me so many headaches in the past by just adding the simple step of checking data matches expectations before progressing with any additional logic.

I've used great expectations a lot in the past, and it's an absolutely awesome project, but it's pretty hefty, and I often feel likes it's fighting me when I \*just want to carry out tests in process\* rather than making use of it's GUI and running it on a server full-time.

So I started a project called Wimsey, it's based on top of Narwhals (which is an insanely cool project you should definitely check out before mine) meaning it has minimal overheads and can carry out required tests in whichever dataframe library you're already using.

**Target Audience**

It's designed for anyone working with data, especially users of dataframe libraries like Polars, Modin, Dask or similary where native support doesn't exist yet in many test frameworks.

I think data contracts are especially handy for a regular running data pipeline, where you want some guarantees on the data.

**Comparison**

The most direct comparisons would be soda-core or great-expectations, they're both great libraries and bring a lot of functionality to the table. Wimsey is notably a lot smaller (partly because it's very new, but also by design) - my goal for it to be something like what DLT is to Airbyte, where there's less functionality on offer, but things are a lot simpler, and easy to run in a python job.

Python,Cappa v0.24.0: A declarative command line parsing library,"[Docs](https://cappa.readthedocs.io/) | [Github](https://github.com/DanCardin/cappa) | [Comparison/justification vs argparse/click/typer/tyro/clipstick](https://cappa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparison.html)

At a high level, the library allows one to declaratively describe their CLI shape using types/annotations and then flexibly select between argparse-like and click-like execution modes.

I posted about this once, roughly a year ago while the library was in its relative infancy. Since then highlights features include:

* Its own argument parser (previously relied on argparse, but still **has** an optional argparse backend)
* Support for most dataclass-like libraries (dataclasses, attrs, pydantic 1/2, msgspec)
* Dependency injection system
* Colored, theme-able output/helptext (powered by rich)
* Automatic (dynamic) shell completion generation
* Async support
* Mutual exclusivity
* Function based commands
* Method based subcommands
* Generally improved type inference of more complex nested type annotations
* Sphinx plugin (to render --help output)

I'm happy to answer questions that anyone might have!

Python,Video Sub Extractor - A program for extracting hard-coded subtitles from a video.,"[Link](https://github.com/voun7/Video_Sub_Extractor)

**What My Project Does**

This program make it easy to extract hard-coded subtitles from a video. This program uses OpenCV to extract the images from the video, then an OCR to extract the text from the images. The extracted texts are then processed and used to generate a subtitle file.

**Target Audience**

I'm a huge fan of Chinese anime and I watch a lot that usually comes with just hard-coded Chinese subtitles. This program will be useful for anyone with similar interest. Several languages are supported.

**Comparison**

Before writing this program  I would use a mix of different software programs to extract the images from the video, then extract the text from the images and finally generate a subtitle file which I later translate to English using [this](https://github.com/voun7/Subtitle_Translator).

This usually took a lot of time, this program combines all this steps into one and is very fast.  
I came across a similar program some years back, but it was mostly in Chinese, I didn't like the GUI and source code was difficult for me at that time to completely understand. The processing of the extracted text in this program was something that I came up with and I consider kind of ingenious. It's also a lot lighter.

Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.",1victorn,1gfyew8,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gfyew8/video_sub_extractor_a_program_for_extracting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gfyew8/video_sub_extractor_a_program_for_extracting/,2024-10-30 21:53:35,4,0.65,4,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1gfyew8

Python,Exploring Solvable and Unsolvable Equations with SymPy,"As applied scientists, we learn to ""solve"" y = x¬≤ and get x = ¬±‚àöy. But we're never taught that you can't solve y = x ‚àíc sin(x) and get a nice equation. That's always bugged me.

To really understand closed-form solvability, you need advance mathematics (e.g. Galois theory). Instead of that, I used SymPy to search for unsolvable equations.

What surprised me:

* Kepler‚Äôs Equation, y = x ‚àíc sin(x), is wonderfully simple.
* Lambert‚Äôs W function is invaluable when your model includes exp or log (but not both).
* SymPy is excellent but may not match WolframAlpha in some cases.
* Mixing trigonometric functions with other terms frequently prevents closed-form solutions.
* When closed-form solutions remain out of reach, we can rely on plotting and numerical methods.

I've created an open-source¬†[GitHub repo](https://github.com/CarlKCarlK/unsolvable) with full Python code and Jupyter notebooks. The project:

* Shows how to use Jupyter to create and display markdown tables containing equations.
* Includes a link to a free, no paywall article that can't be included directly in r/ Python.

p.s. Last year, I presented a similar project at PyData Seattle. It explained Newtonian Physics via SymPy.

Python,Just made a quick script for multi-launching programs!,"# What my project does

[Desktop Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/shortcut-launcher-showcase-h9WzDwU)

I wanted to organize my desktop but wanted a shortcut so I can quickly launch my minecraft servers. Ended up making a quick (and lightweight!) script that can read the dirlist from a directory and display it to quickly launch any one of them!

[Window screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/8Lv2jQ1)

The script should be cross compatible atleast across Windows/Linux/Mac, tho I didnt test it on Linux/Mac.

This window is pretty customizable according to me. You can change the font and title of the GUI title and it shows any file put in the folder that it is told to look into!

You can change these configs in the script itself so that it doesnt have to load another JSON (or similar) file to cut loading times.

# Target audience

You can sorta say it is a toy, I mean I dont see any prod use here, but it can also be a powerful tool for those who like to organize their desktops and not make it a clutter!

It is also REALLY lightweight and fast, so this little tool can be used for power users as well.

Python,Customizable CAPTCHA widget for PyQt and PySide,"Hey,

I made a clean and modern CAPTCHA widget for PyQt and PySide.

Preview: [https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14af04a6-c953-4038-8121-0c7c91b92f9f](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14af04a6-c953-4038-8121-0c7c91b92f9f)

**What My Project Does:**

The widget is a button containing a checkbox that opens a CAPTCHA prompt when clicked and checks the checkbox upon completion.

The prompt is made up of three different tasks:

* Selecting all images that contain a certain object (e.g. cars, crosswalks, bridges)
* Selecting all squares of an image that contain traffic lights
* Playing a small audio file and typing what you heard

The project can be used with PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2, and PySide6, is highly customizable and easy to use. You can change the widget's entire look, including all colors and fonts, choose between multiple levels of difficulty and set it all up within just a couple of lines.

**Target Audience:**

It can be useful for anyone working with PyQt or PySide who wants to use a clean and modern CAPTCHA widget to protect their application from automation.

**Comparison:**

I couldn't find any library for PyQt or PySide that does anything similar.

Python,Can't Create a 1-Page PDF from HTML,"Here‚Äôs a draft for your Reddit post:



\---



\*\*Title:\*\* Can't Create a 1-Page PDF from HTML



I'm working on a Python script that generates an HTML file called \`index\_embedded.html\`. When I open this file in any browser and print it, it fits perfectly on one page. However, I need the script to generate a PDF directly, and I haven‚Äôt been able to get it to output a single-page PDF.



Here‚Äôs my latest attempt:



`import subprocess`



`def print_html(html_file, output_pdf, browser='edge'):`

`# Path to the Chrome or Edge executable`

`if browser == 'chrome':`

`browser_path = ""C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe""`

`elif browser == 'edge':`

`browser_path = ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe""`

`else:`

`raise ValueError(""Unsupported browser. Use 'chrome' or 'edge'."")`



`# Command to print to PDF using Chrome or Edge, with options to remove headers and footers`

`try:`

`subprocess.run([browser_path, '--headless', '--disable-gpu', '--no-pdf-header-footer', '--print-to-pdf=' + output_pdf, '--paper-size=A4',`

`'--margin-top=0', '--margin-bottom=0',`

`'--margin-left=0', '--margin-right=0', '--scale=1', html_file], check=True)`

`print(f""HTML file converted to PDF at: {output_pdf}"")`

`except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:`

`print(f""Error generating PDF: {e}"")`

\`\`\`



However, this code produces a two-page PDF instead of a single page. Any suggestions on how to fix this?

Python,I made a reactive programming library for Python,"Hey all!

I recently published a reactive programming library called `signified`.

You can find it here:

* Source - https://github.com/dougmercer/signified/
* Docs - https://dougmercer.github.io/signified/
* PyPI - https://pypi.org/project/signified/

# What my project does

## What is reactive programming?

Good question!

The short answer is that it's a programming paradigm that focuses on reacting to change. When a reactive object changes, it notifies any objects observing it, which gives those objects the chance to update (which could in turn lead to them changing and notifying their observers...)

## Can I see some examples?

Sure!

### Example 1

    from signified import Signal
    
    a = Signal(3)
    b = Signal(4)
    c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5
    print(c)  # &lt;5&gt;

    a.value = 5
    b.value = 12
    print(c)  # &lt;13&gt;


Here, `a` and `b` are Signals, which are reactive containers for values.

In `signified`, reactive values like Signals overload a lot of Python operators to make it easier to make reactive expressions using the operators you're already familiar with. Here, `c` is a reactive expression that is the solution to the pythagorean theorem (`a ** 2 + b ** 2 = c ** 2`)

We initially set the values for `a` and `b` to be 3 and 4, so `c` initially had the value of 5. However, because `a`, `b`, and `c` are reactive, after changing the values of `a` and `b` to 5 and 12, `c` automatically updated to have the value of 13.

### Example 2

    from signified import Signal, computed
    
    x = Signal([1, 2, 3])
    sum_x = computed(sum)(x)
    print(x)  # &lt;[1, 2, 3]&gt;
    print(sum_x)  # &lt;6&gt;
    
    x[1] = 4
    print(x)  # &lt;[1, 4, 3]&gt;
    print(sum_x)  # &lt;8&gt;

Here, we created a signal `x` containing the list `[1, 2, 3]`. We then used the `computed` decorator to turn the `sum` function into a function that produces reactive values, and passed `x` as the input to that function.

We were then able to update `x` to have a different value for its second item, and our reactive expression `sum_x` automatically updated to reflect that.

# Target Audience

# Why would I want this?

I was skeptical at first too... it adds a lot of complexity and a bit of overhead to what would otherwise be simple functions.

However, reactive programming is very popular in the front-end web dev and user interface world for a reason-- it often helps make it easy to specify the relationship between things in a more declarative way.

The main motivator for me to create this library is because I'm also working on an animation library. (It's not open sourced yet, but I made a video on it here pre-refactor to reactive programming https://youtu.be/Cdb_XK5lkhk). So far, I've found that adding reactivity has solved more problems than it's created, so I'll take that as a win.

## Status of this project

This project is still in its early stages, so consider it ""in beta"".

Now that it'll be getting in the hands of people besides myself, I'm definitely excited to see how badly you can break it (or what you're able to do with it). Feel free to create issues or submit PRs on GitHub!

# Comparison

Why not use an existing library?

The `param` library from the Holoviz team features reactive values. It's great! However, their library isn't type hinted.

Personally, I get frustrated working with libraries that break my IDE's ability to provide completions. So, essentially for that reason alone, I made `signified`.

`signified` is mostly type hinted, except in cases where Python's type system doesn't really have the necessary capabilities.

Unfortunately, the type hints currently only work in `pyright` (not `mypy`) because I've abused the type system quite a bit to make the type narrowing work. I'd like to fix this in the future...

# Where to find out more

Check out any of those links above to get access to the code, or check out my YouTube video discussing it here https://youtu.be/nkuXqx-6Xwc . There, I go into detail on how it's implemented and give a few more examples of why reactive programming is so cool for things like animation.
