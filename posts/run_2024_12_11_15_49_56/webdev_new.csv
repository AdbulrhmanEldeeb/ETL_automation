webdev,"I’m afraid to open source the data for my website, should I be?","I have made a free price comparison website for SaaS dev tools. And as the different categories and all the providers keep growing it will reach a point where keeping this up to date stops scaling time wise for me alone.

The project is still small-ish, but its growing and the requests for adding and updating data is growing as well.

So I’m thinking of open sourcing the pricing data so others can contribute if they want to, to keep the data up to date, and letting people add new categories or providers themselves.

But my worries is that in the day of AI assistants like v0 and bolt, the data source will be used to copy my little site and that it will be overtaken by others.

Is this a legit worry, or is the potential upside of having the tool grow and be a good resource for the community too great?

The target audience is developers so most of them can copy this pretty easily, its not complicated code. It’s the gathering of data that stops the copies I think.

I’ve been thinking of adding APIs for adding data as well, but I dont really think people will use that, what do you think?

The last resort would be to set up scraping to keep the data updated, not really a path I want to take.",skorpioo,1hbvi13,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hbvi13/im_afraid_to_open_source_the_data_for_my_website/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hbvi13/im_afraid_to_open_source_the_data_for_my_website/,2024-12-11 15:06:28,0,0.5,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbvi13

It looks pretty nice on a desktop but when I load it on my phone the download button gets all squished. My download button fills up with liquid when hovered over and I do this by moving a water image background upwards when I hover over the button. On a mobile device though its in the wrong position and already showing a bit at the bottom of the button.

Also my navbar has a dropdown menu that opens when hovered over. I figured out each link in my dropdown menu is 46px tall. Theres 2 items in the dropdown menu so I set it to open to 92px with a transition effect. I cant set the max height in css to be 100% because my dropdown menu isnt a set height and the height depends on the items within it so the browser cant calculate 100%. But while it works on a pc just manually setting the height to 92px on a mobile device it doesnt fully open?

Ive attached an image of it using my pixel 7 and my pcs browser so you can see what I mean. Any help is appreciated thanks.

webdev,Easy Automated Image Gen on the Web,"I have written some python code that generates a few .png using matplotlib with some data I get from an API. I want to regenerate these images daily, and share them with one or more people. Currently this involves me sending an email every day. I'd rather have it hosted on the web where it's easily accessible.   
  
Two questions: 1.) Is there a photo hosting site that has an API I can automatically upload them to? If so, I assume you can program a computer to automatically run some python code at a set time each day, what would I search to learn more about this?  
  
2.) Some of the parameters are customizable, so I'd rather have a little website that allows the other person be able to adjust some parameters and generate the images on the fly. Is Django the best way to get this done? If so, should I host it on a VPS or is there a simpler place to run this web app? Theoretically, these plots/data have monetary value, so I'd eventually want to lock it behind a login as well. I know this seems like I might be biting off more than my amateur self can chew. But I am happy to learn along the way of this process. I don't care if it takes me a few weeks to make all of this work.

webdev,"I want to create a website that's essentially a mix of debateart, kialo and lichess","I'm well aware this may not be realistically viable. But just in case it is, I'm asking here.

I want to create a website that's essentially a mix of these three sites: https://www.debateart.com/ https://www.kialo.com/ https://lichess.org/
A site where you can create or join timed matches (much like in lichess, with different time controls and ratings) to debate virtually any subject you like.

But during the debates, instead of each person having day(s) to come up with a big block of text like in Debateart, the debates will generally be much faster and structured like they are in Kialo, making it very systematic.

Voters, instead of having to read the whole debate to have any input, can vote on individual arguments in the kialo-esque chart according to their relevance, validity, soundness and impact on the parent claim. They can vote on as many or as few arguments as they want, perhaps restricted by whether or not they've voted on the child arguments.

I have some other ideas for it as well if it's possible, but what I've described so far is the main part.

I looked into Odoo, Yola and Webflow but it seems like they won't work. How can I make a complex site with almost no experience? And I would prefer to do it for free or on a low budget.

\- each element need to be spaced out and have a custom width and still look exactly as in the example above.  
\- the larger the concentric circle, the move space each element need to have in between.

I have managed to create the circle, and  managed to rotate the.

The issue is when I try to add the child elements that represent different options. It just doesn't click with me.

From my understanding, I need to bring each element at the border of the circle...

webdev,Is anyone using Processwire with Laravel for authentication?,"Hey All,

I've recently gotten into Laravel, and I love it. It was very easy setting up a previous project using it as a backend to a nextjs frontend. The documentation was great on this front.

I have a pet project now where I really want to use Processwire as a CMS in conjunction with Laravel for authentication only. ***I'm just curious how many here have done this, and if there are any pointers that can be offered? How well is it also working out for you?***

I know how to implement the appropriate table migrations for the Laravel part within the existing MySQL database that Processwire uses - as these will the be same kinds of tables I want to use as I did on my previous project. However, I want to bypass any and all authentication and user management that processwire does. 

Appreciate any advice.

webdev,"Warning, Smartrmail app contains 'bad' automatic permissions in the terms &amp; conditions, and will plant your business's email in everyones' spam.","I recently made a giant mistake by downloading this one Shopify add-on app... right from that wholesome official Shopify app store.

I recently decided to try out this marketing app, Smartrmail (bad idea). I have to say... the experience was so negative, that I felt the need to protect fellow store owners.

Once you download the app, you'll notice the option to create a password for your account (recommended by the app for ""security purposes"" lol). Once you create a password, you'll never be able to delete your account or change the email attached. Not kidding.

The option to delete your account isn't available. You cannot remove your important business-email from this account profile. The option isn't available. You will be stuck.

Next, they'll start sending shitty emails from a shitty template from your email address, because you agreed to 'let' them by checking the box that says ""I agree to these terms and conditions."" They will send emails to every single one of your customers, and the emails look TERRIBLE.

This is so heinous, I had to dig deeper. The company was active about three years ago in late 2020, and then closed it's doors. The application business, Smartrmail, was acquired in 2023 by new owners. At the bottom of the page, the app claims to be owned by Intercom (Google showed it as an AI chat bot business for retail), however, there isn't any proof anywhere else on the web that shady ass Smartrmail is ACTUALLY owned by Intercom. The Shopify app store says it's owned by a company called Relay. So, who is who? We just don't know yet.

Worse, this app has received 500+ 5 star reviews... yet their official youtube channel has less than 100 views total for the three half-ass AI videos they have up. All of them use AI voices. Why on earth wouldn't anybody want their actual name/face or voice affiliated with Smartrmail. Is there something wrong with it? I'm still seriously considering calling the US &amp; Australian FBI, this app is sooooo effing shady. It blows my mind the Shopify app store approved it... yikes

I care about this community, so that's why I'm recommending you stay away from this super-scam Smartrmail app on Shopify. You deserve better. We all do. I love Shopify as much as the rest of us. I can't believe Shopify is letting this app continue... so embarrassing for them.

Don't believe me? Log-out, and open a separate, free 30-day Shopify trial using a dummy email address, and see for yourself. You'll see what I'm talking about. This app is designed to hurt sellers.

I work for a marketing company that manages multiple businesses, and one of my responsibilities is flagging Google reviews that breach Google's policies and following up with Google based on the outcome.

The main challenge is that this is a manual process—we have to log in to each client account and perform this task individually. I’ve noticed that some other platforms offer a dashboard where users can flag specific reviews and receive feedback on Google’s response regarding those reviews. If Google’s reply is negative, these platforms allow users to provide additional information through the same dashboard to support their reason for flagging the review.

I know this process can be done manually via a business’s Google My Business (GMB) account and the Google Reviews Management Tool to submit more information for a review. However, I’ve searched extensively and can’t find any information in the Google API that would enable the above scenario programmatically.

This makes me wonder if these other companies are falsely marketing their dashboards and actually have someone manually performing the process in the background, while simply updating the dashboard with Google’s feedback.",startup4you,1haol26,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haol26/is_programmatic_review_flagging_possible_via/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haol26/is_programmatic_review_flagging_possible_via/,2024-12-10 00:10:21,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haol26
webdev,"YACPD question: I know this has been asked many many times over the last decade or so, but I'm going to ask it again. I'm curious about your experiences with the current cross-platform SDKs","Disclaimer: I intend to build POC apps in my short list to come to my own conclusion, but I would like your opinions in case i've over looked something.

I've always had a native-firsts stance, so I haven't needed a cross-platform solution for a while so i am a bit out of date on the current state of affairs, so i'd like any constructive feedback

I'm currently considering:

- flutter
- kotlin compose/native
- nativescript

My thoughts so far:

**Flutter**

Pros: 

- I've always loved flutter from the pre-beta version
- Their rendering model is very interesting
- Dart is perfectly boring in the best sense of the way. It is familiar whether you're coming from java, javascript, or some other algol-inspired language. it can be quickly adopted by other developers in an afternoon or so
- It is a very opinionated language which eliminates unnecessary conversations about how to do things
- Their web output is finally stable


Cons: 

- State management and design patterns have been questionable in the past and change often. 
- Using canvas for the web output feels icky but that's a knee-jerk reaction and they seem to have addressed accessibility issues

**kotlin**

Pros: 

- Jetbrains understands developer needs and have vastly improved the android ecosystem. 
- Kotlin fixes java and is a fun language

Cons: 

- Kotlin has a large learning curve for new devs because there are so many features. 
- Web and iOS are not yet to a stable state

**nativescript**

Pros:

- It seems robust and stable
- It supports many FE tools

Cons:

- I have no experience with it


**Things i've ruled out (but can be convinced otherwise)**

- react native
- ionic
- anything that uses a web view",anus-the-legend,1haogom,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haogom/yacpd_question_i_know_this_has_been_asked_many/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haogom/yacpd_question_i_know_this_has_been_asked_many/,2024-12-10 00:04:27,1,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1haogom
webdev,Launched an Open Source Tool on Product Hunt. Want to share why I built it.,"Over the past year of building AI-enabled SaaS applications, I kept hitting the same wall. Going from a Jupyter notebook full of AI RAG techniques to something usable in my app was a nightmare. I'm sure if anyone here has taking a look at llama-index or langchain cookbook sections you might understand what I'm talking about.  
  
I came to the conclusion that this is the problem:  
\- Notebooks are great for testing ideas, but they’re not meant for building applications around them.  
\- I had to manually dissect notebooks, build a proof-of-concept API server, integrate it into my app, and pray it worked.  
\- The feedback loop was \*painfully\* long—and most of the time, I canned the project because it didn’t quite fit.  
  
This frustration comes from a gap in roles:  
1. Data Scientists/AI Devs want notebooks to experiment with methods and techniques—but it's not their main focus to also create an API for other applications to use.  
2. App Developers just want simple APIs to test and integrate quickly to see if it actually enhances their app.

This is where KitchenAI comes in. A tool that bridges this gap by transforming your AI Jupyter notebooks into production-ready API server in minutes.  
  
But why??  
\- Shorter Development Cycles  
Test, iterate, and deploy AI techniques faster and cut the feedback loop in half.  
\- Vendor and Framework Agnostic  
Use the libraries you’re comfortable with, no lock-ins.  
\- Plugin Architecture  
Extend functionality with plugins for evaluation frameworks, observability, prompt management, and more.  
\- Open Source and Local-First  
Built on trusted technologies like Django, so you stay in control—no 3rd-party dependencies required.  
\- Docker-Ready  
Share your API server as a lightweight container for easy collaboration.  
  
We’ve released KitchenAI as an Apache-licensed open-source tool, so anyone can use it. Up next is a managed cloud version with deeper integrations, metrics, analytics, and workflows for teams with more complex needs. One short term goal is to go straight from colab to a KitchenAI cloud hosted API so development can be absolutely seamless.

1. Any recommendations for a free open source API I can use to test and implement the system?


2-  What security risks should I be aware of (e.g., API key exposure), and how can I mitigate them?


3- How can I ensure scalability in tracking requests and maintaining uptime? 


4- Any tips for managing API limits and DevOps processes for a system like this?


I’d appreciate any advice or resources. Thanks!

webdev,Ecommerce choice for almost 500k monthly visitors?,"Hey, I am currently in process of building a rather heavy ecommerce that will have a lot of features ( including all normal ecommerce features such as shipping, stock management, order status types, user registration, loyalty features etc). And I will likely need something really strong and customizable, I will also need something that I can go headless route which will allow me to decouple front from back.

Shipping and order management should be something I can fully customize though (like offer free shipping after a certain amount, set order status to what shipping method is used).

There will also be recurring payments, which will be monthly, bi weekly or weekly depending on user package (they will be just a small part of the shop though, I can set the recurring payments via stripe or paypal if needed).

Shop will be operating in Europe and will likely end up being a multi store type shop (different for every country it will operate in, not many countries max 4).

So far I have checked out Shopify Plus, Shopware 6, Medusajs etc.

Shopify Plus while good doesn't really seem to fit the criteria for my project considering client doesn't want to pay monthly for addons and such so I've ruled it out. 

I did look at Medusajs but to be honest it seems like it lacks so many features out of box that most shops have, it lacks category nesting (based on what I have seen) which is something I really need to have.

Shopware 6 to me seems like a good choice, since it is customizable enough for it to work for me and headless seems like a good enough option for it. 

I have ruled out some things like Woocommerce (too slow and can't rely on its security), Magento 2 (too much dev time) and PrestaShop.

My question is, is there anything better and faster considering project scope than Shopware 6? 

Thank you very much for reading.

Edit: I do have the option of going for custom solution backend which is indeed likely the best choice when it comes to this project?

webdev,Can somebody help? Node.js and PSQL,"My front end works fine, but this exact part about updating a client's info is getting over my head and I really need some guidance. I hope some life saver could help. 

This is my clients table on my DB: 

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS clients (

      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      birth_date DATE,

      email VARCHAR(255),
      address TEXT,
      license VARCHAR(50),
      license_expiry DATE,
      note TEXT
    );

And I have this controller for updating a client's info: 

    const updateClient = async (req, res) =&gt; {
      const id = req.params.id_number;
    
      const { name, birth_date, id_document, id_expiry, phone, email, address, license, license_expiry, note } = req.body;
    
      const responseReturn = new ResponseClass();
    
      const query = `UPDATE clients SET name = $1, birth_date = $2, id_document = $3, id_expiry = $4, phone = $5, email = $6, address = $7, license = $8, license_expiry = $9, note = $10 WHERE id_number = $11`;
    
      const params = [name, birth_date, id_document, id_expiry, phone, email, address, license, license_expiry, note, id];
    
      try {
        const { rows } = await queryDatabase(query, params);
        if (rows.length === 0) {
          responseReturn.status = false;
          responseReturn.code = 404;
          responseReturn.message = ""Client not found"";

        responseReturn.data = error.message;
        res.status(500).json(responseReturn);
      }
    };

I also have the other CRUD functions and they are working perfectly, but when it comes to updating a client and clicking the modify button, A server error 500 keeps logging on my console and nothing is updated. 

This is how I'm handling the form submit: 

    const handleSubmit = async (e) =&gt; {
        e.preventDefault();
    
        console.log(formData);
    
        try {
          const response = await fetch(""http://localhost:8080/api/clients"", {
            method: ""POST"",
            headers: {
              ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(formData),
          });
    
          const data = await response.json();
    
          if (response.ok) {
            MessageToast(data.message);
            onSubmit(formData);
          }
        } catch (error) {

webdev,I Built a WordPress Plugin to Solve My Own Problem—Looking for Feedback on How to Share It ,"Hey Reddit!

I’ve recently built a WordPress plugin, and I’m at the stage where I could really use your advice on how to productize and share it with others.

Here’s the backstory: I was developing a WordPress plugin, and every time I made a small change, I had to:  
1️ Zip the folder  
2️ Upload it to WordPress  
3️ Install it  
4️ Activate it  
5️ Test

And I was doing this *every 2-3 minutes.*

Coming from modern frameworks like Vue, where **hot reloads** are standard, this felt painfully outdated. So, I decided to create something that would let me just push my changes to GitHub and have it automatically sync and deploy.

That’s how **RepoSync** was born—a plugin that simplifies WordPress development workflows. It’s functional and ready to go! Here’s what it does:

* **Auto-syncs with GitHub** so you can skip the zip-upload madness. Just push ti Github and your plugin will be updated automatically
* Supports **private repos**, even on the free tier
* Lets you connect to **specific branches**
* Keeps the setup super simple so anyone can use it (no setting up web hooks, just a simple oauth approval with read permissions)

There are other tools on the market, but I found them either missing key features (like auto-sync or private repo support), were too tedious to set up, or too expensive for what they offer.

**Here’s where I need your help:**

* **How should I productize it?** I’m considering a **generous free tier** (maybe limiting to 1-2 plugins/themes but including private repos) and offering both **recurring and one-time payment options**. Most of the others only have a subscription which I hate. I'd rather pay a one-time fee.
* **What’s the best way to share it with the community?** Should I go all in on the WordPress marketplace, or are there other avenues I should explore?

I’m also looking for **beta testers**, so if this sounds like something you’d use, let me know—I’d be happy to share the full version with you for free.

I wanted to share a project I'm really excited about - a new programming language called BuckshotPlusPlus that aims to make web development more intuitive.  
Here's how a simple component looks:

        content = ""Click me!""
        background-color = ""#007bff""
        color = ""white""
        padding = ""10px 20px""
    }

  
The language includes built-in session handling, data caching, and component management.

webdev,Questions about interfacing with OAuth and Azure,"Hey all! Will be posting this to an Azure subreddit too, but since half of the problem is mine as a dev, thought somebody here might be able to help...

For the past 3 years, have been providing single sign-on to a site I run for a client who uses Azure for their employee logins. That was a big learning curve for me as a dev (first work with Azure SSO), but it's been going great since. The expiry for the original certificates is coming up quickly, though, and the closer we get the more I feel like rollover is a situation of ""the blind leading the blind"". Hoping somebody here might have experience from the admin and developer side and be able to provide some perspective.

My understanding is that the usual rollover goes like this... They add a new cert with a later expiry, and add it as a secondary in Azure. They send it my way (they sent it in an XML document). When I'm set, I swap out the old cert for the new, things for the site continue unabated, and once everything's stable they can make the new cert primary and delete the old.

It appears that on their end they've only got ""active/inactive"" for certs, though. They're saying that I can't use the new cert while it's inactive, and activating the new one will deactivate the current one. Apparently they usually do the switch with a scheduled, simultaneous change on both ends. That sounds nuts to me.

So, first question is am I missing something here? I'd be happy to support their system by keeping a primary and fallback cert on my end, and trying the fallback if the primary fails, but in that case could use a little guidance on what going to a fallback looks like for OAuth (in particular, how to deal with the fact that trying the primary I believe consumes the authorization code). Any resources would be greatly appreciated.

Second question... When we started this whole thing the admin on their end had me send a PFX including the certificate for the key we're signing the client assertion with. That will also be expiring soon, so I assumed I'd need to get a new cert to them as well. They're saying there's no ""spot"" for that and they don't think they need an updated certificate. Can that be right?",base736,1hak8ue,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hak8ue/questions_about_interfacing_with_oauth_and_azure/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hak8ue/questions_about_interfacing_with_oauth_and_azure/,2024-12-09 21:00:06,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hak8ue
webdev,"First Month Update - $6K in revenue, here is what I learned","Hey fellow web developers,

Hope you’re all doing amazing! I wanted to share a bit about what the past month has been like for me.

I'm pretty sure you are all familiar with my product - ChatGPT Toolbox, I posted about it here before, But in case you missed it, it’s a Chrome extension designed to supercharge your ChatGPT experience. It bridges all the gaps and adds tons of useful features, like creating folders, pinning chats, saving and reusing prompts, exporting conversations, and even downloading messages as MP3 files with 9 different voice options. And that’s just scratching the surface—there are plenty more cool tools packed in!

you can read more about it here:

www.ai-toolbox.co

 Last Saturday marks a full month since my extension officially became a paid product, and wow, what a ride it’s been. It’s been a month packed with lessons, challenges, and a few wins that I’m really proud of. To celebrate hitting 5,500 users and $6,000 in revenue in just the first month, I wanted to share 5 big lessons I’ve learned along the way.

1️⃣ A great product isn’t enough.
This one hit me hard. You can have the most amazing product ever, but if you can’t clearly explain its value to people, it’s not going anywhere. I had to work on really understanding what my audience needed and how to communicate that effectively.

2️⃣ Marketing isn’t optional.
Honestly, I thought the product would ""sell itself"" at first. Big mistake. Even if it’s great, no one will buy it if they don’t know it exists. Marketing has been a steep learning curve for me, but I’ve realized just how critical it is to make some noise about your product.

3️⃣ Customer support = magic.
I answered 97% of customer emails within 3 minutes (the other 3%? I was asleep 😅). People were blown away by the quick responses. If email didn’t solve their issue, I jumped on a Google Meet with them. The reaction was always the same: pure shock and gratitude. Those moments reminded me how much a little extra effort can make a huge difference.

4️⃣ I shine in live interactions, not on social media.
I was invited to present my extension in front of 700 people during a webinar, and it was such a rush. People loved it, and the feedback I got afterward was unreal.

What stood out to me, though, was that I connect much better with people live than through social media. Whenever I try posting videos or updates, they don’t seem to land the same way. But when I’m live? That’s where I thrive. Definitely something I’ll need to figure out moving forward.

5️⃣ Organic growth is the real MVP.
Every single user so far has come from organic traffic. I hired a marketing agency to help scale, but honestly, they haven’t brought in even one new customer yet. It’s frustrating, but I’m staying patient.

Meanwhile, I’ve been focusing on rolling out cool new features. I have about 70,000 ideas buzzing in my head 🤯, and this month, I pushed out updates like crazy. I just ran a quick poll in my community, and the top-voted feature was live within 24 hours. That was such a fun win!

So, what’s next?
I’ve realized that for my next product, I really need to build a personal brand to make this process easier. But that’s easier said than done—what language do I use? what platform? Still trying to figure that out.

It’s been a wild month, and I feel like things are just getting started.

I'm a high school student and working on building a web app. I am trying to enable users to be able to edit an item's text by clicking directly on it and update it in the backend when they tap a save button. **Currently, I'm using contenteditable on an h2** (I'm also using contenteditable on multiple &lt;p&gt; tags)**.** When the user clicks on the text, a div with buttons cancel-edit and save-edit in it will appear. Once the cancel or save button is clicked, the div disaperas and js runs a function that changes the backend. 

Is using contenteditable fine? If it isn't, what are some other ways I can allow users to change text? (Preferably not another modal)

Sequin is an open source tool for change data capture (CDC) in Postgres. Sequin makes it easy to stream Postgres rows and changes to streaming platforms and queues (e.g. SQS, Pub/Sub, Kafka):

[https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin)

**Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub**

So, you can backfill all or part of a Postgres table into SQS or Pub/Sub. Then, as inserts, updates, and deletes happen, Sequin will send those changes as JSON messages to your SQS queue or Pub/Sub topic in real-time.

**FIFO consumption**

We have full support for FIFO/ordered consumption. By default, we group/order messages by the source row's primary key (so if \`order\` \`id=1\` changes 3 times, all 3 change events will be strictly ordered). This means your downstream systems can know they're processing Postgres events in order.

For SQS FIFO queues, that means setting `MessageGroupId`. For Pub/Sub, that means setting the `orderingKey`.

You can set the `MessageGroupId`/`orderingKey` to any combination of the source row's fields.

**What can you build with Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub?**

* **Event-driven workflows**: For example, triggering side effects when an order is fulfilled or a subscription is canceled.
* **Replication**: You have a change happening in Service A, and want to fan that change out to Service B, C, etc. Or want to replicate the data into another database or cache.
* **Kafka alt:** One thing I'm really excited about is that if you combine a Postgres table with SQS or Pub/Sub via Sequin, you have a system that's comparable to Kafka. Your Postgres table can hold historical messages/records. When you bring a new service online (in Kafka parlance, consumer group) you can use Sequin to backfill all the historical messages into that service's SQS queue or Pub/Sub Topic. So it makes these systems behave more like a stream, and you get to use Postgres as the retention layer.

**Example**

You can setup a Sequin sink easily with [sequin.yaml](https://sequinstream.com/docs/reference/sequin-yaml#sequin-yaml) (a lightweight Terraform – Terraform support coming soon!)

Here's an example of an SQS sink:

    # sequin.yaml
    databases:
      - name: ""my-postgres""
        hostname: ""your-rds-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com""
        database: ""app_production""
        username: ""postgres""
        password: ""your-password""
        slot_name: ""sequin_slot""
        publication_name: ""sequin_pub""
        tables:
          - table_name: ""orders""
            sort_column_name: ""updated_at""
    
    sinks:
      - name: ""orders-to-sqs""
        database: ""my-postgres""
        table: ""orders""
        batch_size: 1
        # Use order_id for FIFO message grouping
        group_column_names: [""id""]
        # Optional: only stream fulfilled orders
        filters:
          - column_name: ""status""
            operator: ""=""
            comparison_value: ""fulfilled""
        destination:
          type: ""sqs""
          queue_url: ""https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/orders-queue.fifo""
          access_key_id: ""AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX""
          secret_access_key: ""your-secret-key""

webdev,Resources to learn about images,"Greetings, 

After just making a super basic SPA I found working regards to images to be quite frustrating. I am familiar with the myriad of devices and screen sizes that need to be accommodated, but I am quite rusty. I am now thinking that for my portfolio I should start with a few websites that dont even have subjects in their images, but instead are just big colored X's that pertain to a certain image size so I can get the hang of this again. Thats practical right? I am rediscovering how switching from one content pane with images, to another with form inputs, will expand and contract the parent container and I need to revisit my understanding on this topic. 

On the other hand, I was also wondering if anyone knows of any resources or tutorials that do a deep focus on web development with respect to working with just images? It would be nice to learn more about how the web isnt all JPG, PNGs, SVGs, anymore, and whatever else has changed over the last 4 years since I have been in school. I did a search on this forums but I didnt find any resources that truly focused on this subject with great emphasis. 

Backstory- I used to manage a PHP/HTML/CSS/JQuery/WP website for a medium sized non-profit before COVID shutdown the company. I went back to school to earn a degree, landed a backend dev job, but then that company started hemorrhaging money and I am now seeking to go into Full Stack development by making a portfolio of projects using React/Node with BS5.

At the core sits a Vue SPA, that gets wrapped in:

* Electron for Windows/MacOS builds
* React Native for Android and iOS builds

[High-level architecture of our POS app](https://preview.redd.it/n3s58yejau5e1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6912edbafd36ace6bfe35d1c68efeb39de887fbf)

Both the React Native app, and the Electron app have a shared NodeJS component, that allows the SPA to communicate with devices on the network using TCP for example.

This way, our app can communicate with peripherals like thermal printers and payment terminals.

Since React Native doesn't come with a NodeJS runtime, we ship [NodeJS mobile](https://nodejs-mobile.github.io/) with it, and this entire setup allows me to share \~95% of my entire codebase for all platforms.

I'm a technical lead with 5 years of experience building financial software and enterprise applications. I love turning complex business problems into elegant solutions, and I'm looking to branch out on my own.

My stack:

* Backend: Symfony/Laravel (built multiple enterprise apps)
* Frontend: NextJS/React (created dynamic form systems)
* Plus the usual suspects: Docker, AWS, Git, etc.

I'm particularly good at:

* Building smart form systems that adapt based on user input
* Integrating with external APIs and services
* Modernizing legacy systems
* Making complex processes simple and user-friendly

Instead of just looking for regular contract work, I'm interested in:

1. Finding companies whose problems I can solve (and potentially turn solutions into products)
2. Building relationships with businesses that need ongoing development support
3. Creating systems that can be repurposed for similar companies

I've already built a solid Symfony/NextJS starter template to hit the ground running. What I need now is to find the right companies to work with.

webdev,I created this all-in-one JSON Toolkit,"This post might come across as a bit self-promotional, but I created this tool for personal use, and some of my colleagues have found it helpful. It's mainly for developers and testers, so I think r/webdev is a good place to share it, and I hope it will be useful to others too.

This tool addresses some pain points I face when developing, debugging, or testing features that involve JSON data.

* I often need to search for each key whenever I get the data, so I built a way to query multiple keys at once.
* It's difficult to remember deep paths to locate my data, so I built a JSON viewer that lets me extract any path by simply clicking on the key.

Some might argue that I should use Postman test scripts or Postgres' `json_extract_path`. But I find these solutions better suited for stable APIs or data. When I’m developing a new feature or debugging an issue, the target field can pop into my mind at any moment. So I prefer to quickly access the field and the data directly, rather than having to write a Postman script or SQL query.

* Customer separation - you can group accounts per customer, and when you schedule, you can filter by customer.
* Option to tag companies on LinkedIn (I wanted to tag people also, but it was not possible)
* Fixes for different social media posts failing.
* **Introducing Plugs!** This is a concept you can find in other tools that can boost your engagement for your current posts. Here are some examples:
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, repost it (to regain visibility to it)
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, add another message to it (all your existing commenters will get a notification)

webdev,Offering financing to clients,"Own a digital agency and IT consultancy. 

Something I've thought about for a while is offering finance options to clients. For example, if an ecommerce site costs £30,000, they could put down a deposit and spread the cost, say £1000 a month for 36 months (subject to credit check). Clients wouldn't gain ownership of anything until it is paid off entirely.

Another alternative is potentially leasing whereby we include maintenance and hosting but the monthly is indefinite. They'd commit to a minimum time period and keep paying after this to keep the site active or start again and rebuild. 

Changes outside of the agreement would be billed at ""x"" amount extra for the remaining agreement months. 

Could offer this by partnering with a bank/broker potentially. Contracts would have to be watertight. 

Drawback - debts die with the company if it folds unless we enforce a personal guarantee.

Hello,
I have been trying to get a germany study visa appointment for the last six months. All the appointments get taken in a few seconds. I have tried everything. I had to defer my semester and now the deadline is going to pass again. 
The problem is that there is a server side limit of 3 seconds before which you can't submit the captcha and appointment form. Considering this limit, the earliest you can submit the form after the appointments are open is 4 seconds (one second to click the appointment slot, open the form and fill it; and 3 seconds wait before the submission). I have many a times clicked the submit button at exactly the 4 second mark, but still no luck . 
I was told that there are some people who have somehow bypassed this limit and they can submit the form and captcha from the client side before the 3 second limit. They book all the appointments. 
I don't know if this is true. But if someone can confirm this or help me, i would be eternally grateful.

I know how to create it, but we're wanting more of a local App without the need of internet connections.

so using visual studio, is there a way i can create a web app using [ASP.Net](http://ASP.Net) Core and use some local database inside the app? I know i can simply write data to XML files, but I'd rather sort of use SQL.

I am wanting to get better at my job so I figured creating my own app will be good practice to become a better developer. Thanks in advance!

webdev,Download a file with error handling in microservice architecture,"Scenario:   
There are two services, 1 UI service (react) and 1 api service (dotnet web api). UI service will generate a get request with an entity id parameter and backend service will fetch all files related to this entity from S3, store them locally, zip them and provide a stream to read to zip as the response (FileStreamResponse).

Problem statement:  
Download the zip by using browser's native download functionality, the download should happen directly from the stream (no intermediate blob conversions). If the server returns a 200 status code, downloading should start immediately, if the server returns 500, simply do a console.log on the UI. In the case where the response is 500, I do not want to change the current page and display the response message, I should be able to handle this in a custom way (show a toast or console or whatever).

Please help. I have already tried doing this with anchor tags, but can't handle 500 status code responses in a custom way, it just changes the url  of the current page.

WTF am I doing guys so the team developing my app is using a cloud based server and I honestly have no idea what they’re doing but the one they’re using seems like they’re up selling me and I’ve been trying to find a good server that meets my needs without paying too much (like an annual subscription)

Description: small app, no more than 40 users at once. Basic functions like financial transactions, account creation and editing profile, post listings with pictures and descriptions (very simple version of an e-commerce website, probably won’t have many users at all)

webdev,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6sm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:46,3,1.0,3,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9l6sm

webdev,Do you know where i can find a solid Full Stack Pre-built Chat App? (next.js &amp; shadcn),"Hey everyone!
I’m working on a chat app built with Next.js/Supabase/Shadcn (Tailwind + Radix), and currently, the UI is built from scratch, using Supabase (with their websocket). 
It works, but I’m looking for something more solid in terms of both backend and frontend (logic and UI)

—FRONTEND—
I’m searching for a library or package that:
- Provides a ready-to-use and robust UI for a chat app (paid options are totally fine).
- Handles common behaviors efficiently, like:
1. Fetching older messages while keeping the scroll position intact
2. Auto-scroll to the bottom when a new message arrives
3. Maybe even built-in gestures or animations to improve the UX.
- It's highly customizable, similar to shadcn: I want to copy/paste components into my project and have the freedom to tweak them directly, rather than being tied to a rigid external library.

—BACKEND—
If it's already related to the package/library it would be great, otherwise if you have any valid alternative to the Supabase architecture with their websocket please let me know

I'm building a P2P video call app using React, Express, and Socket.io. I've gone through several articles and tutorials, and I believe my setup is close to working, but I'm running into an issue. Everything seems to be functioning well, but I'm not receiving the remote video stream. There are no errors in the console, but the remote video doesn't display.

# Setup:

* **React** on the frontend for UI and WebRTC implementation.
* **Express** and **SocketIO** on the backend to handle signaling and peer connections.
* **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication (using STUN server for ICE).

From the server logs, I see that the peer IDs are being set successfully, and messages are being passed between peers.

As you can see, the peers are getting connected correctly, but the remote video stream isn't showing up on the client-side.

# Steps I've Tried:

* Ensured that the remote video element is being updated with the incoming stream.
* Checked that the RTC connection is correctly handling the tracks.
* Verified that the signaling messages (offer, answer, and candidates) are being sent and received properly.

# My Question:

Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this issue? Why isn’t the remote video stream displaying, and what could I be missing in the WebRTC setup?

webdev,Framework for desktop-like approach to developing web applications?,"I'm an engineer in a classical sense, I work with signal processing equipment, system integration, and also implement and manage corporate infrastructure. I'm not a web developer by trade, and *have no such aspirations*. I do however occasionally write specialized utilities for the business.

I wish to ask for a very specific thing. I would like a framework that would allow me to develop applications that will display in a web browser, developed in a desktop application manner, meaning not like traditional web development with separation of front-end and backend, separated by an API. I would like my application code to be monolithic and application be ""rendered"" on the server. In other words, **I do not wish to (read: must not) write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, that should be handled by the framework.

**I found one such example:**

[**Webswing Demo**](https://prototype.webswing.org/webswing-demo/)

This is pretty much perfect, I'm very proficient in Java and Swing. But. My company will likely not adopt Java, and Java runtime.

**Are there other examples of this type of framework? How about something for scripting languages, like Python or PHP? Is there something like this for .NET?**

I have a much better chance of adopting something if the webserver prerequisites come from official RHEL packages repos (CentOS/Rocky/Alma). My company avoids 3rd-party stuff for security reasons.

webdev,Suggestions for developing a simple interactable line graph front end for an econometric model,"Hi I'm a total noob when it comes to web dev but I'm pretty technically savvy and can devote time to self teach.

I know that there are some optimizations that I could do to improve readability, but do people actually notice that? Like:  

- Reduce font weight - Often white text on black background has a perceived stronger font weight than black text on a white background.
- Allow for a light and dark mode toggle. (Dark and light mode toggle definitely would help some people, but how many, is it worth the time implementing it?)
- Reduce brightness of text - Text too bright on a dark background may be harder to read.

webdev,Best Tech Stack for Engineering Notes/Pages with Equations and Graphs?,"Hey all,  
I’m looking to build a website focused on engineering content, with lots of notes, equations, and visual content (graphs/images). My goal is to make navigation between pages *super fast*.

# My Experience

* I’ve worked with static and dynamic site generators like Astro.js, Gatsby, and Next.js.
* I’ve built single- and a few-page websites before but nothing too big yet.

# What I’m Thinking

* **Content Type:** The site will have lots of equations (thinking LaTeX in Markdown for simplicity and readability) and visual content like graphs and images.
* **Speed:** Priority is speed, especially when loading pages.
* **Approach:** Considering Astro.js for a fully static site to keep things fast, but I’m open to suggestions.

# Questions:

1. Is LaTeX rendered in Markdown a good approach for displaying equations? Any better options?
2. For images and graphs, what’s the most efficient way to handle them while keeping performance in mind (e.g., CDN, image formats like WebP)?
3. Should I consider other frameworks or approaches besides Astro.js for this use case?

Would love any advice or insights from people who’ve worked on similar projects!

Hey everyone 👋

After struggling with spreadsheets and scattered receipts while reporting to funders (mainly Innovate UK), I built GrantKeeper - a simple tool to help UK organisations manage their grant expenses and reporting.

It lets you:

* Upload and organize receipts/invoices
* Automated data extraction
* Track expenses and automatically handle currency conversion
* Export Excel with all your data and files
* Collaborate with team members on financial reporting

**Screenshots**: [https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png](https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png) / [https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png](https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png)

I've already worked with others receiving grants and it's turned a task which typically takes weeks into hours (and I want to make it better!)

I'm curious how others currently handle their expense tracking? Are you using spreadsheets, accounting software, or some other solution? Have you tried other specialised tools, and if so, what was your experience?

I know similar stuff exists, but in this case I've decided to start by targeting a niche before thinking about expanding it for more general use cases.

I'm a high school student and a newbie full-stack developer working on building a website. Right now, my approach for modals is to define them in the HTML and then feed them values dynamically from my JavaScript when needed.

Whats the best practice here? Should I stick with my current method, or would switching to dynamically generating modals with JavaScript be a better choice?

webdev,Feedback wanted,"Hey everyone! 

I’ve been working on a fun project called [whothatpokemon.com](https://whothatpokemon.com) which is just a browser based game inspired by the iconic “Who’s That Pokémon?” challenge. I mainly built it as I'm looking to eventually teach others how to code and wanted a project that can be enjoyable to build. I know this has been done before in this community and I've added my own sort of twist to it. You can compete against friends online to see who can guess the most correctly. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes (currently limited to 1 on 1 matches).

I’d love to get your feedback on any of these areas:

* Gameplay: Is it fun and engaging? Is it too easy? I let my cousin who is a Pokémon fanatic a try and had to take the phone away from him because he was guessing them all too easily lol.
* Design: I tried to keep this area as cleaned up as possible but I'm also not a designer so it was a bit hard to be creative in this aspect.
* Features: What could make it better or more exciting?
* Bugs: If you run into anything that's not supposed to happen, please let me know. It also hasn't had any users yet since this is the first time mentioning it, so I was hoping this could be some sort of stress test as well.

  
I’m open to any ideas to improve the game or even expand on it (like leaderboards, new modes, or generation specific challenges).

If you do have some spare time please check it out, and let me know what you think. I’d really appreciate your input as I work on making it better.

webdev,"AI assistants / assistance, who owns your code","So I am increasingly using Chat GPT and it's got to the point I want to start using an editor based assistant that has access to my codebases. However I have a few serious concerns about this and actually about Chat GPT.

Let's start with Chat GPT and other chat bots that are separated from local data, is the code produced by these bots yours or theirs? Who owns the copyright? If it's theirs can you make enough changes to now own the code?

When it comes to AI integrated into an editor like VS Code, it says in on the VS Code website that your data (i.e your code) will be sent to Microsoft for them to feed into their model. I guess they have to do that to make it work at all, but again what is going on with copyright and security here? Do Microsoft now have access to your entire codebase, API tokens etc and do you have full ownership of the code it helps you write? This seems like a huge level of trust for a commercial non-partner operation to agree to, not to mention obvious security issues.

Are there any local AI models used by code editors that don't send your code to the likes of Microsoft?

webdev,The Google Calendar API is getting on my nerves...,"So I use ClickUp as my task management tool and Google Calendar to organize my day. I wanted to view all my daily tasks on my calendar and the inbuilt GCal integration that comes with ClickUp is buggy. So, being a developer I decided to put my skills to use.

I wrote a script that fetches all my open tasks from ClickUp that have a start date or a due date. It then fetches all my existing events from GCal. All the tasks fetched from ClickUp are created as events on GCal. The previously fetched events from GCal are all then deleted. This runs as a CRON every one hour on AWS Lambda (once an hour to stay within the free tier of AWS, ClickUp and Google APIs)

This runs flawlessly for a few hours after which the Google Calendar API that fetches all events from the calendar starts returning 0 events even though I have existing events on the calendar. As a result, older tasks don't get deleted from the calendar and I now have more than 20 duplicates of each task on my calendar.

Weirdly enough, if I delete the calendar and create a new one and pass the new calendar ID it again starts working flawlessly. This lasts for a few hours after which the same thing starts happening again. The Google Calendar API starts returning 0 events even though there are existing events.

webdev,Meet CSSformalize: Simplify Your Form Styling Workflow,"Hi [r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)!

Styling HTML forms can often feel like navigating a minefield. Achieving consistency across various states—such as active or focus—requires meticulous attention to detail. It's all too easy to miss a crucial style or struggle with the myriad of browser-specific prefixes like -webkit- or -moz-. This complexity can turn what should be a straightforward task into a tedious chore. Recognizing these challenges, I was motivated to create a solution that streamlines the entire process.

Thus, CSSformalize was born—a comprehensive open-source CSS framework designed to transform the way native HTML forms are styled. By leveraging CSSformalize, developers can effortlessly generate elegant and consistent form elements. This framework eliminates the need to memorize complex styles or write repetitive CSS code, offering a much-needed shortcut for both seasoned developers and newcomers alike.

webdev,Node or Springboot,"Hi Guys,

I'm thinking of adding a backend for my portfolio website (this is HTML and CSS only). My goal is to have a blog in my portfolio site.

Others said that use the tech stack that you already know. Well I know Angular 17 and Spring Boot for creating side projects.

Then others also said that it is overkill if I use a framework or library (React or Angular) for a simple website with backend (portfolio)

And also, I want to become a Java developer so I searched that most of job postings for Java position need to have knowledge on (HTML, CSS, JS/TS) or (React or Angular).

So what would you recommend?

1. Create the portfolio with vanilla js and node then all the side projects will be React/Angular and Spring boot.
2. Create all side projects with the tech stack Angular/React with Spring boot.


My purpose is to demonstrate or show to interviewer that I am knowledegeable on fundamentals of HTML CSS and JS when I show to them my portfolio.

webdev,Advice for building an app with Cloud Sync?,"Hey everyone,

I'm eyeing a project with Cloud Sync functionality as my next side project. I believe I have the skillset for most of the things the project needs except Cloud Sync, which I have never done before. I have done some googling and collected some articles covering different approaches but I would also like to ask what your recommendations would be for implementing this? 

Here is the project outline:

* Basically, the project will allow users to have an account and store a bunch of data the user enters in their client. This data is synced to all their devices, i e mobile apps and web clients where they have logged into their account.

* You cannot edit data from multiple clients at the same time in real time, but rather work from one client at a time. 

* Users don't have to be able to collaborate on editing the same data, rather each user has their own private data. A future addition might enable other users to see your data, but it's not required for now, and changes don't have to become visible to other users in real time.

* A central server and database keeps track of the data, enables login/auth etc. Probably gonna write this in PHP (Laravel) and postgres unless you tell me this is a bad idea.
* Data is viewed in a mobile app client and stored in a local SQLite database as well for scenarios when they don't have internet. If the user edits data offline, it will be synced the next time they come online. In the future, a web client will be added as well. Will write this in React / React Native because my strongest skillset is in Typescript / React.

* If the user opens another client than the one they're currently on, the current one will disable data entry in favor of the new one (user will be asked if they want to switch) so that they can't try to change the same data from multiple clients at the same time. The only way I have pushed events from a server to clients (in this case, user has opened another client so disable this one) has been with WebSockets but I assume this could be done another way too?

I would assume Cloud Sync can be implemented by adding time stamps to each row of data telling when that row was last edited, and then updating rows that have been edited after the last sync date on that device. Or would it better to pick up a ready made solution for this, and perhaps switch server technology accordingly? For example, if there is a good, readymade solution for Cloud Sync available via NPM I could write the server with express, feathers or what have you instead.

webdev,"Your first project, from a business owner's perspective","I recently decided to start my own online bakery. Because I have a background in programming, I also decided to make the website myself. After completing most of it, I realized that what I had learned would be valuable to people starting off. Often it is the case that new web developers aren't sure where to start. They aren't sure what kind of a project would look good to show potential employers. The following is a list of things I ended up needing for my site, each of which would be excellent things to code.

Order submit form.  
• Layout: I started out using a column design. It looked great on my PC, but once I switched to my phone, it was a garbled mess. First lesson: make sure your design works for everyone.  
• Updating totals: Whenever the user changes the number of ordered items from 1 to 2, update the subtotal. Take into consideration shipping and tax as well. Know what event to trigger this on. There is onchange and oninput, for example. Users are often able to bypass these triggers when they copy and paste data in. Know how to deal with that.  
• Restrict input: Should it only be numbers? Only letters? Only a certain length? Restrict it. Learn how to use regex also. It's scary at first, but it is powerful.  
• Autocomplete, required, and read-only attributes: Sometimes autocomplete ends up making your site look tacky; it makes a dropdown field appear and that can be confusing for some users. Other times, it's handy to use. Know when to use it and when not to. Fields like subtotal, shipping, taxes, and total should be read-only.  
• Pricing: Have a single, small file that contains pricing information if you have a small site, and source this into your order page. Price figures will be used in too many places to have you going through and updating the numbers everywhere manually - they are displayed next to the products and used in the equations to calculate pricing. Having them in a small file greatly simplifies things. Obviously if it's for a large site, use a database.  
• The backend: Don't trust user input. There are various ways to screen it to avoid SQL injections depending on the language you are using. Everything you did on the front end you need to do again on the backend, and more, concerning checking that number inputs are numbers, that inputs aren't too long, that email addresses are in fact email addresses (there is a regex for this), etc.  
• Database: Insert the order into a database to save it. You will learn about the different kinds of fields like int, tiny int, date, and datetime. You will learn what specific format is acceptable for something like datetime as well.  
• Invoice: Once complete, you should show an invoice to the customer, detailing everything that was selected. Showing invoices is actually part of the Visa guidelines, which business owners will care about if they are accepting credit card transactions. Taking this a step further, you can also figure out how to automatically email the invoice to them without too much trouble.

Payment  
• Composer: Know how to use this, as many payment gateways will have you install their payment SDK this way. Know that there can be issues with trying to install it through shell access from an ftp client. It's more ideal through the terminal on your server.  
• Payment Gateways: Look at the developer guides for various payment gateways like Stripe, [Authorize.net](http://Authorize.net), and Elavon. It's also a good idea to explore their customer service, as some of them are absolute garbage. Some of them have code for Ruby, PHP, C#, etc, but others will not have one or the other. Some will have SDK's that are so out of date that they expect developers to edit the code themselves. Read the comments on the github pages to see what people are saying about it.  
• PCI Compliance: Understand the different levels of PCI Compliance, specifically SAQ A, SAQ A-EP, and SAQ D. Try to spot if the payment gateway specifically states what level of PCI Compliance you can achieve using one of their methods. If I had any advice to give here, it would be this: SAQ D is a significant step up and requires a lot of time, money, and effort to achieve. Stick to the easier ones. Lastly, do NOT have any CC data hit your server. The payment gateway should give you a nonce to use instead or take you to an entirely different payment page on their servers.  
• CC guidelines: Look at the Visa, Mastercard, and American Express guidelines. They want you to display their logos on CC forms, have specific image files for them, want specific spacing around the logo's, and specific coloration, even for the background in some cases (where their logo would be not as visible). They are even specific about capitalizing the V in Visa, and not having it as all caps: VISA. Some of these guidelines don't absolutely have to be followed, but you may be required to follow some by the agreement you signed with your acquirer, for example. For you, the new student just getting your feet wet, you don't need to go so far as to read the terms and conditions to get all this, but you still can familiarize yourself with the guidelines and attempt to adhere to them. It also offers you the chance to elaborate on what you know about this subject in interviews.  
• CC spacing: Another thing that comes from the guidelines is the spacing of the numbers in a CC for an input field. 6589756425691215 is difficult to read, but 6589 7564 2569 1215 is much easier to read. Coming up with the code to make this work is a bit tricky as well. With some solutions, using Replace() can alter the caret position, which can be jarring to the user. Copy/pasting can also bypass the event you are trying to wait for. AE cards can have 15 digits instead of 16. Some fancy CC forms also update a logo to the right of the CC number to reflect the kind of card the user is attempting to use. What first seems like a simple form can turn into a completed amount of code.  
• CC expiration dates: They should be separate - one field for the month, one for the year; limited to numbers only; limited to two digits.  
• Security field: I believe most are 3 digits long, but AE's is 4.  
• Luhn algorithm: You can use this to verify if a CC number is typed correctly.  
• Hide CC: The most ideal way to do this is to have each number of the CC that is typed be briefly visible, then switch it to an asterisk ( \* ). Simply putting the input field type as hidden will not accomplish this. I believe this is also a consideration the CC issuers want you to take, but it's not absolutely required. Always nice if you can achieve it though.

Coupons  
As a coder, you might not think this is that big of a deal, but on the business side of things, you realize this is huge when it comes to Direct Mail. Businesses will want to send out fliers through the mail. Postage is expensive, so you begin to learn about programs like EDDM through the United States Postal Service. This allows businesses to send out many fliers at significantly lower cost. You also learn about paper weights and dimensions for what is acceptable. All of this costs money. It's about $200 to hit 650 residents just for the usps side of things. The actual mailers cost around 20 cents each. As a business owner, you do not want to be blowing all this money to end up with zero new customers. This is where coupons come in. Fliers are the perfect place to put coupons, and so your website then needs to be able to process them as well. Coupons will lessen the chance that your fliers are immediately trashed.  
• Just like with pricing, have a centralized location where coupon codes can be sourced from to validate them.  
• You need to display to the user that the coupon code applied. The pricing equation needs to know what to do to account for the reduced price.  
• Consider how many coupons a user can use in a single transaction.  
• Consider if that coupon code should be used up or if it's fine to use it with infinite transactions so long as its not expired.  
• Calculate it on the backend side as well. Have a spot in the database for it so the total price makes sense if you have to investigate a customer order for some reason.  
• Have a way to remove the coupon discount if they decide they don't want to use it yet.

Security  
Fraudsters will buy millions of card numbers off the dark web, find a website with bad security, then will try to run as many of them through with a $1 charge to see which cards are still good. If you allow users to run millions of cards through, you can not only be subject to thousands of dollars worth of fines, but the credit card issuers will also then view you as a problem. Every incidence of fraud creates a problem for them, so if you are the reason, they can and will bar you from making any future online credit card transactions. Just like that, your business will have gone straight down the toilet.  
• Log IP's: Every time someone tries to run a transaction through, even if it is unsuccessful, their IP address needs to be logged in a specific table.  
• Suspension: Once an IP address has exceeded the maximum attempts allowed, that IP address should be suspended for 24 hours from making any transactions at all.  
• Absolute limits: To prevent IP spoofing, there should also be a limit to how many transactions can be attempted overall for a given time period.  
• Be careful of setting the field that counts transaction attempts as something like a tiny int. An attacker could continue to attempt transactions, running the number up to 256 where it may roll back over to 1, thereby making the system think that IP address has not exceeded the maximum transaction attempts any more. Then they of course would try to run more credit cards through. Ideally, the transaction counter for a specific IP address should stop counting once that IP address has been suspended to prevent this from happening.  
• Log IPs first; do the transaction second. Imagine this: an attacker edits a field so that it submits a bad value, causing your page to crash; however, because you have written your code in such a way as to complete the transaction first, they are still able to run millions of cards through to check them, all while avoiding the IP logging part of your code. By logging the IP addresses first however, you lessen the possibility of this occurring.

Customer Retention  
• Allow users to sign up for your website. Have a profile, settings, and order history for their account.  
• Store passwords in an appropriate way, using cryptographic algorithms and a salt.  
• Have sign-ups for monthly promotional emails and also a way to easily unsubscribe from them.

When you lay all of these things out, it really does amount to a tremendous amount of code. An employer would love to see this kind of work in an interview.

webdev,Built an web worker for my portfolio ,"Hey all, Hope you all are doing well. To give you a little background, I use sanity as a cms, and my portfolio website directly fetches details from sanity. Now, I have changed the architecture a bit. I added a new middleware web worker that fetches details from sanity according to a customized crontab rule. Currently it fetched details from sanity every day at 12 AM. And these values are exposed through an API, created using express. Now my front end requests this server instead of the sanity server. Let me know what you guys think of this approach.

webdev,Recommended tech stack / approach for simple hobby project?,"Hello all, programming beginner here!

I basically want to build a simple web app that runs **locally on my computer on** **windows** with minimal dependencies. I have created the app on linux with a cms before but i wanted to simplify it and make it more portable (ideally just copying the folder, not installing anything).

It queries the wikipedia api and lets the user add things to a list and then edit, filter and sort them smoothly. I also want to be able to add items manually to the list with file uploads and have persistent data storage.

I want to install as little as possible and make it easy to backup and transport but still maintain some good practices and learn about relevant technologies.

**What i have so far is html, css and js files and a barebones node server** that can store the data on my system in a json file. I can already add items to my list, save it and load it initially.

Do i need to use a js framework for ""stress free"" editing in the frontend or are there approaches to do dom manipulation ""better"" in vanilla nowadays?

Or would i just be better off to just do this in python? (i have no experience with it though)

webdev,The Frustration of Front-End Work,"Lately, I've got into front-end again, and during my first project I’ve been feeling completely burned out because of all the planning mistakes that keep coming up. It’s not even about the coding itself; it’s those moments when you realize you forgot to plan for something important.

Planning layouts is always like this—you can’t predict every possible scenario for every element. There’s just too much to think about, and no one’s brain can handle that much detail at once. Trying to manage all those little things in a scale from 320px to 2880px is exhausting and eats up way too much time and energy.

What’s worse is that no matter how experienced I am (and I’ve been doing this for about 10 years), no matter what methods or tricks I use, I don’t feel like I’m improving at handling this chaos.

And then there’s the issue with designers. If the designer doesn’t understand how development works, everything falls apart. The project turns into a mess of quick, hacky fixes just to make things work, and after spending hours fixing things, it’s hard to tolerate the work at all.

webdev,Dealing with Safari ITP.. 'applying cross-site tracking restrictions' always occuring?,"I just dove into Safari ITP issues yesterday, because I noticed some cookies weren't being saved. I've now enabled ITP debug mode, and when I got to my site (whether its my production live site or my dev site running locally), I see ""applying cross-site tracking restrictions:"" followed by a ton of domains. These domains include domains from plugins i have in safari, to my own domains, even 'localhost'.

As a test, I detect utm\_campaign as a query string, and save it using javascript to a local cookie. On any other browser, this occurs first time i hit my page. On safari, the cookie does NOT show up on first page load with the query string. It only appears after a refresh of the same url + query string.

Why? I actually just tried clearing my browser history entirely and the 'cross site tracking restrictions' warning has no domains now, \*BUT\*, the cookie still doesn't show up.",maxiedaniels,1h88fjy,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h88fjy/dealing_with_safari_itp_applying_crosssite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h88fjy/dealing_with_safari_itp_applying_crosssite/,2024-12-06 18:41:45,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h88fjy
webdev,Will Authentication always suck?,"The entire web dev scene is  coming to a point where authentication is annoying than ever. Something so simple in concept but the way it is being implemented has frustrated me to a point that I'm writing this because i want to know if it is only me who can't implement proper auth. 

I've used many authentication services across many architectures but in my 3 years of experience I've still not figured out a way or even guidelines that i can follow for implementing authentication across all my applications! Which completely sucks. Authentication is probably the one thing that is keeping me from developing any of my projects which is pretty stupid but if not implemented correctly it poses huge security risks.

  
So I'm writing this to well, maybe discuss what is your approach to authentication. 

  
For context, I'm a full-stack developer (MERN stack) and the problem i encounter is implementing cross-oirigin authentication, many MERN auth videos i see online they either only do it on the frontend or if they are adding auth to both the client and server, that approach is usually not practical or has security risks. I mostly succeed in adding auth to the frontend side, it is securing the backend where i usually screw up.

  
Also when i check the documentation of auth libraries (ex. clerk or next-auth) they lack documentation for client-server architecture and how to secure routes in both frontend and backend. I usually come up with my own route protection system when using any of these but again all types of questions are in my mind. 

**Is this conventional? Is this secure? Is this a good approach?**

  
Again it's not like I've not implemented authentication in a client-server architecture but it's these questions that make me doubt my way of doing things. Anyways would like to know your opinions on this!

webdev,Which field has the highest demand in freelancing,"Hello friends,

I am a Node.js backend developer with 2 years of experience. I want to start freelancing, but I have no idea how to begin. Based on a friend's suggestion, I created an account on Fiverr and made a simple gig.

My question is: which field has the highest demand in freelancing? I mean fields like frontend, backend development, WordPress, DevOps, data pipelines, data engineering, etc. I want to learn as many skills as possible so that I can set up my own business and avoid working as an employee for a company.

Over the past few months, I have met many people and attended several interviews, some of which were not even related to my field. For example, I gave a data engineering interview where I built an ETL data pipeline using Node.js, Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, and Postgres. I also interacted with companies that develop gambling websites, games, and even crack software to steal user data or bypass paid APIs for WhatsApp and Meta applications.

After working for 2 years, I have realized that most IT companies have middlemen who take a significant cut of the revenue, leaving employees with very little. I want to do something of my own.

I have a few friends who are frontend developers, full-stack developers, and UI/UX designers.

If you have any advice, please share it with me. I’d like to know what strategies I should use, which platforms I should focus on, etc.

I am not interested in frontend development, and I’m not good at designing UIs. I prefer backend development and want to explore more opportunities in server-side technologies. Should I explore fields like DevOps or data engineering?

Thank you.

webdev,working with users location,"tldr: ive got an app that asks the user for location and stores in a localstorage but its giving me issues. I'm looking for a write-up or some tips on how to handle users location within a react/next app. 

full story-

i plan on using location throughout the app, so I was planning on using a context. one issue is whether I should ask for location on load, which means any page that gets loaded would ask for users location, even on pages its not needed. for this I could add a second function in my context like fetchLocation and on pages location is needed, if !location fetchLocation. so now I need to check for this every page location is needed?

also, some people don't like to share location. In a way I don't want to bother with them, but I should try to handle this and at least handle it gracefully rather than have the page error. i was considering using an API call to try to get some location from an IP address, or maybe just let people pick a city they'd want to use

the main page for this is an events page that uses location and also can move a map and get lat/lng so there's some logic to change the event location. somewhere in there I'm getting things mixed up and on initial load the maps trying to load without either and erroring. maybe if the first two were worked out I wouldn't fall into this. but I'm clearly doing something out of order. for example when testing in incognito, the page fails as the request to use location is still on the screen.

webdev,Help me choose a stack for my freelance portfolio,"Hi folks,

I'm a freelance dev currently revamping my old portfolio - which doesn't really showcase my skills - and I have trouble choosing a stack for it.

Let me explain:  
I'm a front-end developer with a specialty with CSS / integrations but also a WordPress developer, so I do lots of PHP too. I'm really not used to JS Framework, either front or back end, so I could use this occasion to learn one !  
Since the goal of this website is to present both my front-end and my WordPress services, I'm not sure which way I can go.  
Basically, I've narrowed it down to these four choices :

* **A WordPress with a homemade ACF/Gunterberg theme :** Seems logical since I do lots of WP sites anyway.
* **Just a from scratch HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS website :** Simple enough, I can add a tad of PHP for a contact form. Not even a back-office to add projects, I could to it manually, old-school style.
* **Another CMS like ProcessWire :** An occasion for me to learn some more CMS and not to bother creating a back-office of some sort.
* **Use a JS Framework like Vue.js or React :** I feel way behind modern webdev and I could use a bit of experience. But it might be overkill for a simple portfolio. I could use a boilerplate to have a backoffice/admin and such

Soooo, if I promote among others services, Wordpress dev, it is better to go this way ? Or should I just learn something modern and new ?

webdev,DON'T BUY DOMAINS FROM GODADDY!!!! SCAM!!!!!,"I recently had a terrible experience with GoDaddy, and I feel compelled to warn others about their unethical and exploitative practices. 

Here's the list what they do (according to what i observed so far)  :-

1. **Deceptive Domain Availability**: When I searched for a domain, it was initially shown as cheap and available. However, shortly afterward, it was claimed as unavailable, marked as a ""premium domain,"" and priced ridiculously high.
2. **GoDaddy Monopolizes Domains**: I noticed that every domain I searched for was suddenly ""claimed"" by GoDaddy. Visiting these domains leads to their landing page, where they sell the domain at inflated prices or suggest hiring a broker—essentially forcing users to overpay for domains they initially showed as affordable.
3. **WHOIS Confirms Suspicious Practices**: When I checked WHOIS information for one of the domains, here’s what I found:

https://preview.redd.it/meuivvga995e1.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51bcfc6eddabc92886686167d641e4309cbcea13

4. It’s clear that GoDaddy is holding these domains through their proxy service, making them unavailable to regular users unless they pay a premium

5. **Unfair Market Manipulation**: GoDaddy is deliberately creating scarcity by claiming domains people search for and reselling them at inflated prices. This is not just unethical; it’s exploitative and undermines trust in domain registration services.

💡 **What You Can Do**:

* Avoid GoDaddy at all costs! Use alternative domain registrars like Namecheap, Hostinger, Cloudflare or Porkbun.
* Be cautious when searching for domains, as GoDaddy seems to track interest and manipulate availability to force you to pay more.

⚠️ **Conclusion**:  
GoDaddy’s practices are a blatant scam, designed to exploit users searching for domains. They manipulate the market to extort money and provide no transparency in the process. Stay away from GoDaddy and use trustworthy alternatives instead!

this happen for all the domain i checked specially (.com) all the one also don't say .com are popular in demand then why it available and now its register then why now and why after i checked and why all and why all the domain are directing to godaddy not once to their registered owners website

webdev,"Recently, I have been trying out LLMs for coding and they are surprisingly bad for anything even a tiny bit complex?","Since LLMs (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.) became popular, I have used them for basic things, but only sporadically for coding. Recently, I was entrusted a Vue 3 codebase, and since I didn't know Vue, I thought to myself: Why not get some help from AI? So, I started trying out different models and to my surprise, it's incredible how even basic things such as flexbox in component styling is just too much for them. Anything that has to do with styling, really, that goes beyond ""Set this component's border color to light gray"". If you use Vuetify and custom style classes, then the machine just doesn't WTH is going on anymore. Also, I tried it to make it tell me the difference between React's portals and Vue 3's teleport functionality, and it was disappointing to say the least. The fun became real, though, when I asked it how to teleport a Vue 3 component into a Cytoscape JS node; After 30 minutes or so of back and forth prompting, I gave up, and this is in general how my sessions end: With time wasted, frustration and back at the start of the task.

Other behaviours I have noticed are:

* In the same chat, repeating the same answer to different prompts (this is typical of Mistral), even though you try to nudge it in the right direction by telling it the answer wasn't satisfactory.
* Making up random stuff, e.g., CSS directives or a function's options and then saying ""My bad, you're right. Function x doesn't have the option y"".
* Mixing up versions (e.g., Vue 2 patterns in Vue 3)

... and more.

Honestly, the majority of the time it's useless. Also, for beginners, this is probably the worst one can do to learn programming, people should stay the hell away from it under they have some experience under the belt. Ultimately, I agree that it's just a fancy information retrieval algo and nothing more, and for basic, simple info, it's infinitely superior to e.g. Google.",skwyckl,1h7wmcg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7wmcg/recently_i_have_been_trying_out_llms_for_coding/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h7wmcg/recently_i_have_been_trying_out_llms_for_coding/,2024-12-06 08:11:38,218,0.85,218,0,237,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7wmcg

webdev,The Rise of AgentWeb,"This is something I have been thinking about recently. Basically the idea how the Web is going to evolve in the future with AI. You can read the whole thing at my post, but just to flag a few things here:

""The web is splitting into two distinct futures: one driven by relentless AI agents, the other shaped by human hands. It fills me with both excitement and sadness - excited by the possibilities of AI-driven efficiency, yet nostalgic for the craftsmanship of a human touch. Let's dive into what this means for the future of web development and ownership.

# The Rise of AgentWeb

The AgentWeb represents the industrialisation of web development, where AI agents autonomously build, maintain, and optimise websites at scale. These digital properties will be born in vast WebFarms (remember Bitcoin farms?) where AI systems handle everything from design decisions to content optimisation and user experience refinement.

For website owners, this means hands-off management with AI handling:

* Complete brand identity creation and evolution
* Content creation and SEO optimisation
* Automated maintenance and security updates
* Real-time performance monitoring and optimisation
* User experience refinement through continuous testing
* Integrated social media presence and content distribution

# The Future Renaissance of ArtisanWeb

On the flip side, we might be witnessing a renaissance of handcrafted websites. Like craft beer versus mass-produced lagers, ArtisanWeb represents the boutique approach to web development. I can imagine content on the web being labeled Handcrafted by a Human or No AI Was Used in Creating This Content.

The interesting thing is that while handcrafted web will be proud to display these labels, web farms would not do the opposite: AI Generated Content. They are likely to try to fake that they are really hand-made content. In the same way [browsers once faked their identities to gain compatibility](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/?ref=mantcz.com), AI-generated websites might strive to mimic human craftsmanship to gain trust—a new battle for authenticity in the AI driven digital age.""

I am curious to hear what people think.

webdev,Learndash and FluentCRM API related issue ,"Hi folks,

I am running a WordPress site hosted on Rapyd Cloud and the site uses LearnDash as the LMS, FluentCRM for managing email engagement, and WP Fusion for advanced syncing. I also use Uncanny Automator and LearnDash Notifications for additional functionality.

Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:

When a student completes a topic in LearnDash, I want to log the completion date in a custom field within FluentCRM for that student.

After 7 or 14 days, I want to check if the student has started the next topic in the course.

If no progress is detected within those two weeks, FluentCRM should trigger an automated email encouraging them to continue.

I’ve written a PHP function using LearnDash’s hooks and FluentCRM’s API to update the custom field, but it’s not working. The completion date isn’t being stored in FluentCRM, and I’m unsure if the issue is with the hook, the API call, or something else.

I also reached out to Rapyd Cloud’s support to check if it might be a server-related issue, but they confirmed it’s more of an application-level concern and suggested I check with LearnDash or FluentCRM.

Some questions I have:

Is learndash\_topic\_completed the correct hook for this, or is there a better one to use?

Is there a more reliable way to update FluentCRM custom fields programmatically?

For the follow-up, should I consider using WP Fusion’s tagging features or a cron job for better reliability?

Here are the relevant documentation links I’ve been looking through:

LearnDash Developer Docs

FluentCRM API Docs

WP Fusion Documentation

If anyone has set up something similar or can point out where I might be going wrong, I’d really appreciate your help! Let me know if you need more details.

I currently have a simple game website averaging about 400 users per day and 10,000 views per week. It’s a little puzzle game that resets every 24 hours.

After a couple months of very little interaction it has built up to this point completely organically over a few months, but the growth is slowing.

So what do now? Try and advertise the site? Put google ads on the site and hopefully get $20-30 per week hoping not to alienate the users?

webdev,How to communicate better during meetings? ,"I’m a new developer and an issue I’m facing is being able to clearly communicate the challenges of a task during team meetings. Sometimes clients would make requests to add something new or modify something prebuilt that sounds easy to do in theory but poses a great technical challenge. It could either be something entirely impossible to do or beyond my skillset. I’ve found when I try to communicate the difficulties, I’m being seen as “not having a can do attitude” or “not wanting to do the hard work”. Boss would interrupt me and tell me I just have to figure something out. 

I feel that my job as a developer is to clearly communicate the possibilities of what the client is asking for and/or provide possible solutions. But my boss just wants me to pretty much say yes to whatever and I think it’s because the more time I spend on the project the more he can charge the client. This may mean going away with a task then doing absolutely nothing and saying I’ve tried xyz and it didn’t work whereas this whole bullshit could’ve been avoided in the first place. I’m getting paid so not exactly complaining but this feels exploitative. 

And the other developers although understand the scope of the task, they just agree with the boss and the client to stay on their good side because it’s gonna be me doing the work anyways and not them. Also during calls they would briefly look at my code and confirm with the client exactly what I’ve said which I find disrespectful because I’m the one who wrote the code yet the client is more trusting towards someone who’s not even part of the project.

webdev,Trying to pull a list of metrics available via public APIs,"I'm sorry in advance if this is not the right sub to ask this question but I'm looking to pull a comprehensive list of all public metrics available via some social media APIs and was curious if anyone knows where I can get it or any other guidance.

I've been able to figure out where to pull the data but I'm not a developer so trying to get a gauge of what's available first.

Facebook | Page Public Content Access -  
Looks like you can pull public metrics but as far as I can tell, the doc points you to the general insights doc that lists all metrics and without having an approved app, I'm not sure how to properly verify the metrics available.

Instagram | Business Discovery -  
I know I can get the media, followers count as well as total likes and comments, but is there more that is available?

Linkedin -

webdev,Was interviewer being picky?,"I completed a relatively simple task for a Frontend Developer position. One part involved making a single word in a block of HTML bold.

I chose to wrap the word in a &lt;span&gt; tag and assign it a class, applying font-weight via CSS. However, the interviewer pointed out that this wasn’t the best approach and recommended using the &lt;strong&gt; tag for semantic reasons.

I understand their perspective, but aren’t both approaches valid? My reasoning was that if design requirements changed in a real-world scenario (e.g., the bold word needed a different color or style later), it would be easier to manage through CSS without touching the HTML structure.

Was the interviewer being overly picky, or is there a stronger case for using &lt;strong&gt; in this context? I’m open to feedback and willing to admit if I was mistaken.

webdev,Best Practices for Synchronizing Supabase Auth and Local Database in a NestJS App,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I’m working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What’s the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?
* Any tips for optimizing this flow for scalability and maintaining clean code?",Aymsep,1h6f2g6,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6f2g6/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6f2g6/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,2024-12-04 12:41:55,1,0.6,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h6f2g6

webdev,Genuinely do you need a JS framework?,"Genuinely do you need a JS framework?

I was just talking with some coworkers, and one of them brought up that they think the bell curve meme around the use of JS frameworks would be low IQ - use framework, mid IQ - just use base HTML CSS JS, high IQ - you must use a JS framework.

Personally I am of the opinion that JS frameworks have their place but for the vast majority of websites you don't need anything other than a templating language and vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

I've certainly written webapps that required the use a JS framework, but I would hardly call those websites they were more extremely complicated web apps that simply could not have been made without the use of a framework.

But that's the exception and 99% of all websites on the internet don't need anything more than HTML + a templating language for format, CSS for layout and prettiness, and JavaScript for interactivity (frankly HTML and CSS get you 90% of your interactivity), server requests, and content reactivity. There's a reason 80% of the internet is PHP, and why libraries like HTMX, and frameworks like Astro are becoming so popular - because they just get out of your way.

I sort of responded that for work and for personal projects I mainly build websites using no framework, and I asked why does he think that's the shape of the bell curve. But he didn't seem open to having a dialogue about it, and just kept responding ""it's just what it is"" with a really smug smile. And I didn't want to push it further / potentially start any conflict with a coworker so I dropped it.

I just feel like frameworks add so much complexity and overhead to development (unless your app truly absolutely needs it), that it's really unnecessary and creates so much work compared to using no framework and at the end of the day your user won't notice a difference. 

Runtimes, CSS modules, picking/learning a package, package specific JS, npm packages, typescript, webpack, docker, build tools, hosting... Homie this is a static page that fetches content on load and sends basic CRUD requests to the server, I could have it finished and hosted before you have your environment set up and project initiated. And mine will be functional with JS disabled and for users with 3G connections.

webdev,"How do server-sent event ""streams"" work on a lower level?","Hi, and sorry for the lack of a tl;dr; - I'm not sure how to get away from providing the context. Basically I'm interested in connecting to a web server and consuming [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) using a lower level HTTP API and am hoping somebody can explain how the push vs pull of these events might work at a lower level.

I'm working on a hardware project (ESP32-S3 / espressif ESP-IDF based) where I'm writing C with a bit of higher level abstraction to support HTTP interactions. For example, the methods I might call are:

* `esp_http_client_open()`: Open the HTTP connection with write_len parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set write_len=0 for read-only connection.
* `esp_http_client_fetch_headers()`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). 
* `esp_http_client_read()`: Read the HTTP stream
* `esp_http_client_close()`: Close the connection.

([more examples / docs are here if you're currious](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client.html#http-stream))

Now what I'm trying to figure out is what `esp_http_client_read()` actually is doing in terms of the server to client communication. When I connect to a server over HTTP, and assuming `keep-alive`, I can call `esp_http_client_read()` every millisecond, or I can wait 100 milliseconds and call it. Both ""work"" in that if there is no data being sent from the server, nothing will happen, and if there is data, I'll read it and be able to do something with it. _edit: for clarity because it may be non-obvious, my intention is to have my hardware device connect to a server and stay connected to it indefinitely, waiting for the server to send data using server-sent events - so picture a while(true) loop, but I'm responsible myself for checking when new data comes in_

But I don't have a good sense of what it means to ""read data"" in an already open HTTP stream. As far as I'm aware, for this type of connection (which is similar as far as I understand to a chunked response), nothing is communicated to the server asking for more data for example, it's certainly not like an additional HTTP request is being made. I'm guessing ""read data"" just checks some sort of lower level buffer handled by the WiFi chip or some lower subsystem. I'm guessing if I chose to ""read data"" from an HTTP connection the server is none the wiser. 

That said, I also might 100% wrong, and perhaps (like other forms of communication) part of the underlying protocol is a message to the server that you've read data. This might not be important to the server, but perhaps it acts as a sort of heartbeat. 

My end goal here is to understand how often I should call ""read data"" in my code optimizing for quickly getting updates from the server but also not having any negative impact on the server or taking up needless CPU cycles by reading data every millisecond when once every 50ms would suffice for my needs. 

I'm hoping somebody in the web dev community who perhaps has more experience or a better understanding of lower level HTTP ""stuff"" might be able to understand the spirit of what I'm asking and help me understand.

I recently purchased a **Standard SSL certificate** from GoDaddy,  and i called the help desk and they told me to switch to **AutoSSL** because it automatically handles SSL installations and renewals, and I’d rather not manage SSL certificates manually.... 

Here's what I've done so far:

1. **Purchased a Standard SSL** from GoDaddy.
2. Installed the certificate manually via **cPanel**.
3. I saw that my certificate is self-signed in cPanel.

# What I want to do:

  
Make my website work.

I want **AutoSSL** to take over and automatically install and renew my SSL certificates. I’ve checked my cPanel, but I **don’t see an option for AutoSSL** anywhere in the **SSL/TLS Manager** or **SSL/TLS Status** sections. I also don’t see an option to **enable AutoSSL** in cPanel.

# Questions:

1. **Am I missing something?** Should AutoSSL be available by default, or is it something that needs to be enabled by GoDaddy?
2. **How do I get AutoSSL working for my domain?** Do I need to enable it manually, or does GoDaddy handle that?
3. **Is AutoSSL only available on specific hosting plans?** I'm on a basic hosting plan, so I’m wondering if AutoSSL is available for my plan.

If anyone has had similar issues with GoDaddy and cPanel, I’d really appreciate any advice on how to get AutoSSL up and running.

Thank you so much for the help. ",computer21,1h6324w,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6324w/standard_ssl_to_autossl_in_cpanel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6324w/standard_ssl_to_autossl_in_cpanel/,2024-12-04 00:35:05,5,1.0,5,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6324w

I am someone that is currently using GroupMe as an app for social messaging. 

I am currently trying to add a function to the app which allows one to use the at(@)all function to tag each person in the group chat for certain things. 

I am currently using the guide down below 

[https://dev.to/hawkinjs/using-hubot-to-mention-everyone-in-groupme-3ge](https://dev.to/hawkinjs/using-hubot-to-mention-everyone-in-groupme-3ge)

I have currently already 1) created a GroupMe bot through the Groupme development page, 2) downloaded the Hubot simulator through the CMD command line and lastly 3) have forked the particular GitHub repository that is provided in the link above .

The only problem is that the last step requires you to create an account with Heroku in order to create an app and deploy the GitHub depository to it and add a few other variables. 

The problem is that in order to do this Heroku requires you to add a card and you will be charged for conducting this service. 

Is there a free or open source workaround this that still allows you to create an app, deploy GitHub repo and allow you to add the code to get GroupMe functionality?

I entered into a hackathon and my team and I tried to assist with a wide range of problems teachers and students face in classrooms. Our solution was deemed very broad during the elevator pitch and that we needed to focus on solving a specific problem. My team and I were very discouraged until we spoke to a teacher who gave us a specific problem they wish was fixed so we focused on that and we won the hackathon. 

Since then I’ve been trying to find a problem to fix but it isn’t easy. When I was struggling at my lowest during that hackathon the solution LITERALLY walked through the door and gave me the problem to solve. That doesn’t happen too often.

recently I have been feeling pretty shit. I work at a big office corporation as a software engineer. Work is not that exciting. I am definitelly burning out and starting to hate sitting in front of a monitor in order to pay rent. 

So I've been trying to manage this feeling by doing something tactile after work, like knitting and fixing stuff around the house. One evening it dawned on me that I could get like another 'fallback' skill just in case I decide to ditch my developer career. 

I am looking for suggestions on what I could currently handle in my situation and what I could develop as a skill that could maybe one day be my fulltime gig. For contex - I'm male, living in eastern europe, mid twenties.   
  
The limitations are:

* it must be something I could get good at just by learning/practicing at home; 
* preferably not involving staring at a screen;
* is paid fairly well; 
* will not be redundant in 5-10 years; 
* doesn't cost a lot of financial investment immediately; 

So far I've considered, tufting custom rugs, working with silver jewelry, woodworking handyman (shelves, cutting boards ect), bathroom tiling, nail technitian, massagist and aromatherapy.

webdev,Can't get everything recolored correctly for custom css.,"\[SOLVED\]

I am trying to learn css by creating a general custom css that works for all website in the nord theme. I took the solarized-everything project and tried to add a generic nord theme for all site.

In some websites, e.g. reddit, this bit from the pictures for replies don't seem to get recolored.

Other things in reddit that doesn't get recolored is the markdown editor box for post. Home popular, explore tabs when they are highlighted etc. Others relatively blend in but the subsequent thread line for replies and hide replies area are very jarring to see.

How do I fix this?

\[SOLUTION\]

It was taking a global variable `--color-neutral-background`

However setting the variable in `:root` didn't work but setting it to `*` worked

\[[Here](https://github.com/jojowakaki/dots/blob/main/config/qutebrowser/solarized-everything-css/css/nord-dark-all-sites.css)\] is the css just in case somone is interested.

    :root{
    --color-neutral-background: #xxxxxxxx !important;
    } /*doesn't work */
    
    * {
    --color-neutral-background: #xxxxxxx !important;

webdev,Can anyone explain how scrollbars  determine which element they get attached to? Mine is getting attached to the body for whatever reason and don't really understand it...,"I have encountered the worst problem in my web dev project. **SCROLLBARS**

Imagine implementing a *simple* chat system and you know nothing about websockets and broadcasting yet the **worst roadblock** is getting the scrollbar to go down in a react app.. I can get it to go down when I set `h-[some value]` but it won't go down otherwise...

So I throw in some `overflow` magic. Nah uh, the scrollbar ain't moving an inch.. I do all my scrollbar effecting witchcraft (looking at you **tailwind**) on the element that I think is managing the scrollbar. It did not move one inch. Then I change the potions, seems like `useEffect` ain't cutting it, so my truth sayer (**chat gpt**) recommended `useLayoutEffect`  and it still did not work. Then I go on a hunt for the element which the scroll bar is getting attached to.

Turns out it is getting attached to the body element. I was able to confirm this by adding overflow-hidden to the parent components one by one and it only worked on the body element!!

Now the realization hit me, I know nothing of scrollbars. I can't seem to find a resource to actually learn what it is relevant to my current **context**. I have spent hours on this problem and can't seem to figure it out.

EDIT: Did not add code because idk if it is allowed here

webdev,Monorepo architecture and scopes,"Monorepo architecture

Hi there! I’m using NX with Angular for a monorepo (but I don’t think this issue is specific to Angular nor NX) (4 projects, multiple libraries). As the repo is growing, the current library structure feels unsustainable, and responsibilities between modules are becoming unclear. Here's the current setup:

# Current Library Structure

1. `libs/features`
   * Each ""screen"" (micro-frontend) gets its own library.
   * **Problem:** Shared logic across screens creates overlapping responsibilities.
2. `libs/services`
   * Libraries aligned with backend microservices, split into subcategories:
      * **UI:** Frontend-specific logic/components for an ""entity"" such as order-card.
      * **Feature:** Core functionality (but sometimes imports across services, which feels wrong). Could be a smart search screen for orders, an oder dialog etc.
      * **Data-access:** Backend-specific data handling logic. Like order-rest/websockets
   * **Problem:** The ""feature"" sub-lib crosses boundaries and doesn’t align with service isolation. And it doesnt seem to make sense since its generally more defined by the wanted frontend functionality.
3. `libs/shared`
   * Shared functionality, including:
      * Config
      * Notifications handling
      * Shared UI components not tied to entities

# Questions

1. **UI Libraries**
   * Should all UI components be consolidated under `libs/shared/ui` and divided into sub-libraries/categories (e.g., `shared/ui/&lt;category&gt;`)?
2. **Backend vs. Frontend Domains**
   * Should backend-related libraries only include `data-access` and avoid mixing in UI or feature logic?
   * Should the frontend code be reorganized into ""frontend domains,"" where each domain encapsulates:
      * Shared business logic
      * Specific screens (which could eventually become micro-frontends)?

# Goals

* **Clear separation of concerns**
* **Sustainable structure as the repo grows**
* **Logical boundaries between backend services and frontend domains**

# How should I reorganize my libraries to achieve this?

  
Really grateful for any inputs or direction. Im feeling a bit lost at how to best structure this. I think the way to go is splitting things up more by front-end domains. But what sort of library types would be suitable, and which scopes and types should be limited from importing what?

I remember the saying ""if something is free, you're the product"". I'm wondering if that's the case here.

Same goes for Microsoft copilot as well, and that one can generate unlimited images while chatgpt has a limit on free tier. And it's much better at image generation from what I've experienced so far. Response -wise, free tier chatgpt can still kick copilots ass though.

webdev,Best WYSIWYG website editor with full website control? (Leaving Squarespace),"I’m migrating my photography website away from Squarespace because it’s too limiting. I can’t manage my web pages and other media files directly (no FTP or local mounting), making it impossible for me to automate webpage creation amongst other things. 

This makes managing the many photo galleries I have, and something as simple as linking full-res images to every photo a huge pain. The latter is not even possible on Squarespace—when you upload a 12 MP photo to a gallery, it gets downsampled to 1-2 MP and there's no way to view the original-resolution file. Nor can I link the original resolution file to that gallery preview. 

I need a platform where I can control the entire website structure (individual HTML pages and media), ideally with local file system access via FTP or similar. My goal is to use Python scripts to automate tasks like generating new galleries/web pages, uploading images, and linking previews inside a gallery to full-resolution files (Squarespace forcibly downsamples images and the full-res versions are inaccessible to the end user).

What platforms would you recommend for this level of customization? Note that I do prefer a WYSIWYG editor so that I'm not spending hours setting stuff up from scratch, but when I need to do more powerful things like change sections across all my photo galleries, I want the option for stuff like multi-file regex replacements across all my galleries' HTML files.

webdev,Is This Login/Signup System Secure and Efficient? Looking for Feedback,"Hi, I’ve built a login/signup system for my website and would love your feedback. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sign-Up Flow**

* User fills out name, email, password (validated for strength) and completes hCaptcha.
* Frontend sends a POST request to /api/auth/register with user data and hCaptcha token.
* Server validates data, verifies hCaptcha, and creates a ""pending user"" with:
   * Hashed password, 6-digit OTP (valid 5 mins), and expiration (30 mins).
* OTP is emailed to the user for verification.
* On valid OTP, a user account is created, and the pending entry is removed.

**2. Sign-In Flow**

* User enters email/password.
* Server verifies credentials and creates a session via NextAuth.
* On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

**3. Additional Security**

* Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
* Failed logins tracked for account lockout.
* Background task clears expired pending users every 5 minutes.
* Password resets use the same OTP process as registration.

**4. Session Management**

* Handled by NextAuth with token storage in cookies.

**Questions:**

* Is this secure enough?
* Any improvements to the email verification or overall flow?
* Other tips for a better user experience or security?

Is this because Google has gotten better at loading the articles when it crawls so gating it behind a paywall doesn't matter anymore for SEO?

I've learned so far I can make a lot with HTML and CSS, and I've played around with Scratch. I think I will be able to figure out the game-making.  However, a feature of this website would be for the user to be able to draw a card/picture/.gif in between turns of a game, or there to be a stop point before you can continue with a game.  My goal is to have potentially hundreds of decks/libraries available for a user to select as their question set prior to playing the game (for example - a deck with R sounds, a deck with action .gifs for expressive language tasks, a short video clip, etc)

Would I be able to have a library within HTML/CSS, or should I look at using a different language?

Backend: Node.js (Express), Supabase (as includes auth)  
Frontend: React (+ React Query), Tailwind CSS  
Hosting: Railway (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), S3 (Images)

However I have no experience with React, Tailwind, Vercel or Supabase (just vanilla CSS + JS, HTML/EJS, PostrgreSQL, hosting on Railway)

So really I want some help understanding:

1. Over the next 3 months, am I likely to have saved more time by learning React + Tailwind + Supabase or is it better to stick with my vanilla stack if I'm aiming to maximise progress in 3 months?
2. If I were to create my MVP using my current ""vanilla"" stack and hire a software dev in 3 months, would there likely be lots of technical debt to overcome or would converting to the new stack be relatively easy?

React seems to be the really big one to learn, so I'm also considering just learning tailwind + supabase, and leaving React for later.

webdev,Recommended Architecture for Small Business Site,"I’ve been tasked with making a site with a reservation system for my family’s business. All the costumers are within the state and reservations will only occur 2 months of the year. 

Although a serverless architecture could be less expensive (probably free) I’m thinking of just getting a cheap vps instead. Idk tho. I was initially thinking about using next.js but the site needs very little reactivity. It’s basically just a form so using a frontend framework seems excessive. I could probably get away with using web components. 

I need a form with up-to-date info for making reservations and a basic CRUD admin dashboard (and therefore auth)

What are your thoughts on what technology and frameworks i should use? With so many products nowadays it seems impossible to decide. 

My current thoughts are:
Express + EJS + Web Components (when reactivity is needed) on a VPS and possibly SQLite on the VPS

Or

Next.js + Supabase + Edge function stuff I don’t really understand or Cloudflare worker/pages or whatever",Over-Distribution570,1h538ps,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h538ps/recommended_architecture_for_small_business_site/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h538ps/recommended_architecture_for_small_business_site/,2024-12-02 19:22:36,1,0.67,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h538ps
webdev,"I can not gain traction, short shory","Hi, 

I just wanted to share my not-short but not-long journey. I have been doing freelancing on the side as a full-time developer for some time. I noticed that the competition is too high to get jobs on Upwork and make money. So, I slowly transitioned to indie hacker, solopreneur, entrepreneur, CEO, founder, or whatever you would like to call it because I wanted to scale. With the speed of AI, it is very easy to do small projects; with Vercel, it is very easy to deploy them. But that is it.

Building does not mean anything. If I were to build a website/app that does quantum calculations. It will remain as a hidden gem. It will be useless. Marketing is hard. It is much harder than software development. If I don’t stay active on social media and don’t comment on everything literally, everything. All the graphs goes to zero immediately. 

Like, I am not saying I built the quantum computer. That’s also the other thing. I am making these stupid projects. So that at some point  I would get the inspiration for the big thing, but that is also not happening. I don’t want to quit yet. But this is not just about just shipping it. It consumes more than a full-time job. It needs dedication, unfortunately, and most importantly, it needs luck. 

A thread of luck, an algorithm picking it up, and you are done for. You don’t need to try anymore, and I am very sorry about it. Because luck never strikes me.

webdev,I've created a sports competitions draw simulator,"Hey guys!

I'd like to introduce you to **DICEDRAW**, a web project that I've been developing with great pleasure recently. It's a website dedicated to **simulating draws for sports competitions**, currently focused on soccer. It already has draws for the Champions League, Europa League and, more recently, the new Club World Cup. The latter deserves a special mention because we're only a few days away from the official draw, and we can see how things might end up lining up.

The idea is that each draw respects the specific rules of each competition. In other words, nothing will be seen that goes against the rules of the entities. I've also included the new league stages of UEFA competitions, such as the Champions League, which has replaced the group stage.

If you have any suggestions or even ideas for other competitions you'd like to see there, let me know! I'm also accepting contributions to the project's repository, in case you want to get your hands on the code. And if you find it useful, leave a star there, it always gives you a boost of motivation.

I intend to continue evolving the project, and it would be great to have your feedback to make it even better!

* Customizable sizes for additional use cases.

webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,133,0.82,133,0,183,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

I have no plans to scale it at first but it might require it down the line so my thought was to dabble in microservices for the app because different parts need different things and my thought are might as well try it out.

My question is I plan to use SSO with ad azure / passport so I don't have to put alot of thought in authentication process, but I'm bad at researching and I just want to know if treating authentication  as a microservices is a bad idea/ practice or is the logic sound?

My thought process is I can break things down by best tools for them, hence why the microservices 

Catalogue/Inventory nest , db
Notification/task/chat. Realtime database / web sockets 
Analysis/reports - pandas and maybe fast API depending 
Transfers - not sure yet but I image I need realtime data or worse case some integration with the shipping software that is used .

webdev,Drizzle anyone?,"So I started this project a while ago fire the website concept I have.  I had a developer, but they got busy with a new job.  At first I was going to do the front end and she was going to to the back, but it just made way more sense for her to do full stack.  They did React on the frontend with an Express/JS backend. Drizzle for ORM and PostgreSQL for the database.  I’m still pretty much a newb at all things that’s not just a static page with HTML/CSS and a lil bit of JS.  So I’m looking for someone to follow in their footsteps.  DM me if interested!  

Edit - I have a price in mind, but it’s negotiable for anyone doing me

Edit - here is the last post I made 8 months ago that attracted my previous developer:

So I thought myself front end development…


I’ve had this idea for a job board for forever.  But everyone was way too expensive to hire. So I started teaching myself coding at the middle of last year.   The journey had been up and down, but now I’m at a point where I’m comfortable with front end development.  The problem is, now I need to learn the back end, and I am very burnt out after spending all my nights and some weekends to get to where I’m at now.  So I’ve been looking at different options, here they are:

1. Pay $10,000 for someone to start my project and hopefully have a mvp by the end of it.  I have a better job now, so I can save the money in probably a few months
2. Continue to learn, whether it be self learning or taking a class.  Self learning is cool, but I have no one to ask questions to.  And taking a class would take far too long.  

Those both are a little far away for my liking.  So, I thought of a new idea today!  I thought about just hiring a backend developer.  I could build the front, which would save me lots of money, and someone could do the backend.  The only issue is, I have no idea on how to hire a backend developer.  Do I hire a company?  Do I try and get a freelancer?  If so from where?  I’ve looked at fivver and that option doesn’t work for me because I need someone I can have a conversation with and I don’t understand accents very well in learning environments.  Upwork seems promising, but I have my doubts.

* [https://japan-dev.com/](https://japan-dev.com/)

I understand, correct me if I'm wrong here, that all of those websites could be built from scratch using the 3 mentioned technologies, but I assume that's not what people do in practice?

I'm basically looking for guidance as to what I should learn (maybe there's a solid beginner stack or something?) to build similar websites by myself.

I'm also wondering if those websites (especially the first one is designed by ""hand"" or if they are using some kind of kit or a prebuilt design?

webdev,Managing High-Volume Notifications with Digest (Batching) Strategies,"I'm implementing a notification system using [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) that needs to handle high message volumes without overwhelming users. 

I'd like to share my current approach and get feedback on potential improvements.

**Context:**

* Building a collaborative app with frequent updates (comments, file changes, tags)
* Using Novu as the notification infrastructure
* Need to prevent notification fatigue while ensuring important updates reach users
* Currently implementing in Node.js with PostgreSQL backend

**Current Implementation:** I've developed two digest strategies in Novu:

1. **Time-Window Digest / Batching:** 

&amp;#8203;

     // Using Novu to collect events in a 3-day digest window  
    const digestResult = await novu.digest(""digest-3-days"", {
      backoffUnit: 'days',
      backoffAmount: 3,
      digestKey: 'userId',
      events: notifications
    });  
    
    // Send digest via Novu
    await novu.trigger('digest-notification', {
      to: {
        subscriberId: userId,
      },
      payload: {
        events: digestResult.events,
        totalCount: digestResult.events.length
      }
    });

2. **Look-Back Pattern:**

    const shouldDigest = async (userId, eventType) =&gt; {
      const recentNotification = await novu.getNotificationHistory({
        subscriberId: userId,
        type: eventType
      });
      return Date.now() - recentNotification.timestamp &lt; ONE_DAY;
    };

Here is a visual representation I'm referring to - but with much smaller batching time window:

[Digest \/ Event Aggregation ](https://preview.redd.it/qozoe9akbf4e1.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301cfb85c68526175d084b86374fa8f3c29a3c21)

**Interesting Discovery -** [OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/journeys#time-window)**'s Time Window Approach:** While researching this, I found OneSignal's implementation of time windows interesting.   
  
They use a different approach where you can:

* Define specific allowed time periods (e.g., Tuesday 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST)
* Set intelligent delivery delays that randomly distribute notifications within allowed windows
* Handle out-of-window notifications by scheduling them for the next available window

For example, if you set a notification to trigger outside of Tuesday 1-6 PM PST, their system automatically schedules it for a random time within next Tuesday's window. This helps prevent notification clustering at window boundaries.

**Technical Challenges I'm Working Through:**

1. Race conditions when multiple events occur simultaneously
2. Handling failed notification deliveries within digest groups
3. Database schema optimization for efficient event aggregation
4. Coordinating time windows across multiple time zones
5. Implementing similar time-window functionality as OneSignal within Novu

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. What indexing strategies work best for quick digest compilation in Novu?
2. How do you handle digest delivery failures and retries?
3. Has anyone implemented custom time window logic similar to OneSignal's approach in Novu?
4. What's your approach to testing digest timing across different time zones?

If you've implemented similar systems with Novu or other notification services, I'd appreciate insights on handling these technical aspects efficiently.",Sudden_Profit_2840,1h4t9jv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,2024-12-02 11:53:39,36,0.97,36,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/S_ZmR_1cU5aKbwzfea80L7OQ7oKBdb43DuJDAxM8-xM.jpg,t3_1h4t9jv

The reason for the last one is a recurring problem where different browsers will add the ""https://"" automatically.

Is there an easy way to link an easy URL like ""bongable.cc"" to the Github.io address so that it loads faster and has less errors?

Also, I'm testing out the website on different browsers in their respective ""Private"" modes to avoid loading from the cache. Is this method of testing flawed? I might be tripping a little, but I foresee some customers quitting if the site doesn't load quick enough :/

Do I have to buy actual webhosting to get this to load correctly? All I'm really trying for right now is a simple site with a discord link and links to some documents that are also on Github.io.

1. On the frontend user clicks authenticate which calls an auth endpoint on backend.

Then auth url is formed (with query params: state, clientId etc, and sent to auth provider for authentication code.

3. On the frontend the resource owner would be on the auth provider's auth page to either allow or decline the requested scopes.

5. The backend endpoint verifies state param, auth code and obtains an auth token. Stores the auth token in db.

webdev,How do you develop micro-services locally?,"How do you develop micro-services locally when there are several applications that communicate with each other and you need to see logs in several applications at once.

I'm using Docker Compose + Dozzle for such purposes to run batch of services and watch logs, but with this approach the file system can slow down a lot when live reload is enabled.

Recently I found out that there are Procfile and overmind, which allow to conveniently run several services at once with one command without virtualization. But logs are shown in a single console and it is not convenient to see what is going on (my application has a large business logic and a lot of communication back and forth, so a lot of logs).

UPD:

Combining [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) (Procfile launcher) and [logdy](https://logdy.dev/) (logs viewer from pipe to browser) can be working 
solution. Run it as:

```sh
logdy stdin hivemind

webdev,How would Google selling Chrome stop its monopoly?,"Might be off-topic to this sub, but I don't know what other sub would have redditors with enough knowledge about the web to answer this correctly.

My understanding is that Google has tried to maintain a monopoly over the search engine market by making other companies use Google as the main search engine for their browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).

If that's the case, what's the point of having Google sell Chrome, the browser? There are plenty of other browsers out there -- Google doesn't hold a monopoly over the browser market. Chromium is a thing, yes, but neither Firefox nor Safari is Chromium based, and Chromium is open source anyway. The problem here is the ubiquity of 'Google' the search engine, not Chrome the browser.

TLDR: if what Google holds a monopoly over is the search engine that browsers use and not over browsers themselves, how does selling Chrome stop their monopoly?",cachehit_,1h491sj,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,2024-12-01 17:55:57,78,0.82,78,0,92,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h491sj

\- Assign Title to images and able to add description below. Display all the tags associated with the image  
\- Search for images based on Title and search/sort based on tag(s)  
\- Roughly have similar interface shown for when I search and when I select an image

webdev,Scraping keywords from webpages - method suggestions wanted,"Hi All,

I'm making a keyword scraper in order to do some competitor research on the top google search results. I've come here to ask for your ideas on the best ways to extract the most important keywords from a page I'll detail what I'm currently doing below.

This is all done in python using Selenium and BeautifulSoup

1. Get the text from all visible elements
2. Delete the first header and all of the following elements: footers, navs and elements with ""aria-hidden=True""
3. Flattens all inline elements so that the text is all in block level elements -&gt; just done for ease of parsing
4. Then it creates 8 lists
   1. A list where each of the h1-6 elements are collected
   2. A list for roughly the first 200 words measured from the start of the first h1
   3. A list for all elements after the start of the first h1
5. I then return a dictionary to my keyword scraper which has all of the lists above plus the title, url and meta description

Then I run my langauge processing which is a combo of SciKit learn and SpaCy.

I have three methods currently working to extract keywords:

* TF-IDF -&gt; TfidfVectorizer from sklearn
* Noun-Phrase extraction -&gt; I'll post my matcher below but this is a custom pipeline for spaCy
* Named entity extraction -&gt; spaCy as well, super basic just collecting important types of named entities like person, product etc...

Here is my matcher:

    patterns = [
                # Optional Adverb(s) + Adjective(s) + Noun(s)
                [{'POS': 'ADV', 'OP': '*'},
                 {'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '+'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
               
                # Nouns joined by coordinating conjunction
                [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'},
                 {'POS': 'CCONJ'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
               
                # Gerund + Noun
                [{'POS': 'VERB', 'TAG': 'VBG'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
               
                # Noun + Preposition + Optional Adjective + Noun
                [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}},
                 {'POS': 'ADP'},
                 {'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '*'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
                #  Noun + Hyphen + Verb/Noun
                [{""POS"": ""NOUN""},
                 {""TEXT"": ""-""},
                 {""POS"": {""IN"": [""NOUN"", ""VERB""]}}]
     ]

This collects a decent amount of keywords but I feel like it could be improved. Has anyone else approached this problem and has any advice on new methods I can try I'd love to hear about.

So far, I’ve built six SaaS products, and I hope to build more in the future (some of them are [BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app), [Wuf](https://usewuf.com), [Userdesk](https://userdesk.io), [Inboxs](https://inboxs.io), [Hivoe](https://hivoe.com)).

I've used Prisma in Next.js web apps, node.js servers, and cron jobs.

The key goals of using Prisma are:

* keep under control your database schema
   * define tables and types
   * apply migrations
   * query your database with type safety
   * avoid typing errors
* protect from SQL injection
* leverage pooling

**Common issues**

Despite being a stable product, sometimes you can encounter some issues.

Below I describe two common errors:

* migration errors
* query errors

Let’s start with the first one.

**Error with data migrations**

Sometimes your migrations emit an error, that’s not very simple to debug, like this one.

    Error: ERROR: prepared statement ""s2"" does not exist

You usually get this error when you run `npx prisma db push` (apply your schema changes to the database) or `npx prisma generate` (generate the types from your schema).

But what does this mean?

This error happens when using a relational database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (one of the most popular, and advanced open-source SQL databases on the market).

Specifically, a prepared statement in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows you to execute a query plan that is prepared and stored by the database server for reuse. It improves performance and security, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values.

Prisma ORM leverages the prepared statements as part of its database query execution process, under the hood (but you don’t have to know or master prepared statements to use Prisma).

The main issues arise with the confusion between the different database connections string configurations, pooling and PgBouncer.

Let me go straight to the solution, then I explain you the different parts.

The main solution I’ve found is to use two connection strings, one to run the migrations and the second for the execution of your web application / node.js server.

First, identify the correct connection strings for your database.

The connection string to run the migrations is the direct access to the database (no pooling or PgBouncer), like for instance

    postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

Save this connection string as an environment variable called `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.

    DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=""postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

Secondly, get the connection string with the pool, for instance:

    postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName

Get this connection string from your database hosting provider, the parameters might be different.

Save this connection string as an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL`.

    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

The second step is to update the Prisma configuration to use these two environment variables.

Open the file `schema.prisma` and update the section `datasource db` to include this:

    datasource db {
      provider  = ""postgresql""
      url       = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
      directUrl = env(""DATABASE_DIRECT_URL"")
    }

Now, run the usual commands like `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate` locally to ensure that everything is working correctly, and run your application locally.

If all is good, push the modifications to your hosting service and trigger a new deployment for the modifications to take effect.

Prisma is now correctly configured and you should not have the same issue again.

**Query performance issues**

Recently, I got the ""stack depth limit exceeded"" error message.

    PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid `prisma.table.findMany()` invocation: Error occurred during query execution: ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: ""54001"", message: ""stack depth limit exceeded"", severity: ""ERROR"", detail: None, column: None, hint: Some(""Increase the configuration parameter \""max_stack_depth\"" (currently 2048kB), after ensuring the platform's stack depth limit is adequate."") }), transient: false })

This means that the usage of memory exceeds the database configuration for a specific query.

I ran this SQL command on my database and found this value:

    SHOW max_stack_depth;
    ---
    2MB

I had a query that was returning 1900+ records to aggregate some values.

For each record I have to recalculate the sum of certain values.

When this happens you have two options:

* increase the `max_stack_depth` value in your database
* refactor the logic in the code to avoid to run that big query
* optimize the query

I tried to increase `max_stack_depth` because it was the quickest solution (not the best one), but my database is hosted on DigitalOcean and I didn’t have the permissions to run the `ALTER` command:

    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_stack_depth = '4MB';
    ---
    permission denied to set parameter ""max_stack_depth""

(I contacted DigitalOcean via a support ticket and they promptly provided a solution, I can alter the value using their web API).

Then, I started to analyze the problem.

The first thing I tried was to run the same query as plain SQL against the database using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and it perfectly worked.

This was suspicious, it means that probably Prisma was executing a query too complex and expensive.

Then, I refactored the code, using the Prisma method `$queryRaw` to run the same query, and it worked!

At this point, I didn’t want to manually define all the type for the values returned by the query, and I thought of using a new cool feature of Prisma called [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

This way I can run a Raw Query against the database with the types automatically generated by Prisma for me.

So, in the end, I refactored to code, and avoided to increase the value `max_stack_depth` that would have increased the memory consumption in general.

**Conclusion**

I hope that this post was useful, and it avoids you from spending hours on troubleshooting these kind of errors with Prisma.

Overall my experience with the tool has been very good and exciting, and I see how they are releasing new versions, features, and improvements.

You can find the [documentation of Prisma at this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs).

As a side note, I’m not affiliated with Prisma in any way, I’m just a happy user of the product.

webdev,Advice needed: Looking for a Freelancer to Build an AI-Powered LL.M.-Matching Website – What Should I Look For?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently planning a website that helps users find the perfect matching offer on my site. The idea is to provide general information on the landing page, and then users can input their preferences via an AI chatbot (the best example i can find is Fiverr Neo). Based on their answers, the bot will suggest matching offers from a database. The rest of the site will offer detailed information about the individual offers.

I've already set up a WordPress site on google cloud and have a rough idea of how this could work technically. Now, I’m looking to hire a freelancer to bring this project to life. Before I proceed, I need some advice as i have never worked with freelancer before.

What should I look for in a freelancer?

What skills should they have? (e.g., WordPress, Dialogflow/OpenAI API, database integration, UX/UI design)

Are there specific certifications or portfolios I should check?

Should I hire someone specialized in AI, or will a skilled web developer suffice?



Budget and Timeline:

What’s a realistic budget for a project like this?

How long would it typically take to build, assuming the requirements are clear?



# Communication and Collaboration:

How can I ensure the freelancer understands my vision?

Should I prepare a detailed question catalog and database structure beforehand, or can they help me with that?



Technology and Maintenance:

What should I set up technically to ensure the site is easy to maintain in the long run?

Should I plan for ongoing collaboration with the freelancer for updates and maintenance?

How to stay safe and handle rules or password? 

I plan to run the project on WordPress , hosted on google cloud and integrate the AI chatbot (Dialogflow or OpenAI API), but I’m open to better alternatives if suggested.

webdev,I want to publish an Azure function from a Monorepo,"I am a long term Azure functions user and I have properly created, published, and maintained infrastructure that relied on Azure functions. My process is usually very similar.

I scaffold a basic Azure function (version 4, typescript, http trigger) from the Visual Studio Code Azure extension, I modify the default function with my code, build it with npm run build which is just a tsc command, run it with func start, test it by hitting the API with Postman, and then it's time to publish it to my Azure dashboard on my Azure account.

To publish this correctly functioning Azure function, I run a command like this that actually creates the function instance `az functionapp create --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --consumption-plan-location LOCATION_CODE --runtime node --name FUNCTION_AZURE_NAME --storage-account STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --os-type Linux` , then I run something like `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the root directory of the function repo to actually push up the function to my Azure account.

I recently decided that it would be more convenient to start putting all of my Azure functions into 1 monorepo. It was getting hard to keep track of all of the Github repos of single purpose Azure functions. I used NX to make this monorepo.

I found this project [https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure](https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure) , which allows you to scaffold Azure functions into an NX repo. I ran `npx create-nx-workspace@latest` to create the repo and followed the prompts to make a blank repo.

I made the Azure function in question with these commands:

    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:init FUNCTION_DIRECTORY
    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:new FUNCTION_NAME --project=FUNCTION_DIRECTORY --template=""HTTP trigger""

The function works great locally and I'm able to run it just fine with the NX supplied build and run commands. I can hit the APIs locally with Postman, just like when I scaffolded the functions with the Visual Studio Code extension. The problem is that when it comes time to publish the function to my Azure account, the NX supplied publish command does nothing. It doesn't even error, it succeeds with 0 functions uploaded to Azure.

My best theory on why this is happening lies in the build output structure for @ nxazure/func as opposed to the build structure of the Visual Studio Code extension. The Visual Studio Code build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    └───src
        │   index.js
        │   index.js.map
        │
        └───functions
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

But the @ nxazure/func build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\packages\MYFUNCTIONDIRECTORYNAME\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    │   tsconfig.base.json
    │   
    └───packages
        └───bTSOrdAddrsCreate
            │   _registerPaths.js
            │   _registerPaths.js.map        
            │   
            └───src
                └───functions
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js    
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

With the `func` command, you only need to run `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the same directory as the dist folder and the function will be automatically uploaded to your Azure dashboard/account. Maybe that command expects the `dist` folder to have an `index.js` file within the first level of the folder? I'm not quite sure what the publish command is actually doing under the hood.

In short, how do I successfully execute a publish command for a function build in an NX monorepo that was scaffolded with @ nxazure/func? If there is no way to do it via a simple command from the parent directory of the function or at the root of the monorepo, is there a roundabout way to compile the function to a zip and use some command to upload that to my Azure account/dashboard?",warpanomaly,1h3y2eb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,2024-12-01 07:31:58,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3y2eb

webdev,"Tried building a critical and complex home page using several AI autocomplete tools, and here are my findings","( i am hoping, this is useful for this group, and if its not , i am happy to take it down )

I used BlackBox AI, V0, and Claude simultaneously. I have paid subscriptions for V0, Claude, and ChatGPT, while BlackBox seems to use ChatGPT by default without linking it to my chat gpt account.

**Winner:** For me, Claude was the clear winner, though it’s missing a few features compared to the others.

**What I learned about time savings:** I’m not great at creative coding from scratch, so using these tools made things much easier. It would have taken me 3 workdays to achieve what I did in a 4-hour session split between the tools. Although AI-generated code still needs review—I wouldn't fully trust it—making things responsive using AI saved significant time compared to if I had written everything manually or cleaned up an HTML template. Going forward, I think I can be 3x more productive with Claude, especially now that it understands my project context.

**BlackBox AI:** The main reason to explore BlackBox AI was its VS Code integration, which the others don’t offer. I started generating code on the website, then moved to the VS Code extension. Unfortunately, even with the extension, the improvement process was slow, and ultimately it delivered about 1/10th of the results of Claude or V0.

**Advantages:** Easy code export, since everything’s already local.

**V0:** V0 feels like me—it gets overwhelmed and forgets past discussions. Fixing a bug at one step only to see it return after another adjustment was a common frustration. The interface is clean, and the ability to resize the screen was useful for comparing mobile vs. desktop views. However, some persistent issues included:

* Compilation errors were frequent, though reporting them usually led to fixes. Ideally, it should self-correct.
* Filters would sometimes render incorrectly after a few more feature additions.
* Exporting code is made unnecessarily difficult. It’s not much better in Claude, but with V0 it seems intentional.
* Deployment is easy but seems intended to lock users into the V0 ecosystem, which becomes problematic when scaling to 100-200 files, no more easy way to export except 1 file at a time.

**Claude:** Claude’s UI is cleaner, and it understands my requests better, making adjustments seamless. There were no compilation errors, and changes were stable. The output was visually clearer, and I'm starting to trust the quality of the changes it makes. Although export isn’t straightforward.

Overall, Claude’s consistency and quality make it my preferred tool. It’s stable, efficient, and I think I can use it to be significantly more productive moving forward.",HurryFormal7067,1h3webg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,2024-12-01 05:41:26,0,0.47,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3webg

webdev,Would you consider using iframes instead of divs for easier organization good practice?,"I am trying to make a button on a sort of ""home page"" that you would bring you to another page with a cool transition - something like the page sliding from the right side of the screen, doesn't matter that much. I am planning to do that using an animation (need to learn how to do that... that's another topic) where the page would be either a div or an iframe that would move into view. Would you recommend using a div or an iframe in that case? It *feels* right to use an iframe because the page is somewhat of an independent thing, but at the same time, it's still very much the same website (if I used an iframe I would simply load a local HTML file).

I’ve been working on an app called [Pain Coach](https://paincoach.online) for the past few months, with the help of a friend who is a Physiotherapist. 

We began developing it as a tool that they would be able to use in their own practice, a way to give them more insight into what is causing their patients to have flare ups, and to give patients a way to understand what might be negatively impacting their pain.

However we wanted to see if people would be interested in something like this as a publicly available app instead of doing business to business, so we put together a small demonstration and waiting list page. Im still an undergrad cs student and new to the field so any thoughts, advice, or criticisms would be really appreciated as Im sure there are things that can be improved!",zephdev,1h3tn8v,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3tn8v/im_working_on_an_app_for_people_suffering_with/,https://paincoach.online,2024-12-01 03:04:44,20,0.95,20,0,8,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,Showoff Saturday,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/d9EODUzpbGeCrE3DqRCiHUTCPem_P_DF6ISuRZCyfdM.jpg,t3_1h3tn8v

Bonsai-CLI will streamline web development for agencies or solo developers. I think it will truly 10-100x my development speed, for websites or web apps.

Demo + live-stream: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM1V1IjR96E&amp;ab\_channel=JackalopeLabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM1V1IjR96E&amp;ab_channel=JackalopeLabs)

Bonsai-CLI allows you to generate a beautiful web app in seconds, using pre-built and designed Tailwind/Alpine components. All the copy, images, layouts, components, templates, styles can be configured by AI in a matter of seconds.

It’s built specifically for Roots WP stack at the moment, in the future it could support more stacks.

Once you have a [Roots.io](http://Roots.io) site up running, you can run two commands to create a new landing page–

`wp acorn bonsai:init`

`wp acorn bonsai:generate bonsai`

At the moment, the landing page is fairly basic. I’m going to add all of my custom built components to it. Once Bonsai-CLI is done, it’s going to be able to build full on web apps in a matter of seconds. That’s the goal.

**Here is what I did:**  
\- I tried following convention of telling ""What I did"" and ""how did if affect company I work for"".  
\- English is not my first language, so ChatGPT was involved to ""sound professional"".  
\- I've Ignored the education section, since my Bachelor is in music, and that's not related to IT.

**What I am curious about:**

1. For me it looks like too many bullet point given, but all took important place in the job, would you get rid of something?
2. I listed things like setting up VPS and NginX, does that have any influence for a frontend position?
3. Since ChatGPT was used, is it obvious for a native? Would you change wordings?
4. I finished CS50x course by Harvard a year ago and I have their free certificate, does it count as a proper education and will it be best to include it in this CV?
5. Skills section, some of the things look funny to me, should I keep simple things like CSS and HTML in it or remove them, anything big missing?
6. I don't have any pet projects to show off on my github, do they look for it for a Middle position, if yes, then what kind of projects would that be?

webdev,Not another Slack Git integration,"While there are plenty of Slack-GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab integrations out there, many miss one important aspect.

They act as notification channels (like emails)—which is helpful for many teams—but they still leave a lot for teams to figure out themselves, such as fair code review distribution, back-and-forth communication (like I left new comments - I replied to your comments) and reminders.

This is what ReviewNudgeBot offers on top of very convenient and noise-free notifications:

* **Reminders for reviewers blocking PR progress**: When a PR is left without a review, reviewers’ comments are replied to, or a new commit is pushed to the PR, reviewers are reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Reminders for authors blocking PR progress**: When reviewers request changes, new comments are added to a PR, or a build fails, the author is reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Auto-assign reviewer**: After a few team reminders to review a PR, the bot selects specific reviewers and reminds them to review the PR. This helps resolve the bystander effect.
* **Escalate notification**: The bot can be configured to notify a manager if a PR sits for too long without reviews.

And there are more features!

webdev,Is it fine to find your own way of a ‘workaround’?,"Hey guys,

I am currently developing a next js website where it has some forms using shadcn/ui

So one of the form fields has countries list, which are over 170 elements in an array. While creating them with shadcn combobox or select, the website lags for a second because of the number of the html elements loaded for each country, but doesn’t lag on normal &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;, however I need to have custom styling for it.

I did some research and came across something called virtualization with tanstack or react-window, but applying them threw many errors and it was just a headache

So what I did is, stored the array in a state with a slice(0,10) and once opened, I set the state to fill all of the countries.

Now this method works well, the combobox doesn’t lag, and everything is smooth, but is this fine to do?

I mean definitely there are better practices than what I did, but is this fine to continue with or should I reconsider my approach?

Sometimes things work smoothly this way, but makes me feel stupid in a world full of genius developers.

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I made a simple blindfold chess app,"Hi everyone, I'd like to share a side project I've been working on: [Blindfold Chess](http://playblindfoldchess.com).

**What is this app?**

It's a chess app that doesn't have a board! Play chess against the AI (driven by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)), but you must visualize the board in your head. The app provides menu-like inputs to select what pieces to move and where to move them, but it doesn't give any hints as to where the pieces are or what moves they can make. When the game's over, you can copy the moves to the clipboard and open them in an app that lets you visualize chess games.

**Why I made this app**

I learned how to play chess as a child, but I only started actually playing about two years ago. I studied a few openings back then and read two introductory books, but I've mainly just been playing casually. After a few months of playing, I challenged chat gpt to play a game of chess, and instead of showing a chessboard, it just said ""e4"". That was my first introduction to blindfold chess, and I found it highly challenging but not impossible to visualize the board, so I was interested in improving that skill. Unfortunately, chat gpt wasn't able to play coherent games and would inevitably begin making illegal moves as a game progresses.

I made my own chess AI a while back after and used that to play blindfold chess, but I've abandoned that project. Recently, after about a year or so since that last project, I began this. I'm a bit out of practice at the moment, but I expect that I'll improve over time so long as I play a game every day or so.

Surprisingly, I haven't found any apps that do what this does: provide a simple interface for playing blindfold chess. It's certainly niche, but I don't think it's so niche to the point that nobody would have made this simply for that reason. In any case, I'm curious to see if it actually gains adoption, or if I'm the only one who will actually use this on a regular basis.

**Future plans**

First and foremost, once the app has matured a bit, I'm going to make an Android app, then work to make an Android smartwatch app. I've done some preliminary performance tests and have determined that, if nothing else, a Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartwatch can handle the game in easy mode without taking too long to make moves.

After I improve my ability to play blindfold chess, I'd like to write up an article or two that discusses tactics and strategies to help you visualize the board. If there's interest, I might add a feature to play another human locally (i.e., you'd pass them the phone and they'd input their move). Technically, if two people are playing blindfold chess, they wouldn't need the phone at all, but if they disagree about where certain pieces are, the phone would provide an answer to that. I don't think I'll implement a capability to play online because of how easy it would be to cheat, but if people actually play on this app and request it, I'd consider adding it.

I'd also like to add a feature to speak moves and have the system recognize and execute them, but that's a lower priority.",brandon-quinn-author,1h3e04o,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,2024-11-30 14:44:15,3,0.8,3,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1h3e04o
webdev,PSA: You are good enough !,"I am not sure why I felt compelled to write this post.

Perhaps it is the long unemployment stint I have been on and the rough interview loops I've been enduring or maybe I just needed the cathartic release.

Either way, I want to take those who are interested down memory lane with me and reflect on a past experience of mine that helps me through tough times like these.

It all started many years ago when I worked at a company with another developer. Lets call him Robert. Robert was by no means a super star developer but he was an amazingly nice person and was a pleasure to work with.

However, he did not show qualities I would expect of a top developer.  No great understanding of CS. Not an algorithmic god. Minimal knowledge of craftmanship aspects in software. No extensive knowledge of building systems. He was just an everyday developer.

One day Robert gets called by a FANG adjacent recruiter telling him that a team is interested in hiring him.

What was different about this situation was the recruiter did not send him through the front door.  His interview loop consisted of 3 calls. 1 recruiter screen, 1 call with the hiring manager, 1 call with the wider team.

He did not have to endure a single technical round (I don't want to go into the circumstances of why as I don't want to dox myself)

He of course takes this offer and starts a month later. I was very happy for him and wished him the best and that was that.

Fast forward to today. I am sitting here going through the trenches. 6 round loops. OA, code, system design, behavioural. The whole sh\*t fest.

Occasionally, the doubts creep in. Am I good enough ? should I throw in the towel and go into the #trades ? is my experience worthless ?

Then I always think back to our boy Robert.

Roberts rare and unique story showed me that a vast number of developers can likely excel in any position given the chance (even big tech).

I just wanted to say that you are good enough.

The interview practices we endure are nothing more than a filter to whittle down the demand.

When you fail an interview you are doing just that, failing a filter. It has no bearing on you, your ability, or your identity. Like Robert, if you could jump past all the interview mess you would be just fine (As an aside, I believe that Robert would likely not have made it through the traditional interview loop for the same position.)

Anyways, I hope you liked my story and wish you all the best if you are going through it also.

Lastly, I realise this post comes across bitter and jealous. It is not my intention (although perhaps I am a little). I am just a beaten-down dev struggling through it. I wish Robert the best and hope he is happy and killing it.",Invisible_Wetface,1h3deuo,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,2024-11-30 14:13:55,50,0.8,50,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3deuo

webdev,New technology in prod fears,"I'm wondering if anyone else has fears of trying new tech in prod. I'm not just talking about trying out a new library. I'm talking about standing up stuff that you've never really used in prod before.

I feel like I can play around with new tech locally but I always fear that there must be some prod specific stuff that I'm missing. Extra load revealing issues, incorrect assumptions made, config stuff that I'm expected to know but don't, etc. I tend to use stuff I'm familiar with just because there are some bugs that have been really hard to figure out. Managers have asked before *how* a bug could ***possibly*** be introduced, and the thought of saying, ""eh, this is just my first time using it and I'm learning"" sounds like a good way to get on someone's shitty developer list. Most managers that I've had seem to think that any bug is just completely unacceptable, so the thought of admitting to incompetence or ignorance seems like out of the question.

Do most of you just stick with shit you know, or do you take the plunge if you think something might be better? Or go with something new that might work just as well but also save some paint points from existing tech? I'm not talking about going with new stuff just because it's new.

  
**Example**

I used to work at a place with multiple applications. I was talking to someone on another team in the enterprise one day about their architecture. This team literally didn't use a load balancer to load balance between different servers. They literally made separate URLs for the internal team to use. If one server went down, they would launch up the other and tell the internal customers to go the other URL. Load balancing is SO basic and it used to strike me as extremely weird that they wouldn't just add that in. I can imagine that it might be really scary for them though because of how critical the app was, and you could really screw up production if you messed up your session management setup. You might set up the load balancer and show that you're hitting the servers and that the website is working well, and then totally not do anything about session management. It hits production and then it's a disaster! Ok - you see errors and then you just shut down the other servers and you're pretty much back where you started. Not the end of the world but hopefully you see my point.",wannacommissionameme,1h35jrd,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,2024-11-30 05:28:34,0,0.5,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h35jrd

webdev,Common data fetching in a layout and a page in ReactJS,"I have been thinking about data fetching of front end. Suppose you have

\- Layout: it resource A to render a sidebar

\- Page: it is in the layout. It needs resource A and B

Resource is stored globally in an app (with whatever, Redux or Context). Resource A may be fetched again on a user event like when \`userId\` changes.  
Page A should not know what layout fetches, vice versa. They should care only data they need.

How is it possible to fetch resource A only once?

If you put this \`useEffect\` in a layout and a page, it fetches when \`userId\` changes. A problem is that they may race in a layout and a page. They may run simultaneously.

\`\`\`  
useEffect(() =&gt; {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}, \[dispatch, userId\]);

\`\`\`

Putting another \`useEffect \` does not seem to solve a problem. You will not know when \`useEffect\` runs, no matter it is in a layout or in a page. If only a page waits until layout finishes loading, it would work, but it does not.

\`\`\`

useEffect(() =&gt; {

if (resourceAStatus === 'idle') {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}

}, \[dispatch, resourceAStatus \]);

\`\`\`

One simple way is ""Fetch data in layout, not in page at all"", but it is not a good practice. You should fetch data when you need it.

Does anyone know a good data fetching design?

**Repost Story:**

Back in 2017, I was fresh out of highschool, not a dollar to my name. I had just signed up for the first semester of college as a CS student when disaster struck my family. Mom and dad both lost their jobs and became deathly sick to the point that they were unable to work. As a result, we became homeless and had to move in with some family friends.

I was working at a barista at Dunkin Doughnuts at the time, my day would consist of waking up at unglodly hours of the morning to catch the bus before the sun came up for my morning shift. After work I would study coding online and work on my college classes. 

One day I came home and got the call that my mom had been admitted to the hospital because she was minutes away from having a stroke and her lungs were filled with blood clots. I knew it was either make money or bust, so I started applying to hundreds of coding jobs while studying on sites like pluralsight to prepare. After hundreds of submissions, I finally got a callback for an interview.

I was nervous, stumbling my words, After an hour of coding, I got it to work. I went home, and recieved a callback the next day with an offer for the job.

There I was, a 19 year old homeless broke kid who had just landed his first real job in tech.

Since them I've mannaged to work for some big name companies like Hulu+, Disney, and Warner bros and launched a successful software business, I dropped out of college when I got the first job offer as a sophmore in college. I don't have a degree, or any special certifications, parents didn't give me any money.

I found that when I talk with people about my story in person they are very interested, so I figured I'd post online to see if my expereince can help anyone else learn from it so ask away.

webdev,"Is front end development dying [NOT duplicate, serious topic]","I'm sure there are lots of more exprienced developers out there, since I was professionally in the industry for 3 years now and I was working freelance before but things have gone much worse from my perspective. 

I'm not going to start AI will make us homeless stuff, but the way is front end viewed is the problem.

I think it is a nail in the coffin for this field. imagine this. so, we have backend colleagues. they are getting paid more than us and more important than that, they have PRESTIGE. 

even if they write a simple SELECT query, the employer and others think that it is a rocket science or something, but for a front end developers... "" it is just a simple button bro "". 

it almost took me 2 months to optimize the prescription section of our medical web app. we've had heavy lists and extremely dynamic forms and technical challenges.. but we've done something extremely good. 

and now after 2 months the only thing I heard from my boss was "" this was the least you can do, it is just a simple button "" 

and I don't blame him to be fair. this is what most of the industry thinks. 

  
I feel like the blue collar part of the developer society. you took the most effort, get paid less and no one values your job. 

and even worse than that, compared to Java or C# (Scala or .NET Core), front end is just a shit party! no rules, no strong foundation and god forbid for example if Vercel rolls out a new update and changes the whole structure of the framework! 

on the other hand, from my personal experience, I really enjoy reading .NET core documents. everything is very well structured and you don't have to give blow job  for AI or Stackoverflow developers to get your answer.

just a great Microsoft community. 

  
so, my question is... is it worth it? really after 3 years and couple years of freelance, I just started to regret my choice. 

it was like that in 2016 let's say...

webdev,Issue with vertically centered content shifting on wrap,"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm stuck and was hoping someone could help. Essentially, I have a splash/landing page with a logo. The logo is an SVG, it's vertically and horizontally centered. That all works great.

I have a little JavaScript that types in a byline type description under it. It's short. But on mobile screens, it wraps to the next line, which is fine. Only issue is that when it wraps, the element (H1) then shifts the logo above it upwards so the image, and now two lines of text are all vertically centered.

I'd like the text to just go downwards when wrapping without pushing the group of the content upwards.

Here's what I have currently. We're using Bootstrap 5.

Edit: I can see that putting the JS inside the section groups it with the logo to be centered, but we've tried it outside as well and same.

    &lt;section id=""landing"" class=""landing bg-light d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center vh-100""&gt;

            &lt;h1 id=""typing-text"" class=""typing-text text-primary text-center pt-6 px-5 fw-light""&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;

    .landing .landing-logo {
      width: clamp(300px, 50%, 916px);
    }

I've always been driven by a strong work ethic, curiousity, and the desire to improve myself every single day and I believe as a disciple, this is exactly what a mentor would look for.

While I'm highly motivated, I realize the importance of guidance - someone who can provide direction, share insights, and challenge me to grow.

webdev,New company has clients point by nameserver instead of A record? There has to be a better way.,"Hey everyone, I recently started working at a website development company and ran into something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Here’s the situation:

When we build a website for a client, we ask them to point their domain to our **nameservers** so the website can go live. This means we end up managing their entire DNS, even though we’re just the website provider. It's an extra burden, especially when clients request changes for things like email or subdomains.

I asked why we don’t just have clients point their domain to our server using an **A record**, and here’s the explanation I got:

“If we ever need to change our server’s IP address (which has happened a couple of times), all clients would need to update their A record to the new IP. That’s impractical with thousands of clients. Nameservers avoid this issue because we can make IP changes behind the scenes without involving the client.”

Okay, that makes sense, but using nameservers feels inefficient for so many other reasons... I feel like there has to be a better way to solve this problem without the extra workload.

I’d love to hear your thoughts considering my role at the company isn't as technical but this workflow is hugely affecting my output and I want to offer them a better solution.

webdev,Trying to break out of the field while simultaneously unemployed. Advise?,"I am a senior web dev (NodeJS, RoR) that has recently lost their job unexpectedly for the first time in forever. I live in the EU, in a country that does not have a lot of jobs, and what little can be found has a lot of competition, is underpaid, and you get worked to the bone. Up until this point I was working fully remote for other EU companies and was starting to make a decent living as an EM. When I lost my job I tried to keep that momentum going, but long story short, it's quite difficult and there is higher need for developers than there is for other roles.

I used my unemployment time to pick up Python which turned out great, successfully acing two different coding challenges and reaching the next stage in the pipeline. However, it seems that growing into Python further would involve delving into pretty specific and uninteresting libraries (django, or numpy or pandas).

Context over, now to the matter at hand. I am quite tired of web dev. It's why I ventured into Python in the first place. With time on my hands, I have it in me to pick up another language. To spare you the details, I believe these are the two avenues that might make sense:

\- Refresh in-demand, web only languages. This obviously snuffs out what little soul I have left. Refresh PHP. Or refresh NodeJS/TypeScript. Much better than PHP, but still quite boring. There are a lot of PHP, NodeJS, RoR jobs, but there are also a lot of candidates.

\- Try my hand at C#. Interesting, can think of very enticing projects! I am confident I could pick it up. Potentially moves me away from web dev. But my CV has no single a single speck of C#, so I would not be looked as a solid candidate.

Here’s my current approach: I separate a quantity/time bar chart into two components: quantity and time. Each component is tied to its own plugin for different data sources (SQL, API, IoT). This results in more than six plugins just to update a single bar chart  because the data updates often require mixing and matching different data sources (e.g., SQL + IoT or API + SQL), i need to create additional plugin to handle new combination of data sources

I currently have a website built by myself from scratch using Wordpress. I wish to use other CMS as Wordpress seems too cluttered and messy with so many 3rd-party plugins being installed. There is lack of cohesiveness in design and operations.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Needs**


The website will be mainly an educational website with articles, videos and podcasts. Events will also be shown on the website for people to register.


&amp;nbsp;
 

Will be good if as many of the following items are built-in as possible instead of having to install plugin after plugin.


&amp;nbsp;
 

1) Native SEO


Don't want to wade through tons of SEO plugins, with each professing their way is the best way, just to get basic SEO done.


&amp;nbsp;
 

2) Forms


Built-in form functionality to collect feedback and to sign up for newsletters and memberships.


&amp;nbsp;
 

3) Memberships


I did not create memberships for the current website and would like to do so for the new website as I want to differentiate content between registered members and public.


&amp;nbsp;
 

4) Newsletters


For sending regular newsletters to members and people who sign up for them.


&amp;nbsp;
 

5) Integrations


Be able to integrate easily with other services like Nextcloud (for external storage, linking of videos, audio files &amp; images), Eventbrite (for booking of events created on Eventbrite) and social media platforms like Youtube, Instagram &amp; Tiktok (to showcase my videos and playlists posted on these platforms).


&amp;nbsp;
 

6) Localization


Able to have a multilingual website in English &amp; Chinese.


&amp;nbsp;
 

7) Mobile apps


Able to create mobile version of the website for Android &amp; iOS. Not going to do Native apps as they are too costly. So, I'm guessing I need to use headless CMS for this. However, I have read that Drupal can be Progressively Decoupled to allow for more Editoral needs and less Developer needs. Are there other CMS that can done this way? ([Source](https://medium.com/@opensenselabs/a-complete-guide-on-fully-decoupled-drupal-56fd283fcd60))



&amp;nbsp;
 

Any programming language is fine so long as the CMS can fulfill as many of the above items as possible.


&amp;nbsp;

webdev,A Browser-Based Solution for Reusable Libraries and Frameworks?,"Hey, I’m no expert, but I think I’ve stumbled on a genius idea:

What if browsers offered to store commonly used libraries and frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) locally instead of downloading them repeatedly for each website?

Here’s the idea:

* The browser could cache reusable libraries, especially popular ones like CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries.
* If a website uses modified or custom classes, the browser could detect this and ensure they aren't overridden. (web devs should notify the browser in headers or something to not override)
* For JavaScript, core functions of libraries could be stored in the browser, while any additional custom code gets bundled and served as usual. ( again, devs should notify the browser, and split their code too for this purpose)

This could save tons of bandwidth and improve loading speeds, with only small updates needed for library changes, and I believe that this is the future of web dev speed.

What do you think? Could this work?

As you see. The problem here is Dev is the source of truth but at any given time it can have a multitude of projects/bug fixes etc that haven't been validated by QA.

So, when releasing into Prod, you have to pick a Dev PR that was approved by QA... but then that build still could have items unapproved in it.

It's a mess.

It was setup before I came. So whatever the reason, it's lost in time.

webdev,"Switching from BootstrapVue (Bootstrap v4): Suggestions for a Modern, Lightweight UI Library?","Hey everyone!

We're looking to replace our current component library, which is built with **BootstrapVue**. The main reasons for the switch are:

1. **Incompatibility with Vue3**
2. BootstrapVue uses **Bootstrap v4** under the hood which is very heavy-weight as it still uses jQuery.

We already use **TailwindCSS** and **SCSS** in our development, so we're considering **shadcn** as a potential replacement. One key requirement is that the new library must be **heavily customizable** to help us maintain the look and feel of the Bootstrap components we're currently using.

We also need it to support:

* Accessible components
* Responsive design
* Vue3 compatibility
* Interactive Components (Modals, Dropdowns, etc.)
* Animations and Transitions
* Comprehensive Documentation and Active Community
* Potentially Dark Mode Support

Does anyone have experience using shadcn in a Vue3 + Tailwind environment? Are there other UI libraries or frameworks you'd recommend that offer a good balance between performance, customization, and accessibility?

The whole point of the app is to collect that data in-house, not using 3rd party tools or sending it to different providers.

From my understanding, the fact that the app is collecting information it requires to function, and isn't using 3rd party collection, it should be compliant to both laws without the need for a bunch of ""accept cookie"" banners.

It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.

I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in  California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.



EDIT::: So I asked chatGPT but I dont knwo if I can trust it's answer, but it seems reasonable.

If your site and app use cookies **only for essential purposes**, such as maintaining user sessions and tracking which A/B testing version a user is seeing, and you gather analytics directly on your own backend without setting additional cookies for these purposes, your GDPR and CCPA obligations may differ:

# GDPR Considerations

1. **Essential Cookies**: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations) are generally considered ""strictly necessary."" Under GDPR, **strictly necessary cookies do not require user consent**. However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.
2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:
   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).
   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.
   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.
3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).

# CCPA Considerations

1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:
   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.
   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.
2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.

# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?

* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.
* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:
   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).
   * The purposes for which the data is processed.
   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).

# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance

1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:
   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).
   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).
   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).
2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don’t use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.
3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.

By sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",IAmRules,1h21jfl,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,2024-11-28 17:49:14,1,0.54,1,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h21jfl

They don't need a website for marketing, ads and videos does that it tiktok/fb/youtube. They don't need a site to sell, customers could talk to them via chat and order directly.

So your marketing effort does everything about building your brand image and awareness. You don't need a site to present your business informations. And you can sell through chat.

I'm not understanding the terms of service - theres is similar to Google (one of their named competitors). It says you can't pre-fetch, cache or store autocomplete addresses beyond 30 days. Does that apply to validated addresses as well?

How would a company, after a transaction (assuming that is the point of the 30 days), handle providing receipts to the end user beyond 30 days? I would assume an end user would still want to be able to verify what address a product was sent to beyond that time frame and a company probably would want to store that address longer to deal with incorrect sending/re-sending reppacements/etc. so how do they accomplish this?

Or are the storage terms there to prevent people from requesting all addresses in the platform and storing a copy of them all indefinitely (alleviating the need to use the platform) - more of a gotcha if needed?

I want to use this platform, it's the cheapest/least resteictive by far compared to Smarty, Loquate, Google (attribution), geoapify, USPS (mailing requirement) etc. but my address validation needs require storing the addresses a bit longer than 30 days (not indefinitely).",Unhappy_Trout,1h1vkzq,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,2024-11-28 13:08:11,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h1vkzq
webdev,[PHP/Laravel] Is Livewire polling a decent alternative to WebSocket/Laravel-Echo?,"I'm building a web app using Filament exclusively which uses Livewire. I have a simply Kanban board in my app that requires server polling to keep data up-to-date.

My initial thought was to use websocket with laravel-echo but then I realized it's an overkill for such a simple Kanban board and use-case of my app; the app will be used by small teams (10-15 users) internally only. So I implemented [Livewire polling](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/wire-poll) and it was really easy and it worked, I've set it to 15s interval but I'm just worried about consuming too much server resources.

webdev,Experienced devs: how do you manage different tools on the websites and the process of managing different accounts on different websites? How do share the information with the client? Including more information with examples below,"I have a question about account management for web developers.

I'm building a website for a friend and I need to implement Ahrefs for weekly site scan, Silktide for accessibility scan, Cookiebot for cookie management, and various Google accounts (Google Analytics,  Search Console, Tag Manager and reCAPTCHA) for general tracking and tackling bots.

I've created the Google accounts with my personal email but added my friend as an admin user to all those accounts. I created the Ahrefs account with a new dedicated email address like ahrefs@domain.com and the Silktide account with another dedicated email like silktide@domain.com. Cookiebot in a similar fashion.

Is this approach good? Is there any other way to do this?

Another question is that how do you track things like accounts passwords? I have created a Google Spreadsheet with all the account emails and passwords and private APIs (like reCAPTCHA) and shared it only with my friend. Is there a better way than this?

Edit:
I've been building websites mainly for a major public institution. Most of my experience is with php and JavaScript, and I've dabbled with many other languages and techniques. 

To clarify: I'm not coding WordPress (yet if ever). I'm just managing the site. Most of the tutorials I've come across are aimed at folks with no web experience at all, and I'm a bit underwhelmed. 

EDIT 2:
Wow, thanks everyone! There's some sound advice and useful wisdom here. I really appreciate your thoughtful and useful responses.

And thanks to everyone who validated that it's possible to have deep experience in the field and not having experience with one of the gazzillion tools and techniques that are out there.

As an aside: a few years after I got into this field, the browser wars happened. Things got really messy for awhile. We had to deal with variations in browsers that were pretty confusing. New tools were rising that were helpful. But it was a hard time to know whether any path was a good one. I assumed things would get simpler with time. But they didn't. Web development is much more complex now than ever. Not so much in terms of code, but in the vast array of tools, options, techniques, vendors and so on. It's an exciting time, but also one of peril and pressure. Burnout is real. It has specific symptoms. Take care of yourselves. Be kind to yourself. Get some rest. Hang in there.

webdev,Misleading salary offers in job opportunities,"I've been looking for a new job for the past month. I finally found the perfect match, but on the way there, I couldn't help but notice something that is increasingly used by firms/recruiters: huge salary offers, that lead nowhere.

A bit of context: I'm currently applying as a lead Dev in France/Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I saw a job offer in Paris, for an American company.

Remote 1 day/week. Fine by me, I like being onsite.

Salary ? 72k to 150k, based on experience.

Their stack is interesting, the product looks nice, I give it a go. 

It's a five step process, with 3 interviews, a peer coding session, and at-home assignment that took me roughly 5 hours. Last Friday, they came back to me: they want me on the team. So, 4th interview with my future manager and HR. Manager tells me that I aced the tests, and they'd like to start ASAP. 

Their offer ? 75K.

This is not the first time I see this kind of behaviour, so I asked frankly: I aced all tests, and showed interest in your product, and had a great human fit with everyone I talked to. We share the same values when it comes to both human and professional responsibilities. So, how comes I'm not getting the 150k salary ?

To which they answered that ""This salary is only for applicants who live in the bay area, since the cost of living is way higher there"". So, I turned down the job, because the offer they gave me was lower than my current salary. Plus, I felt like after showing so much investment in their process, this was basically a huge red flag.

Has anyone ever faced this ?

I am stuck at 92/100 performance score on mobile devices for my website [nextbestai.com](http://nextbestai.com)

To get to this score was rough, and I have done all I can think of in terms of cache and using lightweight builders like elementor and blocksy. 

Now from the pagespeed insights it seems the issue comes from LCP , more specifically the H1 which covers quite a big chunk of space over the fold. I have tried editing, simplifying it, but it still won't get my score higher / lower the LCP.

What am I missing? 

Any tips are appreciated.

webdev,How to Handle Currency Conversion and Rounding Issues on a Global Platform?,"`To Be fair i am not a native English speaker so took some help from chat gpt for rewirting my problem to make it less painfull for you guys to read. my apologies` 

  
Hi everyone,

I’m working on a platform where service providers can list their offerings, and users from around the world can book them. We support multiple currencies, but our backend stores everything in USD for consistency. I’m facing a few challenges with pricing, conversion, and rounding, and I’m curious how others handle similar issues.

Here’s the setup:

1. A service provider creates a package with an hourly rate in their local currency (e.g., 100 GBP).
2. The backend converts the price to USD using the current exchange rate (e.g., 100 GBP → 124.56 USD).
3. Users see the price in their local currency, rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 125 USD).

Now the issues:

1. **Rounding Discrepancies**:
   * If the user books a package for 3 hours, they see `125 * 3 = 375 USD`. But the backend calculates `124.56 * 3 = 373.68 USD`. This mismatch confuses users.
   * If I always round on the frontend, the service provider might receive less than they expected.
2. **Currency Volatility**:
   * Exchange rates change over time. Locking the rate at the time of booking solves this for transactions, but I’m unsure how to handle edge cases, like refunds after months of exchange rate changes.
3. **Adding New Currencies**:
   * Storing prices in every currency a user might use isn’t scalable. If we add a new currency later, recalculating and storing all previous package prices in the new currency seems impractical.

**Questions for the Community**:

1. How do platforms like Airbnb or Fiverr handle pricing and rounding across currencies?
2. Is there a better way to deal with rounding discrepancies without overpaying/underpaying either party?
3. Are there efficient ways to handle refunds in multi-currency setups when exchange rates fluctuate?
4. Any scalable strategies for introducing new currencies without recalculating older data?

Would love to hear how you’ve tackled similar issues or any creative ideas you might have!

Thanks in advance! 😊",Aware-Silver-2221,1h101lb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h101lb/how_to_handle_currency_conversion_and_rounding/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h101lb/how_to_handle_currency_conversion_and_rounding/,2024-11-27 08:52:50,2,1.0,2,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h101lb

webdev,"Quit to build WebDev freelancing, where is my actual value?","Apologies if you see my rant in different subreddits, I’ve cross checked and ensured that my post obey’s all guidelines. 

I’ll preface by saying I like to think I’m realistic not optimistic nor pessimistic and not coming on here to say some bs like time to make $5k a week off converting a client.



**Background:** 

(Pre) Background Summary: Boss made a comment so vulgar about my personal life I quit on the spot. Time to take a risk. 



Been scheming on starting freelance Web Design for 6 months now learning the ins and outs of Elementor and overall web design. Had a rude awakening realising that I’m essentially making life 6x as hard for me as I look now and my websites are Webflow websites created in Elementor when it comes to animation and overall feeling. Been researching and seems smart enough to switch over to Webflow and learning curve should be doable as I’ll be rebuilding a portfolio and own website in Webflow and taking Christmas period whilst businesses sleep to understand everything about where I need to be. Decided I don’t think I’ll be touching E-Commerce clients as that’s asking for trouble and in terms of restrictions for what I can provide with websites. Nothing with user accounts/logins and essentially just have a CTA and booking components. 



**Problem:** 

A pretty website doesn’t sell… I wouldn’t consider this endeavour if I didn’t currently work in corporate sales handling anywhere from $2000 to $50,000 deals from straight cold calling. My point is I understand you’re never in the business of selling a product to a company, you’re selling a tool that provides value and generates them new revenue.

So whether I like it or not I’m essentially selling a form of marketing. At the end of the day my passion is web design and I want to keep as close to that as possible as I can without locking myself out of the profit party filled with web designers that sell a website as part of a digital marketing package. 

I understand Webflow has SEO embedded but I can already see the clients face when they’ve heard SEO SEO SEO SEO SEO a dozen times and that is my only bullet for how investing in me building them a new website generates them more revenue. 



**Question:** 

My question is what angle for SMBs should I take to ensure I can confidently say they’re investment is going to pay itself off that isn’t shying too far away from designing on Webflow and entering the ‘aLL iN OnE DiGiTaL MaRkEtiNg sPeCiAl’ where I’m handling their google and meta ads etc. Just super intrigued as to how delusional I’m being or if there are people converting half decent clients essentially off straight web design as I more than understand the $500-1000 website motto is asking for trouble and headaches from cheapskate customers. 



Greatly appreciate any advice as I am as far as I can get in terms of throwing myself into the deep end and have no option but to go out and go get it. ",maxo6k,1h0yyro,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,2024-11-27 07:32:36,10,0.67,10,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0yyro

I'm trying to figure out the most practical hosting for a 'low-traffic app'.

webdev,Is there a catch here? Why choose DigitalOcean when Hosting*r offers so much more?,"I’ve been comparing hosting options for the early stages of a social network project. I came across two options that seem wildly different in terms of the resources they offer:

|**Specification**|**DigitalOcean Basic (2 vCPUs, 2GB)**|Hosting\*r KVM8 (8 vCPUs, 32GB)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**vCPUs**|2|8|
|**RAM**|2 GB|32 GB|
|**Disk Space**|60 GB SSD|400 GB NVMe SSD|
|**Bandwidth**|3 TB/month|32 TB/month|
|**Cost**|$18/month|$20/month|

The resources offered by Hosting&amp;r are so much higher that it seems too good to be true. I get that there’s likely a difference in quality. For example, even if Hosting&amp;r’s 32GB RAM doesn’t reach its full capacity and performs more like 10GB in real-world scenarios, it’s still 5x the RAM DigitalOcean provides. The bandwidth difference is also insane - 32TB vs. just 3TB.

Given that I’m building a social network in its early stages with about 100 users initially, is there a major reason to stick with DigitalOcean? Are there hidden trade-offs in Hosting&amp;r’s offering that I might be overlooking? Or does the sheer quantity of resources compensate for any quality differences?

Which would you recommend for a low-traffic start, with scalability in mind?

webdev,"A question on canvas, bootstrap, and resizing","Hi all, I'm trying to make a page which loads an image into a canvas and then allows drawing on top of the image. The image itself is large, so I would like to be able to resize it by altering my window size.

Currently, the image is loaded into an &lt;img src&gt; and has Bootstrap's img-fluid class and that manages scaling nicely. However, I would like to add a canvas on top of the image to draw on it. If I change the &lt;img src&gt; to a &lt;canvas&gt; with the background specified as the image, I run into all sorts of problems. Either the image is tiny or the image is huge, depending on how I'm setting the background (use the style tag and the image is tiny, use javascript to perform a drawImage and it's huge), and in either case it does not scale with the page.

I am pretty stuck with Bootstrap but I'm not particularly stuck with canvas if there is a different or better way to do this. If anyone has any suggestions then please let me know. Given how few results are available from googling, I assume I must be doing something this was never intended to do (?)",Monster-Zero,1h0wevc,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0wevc/a_question_on_canvas_bootstrap_and_resizing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0wevc/a_question_on_canvas_bootstrap_and_resizing/,2024-11-27 04:49:41,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0wevc

webdev,Asking for a webdev role sanity check,"I was hoping I could get some thoughts and observations about my current position and role. It doesn't make sense to me that my company is run this way, but here I am. 

We are an e-Commerce company (with a couple physical retail locations) that does about $15m a year through our Shopify website. We also do almost that much through Amazon. We have maybe 110 employees, most of which are in product development and fulfillment. 

I am the sole developer in the company. We have 1 IT guy, who helps run Netsuite as well as all IT functions. We have a Tech Manager who just started and is the 3rd one we've had in a year, who will mostly own Netsuite. I seldom speak with these people as our roles don't overlap.

I do *everything* regarding the website. I am a Front End Dev by training with 18 years experience (both in agencies and ecommerce). So, obviously I manage the functionality and look/feel of our site. I also build &amp; launch all of our products in Shopify (800+ SKUs), as well as maintain all of their information/images. I build all of the themes to swap for different site changes, promos or product launches. I build all of the discounts and promotions and upsells.  I own probably 25 of the 3rd party apps we have installed in our store to add functionality, meaning I am the point of contact if any of them have an issue. Search, cart, bundles, reviews, subscriptions, Klaviyo, etc. 

Our Shopify store was built by an agency 2 years ago, yet somehow I was not involved in that process. I was tasked with keeping our previous store running. The agency customized a ton of code because the our people involved *had* to have this or that functionality (most of which are no longer with the company anyway). There are no code comments or documentation of what they did or changed. This is my first Shopify experience, and I am trying to pick up Liquid as I go. 

Speaking of customized solutions... we are also running both a B2B and D2C solution off of the same platform that was NOT designed to do that natively. We have custom scripts running to calculate prices and shipping rules that don't play nice with other things we try to accomplish. 

I am also the point of contact for all of our employees for any issue with Shopify via Slack. I am 2nd layer support for any of our customers who have store issues our CS team cannot solve. 

I report to the marketing manager. She is not very technical. I make just over 90k. I work remote from home. Luckily, I don't touch anything order related, nor Amazon or Netsuite.

I have to ask... This isn't normal, right? 

I am barely keeping my head above water. I don't have any actual QA. I don't have any technical support (beyond Shopify support). I don't have any back up. I work on a non-technical marketing team. We are in the depths of holiday, and as you can imagine, it is unbelievably crazy. 

Do other $30m a year companies run like this? 

I often get approached from our VP of marketing with some idea that GAP or Sephora are doing on their website. Sure, that's a cool feature. I'm going to assume those places don't have a single developer who spends half his day context-switching. 

I've been here 6 years. When I started, we had 3 back end devs and myself. Slowly, they left and were never replaced. Which was why we went to Shopify. I guess this has been a 'slowly boil the frog' situation. 

I know I should probably find another job, but I live in a place that doesn't have a ton of jobs, and every remote job listing I see has 100+ applicants before I've even read it. I'm burnt out, looking for a sanity check.

webdev,Another unprepared project,"Seeing this stuff more and more at my agency as well as when multiple LARGE companies even come with work they would like done...

It gets to Dev to build and much of the project to date with scope, functionality etc is just not there.

Recently had a new landing page system requirement, these differer from the website. All ready to build.  
I sit with the project manager to go over it.

\- Design is done, ready to build!  
\- First off there are 3 enquire buttons in the top area next to the enquire form itself which made me laugh.  
\- I did not say anything but the flow of the page was all wrong, made no sense and to me did not seem to match what they said the goal was, but oh well  
\- They changed what the form did mid conversation to go to another page with more complete form and a part submission step... OK BUT - No idea what was on the page and what the other part of the form was going to be and no idea on what fields would come across pre-populate etc.

Few other things.  
I am the lead developer, I work with all the departments and managers and across everything. Rather than giving it to one of the team as it was a mess I took it on as I am also a designer so I could fill in a lot of the blanks there as well as it does not have a huge budget.

Did what I could and hand over with clear requirements on all the things still needed and missing.

1 week later and they have some back and forward with the client and I am asked to change a graphic (which should be the designers job) and some text changes.

4 days later I am being asked if it is live yet  
I just had to email all parties with the bullet list of the actual important stuff again.

It amazes  me that across several people including the client they have not mapped out the key flow and functionality of the project, want it live and STILL do not know what it is supposed to do and where the data goes and how they will use it.

webdev,How to remove Laravel Routes case sensitivity?,"Hi all, I have a laravel app running locally using Herd and deployed in prod on DigitalOcean. It is working fine so far. But one issue I'm having is that routes are not case insensitive so \`&lt;host&gt;/hello\` works but \`&lt;host&gt;/hellO\` doesn't. I get a 404.

How can I fix this behavior? I'd like for all routes to be lower cased.

I tried creating a middleware and apply it at the route level, at a group level, and globally by adding it to the list of middleware applied to \`$middleware-&gt;api(append: \[NormalizeRouteCasing::class\]\` but none of these works. I added debug statements in the middleware and is as if the execution never even gets to the middleware. When I remove the capital letter form the route it does reach it and I see the debug statements. So even before the middleware layer the upper cased routes are being rejected

Appreciate the help. Thank you.

UPDATE:

I Just want to give an update and say that the only thing I have been able to do that actually works (but it's ugly) is this:

In the public/index.php file, right before `(require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php')-&gt;handleRequest(Request::capture());` is called I'm doing this:

$requestUri = $\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\];  
$parsedUrl = parse\_url($requestUri);  
$path = isset($parsedUrl\['path'\]) ? strtolower($parsedUrl\['path'\]) : '';  
$query = isset($parsedUrl\['query'\]) ? '?'.$parsedUrl\['query'\] : '';  
$lowercaseUri = $path.$query;  
$\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\] = $lowercaseUri;

But please let know if there is a better approach or if there would be any downsides with this approach.

webdev,Can't Get HTTPS Working on Netlify with GoDaddy DNS – Stuck and Need Help!,"Hey everyone,

I'm really struggling to get HTTPS set up for my site hosted on Netlify while my domain is registered on GoDaddy. I've been going back and forth switching nameservers, tweaking DNS settings, and retrying verification, but I just can't get Netlify to provision the SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.

Here's the situation:

Domain: Registered with GoDaddy.

Hosting: Netlify (pulling from GitHub).

Nameservers: Currently using GoDaddy's default (ns55.domaincontrol.com and ns56.domaincontrol.com), since they don’t seem deletable or changeable in the DNS zone.

DNS Records in GoDaddy:

A Records: Pointing to Netlify's IPs (75.2.60.5 and 99.83.229.76).

CNAME for www: Points to sitename.netlify.app.


Netlify Settings:

Custom domain added (sitename.com as primary, www.sitename.com redirects to it).



The problem is that Netlify keeps giving me a ""DNS verification failed"" error when I try to enable HTTPS. I’ve tried:

1. Switching to Netlify’s nameservers (but GoDaddy doesn’t allow me to remove its NS records within the DNS zone).


2. Sticking with GoDaddy’s default nameservers and ensuring A and CNAME records are configured as Netlify recommends.


3. Retrying DNS verification after waiting for propagation (24+ hours).



No matter what I try, I’m stuck in the same spot. It’s frustrating because I can’t seem to delete or override those default NS records in GoDaddy either.


---

Has anyone dealt with this before or has advice on how to fix it? Should I fully switch to Netlify’s DNS and manage everything there, or is there a workaround for the NS records in GoDaddy? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

webdev,I don't understand how they build apps with AI,"To keep it short. I am modifying an app that uses python flask for backend, and I used SQLAlchemy as an ORM layer to work with my database. I had a model that is already in the db and I needed to add new boolean not nullable field to it. I know how to do it, but decided to test chatGPT. Yes, it was great at correcting auto-migration, as you need to pupulate this new field somehow to create it not nullable. But then things got tricky. I needed to add this field to my admin panel, and I wanted it to be 'read-only', so when user can see it but cannot edit it. And it tried to do it, he added it to list view and edit view, disabled the field, removed it from create view, added logic to assign value when the model is created in admin panel, BUT it cannot solve the issue, that when I start editing sexisting model where this disabled field is equal to True and save it, it gets saved to the DB as false, as disabled fields are not part of the form and then ORM treats it like False value. I gave it a chance, tried different promts but it couldn't correct this behaviour. 

So my thought is, I don't know how people are able to develop somethig complex with it. Sure, it helps me with snippents (like with migration), but when you try to get some even simple looking functionality it may introduce bugs and you are lucky if it is you who catches them, not the end-user. Also I get more satisfaction by researching and writing code myself, not writing instructions for who knows how long to get what I need.

1. The **main idea** of the passage.
2. The **mood** the author is trying to convey.

Both would be multiple-choice questions.

The idea is that it would be easy for humans to identify the emotion or central theme, but much harder for bots to interpret the subtleties of human expression.

please help me understand. i've been programming for a long time and I started with web dev, for any project I always used vanilla JS, and in the past maybe something like bootstrap. But today React is absolutely everywhere. I can't find a single modern UI library that isn't dependent on it in some way. Every web project guide involves NextJS or React in some way, it's everywhere. Does nobody teach vanilla anymore? When did this shift happen?

I'm not a hater but I'm so surprised that I can't find much discussion on it.

Awhile ago I participated in a hackathon, and the winning project was a single-page react app that displayed a number pulled from a rest api. The fact that the app needed to be built and bundled, before deploying on an overcomplicated cloud saas platform, was crazy to me. That app would need 10 lines of JS max! I don't understand the react-ification of everything and I rarely see discussion on it. I'm sure it's great for apps that need a component library to function, but I don't see why it's absolutely everywhere. Is it like the modern jQuery? Everywhere for a few years and suddenly gone?

webdev,Image Hosting Approach for Small Web Site on Github Pages,"Hi all, I have a GitHub Pages site that I use for my portfolio and I'm working on expanding some of the functionality to support an online scorecard for a hobby league I'm part of. For context, the group paints Warhammer miniatures and submits a completion log to earn points based on certain submission criteria.

Thus far, this project is a fairly small repo (1.4mb because it has the entire Tabulator JS package in it) and I would like to keep it that way. However, I want to introduce an image gallery to the site and there are currently 45-50 images of varying sizes (not in the repo yet). I also expect that count to grow, especially after this site is released because I suspect participation will increase when users can see their submissions online alongside their friends'.

I know that hosting images on Github is bad practice, especially if those images change or change names over time, so I'd like to avoid doing so. Are there any recommended approaches to image hosting for a project like this?

Since this site is hosted freely on GitHub and I'm only paying for my domain, I'd like to keep it free *if* *possible*. I've seen CloudFlare suggested so that's first on my list to explore, but I'm curious if others have thoughts on image hosting for any similar smallish projects.

webdev,"What's the hype around Cursor? I see so many people saying it's great, but it actually made me laugh out loud how bad it was. Are they shills or am I using it wrong?","I've used Claude and Chad Jupiter before, and I find them useful for a few specific things. 

1. If there's some algorithm I'm pretty sure exists, but I don't know what it's called. 

2. If I'm trying to do something that's way out of my element, like say I want to try to train a model to do something. I don't really know shit about ML beyond surface level stuff, and even though the AIs spit out code that doesn't quite work, I do find it more useful than opening a book to the first page, as I learn best by building something, and they can at least lay out some sort of path for me to follow even if it's not the optimal one. 

For everything else I think they're a waste of time, because it takes me more brain power to code review their code than to write it myself.

More than a few times I've seen the name ""Cursor"" come up as being the cream of the crop, so I downloaded it, tried the free trial, and it turned out the be the sloppiest of the slop.

Here's an example of a prompt I put in. 

    # I need some Elixir code that align characters or groups of characters in pairs of strings. 
    # Here's an example of what the data might look like.
    # 
    # Input:
    # ```
    # abc,LlmNN
    # ccb,NNNNm
    # ac,LlNN
    # bab,mim
    # ```
    # Output:
    # ```
    # a b c,Ll m NN
    # c c b,NN NN m
    # a c,Ll NN
    # b a b,m i m
    # ```
    # So it will look at all the lines to figure out how it can group the letters. 
    # As you can see from the last example, `a` in this case is no longer `Ll`, but we still can figure out where to split it because the `b`-`m` pairing is something we've seen before.

I didn't spend much time on writing the perfect prompt, and maybe it could be improved, but for comparison Claude spit out runnable code, however it didn't actually solve the task as requested. Chad Jupiter started to write code, but spazzed out at the end. I didn't bother reviewing the code to see if it was on the right track, but it at least made an attempt. Cursor? ...?

    I'm not sure how to approach this. Any ideas?

Do I have any ideas?! If I have to come up with all the ideas what are you here for? At one point while adjusting the formatting on the prompt it did spit out some code, but it was just a function that read from a file and split at new lines. Literally not even required based on the prompt. Is Cursor just this shit, or am I using it wrong?

[Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/UmopPBE)

Here's Claude's code. It doesn't solve the problem and just seems to zip each line of characters together, so still pretty useless, but at least it's ~150 lines of running code, which is still, ever so slightly better than asking me for ideas about what to do.

    defmodule CharacterAligner do
      def align_strings(input_lines) do
        # Parse input lines
        parsed_lines =

webdev,Artstation embedding via RSS/API? ,"Hey all, I'm looking for ways i can embed my artstation projects onto my squarespace website.  
I'm not looking to embed it via IFrame, but i want specifically an area of my site to function as a responsive gallery and just display my posts from my artstation, with nothing else, and when clicked on it takes me to the original post.

**the caveat being; i need a FREE solution.** I am tight on income right now and just cannot justify the cost. So my ideal solution is free/open source, and easy for someone with little coding/IT knowledge to use.

thus far, i have tried RSS feeds, but artstation has low compatibility with them, the native RSS feed for artstation shows the wrong thumbnails for my posts, or doesn't display a thumbnail at all. something like [RSS.app](http://rss.app/) and their widgets is EXACTLY what i am looking for, but is not a free solution. I COULD use [OpenRSS.org](http://openrss.org/) and make an RSS through them, but i am limited to 10 items, when i have more than 10 items in my portfolio, and my goal is to display my full portfolio.

Can someone please help? i have been racking my brain over this for days. Anything is appreciated

  
EDIT: Is there potentially a website i can sync my artstation to and then connect THAT to an RSS?",GarboJuice,1gzx69i,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzx69i/artstation_embedding_via_rssapi/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzx69i/artstation_embedding_via_rssapi/,2024-11-25 23:21:24,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gzx69i

It got me thinking, what’s the one setup task you wish you never had to deal with again? For me, it’s definitely UI. I used to spend hours on getting pixel perfect UI and landing pages.

I created this as its always something that i've wanted to try and build. I came across lots of hiccups along the way but i got there in the end. This is simply for a portfolio project as i can only imagine the costs to scale this and make it stable for release.

\## Frontend:

\- \*\*Next.js 14\*\*

\- \*\*TypeScript\*\*

\- \*\*Tailwind CSS\*\*

\- \*\*Lucide Icons\*\*

\## Backend:

\- \*\*Next.js API Routes\*\*

\- \*\*Prisma\*\*

\- \*\*PostgreSQL (Neon)\*\*

\- \*\*Docker\*\*

\- \*\*NextAuth.js\*\*

\## Key Features:

\- GitHub integration for importing repositories

\- Environment variable management

\- Automatic deployments

\- Container management

\- Real-time deployment logs

\- Branch-based deployments

\## Infrastructure:

\- Docker containers for each deployment

\- Automated build process

\- Container orchestration

\- Environment isolation

\## Security:

\- JWT-based authentication

\- Secure environment variable handling

\- User-scoped resources

\- Docker container isolation

The most interesting part was implementing the deployment system using Docker. Each project gets its own isolated container, and the platform handles building, deploying, and managing these containers automatically.

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

Just like chatGPT.  
I was inspired to create it by a bunch of cases when you are trying to do something interesting, find a suitable library for it, but it doesn't have sufficient documentation.  
  
So here is a example with physics llibrary for Three.JS, its have no documentations at all, but provided with a few html files with code samples as a Example. Its enought for ai to analyze how it works and make a short explaination for me.

Have you guys tested the impact of using `rem` layouts these days? It really doesn't have many cases where it matters. I tested the following scenarios:

* Browser zoom (Ctrl + scroll)
* OS interface zoom
* Microsoft Edge font-size configuration

Edge's font-size configuration was the only test where `rem` scaled. The final question is: do the small percentage of users who need accessibility tools use font-size configuration or simply interface zoom? If interface zoom doesn't trigger `rem` scaling, is there any point in using it?

Ok, ok, I lied. There's one more question: should I use `rem` only for fonts or for spacing as well?

webdev,TIL - Why is the terminal called that,"I was listening to lecture on linux -this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gojeTqXdBH0), but it's in Arabic- and the lecturer talked about the first time the terminal was used, which was interesting and worth sharing, so I asked Claude to talk about the point he mentioned in more details so I can share it here:

The term ""terminal"" in computing comes from its literal meaning as an ""endpoint,"" rooted in the Latin ""terminus"" (meaning boundary or end). In early computing, terminals were physical endpoints - devices with just a screen and keyboard that connected to massive mainframe computers. Unlike other input methods like punch cards (which were more like dropping off mail and waiting), terminals were special because they were interactive endpoints where users could have real-time, two-way conversations with the computer.

Picture a mainframe computer in a room with cables running out to multiple terminals - each terminal was literally at the ""end"" of a connection, where the computer system met the human user. When you typed on your terminal, your input would travel up to the mainframe, get processed, and the results would immediately come back to your screen. This was revolutionary compared to punch cards, which required you to submit your entire program at once and wait hours or days for results.

Today's ""terminal"" or command-line interface isn't a physical device anymore, but we keep the name because it serves the same purpose: it's your direct, interactive conversation point with the computer, where you can type commands and get immediate responses. Modern terminals are actually programs (like Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows) that simulate those old physical terminals, carrying on that legacy of being the ""endpoint"" where human and computer meet for direct communication.",Mohammed_MAn,1gzhqp7,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,2024-11-25 12:30:35,0,0.42,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gzhqp7

webdev,Recommendations for a framework/architecture for an embedded application with maps and video,"I need some help with a web application stack/framework. The application is an autonomous ship, similar to a drone. The ship is the server and the application is the client. There may be multiple clients connected to the ship/server (probably fewer than a dozen clients per server). 

The ship/server will send GPS truth coordinates, weather data, and multiple video feeds. The client(s) will need to display all this data and have the ability to create routes for the ship, then upload those routes to the ship/server. The client needs to be extremely responsive (30 FPS, no lag kind of deal).

The client and server communicate over a closed network which may or may not have Internet access. Because of that and speed, I assume we must store the maps (nautical charts) locally to the client. The application/client hardware will likely be a commodity laptop, but may be as low-end as a Raspberry Pi for a remote control station (still a client). 

We're currently using websockets on the server side and the client uses pyside2 via Python. The existing application is very much an engineering GUI. We need to hire someone with real UI/UX experience and embedded web experience so that we have something more polished to show clients. But of course, I need to know what to write for the job description.

webdev,Need Advice: Integrating Stripe for SaaS Subscriptions with Supabase and Next.js,"Hi everyone!

I’m building a SaaS app where users can subscribe to plans that provide monthly credits (e.g., for generating content) and access to specific functionalities. Here’s the flow I’m aiming for:

1. Users subscribe to a plan via Stripe.
2. Based on their plan, they receive monthly credits and access to features.
3. Credits reset or roll over (depending on the plan) each month.
4. Users should be able to switch plans seamlessly.

I’m using **Supabase** for my database and **Next.js** for the front end. My app was built using **Cursor**, so I’m comfortable coding whatever is needed. However, I’d love to streamline this to speed up my time to market.

**Main Question:**  
Do I need to manually retrieve payment info for every user from Stripe each time to update the dashboard (e.g., plan details, payment status, etc.), or is there an easier integration method?

**What I’ve Considered:**

* Using Stripe’s **webhooks** for real-time updates.
* Storing subscription and plan info in Supabase and syncing it with Stripe as needed.
* Some libraries for Next.js (e.g., `stripe-node`), but not sure how well they integrate with Supabase.

If you’ve built a similar setup, I’d really appreciate any advice or resources to optimize this workflow.

I'm currently setting up an e com via Ebay and amazon. 

The products I want to offer are basically foam, cut to any size. 

Now I can offer pre cut products which are fine, however alot of things are unique size wise and I want to offer replacement services. 

This would require around 20-30 pages I think. As each shape would need it's own page description and dedicated calculator. 

I've had a go on squarespace and built a decent concept, however I can't figure out how to link my code I made using ai (and it works haha which is a shock) to their checkout. Which I think is a limitation of Squarespace or me. 

I am also a factory worker who had an idea however as I'm just starting out I have no idea about any of this other than time in the evenings to try and learn,. I do not know what is good and what is not so don't want to be ripped off I guess, but also what is fair for both me and them. 

Do I find a local agency and go with them? Or do I go on fiverr and try to find someone on there?

I am primarily a business student but have designed a few sites using basic htmll/css for class projects. I have a clothing store, and I have used WordPress up to this point to create a basic store and I'm running into this issue where I want to express my brand in the most authentic way, but WordPress has its limitations regardless of theme, lack of custom product borders, animations for opening quick view product pages, background animation etc. I loved the flash sites of the early 2000s when I was a kid and would love to capture that feeling. I've heard great things about Adobe Animate and their export to HTML5 feature, still weighing my options.

If anyone knows any resources to send me to that they can vouch for I would appreciate it. Any advice on what I should learn to do is also appreciated.



(Ik its not going to be an overnight process so I don't need that speech, I plan on keeping my main store up and design the other store over the course of the next year or so. I have looked it up on google but as we all know SEO&gt;Quality).",B2thedarbyel,1gzf33y,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzf33y/flash_sites_in_the_modern_era/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzf33y/flash_sites_in_the_modern_era/,2024-11-25 09:31:22,0,0.25,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1gzf33y

Was asked by senior colleague to develop website for a product we are developing. I did, decided to use Laravel, kept them abreast of developments.

I think I'll want to use just .html instead also because PHP is a bad language. I might also want to learn React at some point but I'm not really familiar with JavaScript and I'll only move to a frontend framework if really necessary because frameworks are usually used by people wanting to make things unnecessarily complicated and static is just fine 90% of the time"".

webdev,Trying to figure out how to better avoid this client situation,"**TL;DR: When to know when to cut your losses on a new ricocheting client?**

Someone I knew tangentially from a business transaction was struggling to make ends meet with her new business, so I offered to help with my skills and interests, some of which I was learning.

Things were progressing nicely, though she struggled understanding some necessary things with marketing and management. I can't call myself a pro with those things but I knew enough tangentially to make things work. I offered the services free to a certain point because I wanted the project on my portfolio and we got along well.

However, when it came down to images, I mentioned that I'm not a designer. She didn't like that answer, and said the previous team (which she said she couldn't afford) did that. I offered to do the free parts and they could send me the images. She didn't want separate entities working on the project. I later learned they also wrote all of the content, and a lot of it looked AI-generated. I generally don't write content, though AI makes things easier, which she at least understood.

Maybe this is the point where I should have cut ties: she said she has no money to spend, but insisted on a professional designer. Since I saw her just pay for something necessary for business management (not a big expense), I couldn't tell if she was being hyperbolic or not. I said, look, I don't know everything, but I'm offering you free marketing recommended by the hosting platform that the pros you paid didn't try. She kept going back and forth, eventually left on a ""let me talk to the other team"" note, and I figured why not see if I could just make the free marketing work.

She texted me some time later, saying she really needed bookings (she didn't have a scheduler set up, oddly), and I tried what I could, but after suggesting some shortcuts, she removed my access to the marketing page and ignored my texts.

So, while I learned some things about the tech/marketing stack, ultimately I couldn't even try what looked like would work quickly and cheaply for her situation.

**Anyway, is it better to be more skeptical than this with new clients?** I'm sort of new at consulting in the wild world myself, and I don't want to insult anyone or lose good leads, but the ping-ponging and apparent mixed messaging surprised me near the end.

I've been searching for a way to host the web page while restricting access to certain users within our domain. I stumbled upon Power Pages and thought it might be a solution.

My goal is to upload the fully formed page and its assets, using Power Pages solely for secure storage behind an Azure AD login. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to achieve this. Ideally, there would be an FTP-like mechanism to simply upload the folder and be done.

Right now I can't even figure out how to upload the image assets, each student's attendance is represented by 2 graphs for YTD attendance and 5 day attendance.

We have different story highlights for certain areas of the federation - ""Enrichment"", ""Early Years"", ""Training"" etc - where content gets grouped. I'd like similar buttons to appear on our website so that when they're pressed, people can easily look through the images without being redirected to Instagram itself. 

I've tried a widget by SociableKIT, and it was nearly what we needed, but it didn't pull through the titles, on the circular buttons. 

Any thoughts about how this could be achieved? 

Many thanks!

webdev,Framework for generating dynamic forms. ,"Hi all,

I am mostly a backend developer and not great with JS. So, looking for some advice. 

I have a project where there is an API, written by me, that provides JSON description of a form. As well as an endpoint to submit the form. 

Currently, I have vanilla JS with jQuery and bootstrap. That based on an FormID and containerID will render the specified form in the container. After getting the JSON from the API. 

The JS itself is now over 1000 lines long and a bit unmanageable. Thanks to there being a function for each input type. 

 I want the JS to be portable so that we can reference the script on any site and call the render function to inject the form. 

Any suggestions on frameworks ect on the best approach to manage this JS.

I am rolling my own auth system, for me to usje and  to prove it doesn't have to be complicated, and probably easier then solutions like NextAuth. Have to make docs, Firstly I created this [beautiful code block renderer ](https://beautiful-code-block.remcostoeten.com/)

and then I got carried away and created[ this interactive file-tree ](https://interactive-tree.remcostoeten.com/)component.

[aspect ratio is a bit off. Had a settings menu allowing changing of space\/font\/settings but rebase dungoofed me.](https://preview.redd.it/j5wm0y9utt2e1.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcd6719c37e9da1a274e048117792a2c0789b5cb)

Comes with a CLI that generates your entire tree + file contents in one command. Super customizable with tons of props, and (if I do say so myself) looks pretty damn good. It's not perfect, but it might be useful for someone else's docs or whatever use-case.

webdev,How to avoid duplicating html page in a static site ?,"I'm not a web dev. I have built a static website with two html pages so far

a) home page shows 6 products in a grid, each product image is a link.

b) a second html page shows details about first product.

My problem is that I found my self needing to duplicate the product.html page 6 times for each product.

All product pages have same structure and look and feel , except product name, description, and image.

what tool / technology / keyword do I need to look for to achieve this ?

I don't need dynamic/server, I have a static small list of products.

\----------------------

Update, I went with this solution:

* page 1 links to page2.html?someValue=ABC
* Page 2 can then read the query string and the key 'someValue'

Page 2 have in java script array list of products ( name, description, image )

Page 2 access the array based on the parameter.

Though static site generator like Jekyll and Astro looks cool and better.

webdev,Looking for Solutions: Building a Dental Clinic Management App (ERP or Otherwise),"I’m planning to build a dental clinic management app with features like patient management, employee tracking, finance, inventory, and more.

I’m now considering using ERP frameworks like Odoo or ERPNext, but I’m open to other solutions as well. My key questions:


1. How easy is it to customize these frameworks for dental-specific needs (e.g., treatment history, appointment reminders)?

2. Are there better tools or platforms to save time while keeping flexibility?

3. Any challenges or advice when integrating third-party tools (e.g., payment gateways, SMS)?

I created **YT Remote** to enhance YouTube experience, allowing you to control YouTube playback and manage tabs from any website or tab.

You can check it out here: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yt-remote/jodpnmokilccncpcgfjpmkhengjhligo?hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yt-remote/jodpnmokilccncpcgfjpmkhengjhligo?hl=en)

What started as a simple tool for managing YouTube tabs quickly evolved when I, as a developer, needed a way to control music across multiple YouTube tabs while working.I wanted something simple yet powerful — a sleek, intuitive tool that would let me play and pause music across YouTube tabs without interrupting my workflow.

That’s when **YT Remote** was born: a lightweight, easy-to-use extension designed to help you manage your YouTube experience seamlessly, whether you’re multitasking or simply listening to music while coding or working.

webdev,Drizzle compatibility with MySQL/MariaDB,"So, a lot of hosting providers replaced their MySQL servers with MariaDB servers. They *say* that MySQL server is running on host you purchased, but it is actually MariaDB. 

This is not a problem because switching MySQL server with MariaDB does not require any code changes in app connecting to it ([https://mariadb.com/database-topics/mariadb-vs-mysql/](https://mariadb.com/database-topics/mariadb-vs-mysql/)). 

Here Drizzle comes in. They stated that Drizzle is still not compatible with MariaDB: [Drizzle ORM - v1 Roadmap](https://orm.drizzle.team/roadmap). 

How is it possible that it is compatible with MySQL but not with MariaDB, if MariaDB is designed to be *drop-in* replacement for MySQL?

webdev,How to deal as a developer with large-ish json files embedded inside of an angular app?,"Context:

I have to maintain an angular 16 application, it is purely front-end.

The application has several large configuration files acting more like tables in a database which it gets it's data from.

Each file has an array of aprox 50 objects, which might not seem much but every object is very embedded with objects within objects within objects.

***I cannot change this, I tried asking, I tried offering other solutions (keep data on server in mongo or sql or etc and the FE app gets it via calls) it's not happening. The files are here to stay.***

A large part of my tasks ends up with me doing changes in these files by hand.

I know it doesn't sound like much but we're talking about large embedded objects without schemas, sometimes I need to only edit one sometimes I need to basically do a manual query to see some field from everything, sometimes I need to change in just 3 out of 50 objects.

My point is the work is very error prone because it's by hand and by me reading the files again and again to understand them.

***I cannot change this structure.***

As a developer what tools can I use to view/edit/manipulate these large json files in a sensible manner?

I am using VS Code as my code editor and my OS is Linux.

webdev,Do I need to use a context provider if I'm storing JWTs in a cookie anyway?,"I'm trying to implement JWT for my react/node.js app, but there are some parts that I'm confused about.

From my understanding: Client makes request to the backend -&gt; backend generates a token -&gt; sends it to the frontend -&gt; frontend stores the token on the client side(eg. cookie) so that you don't need to make a request to the server every time you want to access content.

However, I see people using React context providers to handle authentication as well.

Isn't the point of a context provider to pass down information down to children components, in this case, the authentication status?

Or are you meant to store the JWT token itself in the cookie, and use the context state to store information like ""{userAuth: true, favoriteColor: blue}""?

* XP-based task completion - harder tasks earn more points.
* Dynamic leveling system with milestone notifications &amp; streak tracking
* Tasks can have deadlines with bonus XP for early completion and penalty for overdue tasks
* Global leaderboard for competitive motivation (completely optional and you can ""opt-in"" and ""opt-out"" anytime). Privacy is respected.
* Google OAuth integration
* Cross-device synchronization (Data persists across devices)
* Guest users (data saves to local storage) and authenticated users (allows data sync)

# How are you awarded points?

Although at the base level, you get to decide the difficulty level and importance level of tasks, XP is also awarded by things like completing a task earlier than a set deadline, and how many days earlier you completed it. If a task is past the deadline, then there is an overdue penalty applied to your total points as well.

webdev,Is this a good solution?,"So I have to write a function that basically accepts an object, then returns a link with the properties in the object as url params. The object can have from 2 to 5 properties. So let's say the object is 

`{`  
`type: ""someType"",`  
`colour: ""someColour,`  
`size: ""someSize""`  
`}`

It returns ""link?type=someType&amp;colour=&amp;someColour&amp;size=someSize.

But the object can have 2, 3, 4 0r 5 properties.

My tired ass brain initially thought of using conditionals but that would make for one big and horrid piece of code.

So I opted to loop and push to an array, like so:

    const
     makeLink = (
    obj
    ) 
    =&gt;
     {
        
    let
     baseLink = ""www.myfakeshop.com/promo"";
        
    let
     link;
        
    let

        for (
    const
     property in

          }
          link = `${baseLink}?${params.join('&amp;')}`
