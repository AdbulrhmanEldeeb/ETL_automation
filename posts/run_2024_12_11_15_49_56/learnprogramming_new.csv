learnprogramming,Which route makes more sense for OO?,"# Preface

Overseer object that oversees production of *blank*. Builder object that builds a component. From my novice experience with OO and google, I think that what `Overseer` should do is tell each builder to build their component `Builder.build()` and `Overseer` doesn't care how it gets done. `Overseer` will then likely put the components together, or something else... But my issue is that *some* `Builder` objects need specifications whilst others don't.

Thinking of SOLID, and Interface Segregation amongst other things, doesn't that mean that only objects that require information have the implementation to do so? Maybe I could do this with interfaces alone, but my problem is thus: should `Builder` objects make calls to `Overseer` after being told to `.build()`?

# Example 1

* Overseer: Build this component.  `Builder.build()`
* Builder: Okay. What colour is it?
* `Overseer.order.get_colour()`
* Overseer: Blue.
* Builder: Okay. What material is it? `Overseer.order.get_material()`
* Overseer: Stone.
* Builder: Done.  `return component`

This is probably worded horribly, but I hope my point comes across.

# Example 2

* Overseer: Build this component. It needs to be blue and to be made of stone. `Builder.build(order.get_colour(), order.get_material())`
* Builder: Okay, but I don't care what colour it is.
* Builder: Done.

Which example makes more sense? I don't get OO (started in C, then Python and I'm aware that Python is not a OO language) and don't know if I'm thinking in the right way.

To me, example 1 makes sense because then `Overseer` does not care how stuff gets done, but in example 2 it would *have* to care because it would have to keep track of which `Builder` object uses what information... right?",Warmspirit,1hbvwz0,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,2024-12-11 15:25:22,1,0.67,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbvwz0

learnprogramming,Why Do Engineers from Tier-3 Colleges Struggle to Compete in Product-Based Company Interviews? Need Help to Bridge the Gap!,"I’m a software engineer from a tier-3 college, currently working at a tier-3 company as a .NET developer. Sometimes, when I look at the interview processes of top product-based companies, they seem overwhelmingly challenging and far beyond my current skills and understanding.

It makes me wonder—why don’t we, as engineers with similar levels of experience, have the same technical capabilities?

For instance, topics like data structures and system design, which are commonly asked in these interviews, often feel like fairy tales to many of us. But the reality is, mastering them is essential to becoming a competent and competitive software engineer in today’s industry.

My question is: how can a working professional with an average understanding of these concepts bridge the gap to reach that level of expertise? What structured approach should we follow to solidify our fundamentals and grow to a point where we can confidently compete in the current tech landscape?

learnprogramming,Should I consider switching to C++ from Rust for learning purposes?,"So for context, I'm a college student currently specializing in cyber security and I've been into computer science for a very long time and have being studying these concepts for a decently long time now. During this time I've tried out a bunch of different languages, mostly because I got bored (which isn't the best idea but younger me was stupid). For the past year-ish I've been using rust, which has been a amazing experience for the most part. I really enjoyed working concepts of errors as values and optional types for return values, which I had seen for the first time in a language. The only complaint I've had so far is the difficulty curve with rust. For my studies, its probably a good thing to start maintaining decent ranks in competitive programming websites like LeetCode, and rust is hard to work with for these problems, at least for me at this point. I've considered trying out C++ instead, but coming from rust, C++ just feels 'rustic' to put it simply, lacking features like errors as values which I've come to adore and probably can't live without anymore. It is, however, easier to get things done in C++ since I don't have to have to wrestle with the borrow checker at every turn.

I'm quite conflicted at this point. I could either continue using Rust and hope to simply get good enough to work with it, or switch to and learn C++, which will be pain coming from rust, having to give up such amazing features that rust has.

I was hoping I could get some pointers on what I should do in this situation by people that know more about the field in general than me.

Effectively, I have a little landing page that I am using for a handful of buttons that fire-off fetch request re: using webhooks.

What I am trying to achieve is, high-level, a user taps a button and that triggers a webhook, but without redirecting the user anywhere or opening a blank page/tab - the button should just work like a trigger/toggle.

I've tried (I think) the various combinations or HTTP and HTTPS, reverse proxy, portforward, POST vs GET, no-cors etc.

I know the webhook, link, server etc are all working as I can use the webhook link just in a browser - hit ender - and it triggers without a problem, so it's beyond me why it's so hard to achieve the same thing at button push.

I get various errors (depending on which iteration I've tried re: above) but the most common (from browser console) include

&gt;GET request failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch

&gt;VM2330:7  Mixed Content: The page at 'https://HOSTING-URL' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'WEBHOOK-URL'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

Hopefully what I'm trying to do is possible! and simply, with a little tweak, but if not - just for FYI - the webhook url is https, as is the site the button will be on. The Mixed content error is just a result of my trying to find the right combination (as above), so it pops up whenever I use a miss-matched HTTP/S combination.

learnprogramming,"Graduating Soon and Preparing for 2025 Recruiting Season – Looking for Advice on Learning, Career Path, and Certifications!

","Hi guys,

I’m graduating from the University of Miami this spring with a degree in **Econ** (minor in Finance), and I’ve been diving into Python over the last month. So far, I’ve worked through the **beginner, arrays, and hash tables modules** on LeetCode, and I’m also doing a **DSA course on Udemy** and a **Python for Finance course**. My plan is to eventually build something cool (maybe a financial model) for my GitHub.

Here’s where I’m at:

* **LeetCode:** I’ve finished arrays and hash tables! I’m starting to get medium problems but still struggle to solve them completely on my own.
* **Python Projects:** Trying to come up with ideas—thinking something finance-related that could help me stand out.
* **Timeline:** I’ve got about 9 months until 2025 recruiting kicks off in September. Over the summer, I want to tackle side projects or even volunteer work to build up my skills and experience.

Also, I’m 25—am I too old to be starting in tech? I’d love to hear if anyone else has been in a similar boat and how they made it work.

I’d really appreciate any advice on:

1. **What to learn next:** What should I focus on in DSA and Python to keep improving?
2. **Career path tips:** I love the mix of finance and tech—what roles or projects would make me a stronger candidate?
3. **Certifications or resume boosters:** Are there any certs or must-have skills I should add to my plan?

I know the job market is tough, but I’m trying to use this time to get myself in the best shape possible for recruiting. Any advice, ideas, or resources would mean a lot.

learnprogramming,Almost Completed my Degree and I'm Looking to Learn Python,"Hello,

I'm a Computer Science student looking to broaden my horizons in which languages I can use. For some background, I first learned programming in high school with C++, went to college and used a little bit of C, Assembly, VB, and Java. While I was initially in college I got some serious imposter syndrome and decided to do something else with my life for awhile. 

Last year I decided to go back to school to finish my degree and realized that most of my problems were in my head. I have had no problem picking Java (and a bit of C++) back up, even though I hadn't programmed in over 10 years. I'm finishing up early next year and I was wondering what would be a good place to start with learning Python (and possibly other languages) at my skill level. Is there an online guide for someone who isn't a total beginner? I'm not looking to be stuck doing tutorials. I also bought a Humble Bundle a few years ago that has 18 books on Python from No Starch Press. There is a bunch of options in there, but I'm not sure where to start.

Right now, I have some free time and want to use it to learn the basics of a programming language over the next month, spending 4-5 hours a day on it. I’m thinking of starting with C++ because a senior recommended it. They said the syntax is similar to Java, so I’d be preparing for Java while also learning C++. But I’ve heard that jumping between languages without mastering one first isn’t a good idea.

Should I just start with Java since I’ll need it for my course, or is it okay to start with C++ now and come back to Java later? I’d prefer to try C++ first, but I’m not sure if that’s the best move or if it’ll just be a waste of time.

learnprogramming,Python on the web questions.,"I have written some python code that generates a few .png using matplotlib with some data I get from an API. I want to regenerate these images daily, and share them with one or more people. Currently this involves me sending an email every day. I'd rather have it hosted on the web where it's easily accessible.   
  
Two questions: 1.) Is there a photo hosting site that has an API I can automatically upload them to? If so, I assume you can program a computer to automatically run some python code at a set time each day, what would I search to learn more about this?  
  
2.) Some of the parameters are customizable, so I'd rather have a little website that allows the other person be able to adjust some parameters and generate the images on the fly. Is Django the best way to get this done? If so, should I host it on a VPS or is there a simpler place to run this web app? Theoretically, these plots/data have monetary value, so I'd eventually want to lock it behind a login as well. I know this seems like I might be biting off more than my amateur self can chew.

learnprogramming,Has reading SICP helped you improve in your day job?,"Hi everybody! So I recently started reading SICP and just finished the first chapter ([link to my exercise solutions if anyone is interested](https://github.com/iagombermudez/sicp_book)).

So far, the book has helped me to fully understand the concept of recursion and to be very comfortable using it. During my time as a comsci student I had to complete many assignments that require the use of recursion, but nothing compared to what you need to do in this book since recursion is basically your only tool to create loops.

Another concept that I think is key is the concept of abstraction, which has been repeated across the entire chapter. However, I think this might be more useful if you don't have a lot of experience programming. I think it's still a good concept to review though, and one important thing that the book reiterates is that you don't need to abstract everything (something that I tend to forget from time to time lol).

So if any of you have gotten past the first chapter and would like to give your opinion on if it's worth to read it solely from a perspective of improving as a software engineer, I would love to hear from you!

So far, I think I will continue reading it just because I find it interesting and the exercises are entertaining, but maybe I won't finish the entire book since it's very time consuming (for reference, reading the first chapter and completing all the exercises took me around 2 weeks of daily studying for around one hour and a half).",Iamabrmdz,1hbgo6d,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbgo6d/has_reading_sicp_helped_you_improve_in_your_day/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbgo6d/has_reading_sicp_helped_you_improve_in_your_day/,2024-12-11 00:21:05,4,0.71,4,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbgo6d

Also next semester there will be DSA course so from my perspective it looks like the good idea to start grinding Leetcode. However I have little to zero knowledge of DSA (I know arrays, lists, some kinds of trees, stacks, queues, recursion, several search algos, but nothing about hash tables and more complex ds and no serious knowledge of algos). Is Leetcode a good idea in situation like that? If it's no so good one, what should I do to become better?

learnprogramming,WhatsApp chatbot with Python,"Hello people! This whole year I've been learning Python and although I've already been working on some small things, I wanted to get into something more ambitious. I'm not sure that creating a Chatbot for WhatsApp is specifically ambitious, but it's something I've been wanting to do and it seemed like a good opportunity to test my Python knowledge.

If someone could give me a guide on how to approach the project, it would help me a lot. I can give more specifications of the idea I have in mind about the specific Chatbot I want to create, if necessary. 

Another concern I have is if there are chances of doing it 100% free, or if there will always be something that I have to pay in the process of creating the Chatbot and implementing it on WhatsApp.

learnprogramming,New to Web Development - Need help,"
Hello everyone,

I’m very new to web development (rookie alert! 😅). I’ve learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript for a year now at University but we haven’t.. well I’d assume go in depth and details of every part there is to know, but I’m currently working on building a website for someone I know just for fun—kind of as a surprise for them!

One of the things I’d like to add to the website is an admin page. For example, I’ve got an events page, and I want the site owner to be able to easily add events (title, image, description, etc.) through this admin page. Once they submit the form, it will push the new event to the events page. I’ve read a bit about CMS (Content Management Systems) and think it might be the answer, but I’m not sure

If anyone has experience with this and is willing to guide a newbie, I’d be super grateful! I’m using Visual Studio Code for my development and would love any tips, resources, or guidance you can offer.

Also, I know I’m a rookie, so any feedback or help would mean a lot. If anyone is willing to personally message me to walk me through it and maybe making this website come true, I’d really appreciate it!

I realise now that I'm not very interested in most of the hot areas like machine learning, web/app development or game development in Unity, etc. What I'm actually interested in is stuff that makes me really think like programming puzzles, or maybe making a physics engine, making an algorithm visualiser, making a compiler, etc.

And I realised that maybe C++ is a good language because it seems like most of the things I'm interested in (compilers, graphics programming, OS) are done using it. But I've also heard that it's a very complicated language and takes a long time to learn well enough to land a good job in it. But I want to be able to get a decent internship and job by the end of my degree.

They suggested that instead of solely focusing on DSA and traditional software engineering roles, we should shift our attention to **emerging fields** like:

* **AI/ML**

Is DSA really overrated in 2024, or is it still the best way to break into software engineering roles?

learnprogramming,Best approach to store data values in the database from an OCR scan for a rule-based system?,"I'm using OCR to scan a document and compile all findings in a single field in a JSON-like structure (e.g. ""gender: male, age: 2, country: Yemen""). It should be noted that it is necessary to use the OCR to scan the findings, so it is expected that the scanned results will always be different/inaccurate.

The reason for compiling all in a single field is because the findings from the OCR are inconsistent or unstructured, like different amount of info/fields in every document, or different kinds of info/fields in every document. And most importantly, I'm using a rule-based system to filter records based on the findings (e.g. input:""get me all males aged 20-40 that live in Yemen""). 

Is storing all findings in a single field a good approach for a rule-based system? BTW i'm using a non-relational database (MongoDB).

learnprogramming,Merging two Arrays together in C. Why does this work?,"Hi, for learning i tried to program c code, that merges two monotonically increasing arrays into a new one inside of a function. I tried for hours, did one approach with pointers (didn't went that good) and this one. It works, but i can't wrap my head around why. Here is the code of the function (look for the comments): 

    unsigned merge(int array_1[], int array_2[], int length_1, int length_2) {
    
      int array_3[length_1 + length_2];
      int *ptr_1 = array_1;
      int *ptr_2 = array_2;
    
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length_1 + length_2; i++) {
    
        if ( i &gt; length_1 + 3) { //Why does this work?
          array_3[i] = *ptr_2++;
        } else if ( i &gt; length_2 + 3) { //Why does this work?
          array_3[i] = *ptr_1++;
        } else {
          array_3[i] = *ptr_1 &lt;= *ptr_2 ? *ptr_1++ : *ptr_2++;
        }
      }
    
      int length_3 = sizeof(array_3) / sizeof(*array_3);
    
      for (int j = 0; j &lt; length_3; j++) {
    
        printf(""[%d]: %d\n"", j, array_3[j]);
      }
    
      return length_3;
    }

I know now how to program it more readable but why does this if-condition i &gt; length + 3 work? Initially the idea behind those conditions was to stop getting values from the shorter array, when the pointer is at the end of the array. I tried several things but this + 3 made it work, but that doesn't seem to make any sense. Maybe someone can explain this to me.

Our school is looking to implement a coding class into the curriculum, in the upcoming semester.  I'm looking at about 5 weeks to prepare a 18 week course, and I'm hoping you can help.  I have talked to my brother, who is a programmer, and he suggests emphasizing in either Python, C# or Java.  So looks like I'll be learning with them for at least the first year.

Anyway, for those who are a little more advanced at programming, do you have any other suggestions?  (I am aware of the CS50 that Harvard offers, I might use that for the class as well)

Thanks!

  
Edit: Thanks for the feedback everyone!  I should also add that the school used to utilize a program called [code.org](http://code.org) .

learnprogramming,Is there any workaround for using PyCharm CE on a remote machine (ssh)? Or do I need to switch to VSCode?,"I've been using PyCharm for many many years and I absolutely love it. I mainly code (99%) in Python, so PyCharm has always been the easy choice. I recently started doing some work where I have to ssh into a machine to run my scripts and while I can write the code locally, there's no way in PycharmCE to run a debugger onto a remote machine and see all the steps locally. I'm aware of the [remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-development-starting-page.html) from the professional edition of Pycharm, but my work does not allow for it, I can only use the community edition.

I know that VSCode has a similar option to work on a remote machine and it's free, so I could switch to that, but my muscle memory is so tied to the Pycharm workflow that switching to VSCode is going to affect my productivity for at least a few months, until I learn it all from scratch.

So, before I switch to VSCode for good, is there any workaround for using PyCharm remotely using the community edition? Oh, I can't simply install PyCharm on the remote machine because it doesn't have a graphic server (it's container stuff), so I can only use ssh.

First is either a text based of ASCII based RPG. I'd assume a text based one wouldn't be too hard. I could have a few classes and stats, but I don't know how I'd code the enemies and make it challenging enough to be able to fail. This however would probably be a project that would help me gain a ton of experience. I'm not sure if I'd be able to do this though with the level of experience gained in CS50. It may be worth doing in a language other than C.

The second idea, which is also probably complex is a minecraft skin maker. Basically a simple pixel based editor. A lot of people say to learn it, to solve a problem. However I don't have anything I can think of that needs solving. I am extremely interested in CS, but I'm not experienced enough in programming to recognize things I do on the daily.

The only other thing I could think of, that may be hard at this point in time, is to find a way to program a calendar that would be able to take the appointments and things my wife have to do from IOS and Android and consolidate it into one calendar.

a) ""Splitting"" capability: What is splitting? If you hold two cards with the same value, like two eights or two sixes, you can split them into separate hands and play each hand individually. For this project, once the two cards are split, they should be treated as two separate hands, each with its own ""hit,"" ""stay,"" and ""split"" (if the two cards are the same) buttons. To achieve this, I need to add a button that appears only when the player holds two identical cards, and otherwise stays hidden. Once the button is clicked, the two cards should be split into two hands.



b) ""Reset"" capability: Currently, the game can only be reset by refreshing the page. I need to create a button that resets the game environment and starts a new game by clearing the scores and cards, without refreshing the page.



c) Disable ""hit"" button: When the player's total exceeds 21, the ""hit"" button should be disabled and grayed out to prevent further action, until the game is reset or a new game begins.



I’ve managed to get b) and c) working, but no matter what I try, I haven’t been able to get splitting to work. Additionally, I need to add a backlog feature that tracks matches, pauses, and records the player's progress, so users can return to their previous place in the game.

learnprogramming,Seeking Advice for Implementation,"

Hi r/learnprogramming ! 👋

I'm a Salesforce developer with a bit of experience in web development and Java from about 10 years ago. A couple of friends need a tool to help them with the logistics of serving cocktails for events which should include features for adding, editing, and deleting cocktails from a database and calculating ingredient quantities based on the number of participants.

# Project Overview:

* **Functionality**:
   * Manage a database of cocktails (name, ingredients, quantity).
   * Calculate ingredient quantities based on selected cocktails and number of participants.
   * Nice-to-have in the feature: being able to export a file with the list of ingredient, calculate the number of glasses required ect

# My Goals:

1. **Ease of Use**: The tool needs to be easy to use for someone who isn’t a developer. Ideally, it should work on someone’s personal computer without requiring any special setup.
2. **Portability**: I want to ensure that anyone can use this tool without needing to install additional software or perform complex configurations.
3. **Long-Term Maintainability**: Considering my last serious web project was nearly a decade ago, I’m seeking advice on modern best practices to ensure the project remains maintainable and can be easily improved or expanded in the future.

# Questions:

1. **Which Tech Stacks would you recommand me to base my project on?** I've thinking of maybe an local website using HTML/JS but I dont know how to easily handle the database 
2. **How can I make this project easily portable and usable on someone else's computer?** What setup steps would be needed from an end-user perspective?
3. **What are the best practices for managing a simple local database in this context?** Are there any tools or framework that I can use?

Additional Information:

1. As a Salesforce dev, I am comfortable with object programming logic (the Salesforce language is close to Java), I do JS/HTML5/CSS and SOQL

learnprogramming, How to Simulate Realistic Bus Movement on a Map for a Hackathon Demo?,"I'm building a real-time bus tracking application for a hackathon, and it's almost complete. However, I'm stuck on simulating bus movement on the map for the demo.

Currently, if I change the latitude and longitude of a bus through Postman, the bus jumps instantly to that location on the frontend. While this works technically, it doesn’t feel realistic.

For the hackathon demo, I want to show the bus moving smoothly on the map to make it look more natural. We’re simulating the bus position using the driver’s phone location (no GPS device involved).

How can I simulate this movement to look continuous and realistic? Any ideas or tips for making the demo more impressive would be greatly appreciated!

learnprogramming,Something isn't working. I need advice.,"I'm a first-year undergrad studying Business. For the past year, I have been working full-stack, using React and React Native as the frontends. I loved it. I started with React, but soon realized that I should be more focused on mobile development to align myself with my goals, so I naturally went to React Native. 

I used RN for 7-8 months, and while I enjoyed coding with RN, I kept hitting limitations. Complex animations are near-impossible with RN, and theres just so many small little features, such as 'blur', that are just one line of code when programming natively for Android or iOS, but give so much headache in RN. So, I started learning Swift and SwiftUI, and have been using it exclusively for the last 2 months.

Unlike when I started with React and RN, I decided to really get myself to understand the ins and outs of Swift and follow a more established path to learning it. I read many comprehensive books and followed many tutorials on it, and I, now, have a very solid foundation, and can comfortably navigate myself through it. But I've come to realize: I hate Swift. I hate Apple.

I've always used Windows. I've always viewed MacOS negatively. Though, to program natively for iOS, you need to use a MacOS. Now, over the past 2 months, I've gotten used to using a mac, but I simply just prefer windows for everything. If I'm programming, I'll have my windows and my mac open, and I would do any research on my windows, and code on mac. If I'm designing a UI, I would do everything on my windows, but use my mac to occasionally paste svg icons from SF Symbols (which aren't available to windows, thanks Apple). I have an Iphone, I have an Apple watch, I have airpods, but I just hate macs.

But the worst part is XCode. I genuinely hate XCode with a passion. It's a good IDE, don't get me wrong, but I despise Apple's dedication to giving its developers the least amount of customization possible. With VSCode, you are able to download any extension, and customize it in basically any way you can imagine. I love the open-source community.

Alright, lets move onto Swift and SwiftUI. It feels... weird? I've had experience with JavaScript, Python, and even a little bit of C#, but Swift just feels really weird to me. It has a lot of features right out of the box, such as app storage and environmental variables, whereas with RN, I had to manually spend hours configuring Redux Toolkit and storage persistence. But, I'm realizing now that I much enjoyed writing all that boilerplate code for the external libraries to make applications using RN. I miss the feeling of taking so many open-source contributions, reading documentation on them, and then implementing them into my project. Some had really good docs, which felt amazing to see, some were more frustrating with hard-to-follow docs. I miss the feeling of having this variety. Every NPM package was a different package and you knew what each one did. In Swift, ofcourse there are packages, ofcourse there is the Swift package manager, but working with Swift just feels like you're working with one project, and everything is just supplied to you, barely any variant.

And all of this just destroys my motivation to code every time I sit down. There were, unavoidably, headaches and hardships with React and React Native, but atleast I enjoyed it. Now I just feel like I'm being forced to work with software I hate and at the same time supporting a company I hate. But I need to use Swift. I need to develop for iOS, and there is nothing that comes near to the power of Swift for iOS development.

TDLR; I hate Swift. I hate Xcode. I hate Apple. I hate Macs. How can I make myself more motivated to work with Swift.",RareDestroyer8,1ha38pa,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ha38pa/something_isnt_working_i_need_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ha38pa/something_isnt_working_i_need_advice/,2024-12-09 06:03:38,1,0.67,1,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ha38pa
learnprogramming,am i taking the right decision? ,"im an information systems engineer student (it has some similarities with CS), second year. 

  
in 3 months summer break ends and i will face a very feared class which involves coding an operating system and i thought that it would be a good idea to learn more about programming. 

currently i feel interested to learn how to develop an android mobile app (as i have an android) so i found an android course which uses kotlin as the language and im a bit skeptical of this as kotlin is mostly used in android mobile app dev (really specific niche, my degree focuses on more of an understanding of the entire process of the development of the product) so im a bit scared that learning kotlin which might never be useful to me. Maybe learning java would be better but i cant find any recommended course and i dont want to hop on a random course either. (Dont get me wrong, if you tell me that kotlin could be a useful language to learn aside from android development im staying with the course i found which was recommended to me).

what would you do? 

CS classes i took: algorithms and data structures (C++), discrete math and computers architecture

learnprogramming,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6vx,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:54,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9l6vx

My current plan is to render a 3d model like an obj file, and take individuals slices/planes at 6 degrees intervals as a plane rotates through it. These could then be stitched together with ffmpeg into a 900fps video and played on the rotating display. 60 frames per rotation, 15 rotations per second, 246k pixels.

The display should support this refresh rate as it updates the pixels 2 rows at a time at 1920hz.

My question is what's the best way to go about this, what should I program it in and how? I'm looking into python and trimesh at the moment as that has a voxelise feature which could help, and a slice feature built in. Is there already existing software that could do this for me?

My ""makefile"" (actually just a bash file) looks like this: `gcc -O -Wall -W -pedantic --std=c17 -o game main.c -lSDL3 -lm`

It compiles fine, so I guess my installation of SDL3 was successful. The CMake script put it in `/usr/local/` instead of just `/usr/` where apt put SDL2.

libSDL3.so.0 is in here: 

    /usr/local/lib$ ls -a
    .   cmake       libSDL3.so.0      libSDL3_test.a  python3.10
    ..  libSDL3.so  libSDL3.so.0.1.3  pkgconfig

The weird thing though is that [libSDL3.so](http://libSDL3.so) is a link to libSDL.so.0, which in turn is a link to libSDL.so.0.1.3 which are all in the same folder... I have no idea what that is good for, but then again, I am a newb.

What should I do? I found a similar problem someone had with SDL2 back in the day, on SO, but I don't really understand that thread.

I only know the basics of C and python and I cannot find the solution to such questions with my limited knowledge of loops, arrays, conditional statements, recursion, etc., especially on a time limit ( I'd need a day to solve there on my own LOL ) here's a sample question to explain what I'm referring to:



&gt;Problem Description:

You have a restaurant at a beachside which has N dining tables. Each dining table has only one chair so each table can accommodate only one person. These dining tables are along a straight line parallel to the beach at positions x1 ,...,xN.

C customers are currently queued up outside the restaurant since you have reopened the restaurant after a long time due to the pandemic. You need to assign the dining tables to the customers such that the minimum distance between any two customers is as large as possible in order to take care of the precautions considering the current pandemic situation. (Consider all C customers dine at the same time)

Find the largest minimum distance possible.


&gt;Input Description:

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and c (2 ≤ C ≤ N).
The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 1000000000) - The elements of the array W.


&gt;Output Description:

For each test case, print the answer: The largest minimum distance.

I'm not sure if this system is good; the problem is that this site will be public (rightly so), I would need a sort of protected virtual archive directly connected to the website page where it is possible to put and extrapolate the files (which on the page will appear as audio in scalar order while in the archive the files will be divided into folders and subfolders based on the name of the user and the file so as to make the collection and storage of files more orderly and efficient).  
So my questions are:  
Is there a better way I can use the database to point to folders or some other better way to store files? If my system is otherwise acceptable, could you tell me about a virtual archive service that can do what I requested?

learnprogramming,Read Description - Converting Text XML to Binary DAT File,"Hello everyone,  
I am currently using a BluRay Disc Creator program. Unfortunately, there are very limited customization features in this software for what I am looking to do. Thankfully, there are THEME folders that allow further customization by changing the replacing the preset images. I contacted the developers of the software and they have been able to help me with some small things (adjusting resolution / sizes for the software to accept), but there are some issues they said they can't resolve for some reason. They created a variation of one of the THEME folders for me that included a XML file and a DAT file. Normally there is just a DAT file that is gibberish and can't edit. I believe the developer made a mistake and forgot to delete the XML file after they converted it to DAT format for the software to read. The XML file contains lots of additional styling info that I should be able to tinker with. I asked the developer if they could tell me how to convert the XML file to the DAT file after I have changed some styling options. Unfortunately, they declined saying they do not want people to tinker with that kind of file. I already have the XML file that I can edit and the DAT file that shows gibberish that it was converted from.  
Couldn't I use the DAT file to translate the XML file and vice versa?  
I can share the files to anyone willing to help. Just comment!

learnprogramming,Why isn't my code unzipping the file given by the user? ,"I am writing a batch file that encrypts/compresses and unencrypts/decompresses a file. When the user chooses to unencrypt/decompress, the program does unencrypt it, but it does not decompress it, and I cannot figure out why.

Here is the section in question:

    SET /P FILEPATH=Please enter entire filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt: 
    ECHO 
    SET /P UNENCRYPTED=Please enter filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt, but without the final extension. For example, filepath.backup.zip.aes becomes filepath.backup.zip:
    
    aescrypt.exe -d %FILEPATH%
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET FILE_PATH=%%~dpF
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET FILENAME=%%~nxF
    cd %FILE_PATH%
    TAR -xf %FILENAME%
    

I tried first to strip filename.backup.zip.aes of its last extension so I could unzip that by doing this:

    FOR %%F IN (%FILENAME%) DO SET UNENCRYPTED=%%~dpnF
    TAR -xf %UNENCRYPTED%
    

Then I tried to unzip that, but it didn't work.

After that I tried taking the .zip extension off of UNENCRYPTED and putting it back on in the tar command like this:

    FOR %%F IN (%FILENAME%) DO SET UNENCRYPTED=%%~dpnF
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET NOEXTENSION=%%~dpnF
    TAR -xf %NOEXTENSION%.zip
    
    

but I got the same result.

Finally I decided to prompt the user a second time for the filepath without the last extension, as shown in the current code, but it doesn't work either. If anyone can point me to the problem I would be beyond grateful.",MagesticTortoise,1h99sxj,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h99sxj/why_isnt_my_code_unzipping_the_file_given_by_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h99sxj/why_isnt_my_code_unzipping_the_file_given_by_the/,2024-12-08 03:28:59,5,0.74,5,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Debugging,,t3_1h99sxj
learnprogramming,[batch] Not sure why this command is crashing my game.,"if !rx%x%,ry%y%! EQU # goto backup

\^That's the command itself. As for what's going on...

Context:

I'm making a game where text characters are used for graphics- you play as a capital X, there's an enemy capital M to avoid, periods are used to mark empty spaces and the command above is my attempt at getting the game to recognize walls (marked with #).

    @echo off
    setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
    title M-Quest (test bench ver.)
    set x=2
    set y=2
    REM ^Them thar be the player coordinates. X and Y values on a grid, simple as.
    REM Disclaimer, the grid for this demo is only 2x2 spaces. The version I'm working on is 10x10. In the code below, you'll notice I have individual ""set"" commands for each pair of coordinates rather than using two ""for"" commands. Don't ask me why it runs faster this way, it just does. Trust me, I ain't happy about it either, since it makes expanding the game grid a pain. For a 2x2 grid, I only gotta set 4 variables. For 10x10, that's 100 variables that need individually set in three places- :roomGen, :screenSet, and :screen. Apologies, but limiting your play area in this demo ver saves me 288 very boring lines of code, and makes finding the VERY IMPORTANT comments coming up way friggin' easier.

    :roomGen
    set rx1,ry1=.
    set rx1,ry2=.
    set rx2,ry1=.
    set rx2,ry2=.
    REM The ""r"" in the above variable names stands for ""reference"". I'll explain why later.

    :screenSet
    set sx1,sy1=%rx1,ry1%
    set sx1,sy2=%rx1,ry1%
    set sx2,sy1=%rx1,ry1%
    set sx2,sy2=%rx1,ry1%
    REM the ""s"" in the above variable names stands for ""screen"". Again, to be explained.

    :screen
    color 0a
    set sx%x%,sy%y%=X
    echo %sx1,sy2% %sx2,sy2%
    echo %sx1,sy1% %sx2,sy1%
    REM Behold, you can see now! Note that one of the SCREEN variables gets changed- the one you're at- but the reference variables aren't touched. When you move, :screen will only show you where you currently are, but it will NOT reset the screen variables to what they should be when you're not atop of them. Without :screenSet, moving from x1,y2 to x2,y2 would cause BOTH of those screen variables to display on the screen as an X, since sx1,sy1 was never reset. TLDR, :screenSet exists to clear the screen, :roomGen exists to tell :screenSet what a clear screen even looks like, and :screen exists to draw the screen. Note that the reference values in roomGen aren't for show- changing those changes what the room actually is. If you wanted to add walls, NPCs, or items, you'd change the corresponding reference value in :roomGen to make that happen.

    choice /c wasd &gt;nul
    if errorlevel 4 goto right
    if errorlevel 3 goto down
    if errorlevel 2 goto left
    if errorlevel 1 goto up

    echo Gratz.
    pause
    exit

    :up
    set /a fy=%y%+1
    if %fy% GTR 2 goto screenSet
    REM ""fy"" = ""future y value"" if you hadn't gathered. Checking for (in the case of :up) the upper border of the screen.
    set /a y=%y%+1
    set backAxis=y
    set backWay=-
    REM Two more elements of the command causing the crash- backAxis says which axis (X or Y) is to be changed in the event the player is forced backward (like from colliding with a wall). backWay says weather to add or subtract from that value, + being up or right and - being down or left.
    goto collision
    :down
    set /a fy=%y%-1
    if %fy% LSS 1 goto screenSet
    set /a y=%y%+1
    set backAxis=y
    set backWay=+
    goto collision
    :left
    set /a fx=%x%-1
    if %fx% LSS 1 goto screenSet
    set /a x=%x%-1
    set backAxis=x
    set backWay=+
    goto collision
    :right
    set /a fx=%x%+1
    if %fx% GTR 2 goto screenSet
    set /a x=%x%-1
    set backAxis=x
    set backWay=-
    goto collision

    :collision
    REM The game gets here just fine.
    if !rx%x%,ry%y%! EQU # goto backup
    REM A pause command inserted here will never be executed- the game window has already closed.
    goto screenSet
    :backup
    REM A pause command inserted here will never be executed- the game window has already closed.
    set /a %backAxis%=!%backAxis%!!%backWay%!1
    REM Oddly enough, this command (when placed in :screen for testing, prior to the creation of :collision) worked perfectly fine. Whichever way you went, you would correctly go the opposite direction every time the screen refreshed until new values for backAxis and backWay were set.
    goto screenSet

Anyhow, if you'll excuse me, I deleted what I *thought* was the OneDrive backup of this game from what I *thought* was OneDrive... and turned out to be my actual, on-PC documents folder.

And then Notepad live updated, clearing all text from the entire program at once. Worst part is I've gotten in the habit of shift+deleting files which means no recycle bin backup, and what I've covered in this demo doesn't include save file creation for each room, entering into new rooms, monster behavior, or basically half the rest of the game... so I gotta get to re-writing that now. Thanks in advance!

A. Returns `NA`  
B. Throws an error because 4 is not a valid position

learnprogramming,Is the programming dream a harsher reality?,"TLDR: did your enthusiasm for coding die or fade once you got employment, or did you find the same joy as when you were doing more independent learning challenges?

I started doing the Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python course. And I absolutely love it. I made the blackjack challenge without searching for any of my code just of what I learnt previously and it was such a cool feeling. (First small project in that course)

I’m trying to get back into it, now with a more focused approach of getting a job as a goal and learning enough to do some pretty cool projects ideas I have. But I’m scared what if I spend this 1-2 years of the young part of my life (I’m 23). What if it’s not at all like what I’ve been enjoying, to actually work as a developer. What if I just hate the actual corporate job side of it. 

Right now I love the challenge of coding and visualizing how everything works. The building blocks you need to place to connect it all in your head. I love the thought process of this. I’m just scared that it’s not going to be all that in terms of work. And that I’ll be left thinking “oh well now I learnt all this and now I’m getting a good salary I can’t just leave this”.

I guess what I’m hoping for is that I keep thinking it’s a fun puzzle and that I keep enjoying it. What I’m scared of is becoming miserable and hating my job.

Help!,"I just taught my first high school intro course over the fall semester in Python, and for my first time I thought it went great!

The opportunity has arisen to teach a short middle school programming course over the summer. I have full control of # of weeks, how many days per week, and the curriculum. Kids can sign up on their own accord, meaning the students I have will be interested in the subject (in theory). I think it would be silly for me to pass this up, but I'm a bit intimidated by the idea of teaching middle school students code. I would like to keep it in Python, because it's the language I know best and I feel it's the easiest to learn as a first language.

What I'm looking for:

1) Any tips on how I should teach this stuff at the middle school level. I treated the format of my high school class like a college intro course, where I would alternate between lecture days &amp; lab days and have a few major projects throughout the semester. I'm not sure 50% of the time being lecture is great for middle school students who want to code.

2) This is a shot in the dark, but if anyone has curriculum they are willing to share, I would be more than thrilled to take a look.

learnprogramming,Serious question😩,"TL:DR: What do you do as a programmer when you are on hourly pay but nothing will solve your problem?!

I am both new to Reddit and programming (3 months), so if this is the wrong subreddit for this please let me know about other subreddits!

I work for a small e-commerce/ store and we have always been innovative and developing/becoming more efficient. So I told my boss that I want to learn programming, and that with some recourses from the company and a couple hours paid every week (+a lot of free time) I could learn to build simple JavaScript applications for things like customer service, stock keeping etc. 

1 month ago we decided it would be awesome to control the in-store music using an automatic app, simple enough I thought! For 1 week now I have been unable to connect to the Spotify API because localhost just gets denied. I have tried everything from disabling firewalls to changing ports but nothing works. After 7 long days and nights I don’t know what to tell my boss?!

learnprogramming,Stucked,"Hello everyone, I need advice, support, or any tips for the situation I’m in. I’m a third-year student of Information Technology (4-year program) and am also working full-time in healthcare. I’m not entirely satisfied with my progress at university; it feels like it’s going too slowly. So, I decided to do some additional learning through Udemy and came across the *Complete Web Development Bootcamp With Angela Yu*, which I really liked at first. However, as time goes on, it’s becoming harder and harder to understand. I feel like I’m ""stuck"" at a beginner level and that I’ll never progress beyond the basics of each programming language.

So far, I’ve worked with Python, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, along with their frameworks. I’m most interested in Fullstack Web Development, but in the bootcamp I’m currently taking, the topics are covered too quickly, and it feels like they don’t explain certain essential things in enough detail.

I can make a decent project, i know how to use node,ejs,git,etc, but somehow i rely a lot on google and chatgpt, and i dont want that, is it a common thing, i feel like an impostor.

Do you have any advice on what to focus on? Should i start everything over and dedicate more time to each section in course? My goal is to leave my current job as soon as possible and land a relevant position as a programmer.

learnprogramming,Using an IDE to learn C++,"When the question ""How to learn C++?"" shows up online, one of the top answers always seems to be something along the lines of ""get an IDE"" or ""download MS Visual Studio"".

VS was used in the college course that I followed when learning C++ and I'm relatively sure it slowed down my learning process by years. Specifying include search paths, libraries and their directories, compile options, etc. seemed all like black magic that you have to enter in the right menus.

The right way seems glaringly obvious now... To learn C++, use Linux (or WSL on Windows) and whatever combination of compiler and editor, e.g. gcc + nano.

At least during the first few weeks (or months) when learning about the basic syntax, header files, oop, templates and the STL, compile your code manually. Look at what the preprocessor produces, maybe even take a look at the created Assembly, run the linker manually. Once this gets too repetitive, switch to CMake to automate those building tasks.

Then later, If you apply for a job at a place that uses a specific IDE, take a week to get familiar with it.

learnprogramming,HELP! Help me understand E-R diagram of these entities,"Hello everyone, I've been trying for more than a week to create the E-R diagram for these relationships that I'll explain below, but I still don't have a clear understanding. I don't know if it's because of a lack of foundation, or if the situation might be ambiguous. The thing is, I’ve created my first task management application, and it’s working, but the issue of cardinalities in the E-R diagram is still unclear to me.

Let me explain: there are 3 tables: **USERS**, **TASK**, and **TASK\_USERS**.

* **USERS** has Id(PK), Name, Email, and password.
* **TASK** has Id(PK), Title, date, and createdBy(userId FK).
* **TASK\_USERS** relates the user Id and task Id, and has userId(FK) and taskId(FK).
* **USERS** can create 1 or many **TASK**.
* A **TASK** can only be created by 1 **USERS**.
* **USERS** can assign 1 or many **USERS** to a**TASK**.
* Many **USERS** can be assigned to many **TASK**.

This is the schema I created: [https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT](https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT), but I think it’s wrong because I believe the relationships between **USERS-TASK\_USERS** and **TASK-TASK\_USERS**, depending on how you look at it, should both be N:M, right?

But after seeing all the posts and people saying how hard it is to get a job, employers not replying back or sending rejecting letters, and applying to 100+ jobs, I’ve lost motivation to keep pursuing becoming an SWE.

learnprogramming,Figuring out full stack coding?,"So I’ve been researching about web development, let me just get this right, so there’s three parts 

- Desginer (Figma)
- Front end dev (html,CSS,JavaScript)
- back end dev (PHP, JavaScript)

Let me know if I got this right, the designer just makes a glorified Canva template, the figma file doesn’t actually do anything but become a blueprint (headache) for the front end dev which will guide him on where to put containers and such, the front end dev then creates the physical webpages, places the forms, buttons, containers, etc. however these can link to each other but the they don’t actually perform any function.

The back end developer has to take the website from the front end dev and pretty much connect the dots? Get data collected from forms, tell it where to place that data, establish security measures, pretty much make the website function from page to page.

That’s my understanding of everything so far but now I’m learning with code.ai you can just turn images and screenshots into figma designs using ai, and with visual copilot you can now covert figma designs into front end code in React? So if these actually work all that is needed is backend and decent knowledge of front end. Idk if I’m missing something and maybe the ai tools aren’t all that great yet but I still feel as if front end feels like a lot of work and bit excessive and I also feel as if most people could replace designers by making there own design on figma or just screenshooting a design they like and editing from there.

learnprogramming,Am I just not getting this?,"Hey guys!  


I have been learning C++ independently now for almost a month! Needless to say, I am working on a Rock, Paper, Scissors game right now and I was having an issue where I am using cin to gather a char for my  loops and functions, but I was testing it to see what kind of problems would arise if... say someone entered something greater than a single char. Problem happened obviously, and then I tried to fix the problem on my own, nothing I did would work. I then checked out a couple of stackoverflow questions and even posted one myself! (Which I'm not super happy about). The StackOverflow question I asked got me pushing in the right direction, introducing me to cin.ignore(). Plugged that into my code, still had the issue! Couldn't find the solution online anywhere... so I resorted to asking CoPilot (AI). Because of that I was able to figure out the missing parameter I needed in the cin.ignore() function. My question is... I feel like I cheated in a way because I had to ask around for help and even resorted to asking AI as well. My goal is to become a professional Software Engineer, and me having to google around and ask help from others including AI kind of gives me second thoughts as to if I can actually do something like this.

So I have a degree in information technology from a very small school (OSUIT). The teachers taught very outdated technologies and I was underwhelmed by the whole course.

I want a full refresh on everything because I am quite undertaught from this Oklahoma schooling (I also admit to not paying a lot of attention, I got good grades, but didn't absorb information).

learnprogramming,Replacing a spreadsheet with a web app?,"I have a book tracker spreadsheet, specifically a Google sheet with some Google App Script and unusual functions (for a book tracker spreadsheet)

I would like to learn some coding to replace it with something easier to edit on my phone/tablet ( adding data is easy , editing on android is clunky). I'm aware basic book trackers seem to be a very common coding project and normally I'd look for something pre existing and try to tweak it but none of the existing examples I can find seem to fit what I want to do at all so I figure now is a good time to learn some ""proper"" coding.

My thoughts are to make a web app so that I can acess it across Android, Windows and Linux as I use all 3 (I already know a bit of HTML/CSS/javascript). Have the data in some kind of database that I can host locally (have a small home NAS I should be able to put it on) so I can back up CSV data in case I want to move back to a spreadsheet, and to have something else like Python to do the query, calculations and generate graphs/pie charts (I belive matplotlib should do this)

But this is where I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with info and weighing up pros and cons, I'm not a professional by any means, I just play around with things for fun so I think my lack of correct terminology is hindering me in my searches ... but I am currently  looking at either: 

Python &amp; SQLite- this seems to be the simplest option for installing and as an added bonus Calibre library management software uses Python for plugins so I might be able to get some kind of integration

Or

Django &amp; postgresSQL - Django seems to get mentioned a lot when it comes to Python as making things easier for web/server things but I can't seem to find in what ways, I've seen a lot of people say that postgreSQL is their favorite too but I'm not sure any of the advantages will apply to me as a single user 

Or

Maybe I'm just barking to the wrong tree entirely and should consider a different  approach entirely from Python?

Regardless, it’s something I’d like to keep learning.

I started learning on my own because I got into programming out of necessity, having to deal with scripts written in LUA without any prior knowledge. I should mention that I’ve been using computers since I was a kid, although I never focused on studying anything related to them in depth. As a result, I’m quite comfortable with computers and started teaching myself through YouTube and the internet in general. I tried an online cybersecurity course (Cisco) and also video game development with Unity. In the end, I chose web development and took a couple of free courses, not very in-depth, offered by the employment service in my country, the last one being a full-stack course with Laravel and Angular. And here come my questions.

I don’t like frontend work very much, meaning creating designs and making everything look nice. I prefer backend, databases, and those kinds of things. Although I understand that it’s important to have basic knowledge of how to create a simple frontend. So my question is, after this time and having been completely disconnected, should I continue where I left off, with JS and PHP? Would you recommend any other language or framework for building web applications? Is there something I could focus on that doesn’t require frontend work?

\- Then he will be able to mention how many pizzas  
\- Then he will be able to apply slices amount and toppings (for example onions on 2 slices)  
\- Then he will be asked to ""pay"" (will just click continue cuz it is not real)  
\- Then the order will be move to ""in progress"" and there will be able to put ""On Delivery""

learnprogramming,I ask 'why' too often and always end up in rabbit holes making me feel inadequate,"I am a programming student for 4 years now and i still feel like i lack basic knowledge. I made an .NET API which uses signalR for realtime communication, Docker to containerize it, and MongoDb as database. I use onion architecture to connect everything together. I feel like those things are somewhat more advanced topics, but at the same time i feel like i dont understand the depth of it. I know the abstracts and why to use them, but i wouldn't be able to create it without the use of Google.   
  
An example was creating the db connection. Those are two lines of the code i used:  
`var settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(connectionString);`

`_client = new MongoClient(settings);`  
It gets a connection string from the methods params, and creates ClientSettings. Then is creates a new MongoClient with those settings. This is when i ask 'why?' as in 'why do i need to create a settings object?', 'why do i need a MongoClient?' et cetera. The answer to those questions dont really matter for further developing. Trying to understand those 'why's' I always end up in rabbit holes to the point i just accept that this is how it has to be done. But this makes me feel inadequate because i feel like im supposed to know 'why'. 

Im not looking for an actual answer to the example above. I'm interested how others handle situations where thing become a bit more complex when you question it.   
  
I kinda have this mentality: ""To drive a car you dont need to know how a car works internally you only need to know how to use it."". Do you think this is how you should approach coding as wel?

learnprogramming,Connecting to Public Databases,"I have very little coding knowledge, but I have a really interesting idea that I can’t seem to advance further.

I used chat gpt to create a basic user interface using html, css, and js. The interface is essentially a calculator, which uses a user input value and returns a list of calculated values based on other data.

Given my extremely novice knowledge on how all this shit works, I “hard coded” the other data needed for the calculations into the code. This data needs to be updated regularly for the calculations to be accurate, which is a very tedious process, but it is open source data found on the web. I understand there’s a way to automate this, but chat gpt and my online research hasn’t really helped.

Basically, I’m looking for a way to connect a public data source to my code so the most recent data will be used in the calculations. If I understand the process right, I think I need some kind of “crawling”? application to pull the data, a database to store it in, and a function within my html/css/js to call the data into the calculations.

Public DB -&gt; personal DB (backend static data) -&gt; interface (front end calculated data)

learnprogramming,Pulling weekly fuel costs in Europe,"Hello! 

I am working on my thesis project, and I need real-time ( or at the very least weekly , or maybe monthly if I get desperate ) data updates on the average fuel price ( diesel, gas ) in every country in the European Union and if possible the United Kingdom.

Does anyone know of such an API? Ideally if it is open-source and free, or has many free calls per month, or if it has an affordable pricing plan for a student.

learnprogramming,In the woods and I can't see the trees. Need some help with this CS Lab,"Hello. I've been stuck on this Lab program for my CS course for the past 2 days and I am so deep in the forest I can't see the trees around me anymore.

I was wondering if anyone could take a look and help me determine the issue in my logic for why I am returning the wrong node when I ""check an invalid tree with a right child linking to it's ancestor node.""

Missing code breakdown:

\- The ""Node.java"" file provides the Node class with access to the node value using getData, and the  left and right node values through getLeft and getRight methods.

\- The ""Main.java"" file breaks apart the input through a ""tuple-based"" representation of a binary search tree.

The input looks like this:

(50, (25, None, (60)), (75))

Here, the program would return 60, because that node violates a BST because the node 60 would be on the left side of the tree, and 60 is greater than the root node 50.

           50
       /          \
    25             75
       \
         60

      return checkBSTHelper(rootNode, null, null, new HashSet&lt;&gt;());
    }
    
    private static Node checkBSTHelper(Node node, Integer nodeMin, Integer nodeMax, Set&lt;Node&gt; ancestors) {
    // base case: if the node is null, the subtree is valid
      if (node == null) {

The criteria for this program:

\`\`\`Java  
A violating node X will meet one or more of the following conditions:

* X is in the left subtree of ancestor Y, but X's key is &gt; Y's key
* X is in the right subtree of ancestor Y, but X's key is &lt; Y's key
* X's left or right child references an ancestor

\`\`\`

All of my unit tests pass except # 9, where ""X's left or right child references an ancestor"" is not returning the correct node.

Here are my unit tests:

1: Input

    (10, (20), (30, (29), (31)))

Your output

    20

2: Input

    (20, (10), (30, (29), (31)))

Your output

    No violation

3: Input

    (80, (60, (40, (20, None, (50)), None), None), None)

Your output

    50

4: Valid tree with 10 nodes  
Test feedback

    BSTChecker.checkBSTValidity() correctly returned null

5: Invalid tree with right child's key less than parent's key  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

6: Invalid tree with left child's key greater than parent's key  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

7: Invalid tree with lesser key in right subtree  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

8: Invalid tree with right child linking to ancestor  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() returned a node that is not the BST rule-violating node. The node with either the left or right child pointing to an ancestor must be returned.

9: Invalid tree with left child linking to parent  
Test feedback

    checkBSTValidity() correctly returned the rule-violating node.

10: Invalid tree with left child linking to ancestor

learnprogramming,umm.. help this noob ! 🐢😊,"soooo i am a very very noob guy and i joined a college (fresher, but late because failed a lot) which is not at all related to computer science but I still want to continue programming and cs as it is my passion (not just saying out of blue cuz i liked tony stark) . I was very good at maths but somehow lost the track for past 4 years (failed a lot lol) , currently i want to regain my mathematical powers too. Also I forgot to mention I am in an engineering college so it's not like I am totally disconnected with maths academically . Nowwwww what I need ! , There are tons of Youtube tutorials on how one should proceed and roadmaps (afterall i have to learn from youtube right?) , the reason I am here (again , changed) is to ask what should be the best

1)source

2)roadmap

3)suggestion of language and projects

I umm do not believe there is something best which i would follow and get all einsteined!! but what i need is from y'all experts that a noob like me who can use is hibernating brain and wake it up again and get going into what he really wants. Some other questions which i want to be answered is after this AI effect and all this machine learning being a necessity what should i target from a financial point of view and some good job prospective. I stated above that cs is my passion but to say it in a more broader way about my passion I like Quants , business and shit and programming and AI are like a addon to them which i also like .  It's like years before when i was in the game i had targeted i would do sql , data science , quants and all but now after being brain rotted all these years I have no ffin clue so I am here. :)

PS: Was a fulltime reddit rot (thankfully deleted that) , one of the reasons for downfall , should've controlled . sheeshhhhh not going down the memory lane       past is past , i don't wanna look back and even if i do wanna look back it would be a moment where i think of it as a good time spent posting skibidi memes lol (still got the humor i guess , will continue but not the same way as it was)

Now I am yapping a lot sorry (There is no purpose of this post to get excessive upvotes or smtg , i just want your genuine help for a believer like me) , i think i have yapped much and framed my questions well .  Will check all yours suggestions after my sem exams are over (prolly 3 weeks at most) , old me wouldn't had did this but i don't wanna repeat the same mistake of wasting time at time of exams lol which if i utilized i would've been a mod here rather than being a mod for some brain rot meme page ( no hate , laughing is life) .

learnprogramming,How do I get started building a “tech portfolio” to show hiring companies once I feel ready? ,"
I am pretty new to all of this and starting from scratch. But quite lost when it comes to the “building my portfolio” realm. 

I am starting off with saving my homework and projects from classes I am taking for free right now. (cannot afford to pay for classes but edx.org is great for this atm.) currently just taking the mere basics: intro to CS, have done basic python, and scratch so far. Then will take intro to prog with python. I’ve done a project for HTML5 already so I’ll be adding that too. 

1) should I save the homework and projects I am doing with the classes I’m taking rn? 

2) how am I able to build a website for free? I see a lot of portfolios have their own domain… how can I do this? 

3) is a “portfolio” basically a domain where you attach all your work in there? If so, how can I make it where all my work is cohesive in there to show candidates once I do finish some classes? 

4) have any of you started from scratch, no degree in CS, but learned the skillset, got your portfolio right, and got entry level positions? 

5) would internships be applicable to me even if I am not enrolled in an institution but rather taking free classes that teaches you how to code? 

Currently using edx.org 

Professor David Malan from Harvard University is teaching these classes. Pre recorded ofc. just in case anyone needs then information. Completely free and pretty much feels like you’ve paid for the course itself. 

6) how would I go about adding these skills? In my resume? Would I be able to add the institution I took it with regardless if I paid for it but am currently enrolled  except it’s free? 

I am pretty lost in this and prob not asking the right questions but I hope I can find some clarity on here. Thank you.

COMP 171: Final Exam Study Guide

This study guide notes the topics that will be covered by the exam, and offers some breakdown of the topics into important sub-topics to keep in mind.

For all topics listed, you should be able to write code, understand/trace code, and answer open-ended questions relying on these topics (as you’ve seen on the quizzes).

Design

	•	Important components of software design:
	•	Input, Output, Examples
	•	Domain Knowledge, Algorithm
	•	Know how to write a complete design from a client request.
	•	Design as related to functions (see Testing/Designing Functions).

Creating and Using Variables

Primitive Data Types

	•	int, float, str, bool
	•	How to convert between data types.

Expressions

	•	Math operators: +, -, *, /, //, %
	•	Boolean Expressions:
	•	Getting True or False with ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=.
	•	Combining Booleans with and, or, not.
	•	Order of operations.

Control Structures

	•	if, elif, else statements, while loops.
	•	How these structures make use of Boolean Expressions.
	•	for loop:
	•	range function (1, 2, or 3 arguments).
	•	for loops vs. while loops:
	•	Why choose one over the other.
	•	How to convert between them.
	•	Nested control structures (e.g., if inside while, nested for loops, etc.).

Functions

	•	Calling functions, passing arguments, saving return values.
	•	Built-in functions: print, input, range.
	•	Defining your own functions:
	•	docstrings, parameters, returning values, side effects (see also: collections).
	•	Tracing functions:
	•	Tracing variables, arguments, parameters, return values, and side effects in programs with function calls.

Testing/Designing Functions

	•	Test Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before writing the code for the function.
	•	Tests and function stubs as designs:
	•	docstrings show input/output from functions.
	•	Tests show examples.
	•	Choosing good test cases, writing several different tests to check different behavior.

Strings as Collections

	•	Simple actions to use strings as collections:
	•	Creating, indexing, looping, concatenating.
	•	Using these simple actions to make more complex functions:
	•	find, count, slice, remove, etc.

Lists

	•	Common actions on lists:
	•	Creating, indexing, looping, appending.
	•	Searching for an item in a list (find function).
	•	Indexing to access/change items in lists.
	•	Using a for loop to:
	•	Access/change items in a list.
	•	Passing lists as parameters, and returning lists.
	•	Tracing how lists are stored differently in memory, and the results.
	•	Side effects:
	•	How/why passing lists is different than other data types.
	•	When/how side effects are possible with lists.

Here is the extracted content from the latest image:

2D Collections

	•	2D lists: Lists of lists, lists of strings.
	•	Accessing, creating, changing individual items in 2D lists.

Dictionaries

	•	Putting key-value pairs into dictionaries.
	•	Checking if a key is in a dictionary.
	•	Accessing values with a key from dictionaries.
	•	Iterating through all keys and values in a dictionary.
	•	Side effects on dictionaries.

Lists vs. Dictionaries

	•	When to use a dictionary over a list?
	•	When to use a list over a dictionary?

Reading Information from Files

	•	Opening and closing files.
	•	Getting data from text files using readlines().
	•	Cleaning up data:
	•	Changing strings into lists (split function).
	•	Removing \n.
	•	Turning strings into integers or floats.

Essentially, my question is... where is the line between data type vs. data structure... it seems to me like they kind of blur together.

For example, when you create a tree, which is a data structure, and then pass that into the function, the tree is effectively a data type, no? In this case, the tree is after all the type of value that you are passing in.

As another example, you could create a list forest by making a list of trees.... in this case, you effectively have a list of the data type tree, if I am understanding correctly.

learnprogramming,Resources for learning to program without relying on a language so much?,"Context: I’ve been learning for about a year now and I’ve used CS50, Automate the Boring Stuff, and FreeCodeCamp. Odin Project is next.

The most ubiquitous piece of advice I hear about learning programming is to focus on the fundamentals over learning languages and memorizing every last detail of them. That said, what are some good resources or best practices to learn about the fundamentals of coding without letting the minutiae of programming languages get in the way? I’ve mostly been learning Python, which isn’t too hard, but I do feel like I get caught up in things like syntax and other things that you can just look up too much to really internalize some key programming concepts. I’m not trying to get out of learning a language altogether, I obviously want to, but I feel like it would be much more valuable to find some ways to learn and practice fundamental programming concepts first.

learnprogramming,Learning programming with a targeted approach,"I have a couple projects in mind that I believe would teach me the programming skills I want to learn.

1) I want to learn the skills I would need to create a trading bot that uses relevant information from a source (like a website or discord) to place trades in a brokerage account, and give me text notifications when it takes action.

2) I also would like to learn the skills I would need to code a basic app with email waiting list for the phone or web, ideally to take advantage of any ideas I have and want to test. Most ideas are social apps that probably won't work, but I like the idea of being able to build something basic when needed.

learnprogramming,Small business using VB - Switch or let it die?,"Let me jump right in. For nearly 10 years now I've been working with my father designing/supporting niche business web apps written in VB. My father recently passed away, and now that the business is mine, I'm wondering if it's even worth continuing. I'm a little familiar with C# but I'm not looking forward to making the switch, nor do I have the funds to hire help (it's a very small business).  To be honest, I.T. is not my passion - I mainly took this job because, let's face it, the perks of working in a family business are unparalleled.

On the other hand, if I shut the business down, I feel like my qualifications for a new job in this industry are zilch at this point.  I call myself a ""kindergarten programmer"" because I'm sure they will be teaching what I do in kindergarten someday  - it's just VB, HTML and CSS. I'd have to either go back to school or change careers entirely. I'm 48.

What would you do if you were me? I know there are VB to C# converters but how much of a pain is it to do, really? Would anyone buy a business that is so small and uses such ancient technology?  Am I correct in thinking that my work experience is worth diddlysquat on the job market today?

learnprogramming,Doubted of my abilities,"Hello everyone!

Currently, I am a 9th grade student and a person of the beautiful country of Vietnam :)

I want to share a story with everyone, as well as hope to receive some advice or encouragement (am I asking too much lol)

My wish is to get into a top school in the city I live in, and of course with my passion for programming (IT), my wish is to pass this subject.

But recently, I feel like I am not doing well:

\- There are many problems that I cannot solve (thinking for a long time and have no solution). Even some of them when I know the answer are surprisingly simple!

\- I can do some problems, but the problem is that I cannot handle all the test cases, only a few of them. Some of the questions I know why I made mistakes and made mistakes, some I don't even know where I made mistakes (I even thought the test was wrong lol). This is also the most difficult thing for me because of course when taking the test I can only submit my questions once but most of the questions I don't get a full test.

\- That's the most frustrating thing for me, I feel like I'm not making any progress and just standing still, this makes me especially worried and almost lose confidence in myself.

Have any of you here gone through or are going through this stage? Have you ever felt a loss of confidence, doubted your abilities? Have you ever felt discouraged and wanted to give up?

learnprogramming,Question for non-QWERTY-like keyboard users (e.g. AZERTY / QWERTZ),"I'm developing a programming language specifically for people who will probably never do a lot of programming. I aim to have my target audience make as few changes as possible to their daily lives, and learn as few new things as possible, in order for them to get the benefit of programming that I want them to have. One factor of that is the symbols used in the language's syntax and their accessibility on various keyboard layouts.

After some research I found that about 15-20% of people who have daily personal access to a desktop or laptop computer do not have a standard QWERTY-like layout. On those non-standard layouts, the way to type certain symbols such as \~, \^ and \\ is quite hidden. Those I could quite easily not use in my syntax. But apparently the same holds for  \[, \], { and }, which I don't see nice alternatives for. I'm trying to find out if it's worth my time to find a solution, or to what degree I alienate 15-20% of my target audience if I don't.

So my question to those without a QWERTY-like layout. When you started learning programming in a language that uses \[, \], { and } quite often, how much of a hurdle was this to learn how to type, and after learning it, how much of an annoyance is it still to type them?

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I’m working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What’s the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?
* Any tips for optimizing this flow for scalability and maintaining clean code?",Aymsep,1h6f3ix,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,2024-12-04 12:43:36,0,0.5,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6f3ix

learnprogramming,Can anyone help me for optimization of this code? #newbie ,"I have a problem that has a function

learnprogramming,Have a BS in Computer Science but never learned how to build a website,"I studied computer science for 5 years at university, and not one person ever decided to teach me how to build a website. The closest I got to taking a web development class was **Introduction to Web Development**, where we just reviewed development workflows like Agile and sketched out pictures of what we wanted a website to look like.

Now that I'm a full-on graduate, I’d like to make my own website, but I don’t even know where to begin. In the past, I’ve tried following tutorials or using AI to help me out, but now I actually want to understand what I’m doing. Making a responsive website feels especially intimidating—I have zero clue what the standards are for webpage layouts.

Currently, I’m working on a website that visualizes data recorded from multiple remote water monitors. These monitors fall into three categories, each recording different metrics: water detection, temperature, and turbidity. The data is sent to a relational database service running PostgreSQL on AWS.

The purpose of the website is to help environmental scientists understand and interpret the data recorded by these water monitors. Users should be able to log in securely, though I’m not exactly sure how to manage separating devices between different organizations. Right now, the remote water monitoring devices use ChirpStack and LoRaWAN to communicate with my AWS database. I use the ChirpStack network server web interface to add new monitors, but I’m not sure how I’d incorporate adding or removing monitors into the website itself.

For now, I’m focusing on creating a website that visualizes the data uploaded to my database. Handling organizational separation is a problem for another day because it’s just too much to think about, and I doubt anyone has a clear answer off the bat. I’ve probably lost most of you by now, so here’s a rough outline of what I *think* I want for this project:

# Goals for the Website:

1. **Secure login**: Users should be able to log in securely.
2. **Homepage with a dashboard**: This dashboard should display the following charts:
   * A graph showing water temperature over time.
   * A graph showing water turbidity over time.
   * A table indicating whether water was detected (T/F).
3. **Chart controls**: Users should be able to toggle between displaying data for all monitors or selecting data from a specific monitor.
4. **Data export**: Users should be able to download data as a CSV or Excel file. They should also be able to select the range of data they want to export.
5. **Statistical summaries**: I’d like users to see some key statistics, such as the highest average temperature per day across a week, month, or year. There are probably more useful statistics to include, but this is the only one I’ve thought of so far. I’m not sure where these stats should appear on the website, but they should be somewhere.
6. **Responsive design**: The website should look good and function well on any screen size (mobile, tablet, or desktop).

This post is both a cry for help and a way to dump all the thoughts I have about this project. I wish I had more knowledge about how to make a user-friendly website, but I’m so lost. This project might take me years to complete unless I get help from someone who knows what they’re doing. I’d love any suggestions on where to learn this stuff. I’m sure there are tons of resources out there, but I just don’t know where to begin.

learnprogramming,Writing a text editor. what's best solution to syntax parser/lexer nowadays?,"First, some word definitions (correct me if i'm wrong)
- lexer: tokenizes text for syntax highlighting but does not analyze syntax structure.
- syntax parser / parser: parses code into a syntax tree (AST). basically, lexer + structure

So far, i've found 3+1 viable solutions:
- Tree sitter (parser)
- Scintilla (lexer)
- Clang
- Custom parser/lexer

So, my assumptions/observations is that:

    1. tree sitter generates an accurate AST (abstract syntax tree), 
        - is advertised to run asynchronously and parse ""incrementally""
        - Seems to takes more cpu/ram
    
    2. scintilla parses flat list of tokens, 
    e.g. recognizes if the token is type, variable, data, function declaration, etc. 
        - is NOT advertised to run asynchronously, but i see no reason why it couldn't do that. 
        - i don't know if it parses ""incrementally"". 
        - Seems to take less cpu/ram.

    3. Clang bascially is supposed to be more acurate tree sitter, it's litteraly the compiler.
        - Only c/c++
        - The api will probably be complex &amp; hard to use.

Another note: one feature I like from editor called ""Geany"" - it uses information prased by lexer to do syntax highlighting (obviously), as well as code navigation.

I don't understand why so many editors do tedious task of syntax highlighting a document, only for an lsp to do the SAME TASK again. it does parsing the same document TWICE. That's one of the reason why i'm writing a text editor btw.",dirty-sock-coder-64,1h68jqd,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h68jqd/writing_a_text_editor_whats_best_solution_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h68jqd/writing_a_text_editor_whats_best_solution_to/,2024-12-04 05:15:12,2,0.75,2,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h68jqd

learnprogramming,The gap between the learning environment and the real cases,"I'm really confused by the environment when learning programming. They are always command line, shell, console or whatever, with bulks of similar concepts come up like module, library, framework. And the only usage of it seems to be that you can see the output on the screen when run it.

However, what you actually use or see everyday is softwares in desktop or apps in smartphone that are much more vivid and touchable. There is **HUGE GAP** between the environment and the actual cases. And what's worse is that no one try to make it clear and the beginners have to keep the confusion unresolved by patience until they walk through the path nearly till the end, or they just give up which might the most cases.

As for me, I tried to learn programming at least 8 times in the past 20 years, ranging from BASIC, C, VB, VBA, ActionScript, Javascript, R, SQL, Python. All were abandoned(except for SQL as it has to be used in daily work) following the same route:  passionate, make a little progress, confused(no resolved), boring, give up, till the next passionate period come.

Sometimes I was thinking that if there were any method that could motivate the niwbie by bridging the gap when I was caught up in the confusion, I would have arrived the learning curve's final end safely in the first time.

I can still remember how disappointed and discouraged I was when I was taught to test my toy code in the Turbo-C blue screen when learning C language. At that time you had been already  surrounded by the fabulous and splendid websites and mulimedia, whereas you are still learning the basics in an ancient environment which makes the question always pops up: is this really the staff build the product?

Many years ago I've heard a solo developer of one popular music player said the player was written by VC6(seems to be a quite old programming language). I was wondering 'How could that be?'. I mean, how could the boring text statements print, def, if else, for while ... become the final apps/softwares we've seen and used?

I had the confusion then, and it seems still the same for beginners now, because no lessons fill this confusion gap. All of them just teach how to print, how to define a variable/list/function, how to loop, etc., in front of a black text-based screen.

How much time is left to see the real power of programming to build real things?

* Using third-party APIs e.g. OpenAI
* TTS and speech-to-text
* Send and receive MIDI messages in real time

learnprogramming,Which Programming Languages Do LLMs Understand Best? ,"
I’ve been wondering if there’s any research or data about which programming languages large language models (LLMs) have the most context and understanding of.

It seems logical that LLMs would perform better with certain languages, likely because those languages are more widely used or have a larger amount of online data available for training. For example, if we compare Dart and Flutter (a relatively young language and framework, still evolving with frequent major updates) to Java and the Spring Framework (a long-standing and stable language and framework with extensive documentation and enterprise adoption), I’d expect LLMs to perform better with the latter.

This makes sense: Java and Spring have been around for decades, are widely adopted, and likely have more documentation, examples, and discussions available online. This probably means LLMs were trained on more comprehensive datasets for these technologies.

But how much does this actually affect the quality of the code generated by LLMs? Does it impact how well they can assist programmers in building projects or learning certain languages/frameworks?

I’m particularly curious about how this plays out for developers who rely on AI for daily coding tasks. Does the maturity and stability of a language or framework make a noticeable difference in the ease of use, or does AI bridge that gap? If anyone has insights, research, or anecdotes, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

learnprogramming,What I wish I knew when so I could’ve escaped tutorial hell earlier.,"""Stop spending so much time watching tutorials and start building projects."" You've heard this advice a lot but you ask yourself, ""Am I ready?"" The answer is probably yes.


As a beginner, particularly in web dev, you should know: 
- Basics of HTML and CSS 
- Basic JS syntax - variables, arrays, loops, data types, objects, operators, conditionals, functions, etc.
 - Also try to get a firm understanding of async/await and promises. This will be crucial for working on web apps.


After this, begin learning about the web. Get an overview to understand how the frontend, backend and databases interact with each other.


Learn about Git/Github and why source control (aka saving your code) is important and learn a few commands such as changing directory, listing files and making a new directory.


From here, choose a frontend framework such as React and/or Next.js, a backend framework such as Express and SQL for either Postgres or MySQL.


Learn the basics of these, including how to build a page with basic interface on the frontend and make API calls, learn how to create an API endpoint/routes on the backend, how to connect to a database of your choice and how to query it.  


Now stop! 


Congratulations, you're now equipped to start building projects. Notice how I didn't tell you to spend hours upon hours watching YouTube tutorials. Or how I didn't tell you to learn all the advanced topics of each language and framework.


The main point is that you don’t need to know everything. You don't need to be an ""expert"". You can learn the rest along the way using Google, YouTube, Stack Overflow and AI. Building projects will speed up your learning x10. 


But now you're wondering what to even build?? My advice is to build something that might solve a problem for yourself or build a clone of an app you’re intrigued about.

learnprogramming,PRNG in X: Getting used to a new language's essential syntax.,"Hi there! I'm mostly a C and x86\_64 assembly dev who's been dabbling in Rust, but I had a random idea - write a very small project which I'm very familiar with, an LCG PRNG, once in a bunch of different languages.

A PRNG, if you don't know already, is a pseudo-random number generator, and is essentially a group of algorithms which define how computers generate ""random"" numbers. Note the quotes and the word *pseudo* because they aren't really random - they start with a seed value, which is often the time, then generate the next random number based on that, the next one based on that previous one, and so on. LCG, or linear congruential generator, is a very very simple algorithm for PRNGs (see the wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_congruential\_generator).

My concept is this: A very very simple program, a PRNG, implemented in various different languages (so far: x86\_64 NASM assembly, C, C++, Rust, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Python), which makes for a very easy way to learn the syntax. No heavy commenting besides one at the start of the file and at the start of each function, no huge explanation, no complicated concepts of the language. Just the essential syntax.

Hopefully this is useful to at least one person. **Please note** that I am not an expert at all these languages, and as I've said near the start, most of my knowledge is in C and Assembly, meaning that some of the implementations in other languages may not be perfect. If you see something wrong, feel free to leave a comment or open a pull request.

learnprogramming,is it possible to create DATA STRUCTURE CONCEPTS from scratch without prior knowledge?,"# conclusion

Edit2: I've worded many parts of this post in a bad way, so now this is basically my conclusion/decision to hopefully clear up my question.  
\--How should I go about creating my own implementations of ""data structures, methods, and algorithms""  
before learning them?--  
the main purpose of my post was to figure what I wanted. I thought I wanted to learn basic functions in C to try recreate data structures.  
I've now come to realize that I only want to create my own implementations of existing data structs, algorithms, and methods.  
I've decided to roughly to follow idea 2, and along with some suggestions/guides from others.

**Yapp** (this is just me yapping)  
honestly the rest of my post from here has become a mess and confusion to anyone trying to read and know what I'm asking. I'm considering restructuring the whole thing to clean it up but that will probably make it worse.  
I have my answer now and my post is \[**SOLVED**\] so I will just leave it alone.  
thanks to everyone for the help, and suggestions. my wishes have been fulfilled and my gratitude shall be.., for as long as I remember.  
\---

Edit1: After reading some of the replies I have a better idea of my question  
\-what fundamentals (in C or other lang) like **pointers, memory allocation, etc..**  
do I need to know to try create my own implementations of common **data structures.**

I will be learning them in my own time I would just like a rough list of which functions and concepts are used to make the data structures without learning the data structures themselves.

# original question:

I know what I want but I don't know the right question but basically..

I want to try and create data structures (in C),  
Without learning them or following a tutorial.

so no prior knowledge on how to make them but I know generally what they are (lists, arrays, dicts, ...) and the basic methods (append, insert, delete, etc..).

Sort of like re-inventing the wheel,, maybe?(idk).

If anyone (that's learnt data structures and such) thinks this is a fools errand and has an alternative suggestion they think is better please write. I'm open to suggestions and not absolutely set on this path.

# Disclaimer

I will be searching for materials and thinking of ways to do this. I'm just posting in here because it will be a lot easier for someone who already knows the structure and insights of data structures to tell me what is needed **before** I learn the data structures.

# Idea 1

My first idea of navigating this is to learn the things you need to know to make/write data structures..  
(pointers, the stack, and functions that work with those)  
*I don't know much of the things (functions, structures, etc) needed to write them,*  
*because learning about those would probably include learning a data structure which I want to try*  
*create myself without prior knowledge.*

*I will do some searching for those after this post.*  
\- then choose a data structure and see what it does on the surface, basic input and output  
and try to recreate the 'inner' code for the data struct and then the methods for that struct

# Idea 2

edit1()  
learn 1 or two of the basic data structures then look at a 3rd one and how it works but not how to implement it.  
and create my own implementation  
~~and what it does from a surface level perspective and try to recreate the inner workings~~ .

# --

\-some may think it's 'better' (more efficient) to just learn them and focus on how to utilise them. But this is just something I think will be fun..

If anyone would be so kind to humor me. I would be much obliged. ;)

**side notes**

programming is a hobby for me. I've briefly learned the basics of python3, and have done a handful of scripting projects(AHKv2). So I'm not really worried about trouble learning the fundamentals of C but more-so focused on knowing what I need to learn.

I am considering to do the same with sorting-algorithms and the like. if anyone has any comment on that but I think I'll save that for another time/post.",xtyzii,1h5jpot,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h5jpot/is_it_possible_to_create_data_structure_concepts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h5jpot/is_it_possible_to_create_data_structure_concepts/,2024-12-03 09:32:53,3,1.0,3,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h5jpot

I started to learn how to program 4 years ago when I joined my community college. But the problem is: I faked my way through college.

It feels like I understand programming but I just can't do anything by myself without any external help.

learnprogramming,Where are these weird numbers coming from? (simple C adding program),"Hi all

So I'm just beginning to dip my toes into C here, and after my obligatory Hello World program I decided to try something a little more ambitious using `scanf` and a simple function. Well, after a frustrating couple of hours of weeding the syntax errors out of an ostensibly stupid simple add-two-numbers program (that I came up with *without* referring to a tutorial) I got something that successfully compiled. I'm sure I did everything wrong anyway, but the results are particularly peculiar. Here's the program:

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int sum (int a, int b, int answer);
    int main ()
    {
        int a;
        int b;
        int answer;
        printf (""Enter two numbers dammit: "");
        scanf (""%d, %d"", &amp;a, &amp;b);
        printf (""The two numbers are: %d, %d"", a, b);
        printf (""The answer is: %d"", answer);
        printf (""\n"");
        return 0;
    }
    int sum (int a, int b, int answer)
    {
        answer = a + b;
        return answer;
    }

And here is what I get:

    Enter two numbers dammit: 3 5
    The two numbers are: 3, 708928112The answer is: 32766

Wtf?

I'm guessing it has to do with either a poorly written function or something having to do with `scanf` . Specifically something about the variables and the `&amp;a / &amp;b` variables vs `a / b` as I understand that the &amp; signifies that they're pointers to the actual variable values. I still don't understand a lot of that stuff, so please feel free to pick this piece of crud apart and tell me where I screwed up, I'd be most appreciative.

If breaking into the gaming industry is too challenging, which other language or sector in programming should I focus on?

I’m creating a simple menu with a button, but I keep running into the following errors:

1. **Non-nullable field 'myButton' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider adding the 'required' modifier or declaring the field as nullable.**
2. **Non-nullable field 'menuCanvas' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider adding the 'required' modifier or declaring the field as nullable.**
3. **Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'UnityAction' because it is not a delegate type.**

Here is the code I’m working with:

using MelonLoader;

using UnityEngine;

using UnityEngine.UI;

namespace Menu

{

public class Class1 : MelonMod

{

private GameObject menuCanvas;

private Button myButton;

private bool menuVisible = false;

public override void OnInitializeMelon()

{

MelonLogger.Msg(""Mod Initialized!"");



CreateMenu();

}

public override void OnUpdate()

{

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.F1)) 

{

menuVisible = !menuVisible;

menuCanvas.SetActive(menuVisible);

}

}

private void CreateMenu()

{



menuCanvas = new GameObject(""ModMenuCanvas"");

Canvas canvas = menuCanvas.AddComponent&lt;Canvas&gt;();

canvas.renderMode = RenderMode.WorldSpace;

RectTransform rectTransform = menuCanvas.GetComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();

rectTransform.sizeDelta = new Vector2(300, 200);

menuCanvas.transform.position = new Vector3(0, 2, 5);



GameObject buttonObject = new GameObject(""MyButton"");

buttonObject.transform.SetParent(menuCanvas.transform);

RectTransform buttonRect = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();

buttonRect.sizeDelta = new Vector2(100, 50);

buttonRect.localPosition = [Vector3.zero](http://Vector3.zero);

myButton = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;Button&gt;();

Text buttonText = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;Text&gt;();

buttonText.text = ""Click Me!"";

buttonText.font = Resources.GetBuiltinResource&lt;Font&gt;(""Arial.ttf"");

buttonText.color = [Color.black](http://Color.black);



myButton.onClick.AddListener(() =&gt; OnButtonClick());

}

private void OnButtonClick()

{

MelonLogger.Msg(""Button Clicked!"");

}

}

}

**The errors I am encountering:**

1. **Non-nullable field 'myButton' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor.** This seems to be related to the fact that I'm declaring `myButton` as non-nullable, but it's not getting assigned before the constructor ends. I thought that adding it in `CreateMenu()` would fix this, but it still throws the error.
2. **Non-nullable field 'menuCanvas' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor.** Similar issue with `menuCanvas`. It is declared non-nullable, but the assignment happens later in the `CreateMenu()` method.
3. **Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'UnityAction' because it is not a delegate type.** I am using a lambda expression to handle the button click (`myButton.onClick.AddListener(() =&gt; OnButtonClick());`). This causes an error, and I can't figure out how to fix it.

2)If my message is short, the QR code won't need a lot of space for the correction code, so what will be on the remaining space?

learnprogramming,Are these string formats in scanf function in C language same or different [EXCERSISE],"There is an excersise in the book ""C programming A modern approach"" second edition by K.N King in chapter 3.

For each of the following pairs of **scanf** format strings,indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent.If they're not,show how they can be distinguished.

a) ""**%d**""               versus          "" **%d**""

b)""**%d-%d-%d**""   versus     ""**%d -%d -%d**""

c)""**%f**""                 versus     ""**%f** ""

d)""**%f,%f**""           versus      ""**%f, %f**""

Ok,I am sure that first two are equal,because scanf will ignore spaces in format string.

I am sure that in c) they are not the same,because scanf will not terminate unless you input non spaces charachters when you leave white space at the end of string formating.

I think that in b) they are not the same.Yes the format string ignore spaces but if the input string is for example ""3 -2 -1"" scanf will read 3 in %d then it will try to match - charachter with white space and scanf will terminate where scanf(""%d -%d -%d"") will read it successfully.

I think d) format strings are the same ,because or charachters match and white space is ignored.

learnprogramming,From Tutorial Hell to Subscription Hell to AI Hell: My Journey of Learning Nothing,"They said: ""Leave YouTube tutorials and learn from well-structured paid courses."" So, I left tutorial hell and felt relieved—finally, some direction! However, I soon found myself in a new trap: subscription hell. These courses were indeed well-structured but offered no practical or real-life projects. Tic-Tac-Toe, calculators, hangman games—basic syntax and logic, but nothing that felt like genuine progress.

Frustrated, I sought out more serious and professional paid subscriptions, believing they would provide profound and comprehensive knowledge. Yet, I was met with courses spanning 80 hours of videos (seriously?) and still no meaningful success. Desperate for progress, I turned to platforms like DataCamp, only to find their content too shallow and overly simplistic. Real-life problems are vastly different from what these resources cover.

Seeing no progress and feeling increasingly unmotivated, I found myself drowning in an endless sea of YouTube tutorials, paid subscriptions, and shallow content. Then came ChatGPT. At first, it felt like a breakthrough—it solved my problems on demand. But even then, I found myself struggling to truly understand the code or grasp the deeper concepts. It felt like I was forgetting what programming was even supposed to be.

Now, I’m still determined to learn programming but plagued by confusion. Should I start with Java and then move to Python? Or begin with Python because it's supposedly easy and ubiquitous? And yet, Python's syntax feels clunky and unbearable to me. Why am I stuck in this endless cycle of `if`, `else`, and first-class syntax?

Am I missing something?

learnprogramming,I kinda need to learn programming ASAP....,"(Warning, a lot of yapping in the beginnng, but I promise I actually get on track about program-related topic in the end! Just takes some time since there is a LOT of side information that is pretty important to note!)

Hi! I don't know how else to formulate this, but the title kind of sums it up. I'm a 16 year old girl (turning 17) in 2nd year of videregående (Norwegian high school). A little bit irrelevant, but I switched schools to one in a bigger city and I am now living alone, trying to figure out the stress between finding a job, living with other people in a shared house and all the frustrating things that come with that (which there obviously is a lot of surprisingly from college students that live in the same house and the fact that we're 6 people), the stress with having a lot of tests at the same time, struggling with taking physics and the fact that I'm pretty much on my way to failing math. 😅 so there is a lot of baggage.

That's just a small ""backstory"", per se, not that it's way too relevant. Earlier this year I had chemistry, which wasn't for me at all. I couldn't understand anything, a lot because I couldn't really pay attention due to how boring it was and also problem with sleep due to noisy roommates and such, and just frequently waking up at night and never being quite comfortable. This was a new thing for me, always having slept pretty good at other people's houses for sleepovers and of course at home. This lead to me failing the first chemistry test in the end of October with a nice ""1"", which is the failing grade in Norway, 2 being barely passing. Not even a plus or anything, just a simple 1. To try to save my grade, I had to take a test in-person with the two teachers, face to face with what i could only explain as almost as an interrogation to force some information out of it. I tried my best, studied a lot although it wouldn't sit and it was still not enough, and I still failed.

Now here comes the programming part. School in Norway start in August, and we were now in the beginning or middle of November, which nearing the end of the semester, really. Chemistry was a chosen subject, but it was almost way too far in for me to switch. But I knew I kind of had to, so I asked if I could. Between the choices of geoscience and biology, neither of them really interested me, but those were kind of my options. Chosen subjects are sorted into these ""blocks"" in Norway, where you can choose subjects from each block, and you have 4 blocks to fill out. In the block I had Chemistry in, I saw there was also IT 1, or ""Informasjonsteknologi"". Simply, it's just a subject that learns you web design and coding. The school advisor was kind of like ""Straight out, I would tell people just no"", which wasn't a good sign at all. There was a lot almost straight up begging and convincing because of the fact ""at least let me fail in something I would find slightly interesting at least"". My boyfriend was also with me kind of trying to convince, due to the fact he is in the last year (grade 3), and has IT 2, and actually is a grade 6 (highest grade) student in the subject. I got sent to advisor for my grade level, and through there again to the teacher that has IT.

Miraculously I actually managed to get into the class. But now, close to the end of the semester I kind of have to learn coding pretty quickly. I can feel that I can understand coding if I learn it properly and that I have the skills to actually get good at it if I get far enough, but everyone is so far behind me and it's a lot trying to keep track of schoolwork and final tests of this semester that is the same time, learning the same coding my peers are learning while also not even truly even knowing the most standard of standard of coding. I've gotten this ""Arbeidskrav"" that everyone else got where we were going to make a simple website that honestly looked like straight from the 2000s or something, and I got quite frustrated because I felt like it was my boyfriend doing all the work for me instead of me because I had so much trouble with it and couldn't even make a simple website. I also had the same test that the other students had for for 4 classes at the same time as them, but I won't get a grade on it since I started not long ago, just to test my skills, and I could see people actually managing to make a website, while I couldn't even get anything to show on the website, even cheating a lot by asking my boyfriend for help and seeing I made such a stupid mistake of changing where ""Document"" was on one of the side things (&lt;&gt; those things) by accident and not even seeing it myself. The website turned absolute ass, of course (excuse my language), but this is all so frustrating.

I want to learn programming, and I don't want to leech of my boyfriend, at all. I want to learn it by myself and I just get angry at both myself and him when I have to ask for help all the time, although he is happy to help. It won't help in tests, and I'm ashamed I cheated on the last one even if it wasn't graded for me (although it was graded for everyone else). I just have difficulties on how to learn coding quickly? There was one problem, which was, how will I get a grade without no assignments? Well, that I got answered today. We are going to make websites for companies in the local community for free (real companies this is), and everyone is doing it individually, except for me and another guy that is also new. We will be collaborating with someone else that has been in the class since day one, or in other words, leeching off of the work of someone else. Although I'm grateful that my grade won't be ruined, I still want to contribute and not just leech of others, as I am expected to also work on the website of course. But how can I contribute not knowing anything? This is why I want to learn it quickly, so that I can truly actually be a helping hand instead of a burden for the team. This is a lot of text, and I'm sorry for that, but is there any help with starting?

learnprogramming,How much programming experience do I need to make game in Godot? Resource recommendations?,"I'm an experienced game designer/artist, but for whatever reason has never bothered to pick up programming. Now that I have some time, I am thinking of finally picking it up.  
  
I am thinking of using Godot, which to my understanding is even easier than Unity (but harder than gamemaker). I am also making smaller 2D indie games, so it should suffice. However, I don't know anything about code, not even visual scripting. Function, syntax, etc are all alien languages to me. So I guess **my question is - How much programming knowledge do I need, and if anyone would have some good recommendation/suggestion for me to start?**

Here are some resources I've gathered so far

1. [Python for Beginners](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8?si=twRUu5kiJXmU6w4L)
2. [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev)
3. [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrFk3tjsSY&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=NetNinja)

I am open to paying for the courses and thought [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) looks particularly interesting. But **I am not sure if it is worth the time diving into Python?** Or should I just follow Godot tutorials and muscle things through. Any advises would be appreciated!

I am thinking of starting small, with a snake or tetris project, follow by some Slay the Spire like card games which I think might be a reasonable scale. I also assume that it would be an easier gate way into learning programming, which is why I didn't choose Unity and C# which I read is much harder?

learnprogramming,How to approach learning programming from books,"How to approach learning programming from books?

Pick any classic programming book (say, a book from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)). Chances are the book has many pages and many exercises.

If you decide to read through the book and solve all the exercises, that's easily hundreds of hours of work.

Now lets say you lead a normal life with private and professional obligations, but you manage to block 16 h per week for reading and working through exercises of a book.

Lets be optimistic and say that it takes you just 200 h to read the book and do all the exercises. 200 / 16 = 12.5 weeks = 87.5 days \~ almost 3 months.

Is this the best time invested to learn the techniques in the book?

Suppose you're looking for a (new) programming job. Will you put solutions to those exercises in you portfolio? Would that be valuable to your potential employer?

Ideally, you would do all the exercises, than make a project using all the techniques from the book.

learnprogramming,🏎✏ Dotrace game in Js,"After 4 months of development, I'm delighted to present my DotRace game!

This strategic racing game is inspired by the classic game of racing with a pencil on a small sheet of paper (moving points with inertia)... yes, I drew trajectories for a good part of my childhood!

It can be played online at this address: [http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/](http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/)

Some technical information:

* Choice of game mode :
   * Time Attack: Beat the AI
   * Race: Single race
   * Championship: Several races in a row
* Choice of tracks :
   * Pre-integrated tracks (well-known F1 circuits, spirals, bizarre shapes, etc.)
   * Random track generator with choice (min, max) of total track length, width and length of road sections, angles...
* Player configuration :
   * Up to 4 human players (on the same screen)
   * Opponents with configurable AI level
   * 8 players in tracks
   * Button assistance options (best choice)
* Screen configuration :
   * Quick glance to see the entire track
   * Full screen mode
   * Camera follows player
   * Speed-dependent widening of the view (to “see further”)
* Sound configuration :
   * Choice of 3 sound themes:
      * Sound of marker pen on a sheet of paper
      * Sound of my car (A-Class 250, yes, I'm a 50-year-old)
      * The sound of a spaceship
   * Choice of sound volume for opponents
   * Speed of movement...
* Main path-finding algorithm
   * The main principle of my algorithm is that it doesn't know the arrival points, it just tries to go as far as possible in as few moves as possible. A nice recursive function calculates all possible paths and determines the best one.
   * The “AI level” (variable from 2 to 8 for each player) corresponds to the depth of this recursive search for the best path.
   * The position of opponents is not taken into account when calculating the path, which can lead to accidents and run-offs when the width of the track is reduced and several players covet the same point.
* About 4,000 lines of javascript typed with my old fingers...

My question concerns the possibility of simply running the same code in an android apk? for free?

I am also interested in your suggestions for improving my game.

Thank you.

learnprogramming, Beginner Project: The God Protocol – Looking for Feedback and Advice,"Hi everyone!

I’m new to programming (just about a month in) and have been experimenting with an idea I’m calling *The God Protocol*. This project started as a way for me to learn and explore data compression and encoding, but it’s turning into something I feel might be worth sharing for feedback.

The basic idea is to compress and encode data in a way that speeds up how AI systems, humans, and machines share and process information. While I’m new to all this, I’ve done some testing and wanted to share what I’ve observed so far:

# What I’ve Found So Far:

* **Faster Processing:**
   * Compared to traditional formats, the protocol handles large datasets much faster.
   * Example:
      * RDF/XML: 2.97 seconds for 78 KB.
      * Standard JSON: 0.52 seconds for 8 MB.
      * My approach: 0.31 seconds, and combining it with binary encoding brought it down to 0.003 seconds.
* **Works with Any File Format:**
   * The encoded data seems flexible—it works across binary, CSV, JSON, etc., while staying compact and fast.
* **Scales Well:**
   * Even as datasets grow, the framework holds up with low processing times and flexibility.
* **AI-Centric Design:**
   * The setup seems to help AI systems, allowing for smaller, faster models without extra processing overhead.

# Why I’m Sharing This:

I’m still very new to programming, so I’m sure there are things I’m missing. I wanted to ask this community for thoughts and advice because I’m not sure if this is practical or if there are blind spots I’m overlooking. Specifically:

1. Does this seem like a useful or valuable approach to improving how we handle data?
2. Are there areas I should research further to improve my understanding?
3. How might this compare to tools like Protobuf, MessagePack, or Avro?

# Note:

I’m not revealing the exact methods just yet since I want to refine my understanding first. But I’m happy to share more general details if that helps clarify anything!

Thanks in advance for your time and feedback.

learnprogramming,Can someone explain the output of this code for me? (C Language),"I'm studying Computer Programming. There is a code in a question in one of my exams. The solution say that the correct answer is ""The last letter of the output is ""I"""".

I got ""T"" as the last letter. I got confused so I tried run the code with AI and it also say that the last letter is ""I"" so I got even more confused.  The code is:

    int i = 2;
    char text[] = ""ALGORITHM"";
    while (i &lt; 8) {
        printf(""%c"", text[i]);
        i += 2;
    }

* When `i = 2`, `text[2]` is 'G'.
* When `i = 4`, `text[4]` is 'R'.
* When `i = 6`, `text[6]` is 'I'.
* When `i = 8`, the loop condition `i &lt; 8` fails, so the loop stops.

So, the output of this code will be:

    GRI

\[The output is from AI\]

So, from what my little brain understands, the text\[2\] which is the third letter in ""ALGORITHM"" is ""G"".  
text\[4\] which is the fifth letter is ""R"". Understandable.

But the text\[6\] which ""should be"" the seventh letter which is ""T"" but it appears to be ""I""

I've been stunned by this for a couple of hours now, someone please explain this to me please.

learnprogramming,Is programming a good field to go into if you don’t do well in a 9-5?,"Title. I’m currently working a typical 40hr per week job, but I don’t think I’m the type of person who can do that long term? I have lots of social issues and often feel ostracized, I’m trans but I don’t pass and not being referred to as my chosen gender is really really hard on me, I also just have a soup of mental illnesses that make it hard to deal with a ridged schedule, etc. I wouldn’t even need a job that pays all that much, I’m able to support myself and my cats with $15 per hour as long as I am stringent. 

So I’m trying to figure out a job I could do that has a more flexible schedule or where I can be my own boss, and that will feed me. 

I definitely think I could teach myself how to program too. I did well in an AP computer science class that used block coding(?), I was able to teach myself html in under a week like two years ago, and I’m generally interested in all sorts of computer related stuff like hardware, gaming/gamedev, 3d modeling, helping my family troubleshoot their computer issues.

learnprogramming,"Having trouble sticking to any one thing, advice? (ADHD may be relevant)","note: I wrote this somewhat out of order so excuse if I've repeated myself.

Background: I'm in my early twenties and this year got diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, recently I was able to get on medication, which has been a good help, and it's why I'm choosing now to try to tackle this.

I'm not a CS student, nor do I want to be. I'm not pursuing a career in CS or anything related to it. I just have a significant interest in programming, and see it as a hobby and creative outlet.

I got my first computer at 12 and I've been using Linux since I was about 13. So I'm pretty competent at using Bash, writing shell scripts for friends to solve little tasks, and writing ebuilds for my Gentoo install.

In high-school I took an intro to programming class, where I learned some basic Python and Java. The most complicated of things that I made were some terminal based games, and a couple of basic GUI games with some Java game engine.

But outside of the classroom environment, I've really struggled with adding some depth to my knowledge with self-learning. I've basically forgot all the Python and Java I learned after I finished the class, and the only thing I'm able to retain is a fair bit of Bash since I use it daily in the shell.

I've had a lot of fun in the past messing with different languages and started a handful of projects.

* Didn't love C
* Stuck with Haskell for awhile before I started to feel like I was wasting my time as a hobbyist
* Stuck with Scheme and Racket, for SICP and HtDP2, but again felt like I was wasting time
* Stuck with Go probably the longest out of anything since high-school, never really had a reason to stop, but I broke my streak of using it, and never started back up
* Thought C++ was cool
* More recently wrote some simple Rust, thought it was very productive, but kinda funky feeling? Starting to get a little embarrassed at how many attempts at learning and stopping I've made, and this isn't even all of them, so I'll cut it short here

I'd say at the moment, maybe it's just recency bias, but I'm most interested in C++ and Rust. There's something I particularly like about compiled languages, that I can't really explain, just makes my brain happy I guess. I have a preference for languages with a good book to read. And I have enough experience I feel, that I don't need to restart with a beginner to programming book like, one that might teach you to use Python to program a magic 8 ball or something.

I'm very much rambling at this point that I don't think I've stayed on topic, and instead just dumped a mishmash of details about myself here, so a tl;dr is in order...

***tl;dr:*** I have ADHD, recently got on medication. Despite taking a high-school programming class, I've forgotten everything except some Bash. I don't want a CS career or education, just a hobby that might be useful at times. Any advice on how to stay focused on a project/language long enough for the snowball to keep rolling? And where might be a good place to pick back up, as someone with a little experience?

Would ""Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++"" or ""The Rust Book"" be a good fit?

learnprogramming,How to become faster at coding and completing tasks at work? ,"Hey everyone,  

I’ve read a lot of posts about people feeling slow at work, but most focus on productivity or focus issues. That’s not my case—I work my full 8 hours non-stop, sometimes even skipping lunch to get more done. On some occasions, I even work overtime when I get at home (without my team knowing) just to speed things up.  

The problem is that my lead thinks I’m slow. He’s generally a chill and cool person, and he doesn’t put a lot of pressure on me, but he often seems disappointed with my progress. I frequently hear comments like, *“Oh, you’re still working on that? Don’t you think it’s taking too long?”*  

I’ve reflected on this, and I admit that compared to the other member on the team, I am slower. But here’s the frustrating part: I’m genuinely putting in the effort. I work nonstop, put in overtime, and still struggle to keep up. It’s not that I don’t know what I’m doing—I do. I make progress, sure sometimes i get stuck but most of the time I'm not stuck i am progressing but still slow

Honestly, this is starting to get to me. I’m not offended by the comments, but I’m frustrated with myself because I feel like I’m failing to meet expectations, no matter how hard I try.  

It’s worth mentioning that this is my first job. I’m five months in, and before this, I use to work as a freelancer for years. This is my first experience in a company setting.  

Have any of you faced similar challenges? Is there some things that we can do to become more fast at coding? I’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

I can access BAK Files just fine, but only a few of the files have that option, most just have the first two. RPYC is gibberish (it's what Ren'Py uses to run) and Windows Media Player just... can't.

learnprogramming,How to write Pseudocode in an efficient way?,"I have to learn pseudocode for some exams and I really feel like it's harder than simply writing programming-code. Since we can't use a specific language, I always end up writing everything way more verbosely, because it feels like pseudocode is meant to still be very exact and also easy to understand for non-programmers.

I like programming for the clear structure and rules. So I basically want the same for pseudocode.

I mainly program in Java und Kotlin, but also know some Python. Python seems quite well-suited for pseudocode. So I might want to basically write Python with some Kotlin, where Python is less expressive (e.g. fun instead of def for functions).

Do you have tipps and rules for efficient and readable pseudocode, that doesn't take an eternity to think about or write down?

**Examples with Python + Kotlin for Pseudocode**

Write a function that takes two numbers from the user and prints out the sum of those.

    fun add():
      set x = input
      set y = input
    
      print(x + y)

learnprogramming,How to Efficiently Convert a 250MB CSV File with 1 Million Rows to XLSX in AWS S3,"# Problem:

I'm working on a project where I need to **convert large CSV files (250MB, with 1 million+ rows)** to **XLSX format** and save them back to **AWS S3**. The CSV is stored in an S3 bucket, and I’m trying to do the conversion directly from S3 without downloading the file locally due to its large size.

However, I’m facing performance issues, as processing and converting these large files takes a lot of time. My current approach is based on **Node.js**, using libraries like `xlsx`, `fast-csv`, and **AWS SDK** for reading and writing to S3.

# What I’ve Tried:

1. **Streaming the CSV file**: I’ve tried using `fast-csv` to stream the file and process it in chunks. However, I still face memory and performance bottlenecks when writing the data to XLSX, especially with large files.
2. **Worker Threads**: I’ve attempted to parallelize processing by using **worker threads** to handle chunks of the CSV data. This doesn’t seem to improve the performance significantly.
3. **Buffering Issues**: I am encountering issues related to **buffers**, **memory consumption**, and **XLSX formatting**, as writing each row to the workbook one by one leads to significant delays, particularly with over a million rows.
4. // Example of my approach to processing CSV and converting to XLSX
5. const { S3Client, GetObjectCommand, PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
6. const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker\_threads');
7. const fastcsv = require('fast-csv');
8. const xlsx = require('xlsx');
9. const { PassThrough } = require('stream');
10. const s3 = new S3Client({ region: 'us-east-1' });
11. const bucketName = 'my-bucket';
12. const inputFileKey = 'path/to/my-csv.csv';
13. const outputFileKey = 'output\_data.xlsx';
14. function processCSVInChunks() {
15.   // Reading CSV from S3, then converting and writing to XLSX
16. }
17. function processBatch(rows) {

Joe has organized a party for M guests and has planned a party game. In the game, Joe gives everyone a string S and explains to them the rules to play the game. The rules to play the game are as follows The string S needs to be distributed among the M guests, and each guest must get at least one character. The smallest lexicographical distribution of the string S among the M guests must be stored. Out of all the stored smallest lexicographical distributions, the largest lexicographical string must be found for distributing ""good"" and the number of guests are 3. Here are all possible ways in which you can distribute the string among 3 guests: ((o, o, dg), (oo, d, g), (o, do, g), (o, d, go), (o, d, og), (o, gd, o), (o, od, g)\] Now, the lexicographically smallest strings among all these distributions are   
(o, o, dg)-dg  
(oo, d, g)-d  
(o, d, go)-d   
(o, d, og)-d   
(o, gd, o)-gd   
(o, od, g)-g   
After comparing all the lexicographically smallest strings of every distribution, ""gd"" is the lexicographically strongest string. Hence, gd is returned as the output.

It seems like a good alternative, but I’m also not entirely sure what programming jobs I can get with it. IT looks temping but I know i wouldn’t be doing a lot of actual programming. 

Should I just bite the bullet and major in CS and hope the math classes don’t turn me off, or is CIT still a viable option for someone looking for a programming centric job?

learnprogramming,Coding  a native application to find lyrics in music files,"Hi everyone!

Yes, I read the FAQ, yes I've researched the topic for a while and still haven't reached a conclusive answer. Maybe my search terms are wrong, maybe I am not good at this. Anyhow...

I'm starting a personal project to build a native application (for Linux, ideally) that can determine if a song has lyrics. I find music helpful to focus, but lyrics can be distracting.

Currently my solution is just listening to bits and pieces of the songs and sorting them efficiently, but manually using a bash script.

I'm hoping to create a program that can analyze audio files and identify whether or not they contain significant amounts of vocal content (lyrics). Ideally, the program would analyse the whole library and write a commentary in the metadata of each track.

However, I'm stuck on the technical side. I'm not sure what technologies would be best suited for this task. Does anyone have experience with developing programs that analyze audio for vocal content? Are there established libraries or frameworks I should be looking into? Is this even feasible?  
I'm particularly interested in:

Possible technologies: e.g., libraries for audio analysis

Existing solutions: if any already exist and I just haven't stumbled upon them. Proprietary and even expensive programs might be worth it, but it has to be processed locally.

learnprogramming,Seeking advice on handling images and optimize costs in my ASP.NET App,"I apologize for asking you guys to ""solve"" my problem.  
I'll try to provide some context first.

I recently created a rudimentary application with 2 components:

1. A frontend application that has 2 pages and that fetches car entities from firebase. - 1 overview page that displays said cars through pagination. - 1 page to display one particular car entity and all its details.
2. A .NET desktop application to upload car data + images to firebase.

A problem is that the load time for the images is extremely big, the overview page takes 7-8+ seconds to load.  
Each entity has \~10 images and the overview page initially loads 6 entities, so that's 60 images. Small edit -&gt; I did use compression for the images fetched on the overview, it did not improve load times in a noticeable way.

I'm using a free tier version of hosting for the frontend application and as well for firestore and firebase storage so I can't complain about speed but few other concerns did pop in my head aaaand long story short and after a bit of research I'm now currently trying to steer towards a full stack .net application instead that I will probably host on Azure.

Now, below are my plans, concerns and questions where I do need some feedback. :&lt;

One of the most concerning things is optimizing the bandwidth for all the data transfers regarding images, I would like to carefully approach this.  
Some safety guards against malicious users spamming requests are also welcomed, I'm not sure if this will even be a real problem.  
Ultimately, decent loading times are also important.

I'll try to somehow arrange my plans based on the topic.

A. Due to the simplicity of the application my current plan revolves around creating a [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC Web App and using a Linux container to host it in Azure as an app service.

B. The total amount of data that I will have is really small, around 50-100 car entities at max.  
For storing the images I'll most probably go with azure blob storage but for storing the car entity details I'm not sure. I would only need two tables. One holding the car details and the other having all the references to the images blob storage images, both with few records.  
Is using the storage provided by App Service a viable alternative?

C. My application doesn't target users from different regions/countries. However, I've read Azure CDN can optimize bandwidth usage and load times.  
Is a CDN necessary for this application?

D. How can I protect myself against malicious users?  
Sorry if this is a extremely stupid question but are there any built-in safeguards for someone spamming million requests to fetch images from the blob storage?  
How to handle this kind of issue?

E. I assume caching is essential for this, it will help optimizing data transfer and costs.  
Any tips for implementing caching effectively for this?

F. COSTS... after all, is going full Azure a good idea for this?  
While I don't want to cut corners unnecessarily I would prefer to approach this in a smart way.  
Unfortunately, my lack of experience is showing.

How would you approach this? Are the technologies/cloud provider I chose suitable for my context?

I will HIGHLY appreciate any kind of input about this.

learnprogramming,My Programming Learning Journey: Struggling with Syntax and Cognitive Load After Two Years of Consistent Effort,"I've been seriously learning programming for over two years now, with a particularly intense period of daily coding and study since summer 2023. My ""uptime"" has been close to about 98% — I'm committed, but something fundamental feels broken in how I learn

Every time I start something new, it feels like pure torture. Whether it's a new stack or technology, the process drains the life out of me. Learning seems like a constant battle where every single step is either a snag or a stumbling block

My Learning Process:

\- I break down tutorial videos into tiny 7-minute segments

\- Take extremely detailed notes (down to the dot)

\- Rewatch these segments multiple times

\- Spend literally 30 minutes of real life analyzing just one minute of video

\- Despite all this effort, I retain maybe 1/20 of the information



The most frustrating part? Others seem to breeze through content by binge-watching, while I'm meticulously dissecting every moment and still feeling lost



Current Focus: Frontend development, currently wrestling with advanced Redux (RTK)



Biggest Challenge: Syntax retention. I understand logic most of the time, but remembering syntax feels impossible. Even after breaking concepts down into minute, simple parts, the connections remain fuzzy.



I've tried everything:

\- Detailed note-taking

\- Repeated viewing

\- Breaking down concepts

\- Intensive study sessions



But documentation feels like a foreign language. YouTube tutorials often show workarounds different from docs, making everything more confusing. I can spend 14 days, 5 hours daily on a 50-minute video and still only grasp a vague understanding.



Emotional Toll:

It feels like I'm constantly hitting my head against a wall. Each new technology seems like an entirely different world, and the learning curve appears almost vertical.



I'm not looking for sympathy, but insight. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you break through this seemingly impenetrable wall of learning?

learnprogramming,system() returning different value with gcc,"I'm writing an interepreter, and I have an end-to-end test program in C++ which calls the interpreter executable. To get things off the ground, I'm just calling it with `system()`. Something like this.

    const int ReturnValue = system(Command.c_str());
    assert(ExpectedReturnValue == ReturnValue);

On Windows, this seems to be working fine. But my CI runs in Gitlab on some sort of Linux image with gcc. Over there, it works fine when my interpreter returns 0, but when it returns 1, the `system()` command returns 256. I know the interpret is running fine, because I see it printing out the correct value before it exits:

    std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""Returning "" &lt;&lt; Retval &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return Retval;

My understanding of [the man page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html) is that the return value of system should be the return value of the last command it executes...

learnprogramming,Correcting aspect ratio in a shader (HLSL)?,"Hi. I wanted to write a shader to correct aspect ratio in a game i'm playing, and i'm running into some problems. Now, i'm not really familiar with graphics programming and shaders at all beyond some very handwavy idea of how they work, but i thought the task was trivial enough to trial and error my way through it. Apparently not!

So, the code for the shader looks like this:

    sampler s0;
    // Variables that set the width and height of the current game resolution from sfall
    float w;
    float h;
    float2 rcpres; // pixel size
    
    static const float2 gameRes = float2(640.0, 480.0);
    static const float2 windowRes = float2(1920.0, 1080.0);
    static const float2 scaledRes = float2(gameRes.x * windowRes.y/gameRes.y, windowRes.y);
    static const float2 border = ( (windowRes - scaledRes)/windowRes ) / 2.0;
    static const float2 ratio = windowRes/scaledRes;
    
    float4 test(float2 uv : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0
    {
      float2 uv1 = uv * ratio;
      float4 col = tex2D(s0, uv1);
      return col;
    }
    
    technique TestShader
    {
      Pass P0 { PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 test(); }
    }

And the result i'm getting is [this.](https://i.ibb.co/857cd1y/2024-11-30-134838.png) It looks like i'm losing quite a lot of horizontal resolution, with some of the text letters pretty much merging together. And i'm not sure why, i mean, the resolution i'm scaling to is still over 2x the internal resolution. 

I thought that a pixel shader is executed for every pixel of a rendered surface, which, in this case, would be the entire window. I take in coordinates of the pixel, i do some transformations on them, and then i use those coordinates to sample from the base image that the game is outputting. But then i don't see how would i end up skipping over so many of the pixels in the base image.

Can someone explain this to me, or point me to some relatively simple overview for dummies? Cause i definitely don't feel like taking an entire course just for this.

The only thing I've found would be something like this, but I think I did it **without an exception** back then:

	•	Capture voicemails using Twilio.
	•	Convert voicemails into text for further analysis.
	•	Prioritize voicemails based on urgency, emotional tone (from audio and text), and content.
	•	Summarize the text and distribute the voicemails to relevant departments.
	•	Encrypt sensitive data and mask any PII in both the text and audio.

I also plan to use a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for displaying the results.

	1.	What libraries or models should I use for emotion detection and urgency ranking?

learnprogramming,Making a stopwatch - x16,"So im working on a board and trying to make a reaction speed test. 

Board im working with has a RTC (Real time clock) From that i can use seconds,hours,minutes.

On the other hand, the board has a free running clock-16-bit 1Mhz. 

My approach currently is that im counting clock cycles. That is done by comparing the value of the current clock (free) and the value of the clock when first called. 
If it is equal then a cycle has completed, CountCycle++ . If it is less than then an overflow occured and clock wrapped back to 0 so CountCycle++.

then i convert CountCycle to  ms by dividing the number of clock cycles by 45 (Rough math was fried at this point). 

Was debugging the code and the answers (in ms) were not realistic at all. Is the math wrong? Or is my way of counting cycles wrong? Personally i feel it is the latter and i am skipping clock cycles while checking if the button is pressed. If so what suggestions do you have.

I'm making a module that allows a bigger project to retrieve information from a source. So there's a common function called by the bigger project that returns a String used by that project. 

  
The thing is that there is ONE case, in which the function should return a list of strings instead of just a string. The project expects that list in that case. It expects a string in any other. Before they were data introduced manually and now I want to automate it.

  
I know I can return different types from the function, and I can make it so the function returns the list only in the case I need. 

  
My question is more like, is that good practice if I note it down? I feel like I'm overthinking it but something tells me it was better to ask.

learnprogramming,Need Help Choosing a Framework for Modern-Looking Windows Desktop Apps,"Hi everyone!

I need help choosing the right framework for my needs. I’m a new solo developer (previously a hobbyist but recently started doing this full-time). Some of my clients need desktop apps for Windows. My clients are non-technical, but they occasionally want to tweak the code, so having a Python backend is ideal.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* Apps that look native and modern.
* A simple way to turn Figma designs into functional UI components (I use Figma for design).



So far, I’ve explored:

1. **PyQT and Qt Designer**: Couldn’t find a good integration with Figma.
2. **Qt Design Studio**: Has a Figma Bridge and recently began supporting Python for the backend, which feels like a dream come true, but it’s locked behind a pricey enterprise license ($2k+/year).
3. **Tkinter**: While there are some libraries and GitHub repos for Figma integration, the generated UI doesn’t look good.
4. **Reflex (formerly Pynecone)**: Couldn’t get the Figma integration to work.

After that, I started considering non-Python options but got overwhelmed:

* **WPF and WinUI**: I’m unfamiliar with XAML, and it doesn’t seem to integrate well with Figma (I might be wrong, but I couldn’t get it to work). I found some repos that support a Python backend, but I didn’t dive deeper.
* **Electron/Tauri**: I have no experience with web-based technologies, but if this is the state-of-the-art for Windows apps, I’m willing to learn.

Since I have some game dev experience, I even tested **Unity** for creating UIs and Windows desktop apps. Unity has some great Figma bridges, and it sort of worked, but using it for desktop apps feels overkill.

At this point, I’m completely lost. I’d prefer a solution with a Python backend, but I’m open to other options if needed. What frameworks would you recommend for creating Windows desktop apps?",External_Leek_2720,1h2qg0u,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2qg0u/need_help_choosing_a_framework_for_modernlooking/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2qg0u/need_help_choosing_a_framework_for_modernlooking/,2024-11-29 17:07:59,2,0.76,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h2qg0u

I read that ORMs like prisma or drizzle can go through the DB (inspection) and create sort of interfaces of tables. Is it reliable? Can they update them when there is a change in DB. Since it is just me working on this project, manually running the inspecton after new migrations won't be a problem.

Each node in the tree is supposed to be the sum of its 2 children. If there is a node that has a value which is NOT the sum of its children, you have to return the index of that node and the proper value that it should be.

Seems straightforward. But I noticed one strange line in the description:

  
""**If the incorrect value occurs on the leaf level, then the** ***right*** **child will always be the incorrect one.**""

This is the part I'm confused about. It says that the incorrect value can occur on the leaf level. But how? A node's value should be the sum of its children. Since the leaf has no children, the leaf should not even be counted right? Its value does not mean anything.

The homework is graded by a tutor in the 5th semester. I recently noticed that he doesn’t seem to be the best, but I thought maybe it’s just me. Well.

Today I received feedback for the latest homework, and he pretty much wrote that my programming style is shitty. Maybe I‘m too sensitive but, that made me cry because I really put a lot of effort into it and I felt like I was doing really well. I dont even know what a programming style is? Or what defines it?

Also i feel like he just removed points unnecessarily for things that arent even true. Example program not working when its working on every pc/laptop for me.

Altogether I feel really really discouraged, and awful, like maybe I should just give up programming. I really like it and its fun to me and I want to do it but I feel like I‘m not wanted because my code and style is so so bad. Before joining uni I‘ve never had any experience with programming/coding at all. Like yes, my code might be messy, i don’t know, but its working and its my own solution so.. i honestly dunno how to go on from here. I feel absolutely useless and awful.

Looking at the code of my colleagues, they seem to have different solutions. Yes mine is longer, but isnt that the fun about programming, that theres different solutions? I know the complexity goes up, but if I cant come up with another solution, what exactly is so wrong about it? Right now I feel like there’s only ONE solution and thats the best, optional solution and that makes me want to not even start the next assignment.",r1ppedGuts,1h2gql6,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2gql6/told_by_tutor_that_my_style_is_awful/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2gql6/told_by_tutor_that_my_style_is_awful/,2024-11-29 07:47:43,36,0.68,36,0,93,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h2gql6
learnprogramming,I feel I know a lot and nothing at the same time. ,"I was interesting in programming for years but never started learning seriously before until from a month ago.
I had this book about programming in C, I learned form it then downloaded this app called SoloLearn because some of the book content was outdated.

the problem is I learned introduction to C and C intermediate then I solved some easier 'problems' then I started feeling confused about how to progress from here. 

so then I just jumped into C++ and finished introduction to C++ and intermediate C++.

and I'm in the same stat of confusion. 
I feel I learned a lot of many different concepts and functions... but how to use them to make an actual program... I'm totally clueless. 
I'm unclear on how to use what I learned and making it something that I can really use instead of just knowledge. I'm also clueless how to progress from here. I don't mind learning another language but I feel it will lead to same problem and i might be more counter productive as I will just  learn another language syntax without fully grasp what I know.
so.... is there any solution to my problem?!",SirArcher0,1h2frm2,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2frm2/i_feel_i_know_a_lot_and_nothing_at_the_same_time/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2frm2/i_feel_i_know_a_lot_and_nothing_at_the_same_time/,2024-11-29 06:39:51,22,0.87,22,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Tutorial,,t3_1h2frm2

learnprogramming,Creating a functional elevator program C++,"Hi, I am a first year college student taking an engineering course where I am expected to program an elevator. I have written code for an elevator that memorizes button presses and moves the lift to the corresponding floors. You are able to press a button any time, and no matter what you will get to the floor (if the lift is moving or not). However, I need to implement up/down buttons for each floor, and have the lift memorize the order it needs to follow. For example, if the lift is on floor 2, and an up button is pressed on the ground floor (0), but a down button is pressed on floor 1, the lift should go to floor 1, then ground. Another example: If the lift is on floor 4, a down button is pressed on floor 6, but an up button is pressed on floor 2, if the lift has already been on its way up, the lift should go to floor 6, then 2. I have tried everything I can think of to implement these properties over the past several weeks, but have had no luck. The following is my simple code. If someone could help me out it would be much appreciated (oh, the lift at the moment is a servo, but will be changed to a stepper motor soon):

I haven't coded before but i don't mind learning a slightly harder language and I have already done I fair bit of python a few years ago and I was quite good at it. But I am not sure if Python is too simple/ not advanced enough compared to the others so it may seem less impressive to an employer, etc?

Please let me know what you think I should learn in regards to being fairly new to coding and wanting to do engineering.

I did 1 lesson C+ and I am liking it currently but I want to make sure I am making the right choice doing this specific language.

learnprogramming,"Hello, I dont really know what to say here, I explained it well down below. thanks :)","Hello, Im currently studying for a cs degree, and have completed my first year. so far I learnt basic data structures and algorithms, and I am somewhat excited to keep learning how to solve problems and code, so that one day those things come in handy for my job or, I can actually get a job based on my knowledge. aside from studying, I think that real knowledge will come from learning myself how to do things. So, recently, some videos about a korean guy solving kickstart google popped, and it motivated me to learn how to code and how to solve problems because I heard that it is really useful but on the other side I also heard that something like leetcode is useless if I want to become a software engineer. So right now im doubting wheather I should start doing leetcode for example in summer vacations, to reinforce my knowledge on data structures, and algorithms. I want to do something that can help me grow (im barely starting) and that can help me someday get a good job.

learnprogramming,The right tools for building automated document extraction,"Hi,

hope this is the right subreddit, since this is not a concrete coding/programming problem but more a general question about the right (AI-)tools to use. If there is a place that is more suited for this kind of question, please let me know :)

I am currently trying to automate orders by extracting relevant data out of pdf files so that they can be used for other software systems. When searching through the web there seem to be a lot of AI startups and other companies that provide some kind of solution to this stuff, so I am wondering how well the general state of the art is here.

Currently i am playing around with python pdf readers and Chat GPT with object responses and the results are quite impressing for the first few tries, however I'm not sure if going with an LLM is the best choice in this case. There are other AI-based tools that promise to extract key value pairs for example. I can imagine that it is also possible to train your own Machine Learning models for such a task.

What i basicially want to know is, if there are any best practices i might oversee. When searching through the web there are quite a lot of enterprises offering something like AI order/document automation. I wonder if they all use LLMs as well or if there are better / more accurate tools for this kind of job. I'm just wondering if anyone here knows which tools are able to get reliable results (no matter if SaaS like AWS Textract or Azure Document Intelligence or more coding based stuff).

The OpenAI route seems promising since it does not require any finetuning so far and the keys can differ from document to document so the LLM often is smart enough to map those keys into a standarized data structure. Also i imagine that an LLM can easily deal with multiple languages.

Do you think I'm on the right track or are there other major things i should have a look into?

learnprogramming,Dealing with large data through message broker for a search engine,"Hi guys so I've built a search engine where user's can setup a list of entry point urls to crawl and save in an sqlite database, the communication between the express server, database, search engine and web crawler is all through rabbitmq, the way I handled transporting the whole database to the search engine for processing and ranking is through data segmentation, basically creating segments with header which contains the total number of segments to be expected and the sequence number for requeuing then the payload which is the segmented data from the database, so my problem here is as the database grows the number of segments increases and as more segments increases then more data to be queued to the message broker, but the message broker is so slow, currently the total size of the database sits at approximately 26MB and the maximum segment size or MSS is at 100008 bytes including the header which is 8 bytes

**The search engine filters out web pages with 0 ratings which is not relevant to the user's query**

as you can see it takes at least 700ms for listening to incoming segments from the database, dont mind the ranking I'll try to figure that out myself, so since listening to incoming segments does not seem to be a good idea for scaling, Im thinking about just removing the message broker between the database and search engine and let the engine instead have direct access to the database, but I'm curious does anyone have a good idea using on how to handle large data like this? I couldnt't think of anything else

##### What I did

* changed storing segment data from using byte slice to bytes.Buffer because its more efficient
* increased the segment size, I can still increase it up to the default message size defined in rabbitmq, and it does reduce the time but I feel like there should be another way since this only reduces the time as a temporary fix and would still need to increase message size in rabbitmq as the database grows.

Here's is the Segment listener code:

    	var (
    		segmentCounter      uint32 = 0

I’m currently working on my Bachelor’s thesis and I want to calculate the match between Spotify profiles to study its influence on relationship satisfaction. The idea is to have two people authenticate via the Spotify API, and then I analyze their listening data (Top Songs, Artists, Genres, etc.) to create a ""match score.""

My questions are:

1. **Metrics**: What metrics are best for calculating similarity between two users? I’ve been thinking about using Jaccard Index (for genres or artists) and Cosine Similarity (for audio features). Has anyone worked on a similar project?
2. **Automation**: Is there a way to replicate the Spotify Blend logic or use similar functions via the API? I would like to automate this match calculation.
3. **Playlist Creation**: How can I automatically create a playlist with the best matching songs from both users? I’m currently using Python and the Spotipy library.
4. **Scaling**: My goal is to provide this feature to multiple participants in an online experiment. Are there any best practices for integrating Spotify data into web apps (e.g., with Flask or Django)?

I’d appreciate any tips or resources that could help me implement this. Also, if anyone knows how I could contact Spotify directly to learn more about their algorithms (e.g., behind the Blend feature), that would be really helpful.

Hey everyone!

I’m a bootcamp grad with a non-CS undergrad degree (in fashion design) and want to pursue an MS in Computer Science. I’ve looked into UIC and Northeastern’s Align program but would love recommendations for schools that are flexible for non-traditional students (online or evening options would be great).

Also, do bootcamp grads usually need to take bridge courses, or can that be skipped sometimes?

I’m in Illinois, so any advice on programs here or financial aid tips (FAFSA, etc.) would be awesome!

learnprogramming,How should I continue my journey?,"Hello :)

A little bit of background: I was always interested in computers, but I never really got into coding except for doing a project with an Arduino in school many years ago. I recently started the CS50 Course for Python and it's been fun. I don't really have any precise goals of what to do later, but as a media designer (both video and audio projects) I think it would be helpful to have some knowledge in programming.

Now to my question: As I don't really know where to go, Im a little lost. I will definitely finish this course and it feels like a stepping stone for me, as it really interests me. But I don't know where to go then and also which questions I should ask myself (future goals, etc.).

I also thought of buying a raspberry pi and do some smaller projects with that, because I could continue to learn python and feel more comfortable with a Linux environment.. But right now this seems so far away compared to the things I learn in the cs50 course..

  
I hope to get some thoughts from you to help me feel a little less lost. Im excited to here from you!

","\[EDIT\] I'm concerned about generating my own API keys for authenticating users in my own project, not using an API if another service.

Hello there! Recently I've started reading on REST API and how to implement one, and currently I'm looking at the use of API keys for authentication. I'm confused on how the URL path should be constructed for different users, and whether the API key should be placed in the URL or within the HTTP header. 

From my understanding, API keys are like your email/password when logging into a website, but they are usually encrypted in the database and used for verifying if a certain request like GET/POST can be called. From the guides I've read online, these API keys are stored as parameters in the URL, for example: `http:/localhost:3000/users/?api_key=some_long_api_key`.  But with this approach, what's stopping someone from copying the API key who isn't authorized and using it in making requests?

The other option was to embed the API key in the body of the request, but I'm still wondering if this still suffers from the issue of someone who isn't authorized from making their own request body using it.

The other approach I'm thinking about is where before the request is made, the client retrieves the API key for the currently logged in user and then sends a request using that API key, ensuring that it is hidden from the url, but then again what's to stop someone from viewing the body of the request and getting the API key, unless encryption is required while sending it.

The above approach is what I'm planning to do, although I don't know if it the correct way to do it. For instance, my though process about doing this is as follows:

1. A new user registers with an email and password,
2. An API key is generated for the user,
3. When a request is sent, like posting some form data, the API key is retrieved for the current user and encrypted, then placed in the body of the request,
4. On the server, it first validates the API key and then continues with the request.

Also, for generating an API key, is generating a UUID good enough? Along with that, is it okay to send the user's email in the body of the request to identify which user is making the request? Is it possible that two user's can have the same API key, which would require sending their details to the server to know which valid user is making the request?  I've never worked with API's before so I am curious to how this is solved from a security standpoint...

I’m currently working on a personal project to automate an inventory calculation process that I usually do manually in Excel. The goal is to calculate **Runrate** and **Days of Cover (DOC)***Building a Python Script to Automate Inventory Runrate and DOC Calculations – Need Help!*  
Hi everyone! I’m currently working on a personal project to automate an inventory calculation process that I usually do manually in Excel. The goal is to calculate **Runrate** and **Days of Cover (DOC)** for inventory across multiple cities using Python. I want the script to process recent sales and stock data files, pivot the data, calculate the metrics, and save the final output in Excel.

Here’s how I handle this process manually:

1. **Sales Data Pivot:** I start with sales data (item\_id, item\_name, City, quantity\_sold), pivot it by item\_id and item\_name as rows, and City as columns, using quantity\_sold as values. Then, I calculate the Runrate: **Runrate = Total Quantity Sold / Number of Days.**
2. **Stock Data Pivot:** I do the same with stock data (item\_id, item\_name, City, backend\_inventory, frontend\_inventory), combining backend and frontend inventory to get the **Total Inventory** for each city: **Total Inventory = backend\_inventory + frontend\_inventory.**
3. **Combine and Calculate DOC:** Finally, I use a VLOOKUP to pull Runrate from the sales pivot and combine it with the stock pivot to calculate DOC: **DOC = Total Inventory / Runrate.**

Here’s what I’ve built so far in Python:

* The script pulls the latest sales and stock data files from a folder (based on timestamps).
* It creates pivot tables for sales and stock data.
* Then, it attempts to merge the two pivots and output the results in Excel.

 

However, I’m running into issues with the final output. The current output looks like this:

||

It seems like \_x is inventory and \_y is the Runrate, but the **DOC** isn’t being calculated, and columns like item\_id and item\_name are missing.

Here’s the output format I want:

learnprogramming,Looking for how to program a vector drawing application,"I'm looking for tutorials or textbooks describing how to develop a vector drawing application. Googling for information has been mostly useless, as I find tutorials for illustration and CAD software, but not info on how to design the applications. Enough apps exist that somewhere, there's got to be info on how to build one. 

I've got some books on computational geometry already, so I don't (at this time) need suggestions for that side of things. I'm really looking for something to help walk me through the basics of building the drawing app while avoiding some common pitfalls. I'm thinking the basic outline would go something like:

1. Create a shape
2. Draw a shape
3. Add handles to the shape
4. Modify and/or move the shape using the handles
5. Show a property dialog for the shape
6. Add snaps to the shapes.
7. Make too many shapes and eventually the app slows down. Sidetrack into quadtrees (or some other sort of tree) to deal with that.
8. Add zoom and pan. Sidetrack into the limits of your drawing space', possibly covering ways to deal with that. (I sometimes hit those limits in AutoCAD during my day job. I'm guessing it deals with the limits of floating point numbers, but I'm not positive.)

Bonus points if the textbook or tutorial has exercises to work through. 

My end goal is to make an app to draw periodic, non-periodic, and aperiodic tesselations, and then paint or texture them. I've been hobby-programming since the 1980's; I'm mostly self-taught (though I did take a couple CS classes as electives in college), so I may know a lot about a few specialized topics that interest me, but also may be ignorant of topics that every CS graduate knows.

learnprogramming,Looking for API/Database to Identify Companies Behind IP Addresses (Not ISPs),"We’re building a tool that needs to identify specific companies behind IP addresses, but we’re running into a common issue: most services, like IPinfo, only return the ISP (e.g., Ziggo, Telenet) instead of the actual business using the IP address.

The Challenge:

For larger organizations, it's easier to identify the company behind the IP, but when it comes to smaller businesses using common ISPs or shared/dynamic IPs, we only get the ISP information. We're specifically after the company data, not just the internet service provider.

What We Need:

We need an API or a database that can accurately identify the company behind an IP address, even when that company is using a dynamic IP provided by an ISP.

Self-hosted or independent solutions are preferred. We're not interested in using another service like Leadfeeder. Instead, we want control over the data and how it integrates into our tool.

We want to find a solution that offers the best balance between price and quality.


What We’ve Tried:

We’ve used IPinfo.io, which aggregates data from sources like WHOIS records, but it often returns only the ISP for smaller businesses. We even tried the IP-to-company data API.

Reverse DNS lookups similarly lead back to the ISP instead of the company.


Our Goal:

We want to find an API or data source that provides the actual business behind an IP, not the ISP.

Alternatively, we’re open to building our own database if there's a reliable method to aggregate and map business information to IP addresses.


Questions:

1. Does anyone know of an API or data provider that can reliably return company-level data behind IP addresses?


2. Has anyone had success in creating a custom database to map businesses to IPs? If so, how did you gather and maintain this data?


3. Are there any other data sources or techniques we should be looking at to solve this problem?

Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

2. **Service1** processes the request (e.g., fetches client and delivery personnel details) and forwards it to a dedicated ""Job Service"" (packaged as a separate Spring Boot JAR application).
3. The **Job Service** establishes and manages live, bidirectional connections between the delivery personnel and the client application.

I got a student licence for JetBrain IDEs in March this year. It was working perfectly fine, until I completely deleted Windows (where I used these IDEs) and installed Ubuntu on my computer. Since then, I don’t have any licence in my account whatsoever, it just randomly got deleted and when I want to renew it from my account webpage it prompts me to another webpage, which promps me again to the first one, like a loop. I basically only have the option to pay for the subscription. When I try to start over and fill a form, it’s not accepted since I’m using an email address that already is registred, which prompts me to a webpage where I already tried to renew the licence, without success.

The registred email address is the one from my faculty. I haven’t gotten a reminder that my subscription will expire whatsoever. I am pretty sure my subscription shouldn’t have expired in the first place since I got it less than a year ago.

I thought of deleting the account altogether and setting it up with the email address I already used once again, but I am not sure if I will lose the right to a student licence.

Can someone please instruct me with how to have python code working alongside my node.js code? Perhaps there is a way to define the python function in a .py file and then import that function in my .js file? Or maybe there's some other way?

I would appreciate any help and guidance.

Thank you.",amian246,1h12c0v,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h12c0v/how_to_have_python_code_in_my_nodejs_web_app/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h12c0v/how_to_have_python_code_in_my_nodejs_web_app/,2024-11-27 11:38:06,0,0.5,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h12c0v
learnprogramming,suggestions for resolving an ambiguity in a system,"I have a huge dataset containing information about painters, divers, drivers, electricians, chefs, gardeners, and many more, including the different types of work they can do and other related conditions. Based on this data, there are corresponding prices for each type of worker, such as painters, drivers, electricians, etc.

I am using a Large Language Model (LLM) to calculate the charge for a worker based on the user's input, which specifies details such as the type of work they've done, its complexity, timing, and other relevant factors. The LLM will use these input parameters to return the total charge for that particular worker.

For example, if a user enters ""a diver dives at 100m,"" the LLM will calculate the total charge for that diver, as the system recognizes that the diver has performed a diving task at a depth of 100m.

However, if the user provides ambiguous input, such as the word ""diver"" alone, it becomes impossible to calculate and return the charge for that diver because there is insufficient information. I want my system to clarify this ambiguity with the user in a friendly way to ensure accurate charge calculation.

Can you suggest how I can implement this clarification step in a user-friendly manner, so that the ambiguity is resolved and the user does not get frustrated? I would love detailed step wise response.

Note: As I mentioned earlier, the dataset is huge and includes many different types of workers, meaning various different types of ambiguities can arise. The solution should work for all these cases.

**Update**:  
Challenges I am facing:

1. Handling large datasets: The dataset is enormous, and sending this entire data with every request to the LLM is impractical. LLMs have token limits and such an approach would be cost-prohibitive. I need a cost-effective and efficient solution.
2. Interactive communication flow: This requires a back-and-forth interaction between the server and the user. The user provides input, and the server (assisted by the LLM) responds, addressing ambiguities in the input.

Example of user-system interaction for clarity:  
User: ""operator""  
System: ""I found multiple entries with 'operator'. Options are:  
JCB operator, Excavator operator, Crane operator, Truck operator.""  
User: ""Crane operator""  
System: ""Work location can affect charges. Select a location: Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune.""  
User: ""Hyderabad""  
System: ""The charge for a Crane operator in Hyderabad is 100 Rs (for example).""  


This flow includes only location, but there can be different parameters for different workers. I want to achieve this type of interactive flow, possibly enhancing it for a better user experience. Suggestions needed:  
How can I achieve this solution?  
What technologies or approaches would best suit this use case?

learnprogramming,How to search for a product through Shopify API?,"Hi everyone, I’m working on a web app to help users compare Pokémon card prices by gathering listings from local stores. Many of these stores use Shopify for their websites, and I’d like my app to fetch data from their APIs for a specific card when a user clicks on it.

I’ve tried methods like:

* Sending GET requests to `[store].com/products.json?title=[Card Name]`
* Sending GET requests to `[store].myshopify.com/products.json?title=[Card Name]`
* Using `https://${store}.com/api/2023-10/graphql.json` with a hardcoded `const accessToken = ""X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token""`

Since I think you need to have access to each store’s Shopify storefront access token, these approaches haven’t worked.

I'm currently in my third year of a Computer Science BSc, and I'm feeling a bit lost about my future career path. I'm really passionate about cybersecurity, but I don't feel like I have enough fundamental knowledge to apply for a job in that field just yet. As a result, I'm considering pursuing a developer role for the time being.

The job market is tough right now, and it seems like everyone wants years of experience, even for junior positions. On top of that, I'm not sure what to put on my CV since I haven’t worked on any major projects that would stand out.

Currently, I’m taking two cybersecurity-related courses and also starting to explore TryHackMe, but I’m unsure if I’ll be able to find a cyber-related first job without more experience. I’m considering working on projects or solving LeetCode problems to gain more experience, but I’m not sure if that’s the best route.

If anyone has advice on how to move forward, I’d really appreciate it. Specifically, I’m looking for guidance on:

I have to create two cards, both populated with a list of therapies (one for manual and one for instrumental therapies), so I made types, datas and props. So far so good.  
I decided to create the cards through the map() method in order to keep the same styles for both of them, but I’m finding some inconsistencies: the first card is fine and it's been displayed as I wrote it, while the second card is visibly off, and I don’t understand why since they're both created by the same method with the same attributes. The iteration works, both cards are correctly populated, but somewhere in my code there's something wrong, and I can't find what, why or even where (and it is driving me crazy).

I am building my first ""real"" project. It is a full stack web scraper.

I am figuring out the flow of the components.

Regarding the scraper, db, and getting info. from db:

Option 1, a middle component separates the db and scraper entirely. The scraper has to go through the middle component. The middle component handles all db interactions.

Option 2, the scraper interacts with the db directly. The middle component (no longer middle), only interacts with the db.

Others say Python and JavaScript are the ones beginners should opt for, and those two alone would be enough for lots of people.

I'd like to ask all of you who have got ample experience in programming in different fields: what is your stand regarding all of this? At the end of the day, **does it actually matter**? And if it does, I'm very much interested in hearing your opinions as to why that is so. Also, as a side note: how much should beginners rely on third-party libraries and modules?

learnprogramming,How to actually get better at coding in a stressful environment?,"I recently joined my university to pursue bachelors in software engineering and it's difficult. Everywhere I go, I see people with tons of certificates and coding experience crushing it in the exams and coding assessments.

Here, am I, a newbie with basic knowledge about programming but a passion to get better.

I genuinely feel good when I program, I feel great when I am able to solve a simple coding problem, problems that my peers don't even sneeze at. I feel joy being able to solve a small decrementing problem. You know when you have that ""aha!"" moment in coding when you suddenly understand what something does in a program. I had one about recursion and my joy was overflowing, I was really happy.

But to get to the real part, university is difficult. It's a whole different beast from school where you constantly guided from destination to destination. In university, you're on your own. No one is here to mess sround, everyone is as good and most are far better than you. It's stressful.

We just a programming assessment and I, as a non-programmer was quite sad that I was able to score only a 60%. This feeling was further amplified when I saw almost all my peers sad cause they got an 80 or a 90. Everybody is pushing for 3.8 and 3.9 gpa while even though I'm doing my best, pulling all nighters, rigorous note making, working on algorithms and pseudo code, trying new things, applying for clubs where I may improve, but I'm not having any luck. 

I had my maths test today, and my roommate who was always on valorant did better than me (according to him) on the test I studied continuously for almost two days (revision and problem solving). It's really disheartening seeing people get ahead of you with minimal hardwork when you've been working you ass off. I applied for my college cs society, but got rejected. Even though I learned html and actually gave them a project I was really proud of. I made it to the interview round but got rejected.

I am getting better at coding but their is so much to learn and I feel like I've no time left. People hear know how to build apps, make interactive website and I'm stuck learning file handling.

I attend all my classes, always study after I come back, practice coding but still feel left behind.

Anyways back to the main question,

How to actually get better at coding?

What should I learn? 

How to go from learning how to code, to making a project in that language?

How to know which projects to make?

What the hell is a tech stack?

How to learn a language?

How to get better at algorithms?

How to get even started with leetcode?

How to make github contributions? 

What to do and what not to do? 

Do I even have enough time? 

I wanna learn web development, but where do I start? 

Do I use books or lectures?

Can I take my grades up if I mess up my first semester a little bit? 

How to actually improve as a coder?

How to make a good portfolia, a good resume?

So to explain the idea let's say I have this dictionary {1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0}

If I add +1 to a key, the same value will be added to all the larger keys but not the smaller keys

Examples:

I add +1 to key 3 so the values ​​become {1:0, 2:0, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1}

I add +1 to key 4 so the values ​​become {1:0, 2:0, 3:1, 4:2, 5:2}

I add +1 to key 2 so the values ​​become {1:0, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:3}

the stack diagram picture showed the addresses 8000, 8004, 8008, 8012, 8016 then jumped to (showing a line of dots a space between 8016 and 9k) 9000. all having the integers stored in them in order: 84, 42, 56, 10, 28, 8004. 

multiple questions asked but one that really threw me off, it simply stated *eval; chat said that 8004 is actually the address 8004 not necessarily a number passed like the others. so it is taking the value held at 8004 which would be 42. 

i wish i could give a picture. but the declaration for *eval was just that. a declaration. int *eval; and then the stack shown

how the fuck was i meant to know that it was actually pointing to another address? am I missing some critical thinking skills with this one? i already don’t understand this all too well with the brackets and all, this seemed so simple im bummed i got it wrong  T_T",greatestlatestell,1h05e4b,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h05e4b/was_this_a_fair_question_on_an_exam/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h05e4b/was_this_a_fair_question_on_an_exam/,2024-11-26 06:22:44,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Code Review,,t3_1h05e4b

Prompt:

Write a Flowgorithm program that performs the following tasks:

* Utilizing nested loops
   * Outside loop keeps the program running until told to stop
   * Inside loop asks for input of a number, positive or negative
      * input number count should be unlimited
      * Input of a zero (0) terminates inside loop
* When the inside loop is terminated, display the largest and smallest number of all the numbers entered in the inside loop as well as their total.  No values carry over from one set of numbers to the next. Example:  If input is:      1   3   -12   5   50    0                  Largest is       50                  Smallest is     -12                  Total is           47
* The outside loop will then ask if a new set of numbers is to be input

 

# Remember the following:

* declare necessary variables &amp; constants
* use clear prompts for your input
* use integers for the input numbers
* clearly label the largest and smallest number on output
* use comment box for your name, lab name and date at the top of the flowgorithm
* use other comments where appropriate
* the zero to stop the inner loop is not to be considered the lowest number, it just stops the inner loop
* consider a ""priming read"" to set initial values of large and small

learnprogramming,Windows daily user wants to start programming (stack question),"Hello,

First of all, I would like to apologize for speaking such a non-technical language, but I have only been learning programming for a few days. I kindly ask this cool community for your understanding and help. Because no one who asks is wrong :)

I know that most apps are based on an OS such as Linux because software is ultimately built for this system. I am starting to learn to program, the presence of AI very quickly increased my learning curve of each language, but I am still very much a beginner, I do not even know how to use git well enough, please be understanding. I am just gaining awareness of the basics of all languages.

There is a problem, however, when I transfer project files from vscode to my vps with ubuntu, they simply do not work (which is normal). Sometimes the dependencies require .exe extensions and so on, you surely know what I mean. I also tried to play around with the windows vscode stack remotessh extension directly to my vps but there is also a problem with permissions (I want everything to be done on the Linux vps - debugging, dependencies also to be on linux and not Windows, but when Windows is the main machine, I guess you just don't have a Windows shell and Linux is different.

Therefore, I would like to ask for advice on what to do? How do you program? My stack is windows vscode + cline / windows vscode + cline + remotessh with vps Linux. I am so used to Windows that I am unable to give it up.

What are my options? Is my lack of basics causing these problems? For example, from what I know, remotessh does not allow commits to be made on the remote machine (vps), but only the local one (windows), and these dependencies. I would like the mscode and cline gui to be on the Windows side, and everything to be done on vpsie.

I read a bit about this before creating the topic and someone who got a lot of pluses here added a comment ""regardless of whether you have Windows or Linux"", vscode is already mature enough to create universal applications"", maybe I understood it in the wrong context, but maybe I'm just making a mistake?

What do I have to choose?

1. I made a mistake and can I achieve what I want to achieve in mscode on Windows? My local Windows only as a gui in vscode, writing code on it using cline and connecting to a vps with Linux.

2. Use WSL1 / WSL2 / Virtualbox / Wmvare Pro for personal use on Windows to emulate Linux? But then, will this compatibility with Linux work fully when I'm on this virtual system? Only then another problem appears, the graphical environment on such virtualbox works tragically, and I would absolutely need a graphical environment on this Linux on which I will be working, so that everything works quickly.

3. I have two monitors, I could buy a computer on which I will install Linux (what distribution do you recommend, I know Ubuntu and Debian best, but literally the basics of the console version without GUI), this Linux will have a GUI for programming. I am going to have Windows on one monitor on my main computer, and Linux on the other. If this is the right way, what would you recommend for a budget? I don't think I want anything like a Rapsberry Pi, because there is Arm there, I want a stack like it is on normal servers, maybe not in terms of performance, but compatibility, something inexpensive. Sorry for speaking in such non-technical language but I have only been learning for a few days.

4. Is it possible to install both full Windows 11 and full Linux (in the context of the shell, kernel or anything there) on the same computer? So that they work at the same time? For example, Windows on the first, Linux is the second.

5. Does Dualbot still work with W11 in combination with Linux? I once saw a video on YT where someone gives a guide on how to do it. But even if it works, I will only be able to run one system :(

6. Do you have any other ideas for me?

I apologize for writing so much, but I am extremely determined, I wander and it really annoys me that I have no one who could explain the basics to me.",mehambre,1gzyltl,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzyltl/windows_daily_user_wants_to_start_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzyltl/windows_daily_user_wants_to_start_programming/,2024-11-26 00:25:53,0,0.42,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gzyltl
learnprogramming,My Struggle as a Self-Taught Developer,"I've always wanted to be a programmer—well, not really. Back then, I didn’t even know what ""programmer"" meant. I just wanted to create things, like the technology I saw on TV. I thought it would be impossible, something only geniuses or scientists could do. Fast forward, here I am, chasing that dream!

It all started when I was 13. The first time I accessed the internet on a laptop, I began searching for what I could do with this magical thing called “Google” That’s when I stumbled upon a fascinating concept: programming. I didn’t understand much, but it sounded exciting.

During summer holidays, I began searching how computers work. It amazed me how simple technology could be—especially for achieving my childhood dream. As a kid, I was glued to documentaries about robots in Silicon Valley and China. While most kids my age were watching cartoons or Barbie, I was fascinated by machines (I loved Barbie too! I'm not a nerd, okay?🙂)

In the summer of 2019, I discovered HTML5 through a YouTube channel and created my very first webpage. It was just a basic “this is my first page” header, but it felt like magic. I was so proud and told everyone about it, but no one really got it—all they saw was a browser tab with some text.

Still, I pressed on. I experimented with CSS, building colorful layouts, navbars, footers, and grids. Then I dove into JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and MySQL. I was learning, exploring, and dreaming big.

Then came the pandemic. In my final year of high school, COVID turned everything upside down. After graduating in 2020, I went to nursing school—not because I wanted to, but because studying computer science wasn’t an option in my city. Plus, the CS curriculum in my country was so outdated, I knew I’d have to teach myself anyway.

Working as a nurse during COVID was overwhelming. My plan was to learn programming in the evenings after work, but after 8-to-6 shifts in pure chaos, I barely had any energy left. Still, I pushed through. I completed my residency program, got licensed, and finally quit nursing to focus on programming.

Now, I’ve been teaching myself for a while. I’ve built projects, learned different tools, and tried to improve step by step. But the journey hasn’t been easy.

Being self-taught often feels lonely. You doubt yourself. You feel like you’re constantly catching up. And with the job market so competitive, it’s easy to lose hope. I planned to land a job or internship as a developer by the end of the year, but that hasn’t happened yet—I haven’t even applied. And the pressure is mounting—I’m turning 22 this week, and I need a job.

But I’m not giving up. Software development is what I want, and I haven’t given it my all yet. This is just the beginning of my journey, not the end.

Technology has always been my passion, and I want to be part of shaping the future. Whether it’s building tools that help people, solving unique problems, I know my story is far from over.

If you’ve been through this or are going through something similar, I’d love to hear your story or any advice you might have.",Human-Reporter-3657,1gzwey1,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzwey1/my_struggle_as_a_selftaught_developer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzwey1/my_struggle_as_a_selftaught_developer/,2024-11-25 22:48:15,84,0.95,84,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gzwey1

After that, it has to finish out each iteration of the function sorta ""in reverse order"" but really its just the most recent so that the preceding recursed functions actually have a returned value to work with to finish the instructions.

learnprogramming,Chromadb beginner,"Hi.

I'm currently working on an llm project in which one of the selected technologies is the chromaDB vector database.

I'm working on a function that takes a pdf document as input, and adds its content and embeddings to the database. I did my research on google. Knowing that I want to make very specific queries on a pdf file and the way a vector database works, I think it would be better to store one pdf document per collection, and divide it into several documents, either one page of the pdf per document, or a certain number of characters per document.

This is combined with a database search function that accepts text as input, and an embeddings search function. These functions return a choice of 1 or more results, reinforcing my idea of storing several documents per collection.

learnprogramming,How to make two Docker Apps appear as different origins ?,"Hi everyone,

First, I'm not sure if my post belongs in this sub, so feel free to recommend one that's more appropriate! :)

I'm a student in software and web development, which means I'm not completely new to programming, but I still have some gaps in my knowledge. So here’s the speech : imagine I have two instances of the same app (each running in its own Docker container). When I launch them, by default, they are connected to my private network, defined by the IP 192.168.1.1. And if I understand how this works correctly, from an external server, both apps access the internet with 192.168.1.1 as their ID.

Now, what I’d like to do is make the external server believe that my apps aren't from the same origin (for example, app1 is from 192.168.2.1 and app2 is from 192.168.2.2). I assume this is how a VPN works, right? Do you have any suggestions?

While discussing this with a colleague, I learned that I could use Kubernetes (though I’m not familiar with it), or a VPS (not convinced by this one). I also found that I could run a VPN/proxy on each Docker container, but I’m not sure if that solution is feasible.

If it’s possible, the goal is to get this project running on a Raspberry Pi, with a low or no-cost solution.",TamPoulet,1gzibcm,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzibcm/how_to_make_two_docker_apps_appear_as_different/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzibcm/how_to_make_two_docker_apps_appear_as_different/,2024-11-25 13:02:49,1,0.6,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gzibcm

learnprogramming,(C# || Python/Windows) Is there a way I can create an in-memory file that has a path other processes can access?,"I feel like this might be a situation where OS features like pipes could come into play but I'm not knowledgable enough about that stuff, and would appreciate any advice or clarification.

I'm writing a program that deals with image data, reading files into arrays of pixels in memory. The library I'm using knows how to decode JPEGs and PNGs, but not some more niche cutting-edge formats like JPEG XL. So currently when I need to deal with those I create a subprocess, call ImageMagick or djxl (JPEG XL -&gt; JPEG decoder program) to create a temporary .JPEG/.PNG file on the disk, read that, then delete it.

Which works fine, but this isn't optimal: the program could leave temp files on the disk if it's killed before cleaning up (e.g. power failure), it could write millions of temp files for large runs creating unnecessary wear and tear on an SSD, it could spin up a sleeping HDD on a laptop causing battery drain, etc. The temp files are never over 3 MB so it'd be nice to create them in memory instead.

But I'm not sure how I'd go about doing that short of creating a ramdisk. The programs I call in the subprocess want file paths to read from and write to.

So is this a situation where you can create a pipe and use the pipe like a file path, and have the C#/Python program read from it?

2. Restore previous versions easily, enabling straightforward rollbacks.

Should I go to Community College for first 2 years or all four at University?,"I posted here about a year ago, and you guys have helped inspire me to go to school. I start in January. But it's time to make some crucial choices.

PSA: I barely have a clue what I'm talking about. That's why I need your advice. My advisors have been over the phone and very unhelpful. I have to schedule 2 weeks ahead just for a phone call. All I know for sure is that I want to end up with at least a bachelor's in computer science. Okay I could be terribly wrong about all of this or be making a big brain maneuver.

The CC is Gateway. The Uni is NKU.

I have to decide between going to the local community college for my first 2 years or local university for the full 4 years. The CC is going to be mostly online, whereas the Uni is more in-person but with the option to go online. I am thinking I could get an AS in IT/Programming first and then do 2 more years at Uni for a BS in Computer Science. Is that how that works? Maybe just have to take a few extra classes? Has anyone done this? Do the credits overlap, or would it take 6 years?

My academic advisors have me down as an AAS. As of right now I am basically getting my Gen Ed.'s out of the way at community college for the first 2 years, then going to NKU for the last 2 years. An AAS degree doesn't sound as exciting as having an IT degree AND CS degree. The latter would give me more experience and make me more attractive to employers, right?

TL;DR Questions:

Community college or university?

Bachelor's of Computer Science precursor: AAS to ""get Gen Ed's out of the way"" or IT/Programming 2yr?

Online College or In-person?

Have any of you done this? I will take any advice I can get. I really want to make the best choices and I'm tired of feeling lost and confused about it all.

learnprogramming,Java order of operations question," I'm hoping somebody can help me understand this code a little better, it's from an online tutorial I am following:

The answer is 6 but I'm strugging to understand why.

The variabled *BEFORE* hitting ""LINE 5"" are as follows:

***result = 5***

***a = 1***

***b = 0***

Then we hit LINE 5. My way of thinking is ok lets work out what's between the brackets

***(0 / 1) = 0***

then work out the first part and since the variable 'a'  was decremented it should now be 0

***result += 0 + 0;***

result should equal 5 but it's actually 6. Where am I wrong in my understanding?

  


                  int result = 5;
                  int a = 1;
                  int b = --a;

learnprogramming,How to strip a matrix efficiently ,"Apologies for the weak title, I couldn't see how to summarise it better. 

I have a binary matrix. Call a 1 in the matrix isolated if it is the only 1 in either its row or column or both. I want to remove all isolated 1s and I also want to reduce the rows so there  is only one copy of each row.  Identical copies off a row should be zeroed out as should isolated 1s 

The identity matrix would be reduced to the all zeros matrix. More interestingly, the all ones matrix would also be reduced to the all zeros matrix. First all duplicate rows are zeroed and then all  remaining 1s are isolated.

The difficulty, in terms of computational complexity, is that zeroing a row can cause a 1 to become isolated and zeroing a 1 can cause two rows to become identical. Running the whole process until there are no isolated ones and no duplicate rows could be slow. 

Is there an efficient way to do this?

My company is partnering with an educational institute and is offering programming classes for elementary grade students grade 2-4. They have requested the lesson be 90 minutes long, and the students should complete the project in those 90 minutes.

  
I never learnt programming when I was young, and only started in university, so 90 minutes to get elementary students who have never used scratch before to make a game in 90 minutes seems impossible. For context, 25 of these 90 minutes will be introducing ourselves, presenting our work, and reviewing. So only 65 minutes of actual instruction and work.

  
What are people's opinions that have more experience than me? Should I push back against this? The only way I can see it being possible is by having a very on-the-rails experience, where all the assets and functions are already pre-selected by me.

learnprogramming,[Python] Decision tree prediction using recursion,"Hello world! I'm currently taking a class on machine learning and am very stuck on a strange problem

As part of a larger assignment we have been instructed to partially implement a decision tree that can separate the data from a dataset into groups. (Mainly using numpy)

To implement the predict function we have been given these instructions:

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: NDArray
        NumPy feature matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
    node: ""DecisionTreeBranchNode"" or ""DecisionTreeLeafNode""
        Node used to process the data. If the node is a leaf node,
        the data is classified with the value of the leaf node.
        If the node is a branch node, the data is split into left
        and right subsets, and classified by recursively calling
        _predict() on the left and right subsets.
    
    Returns
    -------
    y: NDArray
        NumPy class label vector (predicted), shape (n_samples,)
    
    Notes
    -----
    The prediction follows the following logic:
        if the node is a leaf node
            return y vector with all values equal to leaf node value
        else (the node is a branch node)
            split the dataset into left and right parts using node question
            predict classes for left and right datasets (using left and right branches)
            ""stitch"" predictions for left and right datasets into single y vector
            return y vector (length matching number of rows in X)

Based on those instructions i wrote this function:

    def _predict(
        self, 
        X: NDArray, 
        node: Union[""DecisionTreeBranchNode"", ""DecisionTreeLeafNode""]
    ) -&gt; NDArray:
    
      if type(node) == DecisionTreeLeafNode:
          y = np.zeros(len(X), dtype=np.int32)
          y[:] = node.y_value
          return y
      else:
          left_mask = X[:, node.feature_index] &lt;= node.feature_value
          left = X[left_mask]
          right = X[~left_mask]
          left_pred = self._predict(left, node.left)
          right_pred = self._predict(right, node.right)
          y = np.concatenate((left_pred, right_pred))
          return y

Which can reliably predict how many items from the dataset will end up in each group, but the order is completely wrong. 

Example:

    Decision tree:
      f0 &lt;= -0.368_____________________
     /                                 \
    0                       _______f1 &lt;= -0.229
                           /                   \
                     f0 &lt;= 0.732                1
                    /           \
                   2             3
    
    Data:
    [[-1.   0. ]
     [ 1.   1. ]
     [ 0.5 -1. ]
     [ 1.5 -1. ]]
    
    Expected result:
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
    
    Actual result:
    [0, 2, 3, 1]

I understand why the order is wrong, since np.concatenate() just mashes the two vectors into one without regard for the contents, but i cannot find a way to keep the order of the items while using the recursive method described in the instructions.

So my question is; Is this a strange way to implement a decision tree prediction function, or am i just horribly misunderstanding the instructions? And if so what am i supposed to do?

learnprogramming,Building a website with database search,"Hey all,

For learning purposes, I want to build a website/web app that does the following:

1. The first/home page let's the user input a UK car reg and submit it. If the car reg is valid, it will display info about the car (basic stuff for now) but will also store the car reg and info into a database table (say cars). If the same car is searched again, it will pull the info from the table.

2. On a different page, let the user search through the cars table. They can search by car reg, make, model etc.

I want a modern looking UI and to be relatively snappy.

I can write a python script to pull the car info but that's about it.

I'm looking to avoid no-code as I want to learn the tools myself. I have no particular time limit on this.

Edit: lol forgot to ask questions. I don't really know how to go about this and want some direction. I feel like my idea is straightforward and done 1000s of times and there is some decent guide I can follow.

I'm seeking advice on preparing for summer internship 2025 coding interviews (SWE, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or anything coding-related). I've started to leetcode and know that data structures and algorithms are key for interviews. I’m looking for an online course to take over winter break—something not too heavy but effective since I’ve already taken an intro to DS and algos course.

**My background:**

* **Experience:** 2+ years in market research with a focus on data analysis (non coding)
* **Education:** Undergrad in econ, currently finishing my first semester of my CS master’s program. I also did a data science bootcamp focusing on python a few years ago.
* **Courses so far:** Intro to DS and algorithms, Intro to Java. Next semester I'll be taking the DS + Algos course beyond intro level.
* **On the side:** brushing up on Python as I heard it's easier for coding interviews
* **Goals:** Not aiming for prestigious internships lol—just want to build solid skills to compete for internships as I have far less coding experience than undergrad CS juniors.

Can anyone recommend a good winter break course or strategy to strengthen my coding skills, **especially in data structures and algos prep aimed for coding interviews**?

learnprogramming,[HELP] Python Developer Struggling with JupyterLab Extension Setup - Can't Get Past Installation Stage,"Hi learnprogramming  community! I'm primarily a Python/data analysis developer trying to create my first JupyterLab extension. I'm stuck at a really frustrating stage and could use some guidance.

**What I'm Trying to Build:**
A JupyterLab extension that shows tooltips of Python function content when hovering over markdown links in Jupyter notebooks. For example, if I have a function:
```python
def my_function():
    """"""
    My docstring
    """"""
    return ""Hello""
```
And a markdown link `[Click here](#my_function)`, hovering over it should show the function content.

**My Current Setup:**
- JupyterLab 4.2.6
- Python 3.10
- Using virtual environment
- Project structured following JupyterLab extension template
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Warren8824/jupyter-hover-tooltip.git

**The Problem:**
Even though I'm just trying to get the basic extension recognized before implementing Python functionality:

1. The extension builds without errors:
```bash
   npm run build  # Succeeds
   pip install -e .  # Succeeds
   jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite  # Succeeds
```

2. Server logs show it's loading:
```
   jupyter_hover_tooltip | extension was successfully loaded
```

3. But the extension is invisible in:
   - `jupyter labextension list` output
   - JupyterLab's Extension Manager UI

**Key Files in Place:**
- setup.py with proper Python packaging
- package.json with JupyterLab extension metadata
- __init__.py with proper extension registration
- webpack.config.js for building JavaScript components

**What's Confusing Me:**
1. I understand Python packaging but this hybrid Python/JavaScript setup is new to me
2. Everything seems to build correctly but JupyterLab won't recognize the extension
3. I had it working once before but can't reproduce that success
4. Can't even get to testing the actual Python functionality because I'm stuck at setup

**Questions:**
1. Is this a Python packaging issue or a JupyterLab configuration problem?
2. Are there specific Python-side debugging steps I should take?
3. How can I verify if my Python package is correctly registering with JupyterLab?

I've spent over a day just trying to get past this setup stage. As someone who usually works with pure Python, I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about how Python packages interact with JupyterLab's extension system.

All code is in the GitHub repo. Any help, especially from Python developers who have experience with JupyterLab extensions, would be greatly appreciated!

learnprogramming,Where to start? ,"Hey there,

I really need some advice and honestly don't know where else to turn. I've been learning programming at school for about 2 years now, mainly C++, and I'm really struggling. Not with the concepts exactly, but with finding any enjoyment in it. We're working with SFML now, and I just can't get excited about it.

I watch YouTube tutorials and try to code along, which helps me understand things, but it still feels like a chore. What actually gets me excited is thinking about making games in Unity, but my teacher says that's just wasting time and wants us to focus on algorithm exercises instead.

Something that really frustrates me is when I ask other programmers how they got good, and they just say ""just start coding"" or ""I just enjoy it."" That doesn't help me at all. The weird thing is, I managed to teach myself graphic design pretty well, but programming just isn't clicking the same way.

But recently something changed. I watched this video about AI  from the YT Channel ""TylerMommsenl"" like the Fruit ninja one and for the first time in ages, I felt really excited about programming. Like I want to start to learn that. I love working with AI and prompt engineering, and I think actually programming AI would be amazing. Especially in a world where the ki can now programme everything for you. I always think to myself ‘just learn python’ and ask the ki if she can rewrite the python code in c++. Or make your own ki for your own problems. The problem is, I still don't know where to start. I know I probably need to learn Python, but I'm worried about getting worse at C++ if I try to learn both.

I've actually just uninstalled all my games to really focus on this. I know that might sound extreme, but I really want to make this work after so manye tries. Programming has been my dream since I was a kid, and I don't want to give up on it.

I guess what I'm really asking is - has anyone else felt this way? How did you find what excited you in programming? And if anyone here works with AI, how did you get started? I'd really appreciate any advice.

Thanks for reading this far. I know it's a bit of a mess, but I really want to figure this out.",SUZ0Y,1gyw2tv,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gyw2tv/where_to_start/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gyw2tv/where_to_start/,2024-11-24 17:16:44,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gyw2tv
learnprogramming,Programming makes me feel overwhelmed,"I started studying CS this year at university, but it's not the first time I coded.  
I was in ""high school"" that has a branch of computer science. Last year my interest in programming grew thanks to Java, I really liked the problem solving part of it, I think I was one of the few who really had fun in tests while the others were struggling and panicking.

But somehow after finishing last year, I didn't stick with Java I went on and tried to learn new things such as basics of Web Dev, Python along with Pygame, I remember I did a bit of C but I gave up the second I saw pointers...

We also learned SQL and PHP, I considered them to be less fun than Java (even if they're two separate things), I had no issue with the latters but still, I was still in that gray area of not knowing what to focus on.  
  
Although programming is a very interesting, and the fact that you can do a lot of different things with it is truly fascinating.  
  
The issue is that now at University, **I'm unable to do anything, and it feels so overwhelming that, it lowered my self-esteem**.     
When the teacher gives us exercise to do (in Java), I feel ashamed that I'm unable to solve most of them, while others do them with ease. Not only that, watching people online coding and being able to do very cool projects like [this guy](https://youtu.be/GXlckaGr0Eo?t=3333), or coding blazingly fast like [Prime](https://youtu.be/88Oy0h3zxW0?t=1592), truly makes me question if I'm suited for this kind of carrier.

I know most of y'all are thinking ""Just learn prgramming then !"". Believe me I tried, but I'm having a heard time trying to make/complete projects. Either they're too easy to make me feel bored or to hard to make me quit. I can't find a middle ground.

    [[0 1 1 0 1 1 1]                                                                             	 
     [1 0 0 0 0 0 1]                                                                             	 
     [1 1 0 1 0 0 0]
     [1 0 1 0 1 0 0]
     [0 0 0 1 0 1 1]
     [1 1 0 0 1 0 1]
     [0 1 0 1 0 0 0]]

If we take columns 0, 2, 3, 6 we get:

    [[0 1 0 1]                                                                             	 
     [1 0 0 1]                                                                             	 
     [1 0 1 0]
     [1 1 0 0]
     [0 0 1 1]
     [1 0 0 1]
     [0 0 1 0]]

and we see row [1 0 0 1] appears twice.",MrMrsPotts,1gypt30,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gypt30/how_to_find_the_largest_subset_of_columns_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gypt30/how_to_find_the_largest_subset_of_columns_with/,2024-11-24 12:24:03,3,0.81,3,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gypt30
learnprogramming,Any resources from where I can mean DSA? Hands on project based resources ,"I really need some advice. I'm trying to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), but I’m struggling to figure out where to start coding on my own.

I can understand the theory behind DSA concepts and even follow along with examples. When it's time to actually write code, though, I freeze up. I don't know how to begin solving the problem. I've tried watching YouTube videos and reading books, but I feel like these approaches aren't working for me. I can follow their solutions, but when I'm on my own, I’m lost. I’ve got beginner-level knowledge of C++, Java, and Python, so I understand the syntax and basics, but I don’t know how to bridge the gap to solving complex problems.

It’s frustrating because it seems like everyone else knows what they’re doing, and I feel stuck. I need something that forces me to write code and learn by doing, step by step.

I’m not naturally good at coding, but I’m willing to work on it. Logical problem-solving is an area I know I need to improve, and I’m ready to put the time into it.

Does anyone know any resources or platforms that focus on project-based or interactive learning for DSA? Something where I can practice building projects or solving problems without having to rely on videos all the time. 

I’d appreciate any advice, tips, or resources that have worked for you when learning to code.

However, I was told that I shouldn't care about that, because most people use int everytime and some even use long by default.

learnprogramming,Chat GPT is actually great for learning (sometimes),"I've seen a post recently that says that chat gpt isn't good for learning programming.

HOWEVER, I believe it can 2x your learning speed and is a life hack if used correctly.

That being said, If you're still a total beginner,  then you should stay away from chat GPT.

Why? If you don't have solid understanding of the language, programming patterns and best practices before asking chat gpt for anything, you will not be able to notice when it starts hallucinating.

I think chat gpt excels in explaining simple concepts but don't ever expect that it to solve all your problems, and always take the answers with a grain of salt. It can help you speed up your process if you give it specific instructions but you must actually use your brain to analyze it.

It can give you different ideas to code something, teach you what a specific syntax means, or help you make your code cleaner and make more sense. I found that using chat GPT this way has accelerated my learning.

Don't rely on it for explaining complex concepts because it will definitely start hallucinating.

I'm not an expert yet or anything but that's what I found so far.

First time setting up an API with QuickBooks. I’m a pretty beginner in the programming world. All self taught.

I have set up the developer with intuit and have the software approved with the System able to get keys. 

I am lost when reading the intuit guide. I’m hoping that someone has experience and can share code snippets to get me started. Specifically, how to tell the system to send the data. 

My software creates a log and has a button to send it to Quickbooks. Just need help programming what the button does.

learnprogramming,Is single player game development a front-end project or back-end?,"I have this non-programmer friend who was asking me about a project I had made. 

The project was a top-down car racing game made in Javascript. It has a control panel to control the car, and there is a physics engine which simulates intertia as you accelerate, decelerate, etc.

He then asked me ""Was this a front-end project or back-end?""

To which, I didn't know what to say. I've always associated the terms ""front-end"", ""back-end"" mostly with website development.

So what is the right thing to say here? This is a simple single player game. Should I have just said ""It's both""? What is even the front-end part here? Just programming the buttons to move the car? And the physics engine is the ""back-end"" part? It feels weird to seperate the project like that.

I’ve recently started learning GTK GUI programming in C, and I’m really enjoying the process!

It’s a fun little productivity tool I made to combine coding with personal habit-building.

I’d love to share this project with others who are learning programming, especially if you’re curious about GUI development or working with GTK in C. If anyone’s interested, I can share my screen over Discord or another platform to walk through the code and explain how it works.

learnprogramming,Are there real situations where a producer-consumer pattern is useful?,"Was taught about the [producer-consumer problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) in an operating systems class when talking about parallel programming. It makes sense conceptually and it worked as a demonstration for how complicated synchronization can be, but I can't think of a situation where it's a useful solution to a problem, and the professor didn't have a concrete example.

Any examples I can find are either entirely abstract (producers are putting some abstract item in an array, consumers are removing them) or a toy model of a real-world situation (producers are customers making orders, consumers are cooks fulfilling those orders) and they always feel constructed just to demonstrate that it's a pattern that exists.

I can imagine that a queue of database queries may express this pattern, but the producers here aren't in software and I don't think a real database management system would work like this. When I asked the professor, he said it could *possibly* show up when simulating partial differential equations, but also cast some serious doubt on if that's a good place to use it.

Do producer-consumer problems entirely in software exist in practice? Is there a problem I might encounter that wasn't constructed to show off this pattern where a producer-consumer pattern would be useful? Does any real software that sees use somewhere express this pattern?

","[https://postimg.cc/gallery/HCpGhMS](https://postimg.cc/gallery/HCpGhMS)

Hi everyone, I am working on a project where I need to calculate the thread count from an image of fabric threads. The first image I have is a zoomed-in image of the fabric threads. After preprocessing the image, I apply the Hough Line Transform, and the second image shows the output with multiple lines being detected for a single thread. The third image represents the desired output, where the lines are correctly marked on both horizontal (red lines) and vertical threads (yellow lines). I want to achieve this output for all threads in the image, but currently, the result isn’t as expected. The fifth image was obtained after applying an edge detection filter to the first image, and the last image shows the desired final output. The fourth image shows the output obtained from the fifth image. Here’s the issue I’m facing: I’m getting multiple lines for a single thread, and in some cases, no lines are detected for certain threads at all. Can anyone suggest any algorithm or improvements to the Hough Line Transform that could help me achieve the desired output?

below is my houghline code that i have implemented

import cv2

import numpy as np

\# Load the image

image = cv2.imread('W015.jpg')

\# Convert to grayscale

gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR\_BGR2GRAY)

\# Apply median filtering to remove noise

filtered = cv2.medianBlur(gray, 5)

\# Increase sharpness by using a Laplacian kernel

laplacian = cv2.Laplacian(filtered, cv2.CV\_64F, ksize=3)

laplacian = cv2.convertScaleAbs(laplacian)

sharp = cv2.addWeighted(filtered, 1.5, laplacian, -0.5, 0)

\# Edge detection using Canny

edges = cv2.Canny(sharp, 50, 150)

\# Apply dilation to enhance edges

kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)

dilated = cv2.dilate(edges, kernel, iterations=1)

\# Use Hough Line Transform to detect lines (both horizontal and vertical)

lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(dilated, 1, np.pi/180, threshold=100, minLineLength=50, maxLineGap=10)

\# Initialize counters for horizontal and vertical threads

horizontal\_lines = 0

vertical\_lines = 0

\# Check orientation of each detected line

for line in lines:

for x1, y1, x2, y2 in line:

\# Calculate the angle of the line

angle = np.arctan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) \* 180.0 / np.pi

if -10 &lt;= angle &lt;= 10:  # Horizontal lines

horizontal\_lines += 1

cv2.line(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

learnprogramming,SQLAlchemy + Pydantic assigning default value if no value is inputted,"I am working on the messaging component of a project where users can message sellers of a product through the site. In my database (SQLite using SQLAlchemy, I have a column called convo\_id which I am planning to use to group related messages - like text chains). Sometimes the convo\_id will not be passed (if it is the first message), and other times it will be if the message is in reply to another. Obviously, the generated convo\_ids need to be unique; otherwise, messages will be grouped together incorrectly.

I have this pydantic model for creating (sending) a message:

    class MessageBase(BaseModel):
        sender_id: str
        receiver_id: str
        product_id: int
        message: str
        is_read: Optional[bool] = False
        parent_id: Optional[int] = None
        convo_id: Optional[str] = None
        
        # If no convo_id is provided, generate one
        @field_validator('convo_id')
        @classmethod
        def generate_convo_id(cls, convoID: Optional[str]) -&gt; str:
            # Used if no convo_id is provided (i.e. first message)
            if convoID is None:
                convoID = str(uuid.uuid4())
            return convoID

I ran the FastAPI function on FastAPI docs with some test values. In the return model of the FastAPI function, it shows all the attributes of Message, and there is a correctly generted convo\_id. However, in the database the column for convo\_id shows NULL. And sure enough, when I changed that column to be nullable=False and tried to repeat with a new message and an empty convo\_id, I got an error. But when I retrieved the message from the database (before I added nullable=False - so the column showed NULL), the convo\_id was returned and it matched the generated convo\_id that the FastAPI response model showed. So it seems that the convo\_id is in the database, but it is showing NULL? I'm a bit confused on what is going on. I do believe I fixed the problem by simply doing 

`convo_id: Optional[str] = str(uuid.uuid4())`

and deleting the field\_validator. I feel rather dumb for not doing that originally, but at least it's working. But I'm still confused at to what was going on with the original code. How was the database showing NULL for convo\_id, but when I retrieved the message there was a convo\_id?",Jumpy_Employment_439,1gy5a0b,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gy5a0b/sqlalchemy_pydantic_assigning_default_value_if_no/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gy5a0b/sqlalchemy_pydantic_assigning_default_value_if_no/,2024-11-23 17:45:44,2,1.0,2,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gy5a0b

This year I decided I want to get into programming so I got into a university. 

Lucky thing happens so that the company I work for (bakery factory) wanted a custom inventory management system. They told me they would hire a senior programmer and I am to take the role of the junior programmer. 

I meet the senior programmer and I explain to him that ""hey I don't even consider myself a junior"" and he says don't worry we all been there. 

To see my knowledge he puts me down to read a few codes of python and I do understand what's happening and he says you good to go. 

Here is me thinking ""hey I do know all the basic stuff but how am I ready to code?"" 

1 week goes off just doing 8 hours meeting, planning, keeping notes of the companies needs and problems. 

Second week is prototyping which we did in Chatgtp..... 

And all I had to do was basically piece together functions and fix smalls bugs..... 

So I do end up asking him like when we will actually code and he tells me this. 

""we don't code from scratch, it's 2025""

Later he told me all I need to know is to understand the code chatgtp gives me, make sure to put custom comments so we know what everything does, make sure the code given by chat gtp is bug free make sure it doesn't mess up our source code, keep a log in a parer sheet/word file/txt so we know what I did and what order to locate possible bugs. 

When I asked why I don't just write the code myself he said

"" everything is on the Internet if not chatgtp you will end up searching something online to understand how to do it and most likely get the code from someone who knows or already solved that issue , so you just skip that and get it from chatgtp. If there is something we need more custom and from scratch I will be doing that as senior and guess what! , I will be using an ai code assistant to save time. ""

I do understand that we don't ask an ai for the whole program and I do see that we do actually make it step by step and very carefully and that there is actually a human touch to all that but... 

Is that all we gonna do as programmers? Read existing code and puzzle functions together? And then fix bugs?

    In short, would it be a good investment considering that I am studying a separate career or is it very demanding to learn and practice it, in how much time?

I'm ""reverse engineering"" **my game** that is made with unreal engine 4. I'm injecting my DLL into the game process and hooking some functions. However, some of those functions are UE4 functions that I'd like to call manually but they take in some UE4 objects that I don't have access to. I know I could just define them myself, but that's just too much work. I also tried using UE4 from source but it expects a lot of stuff and I'm just not sure how to get it working.

So I'm here looking for a way to statically link the UE4 core lib (the one that has the containers e.g FString, TArray). I know that I might be able to achieve that by building UE4 myself, but that would just take a REALLY long time and I'd like to keep that as the last resort.

It is written in python for aws lambda and api gateway, little fuzzy on that exact side as I am still sifting through everything.  
Something that we are not doing is contract testing and would like to start doing this. One of the requirements is to ensure the server is responding back to the client with what the openapi spec is saying it needs to be returning to the client.

I have found a few tools that almost accomplish this, prism that creates a mock server from an openapi spec and schemathesis which uses an openapi spec against a ""real"" api server to ensure validation is returned correctly. Though a lot of the tools I have found seem to be tailored for code-driven development.

Is there a good way of attempting this contract that I have not been able to find? From my research it seems like it should not be needed since the spec says what the client should send/receive and what the server should receive/send.

Ideally everything would be automated, so we wouldnt need to create direct tests persay, just does the contract match each other. With prism and schemathesis, we could just run a local automation it would utilize each other to do the testing.

Everyone was like proud and happy for me, and I was confident too. I got really decent grades and have a few projects and some scholarships under my belt. I then practiced leetcode and read some stuff like everyone says. Then the day came and I failed so hard to the point where I just didn't know how to feel. The questions were not hard, it was some greedy problems for string, but I fumbled like horribly. My hands and voice were shaky, my code didn't even work for some edge cases and I couldn't explain some complexities questions. Seeing the dude being visibly annoyed made me feel even worse.

I'd always been confident in my abilities but now I just feel like a fraud. All those grades and confidence went down the drain, and I didn't even have the balls to tell my family and friends how I did. Landing this job would be game-changing, but somehow I had to mess it up. I don't know how to feel about this and wanted to share this somewhere.

learnprogramming,Which tutorials include the best 'real-world' examples of code,"So many tutorials use unrealistic examples for explaining code, which makes it difficult to understand when to use certain concepts.

For example, google the use Javascript's .call method and you get a bunch of examples about how to pass one object to another so you can use it's properties.  Which seems a weird way programming to me, because if I needed a property on an object I would add it to that object, not borrow it from another.

Another of example of this, is testing tutorials, which nearly always explain unit testing by showing how to evaluate if two numbers, usually both less than 10, sum together correctly!!!

Are there tutorials that are based on real code, or show examples from realistic situations if you would encounter on a development team?",Various_Ad5600,1gxp2vy,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gxp2vy/which_tutorials_include_the_best_realworld/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gxp2vy/which_tutorials_include_the_best_realworld/,2024-11-23 02:19:27,9,0.72,9,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gxp2vy

learnprogramming,Coding Certification,"Hello! I am a business student at an American university, and I am currently trying to get a finance internship. The more places I apply to the more I see that coding skills are either required or highly encouraged. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a reliable website where I could take a brief introductory course to some form of coding (maybe python or SQL?), and earn a certification that I could use for job applications and place on my resume. I see a lot of websites that are locking certifications and courses behind paywalls, and wanted to see if there is a site that the general public approves of that could help me out. Any advice is very much appreciated!!

learnprogramming,How to wrap my head around this code,"I know what this code does, but I don't know how it does it.  Can someone ELI5.

     &lt;script&gt;
     function once(fn) {
            return function (event) {
                if (fn) fn.call(this, event);

        }  
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;button onclick={once(preventDefault(clickHandler))}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;



I don't understand why it runs once only, I can see that fn is being replaced with null when it is clicked the first time, 

but why when it is clicked a second time isn't fn just replaced with another instance of preventDefault",Various_Ad5600,1gxn53q,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gxn53q/how_to_wrap_my_head_around_this_code/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gxn53q/how_to_wrap_my_head_around_this_code/,2024-11-23 00:42:04,11,0.73,11,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gxn53q
