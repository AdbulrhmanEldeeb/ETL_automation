books,Is this true?,"I read today that ""The UK is the world's bookiest nation (no other country published as many books per capita). And I thought this might spark an interesting debate: which nations are the most literary? And how would we define the criteria?

I've come up with the following as a starter for ten:

Books published per capita
Number of libraries per capita
The state of the newspaper industry
Literary traditions
Number of books

What countries would you nominate and why?  And what criteria do you use when making your nomination?

books,No more TBR?,"This year was the first year I really dove into book spaces online, and while I have always had a long TBR, I never had the sheer volume of suggestions coming at me as I have this year. I also did not have access to a public library until a couple of years ago and had limited money, so my reading was very limited to what I could actually buy on Kindle or the occasional bookstore trip. 

I was excited for a while to get into online book spaces and have access to more books through the library and a decent income, but I quickly became overwhelmed, and I'm thinking of scrapping the idea of a TBR altogether. There are still ""hidden gems"" I come across and think to note for later, but putting them on my TBR feels like a committment that just haunts me until I read them. However, navigating the world of books without a TBR feels daunting, despite doing it for most of my life and having a great time. I'm also much more plugged in to popular books and ""must reads"" than ever before, so I feel the need to read those, too. 

Have you ever scrapped your TBR altogether? How does it feel? Do you keep track of interesting books or just feel they'll come back to you if/when the time is right? There's about a million books that interest me and no time to read them...",sargassum624,1hbp3q8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbp3q8/no_more_tbr/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbp3q8/no_more_tbr/,2024-12-11 08:34:21,0,0.39,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbp3q8
books,Should I Have Been Allowed to Read That?,"What was the most inappropriate thing you had read by the time you were 15 or 16? Some things I had read by that age include the following: 

- Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) 

- Flowers in the Attic

- Interview with a Vampire (which my science teacher asked to borrow after I was done?)

- Almost everything Stephen King had written up through 1987

- The Happy Hooker 

(It doesn't fit in with scandalous list above, but I was also obsessed with Erma Bombeck starting around age 11 or 12. I desperately wanted to be seen as the world-wearied housewife and mother of two that I, a pre-teen boy, apparently so identified with.)

So, tell me what yours are: 

Do you remember what it felt like reading the book? 

Did you feel like you were getting away with anything? 

Did you feel as if you had to keep this reading secret? 

Or were you reading this stuff openly? 

Do you get the sense that your parents also maybe had a list of books they had access to at too young an age? (If so, I'd love to hear what those are, too.)

books,"Why is Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's The Prince, seen as controversial?","I read a poor translation of it 16 years ago, while in high school, and basically took nothing away from it. 

I recently bought a new copy, with a different translation, and reread it with a more adult perspective, and I'm both more and less confused than ever.

Less confused, because as a lover of history, I understand that Machiavelli was ""subtly"" throwing shade at quite a few people in Italy's ruling class, but more confused because there's nothing in there that should be deemed controversial by modern readers.

Aside from actual military advice, like the relevance of fortress cities like Pistoia, the stockpiling of military equipment, and supplies, the rest of the book is very basic in its advice.

* Treat your friends graciously, pay special attention to allies who may become enemies, and ensure you keep them on your good side. 

* Be good to your people. 

* Try to be charismatic. 

* Know the value of those around you, and leverage it. 

* Don't be a dick for no reason. 

* Don't let people walk over you. 

* ""Speak softly but carry a big stick"" (be a good diplomat, but be ready to go to war if you need to).

* If you need to deal with opposition, make sure it's dealt with decisively so they don't harbour resentment and come back later to try and harm you again.

Basically, the majority of the book is either advice your parents should have given you in high school, or advice you learn watching children's cartoons. I mean there's literally a part in there about being crafty like a fox, and strong as a lion... you could put that into a child's storybook, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone did. 

Maybe this translation isn't very good as well, but nothing in it seems particularly ""Machiavellian"" despite the book literally being where we get the word from.",Cilarnen,1hb6sqp,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hb6sqp/why_is_niccol√≤_machiavellis_the_prince_seen_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hb6sqp/why_is_niccol√≤_machiavellis_the_prince_seen_as/,2024-12-10 17:15:51,171,0.82,171,0,129,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hb6sqp

books,Average Books Read Per Year by Country 2024,"As an Italian, I‚Äôve grown accustomed to hearing a common lament: *‚ÄúNo one reads anymore.‚Äù* It's a phrase that echoes through discussions about cultural habits, often paired with reports of dwindling readership statistics. So you can imagine my surprise when I recently stumbled upon a report claiming that Italy ranks fifth in the world for readership. Naturally, this raised a mix of curiosity and skepticism‚Äîcan such a claim be trusted, or is it an anomaly amidst the usual narrative? While I remain cautious about the source, it did prompt me to reflect on the broader landscape of reading habits.

I‚Äôd love to hear from you: in your country, do you also sense a decline in readership, or perhaps a shift in the way people engage with books? Is there a growing preference for digital formats, or are traditional books still holding their ground? I find this topic fascinating, especially since it speaks not only to our personal habits but to the cultural and educational priorities of our societies. What‚Äôs your perception?
