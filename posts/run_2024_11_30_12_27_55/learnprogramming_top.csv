learnprogramming,Transitioning from high level languages to low level languages,"hello everyone,

i am a young guy and i will be joining college next year for a 4 year CS course however i want to self-learn programming. i learnt javascript back in 2019, what i used to do was read and analyze other people's source codes on github, read the documentation, stackoverflow (project based learning) i used to build discord bots then websites in reac then vue then nextjs then transitioned to web frameworks and backend like nestjs,express,hono. similarly i learnt golang in 2020 however i do not know the concepts of javascript / go, i don't know what's global execution context, i don't know what's the different between a map or a set i have to refer to the MDN docs/ go docs everytime but if someone tells me to write some code to do this task, etc i'll be able to do that (after reading some source codes if they exist and docs). i also know little bit of devops since i used to deploy some APIs and server-side projects over at aws ec2 / vercel / netlify / cloudflare workers and pages.

i want to learn cs from the absolute basics (semi conductors) and i was suggested patt and patel, however that book does not go much into compilers before clang, should i learn about compilers before C? after learning C i would most probably get into C++ then AI/ML but i want to do backend as well. i would also want to do data structures and algorithms because i have felt the need for it while writing efficient code (i was writing a routing library and felt the need of data structures for trie routers and other hashmap routers etc). please suggest me how should i go about it (i would heavily prefer text content over video lectures)",RespondRepulsive7588,1h2s2s8,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2s2s8/transitioning_from_high_level_languages_to_low/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2s2s8/transitioning_from_high_level_languages_to_low/,2024-11-29 18:18:28,7,0.77,7,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Learning,,t3_1h2s2s8

learnprogramming,Making a stopwatch - x16,"So im working on a board and trying to make a reaction speed test. 

Board im working with has a RTC (Real time clock) From that i can use seconds,hours,minutes.

On the other hand, the board has a free running clock-16-bit 1Mhz. 

My approach currently is that im counting clock cycles. That is done by comparing the value of the current clock (free) and the value of the clock when first called. 
If it is equal then a cycle has completed, CountCycle++ . If it is less than then an overflow occured and clock wrapped back to 0 so CountCycle++.

then i convert CountCycle to  ms by dividing the number of clock cycles by 45 (Rough math was fried at this point). 

Was debugging the code and the answers (in ms) were not realistic at all. Is the math wrong? Or is my way of counting cycles wrong? Personally i feel it is the latter and i am skipping clock cycles while checking if the button is pressed. If so what suggestions do you have.

learnprogramming,Need Help Choosing a Framework for Modern-Looking Windows Desktop Apps,"Hi everyone!

I need help choosing the right framework for my needs. Iâ€™m a new solo developer (previously a hobbyist but recently started doing this full-time). Some of my clients need desktop apps for Windows. My clients are non-technical, but they occasionally want to tweak the code, so having a Python backend is ideal.

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m looking for:

* Apps that look native and modern.
* A simple way to turn Figma designs into functional UI components (I use Figma for design).



So far, Iâ€™ve explored:

1. **PyQT and Qt Designer**: Couldnâ€™t find a good integration with Figma.
2. **Qt Design Studio**: Has a Figma Bridge and recently began supporting Python for the backend, which feels like a dream come true, but itâ€™s locked behind a pricey enterprise license ($2k+/year).
3. **Tkinter**: While there are some libraries and GitHub repos for Figma integration, the generated UI doesnâ€™t look good.
4. **Reflex (formerly Pynecone)**: Couldnâ€™t get the Figma integration to work.

After that, I started considering non-Python options but got overwhelmed:

* **WPF and WinUI**: Iâ€™m unfamiliar with XAML, and it doesnâ€™t seem to integrate well with Figma (I might be wrong, but I couldnâ€™t get it to work). I found some repos that support a Python backend, but I didnâ€™t dive deeper.
* **Electron/Tauri**: I have no experience with web-based technologies, but if this is the state-of-the-art for Windows apps, Iâ€™m willing to learn.

Since I have some game dev experience, I even testedÂ **Unity**Â for creating UIs and Windows desktop apps. Unity has some great Figma bridges, and it sort of worked, but using it for desktop apps feels overkill.

At this point, Iâ€™m completely lost. Iâ€™d prefer a solution with a Python backend, but Iâ€™m open to other options if needed. What frameworks would you recommend for creating Windows desktop apps?",External_Leek_2720,1h2qg0u,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2qg0u/need_help_choosing_a_framework_for_modernlooking/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h2qg0u/need_help_choosing_a_framework_for_modernlooking/,2024-11-29 17:07:59,2,0.76,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h2qg0u

I keep on getting like 3 numbers correctly, and then find the only possible solutions for the other 3 incorrect, so I am at a loss.

I know there has to be 6 numbers, with the range of 1-6, and there can't be any repeats.

The answer should be 3 1 6 2 5 4, but it not correctly

This is the use case for my knn algorithm. Also graphql is implemented too.

learnprogramming,Correcting aspect ratio in a shader (HLSL)?,"Hi. I wanted to write a shader to correct aspect ratio in a game i'm playing, and i'm running into some problems. Now, i'm not really familiar with graphics programming and shaders at all beyond some very handwavy idea of how they work, but i thought the task was trivial enough to trial and error my way through it. Apparently not!

So, the code for the shader looks like this:

    sampler s0;
    // Variables that set the width and height of the current game resolution from sfall
    float w;
    float h;
    float2 rcpres; // pixel size
    
    static const float2 gameRes = float2(640.0, 480.0);
    static const float2 windowRes = float2(1920.0, 1080.0);
    static const float2 scaledRes = float2(gameRes.x * windowRes.y/gameRes.y, windowRes.y);
    static const float2 border = ( (windowRes - scaledRes)/windowRes ) / 2.0;
    static const float2 ratio = windowRes/scaledRes;
    
    float4 test(float2 uv : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0
    {
      float2 uv1 = uv * ratio;
      float4 col = tex2D(s0, uv1);
      return col;
    }
    
    technique TestShader
    {
      Pass P0 { PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 test(); }
    }

And the result i'm getting is [this.](https://i.ibb.co/857cd1y/2024-11-30-134838.png) It looks like i'm losing quite a lot of horizontal resolution, with some of the text letters pretty much merging together. And i'm not sure why, i mean, the resolution i'm scaling to is still over 2x the internal resolution. 

I thought that a pixel shader is executed for every pixel of a rendered surface, which, in this case, would be the entire window. I take in coordinates of the pixel, i do some transformations on them, and then i use those coordinates to sample from the base image that the game is outputting. But then i don't see how would i end up skipping over so many of the pixels in the base image.

Can someone explain this to me, or point me to some relatively simple overview for dummies? Cause i definitely don't feel like taking an entire course just for this.

learnprogramming,Learning while on a 8 to 4 job with no access to pc ,"Good morning/afternoon, wherever you are I hope you are having a good day.

To give you guys context, I'm a recent cs graduat, I didn't do much projects during my time in college (that's on me ) and now I have to pay the bills, I'm working as a low current technician for now, and I really want to get back to coding.

My question is, how do you guys learn effectively and make most of your time that you have , I'm a slow learner to say the truth, now I'm learning JavaScript by reading eloquent js and when I get home I try to do some simple problem solving in order to apply what I learned.

Some of my friends frown upon my style of learning, they always say you need to learn by doing and doing projects, but I always find myself lost trying this way.( They are all working as frontend/backend devs) 

Btw guys, I really love web development, and I really want to be good at it, it's a shame I started learning now after graduation, but I think it's better now than later.",abdelfor3,1h39g9a,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h39g9a/learning_while_on_a_8_to_4_job_with_no_access_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h39g9a/learning_while_on_a_8_to_4_job_with_no_access_to/,2024-11-30 09:59:37,1,1.0,1,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h39g9a
learnprogramming,Pattern that only let's you create a valid object,"Quite a while ago I implemented a pattern that only let you create valid objects. But I've completely forgotten how I did it (a colleague told me how) and my search was unsuccessful. Maybe someone knows what I'm talking about?

What I mean is this: let's say you have a class that represents an IBAN, which has two check digits in it, and you only want objects to exist where the IBAN they represent has correct check digits.

The only thing I've found would be something like this, but I think I did it **without an exception** back then:

    class IBAN {
      ...
      public IBAN(string IBAN) {
        if(!this.validate(IBAN)) {
          throw new ArgumentException(""Invalid IBAN"");
        }
        ...
      }
      ...
    }

So, is there another way? Would you do it like this?

Thanks in advance!

learnprogramming,Hai ,"Iâ€™m working on a project to create a priority-based voicemail system, and Iâ€™m unsure about how to approach some parts of it. Hereâ€™s what I want the system to do:
	â€¢	Capture voicemails using Twilio.
	â€¢	Convert voicemails into text for further analysis.
	â€¢	Prioritize voicemails based on urgency, emotional tone (from audio and text), and content.
	â€¢	Summarize the text and distribute the voicemails to relevant departments.
	â€¢	Encrypt sensitive data and mask any PII in both the text and audio.

I also plan to use a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for displaying the results.

My main questions are:
	1.	What libraries or models should I use for emotion detection and urgency ranking?
	2.	How can I implement encryption and PII masking effectively for both text and audio?

* I have {`""proxy"": ""http://localhost:3000""}` in my package.json file for both backend and frontend. I wasn't sure which json file the proxy was supposed to be it in so I tried either/both; didn't work.

learnprogramming,Returning different types function (Python),"Hi! I'll go straight to the question:

I'm making a module that allows a bigger project to retrieve information from a source. So there's a common function called by the bigger project that returns a String used by that project. 

  
The thing is that there is ONE case, in which the function should return a list of strings instead of just a string. The project expects that list in that case. It expects a string in any other. Before they were data introduced manually and now I want to automate it.

  
I know I can return different types from the function, and I can make it so the function returns the list only in the case I need. 

  
My question is more like, is that good practice if I note it down? I feel like I'm overthinking it but something tells me it was better to ask. 

  
Thanks a lot and if any other info is needed please tell me! Oh! And any good reads on the matter are also great, because nothing I've found has helped me much.

Here's a summary of what I've done so far:

1. Signed up for Amazonâ€™sÂ **Product Advertising API**Â and have theÂ **Access Key**Â andÂ **Secret Key**.
2. I've generatedÂ **X-Amz-Date**Â (e.g.,Â `20241128T145207Z`) and theÂ **Authorization**Â header using Python and HMAC SHA256.
3. Tried sending the request usingÂ **Postman**Â andÂ **Zapier**, but I get the error:Â `""Error: InternalFailure""`.
4. Iâ€™m also using aÂ **valid PartnerTag**Â for my affiliate account but still facing issues.
5. Ensured theÂ **X-Amz-Date**Â andÂ **Authorization**Â headers are dynamically generated (not hardcoded)
6. Double-checked the endpoint URL (`https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/getitems`).

The exact error message I receive from Postman is:  
**400 Bad Request**, and in the response:  
**""Output"": {""\_\_type"": ""com.amazon.coral.service#InternalFailure""}**

learnprogramming,how do i know what data size a value is?,"i may be going backwards, because i started with js, learned a little c# and then i just started c++. (i know you shouldnt jump around so much, but im trying to find one i like before i stick to one. 

my biggest struggle is with data sizes and variable types. i went from just putting everything in const and let and now i need to look at more than just scope..

my understanding is this

8-bit is 1 char and the number 225 and under

16-bit short integers. (how short? like 226?)

32-bit larger integers and file sizes

64-bit much larger integers precise floats and pointers
