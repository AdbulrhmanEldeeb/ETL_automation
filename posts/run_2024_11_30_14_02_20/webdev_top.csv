webdev,New company has clients point by nameserver instead of A record? There has to be a better way.,"Hey everyone, I recently started working at a website development company and ran into something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Here‚Äôs the situation:

When we build a website for a client, we ask them to point their domain to our **nameservers** so the website can go live. This means we end up managing their entire DNS, even though we‚Äôre just the website provider. It's an extra burden, especially when clients request changes for things like email or subdomains.

I asked why we don‚Äôt just have clients point their domain to our server using an **A record**, and here‚Äôs the explanation I got:

‚ÄúIf we ever need to change our server‚Äôs IP address (which has happened a couple of times), all clients would need to update their A record to the new IP. That‚Äôs impractical with thousands of clients. Nameservers avoid this issue because we can make IP changes behind the scenes without involving the client.‚Äù

Okay, that makes sense, but using nameservers feels inefficient for so many other reasons... I feel like there has to be a better way to solve this problem without the extra workload.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts considering my role at the company isn't as technical but this workflow is hugely affecting my output and I want to offer them a better solution. What‚Äôs the most practical way to minimize client disruption while reducing our DNS management responsibilities?",ZeusBabylonski,1h2oz0r,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2oz0r/new_company_has_clients_point_by_nameserver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2oz0r/new_company_has_clients_point_by_nameserver/,2024-11-29 16:02:56,23,0.79,23,0,33,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2oz0r

webdev,Trying to break out of the field while simultaneously unemployed. Advise?,"I am a senior web dev (NodeJS, RoR) that has recently lost their job unexpectedly for the first time in forever. I live in the EU, in a country that does not have a lot of jobs, and what little can be found has a lot of competition, is underpaid, and you get worked to the bone. Up until this point I was working fully remote for other EU companies and was starting to make a decent living as an EM. When I lost my job I tried to keep that momentum going, but long story short, it's quite difficult and there is higher need for developers than there is for other roles.

I used my unemployment time to pick up Python which turned out great, successfully acing two different coding challenges and reaching the next stage in the pipeline. However, it seems that growing into Python further would involve delving into pretty specific and uninteresting libraries (django, or numpy or pandas).

Context over, now to the matter at hand. I am quite tired of web dev. It's why I ventured into Python in the first place. With time on my hands, I have it in me to pick up another language. To spare you the details, I believe these are the two avenues that might make sense:

\- Refresh in-demand, web only languages. This obviously snuffs out what little soul I have left. Refresh PHP. Or refresh NodeJS/TypeScript. Much better than PHP, but still quite boring. There are a lot of PHP, NodeJS, RoR jobs, but there are also a lot of candidates.

\- Try my hand at C#. Interesting, can think of very enticing projects! I am confident I could pick it up. Potentially moves me away from web dev. But my CV has no single a single speck of C#, so I would not be looked as a solid candidate.

webdev,New technology in prod fears,"I'm wondering if anyone else has fears of trying new tech in prod. I'm not just talking about trying out a new library. I'm talking about standing up stuff that you've never really used in prod before.

I feel like I can play around with new tech locally but I always fear that there must be some prod specific stuff that I'm missing. Extra load revealing issues, incorrect assumptions made, config stuff that I'm expected to know but don't, etc. I tend to use stuff I'm familiar with just because there are some bugs that have been really hard to figure out. Managers have asked before *how* a bug could ***possibly*** be introduced, and the thought of saying, ""eh, this is just my first time using it and I'm learning"" sounds like a good way to get on someone's shitty developer list. Most managers that I've had seem to think that any bug is just completely unacceptable, so the thought of admitting to incompetence or ignorance seems like out of the question.

Do most of you just stick with shit you know, or do you take the plunge if you think something might be better? Or go with something new that might work just as well but also save some paint points from existing tech? I'm not talking about going with new stuff just because it's new.

  
**Example**

I used to work at a place with multiple applications. I was talking to someone on another team in the enterprise one day about their architecture. This team literally didn't use a load balancer to load balance between different servers. They literally made separate URLs for the internal team to use. If one server went down, they would launch up the other and tell the internal customers to go the other URL. Load balancing is SO basic and it used to strike me as extremely weird that they wouldn't just add that in. I can imagine that it might be really scary for them though because of how critical the app was, and you could really screw up production if you messed up your session management setup. You might set up the load balancer and show that you're hitting the servers and that the website is working well, and then totally not do anything about session management. It hits production and then it's a disaster! Ok - you see errors and then you just shut down the other servers and you're pretty much back where you started. Not the end of the world but hopefully you see my point.",wannacommissionameme,1h35jrd,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,2024-11-30 05:28:34,3,0.62,3,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h35jrd

webdev,Common data fetching in a layout and a page in ReactJS,"I have been thinking about data fetching of front end. Suppose you have

\- Layout: it resource A to render a sidebar

\- Page: it is in the layout. It needs resource A and B

Resource is stored globally in an app (with whatever, Redux or Context). Resource A may be fetched again on a user event like when \`userId\` changes.  
Page A should not know what layout fetches, vice versa. They should care only data they need.

How is it possible to fetch resource A only once?

If you put this \`useEffect\` in a layout and a page, it fetches when \`userId\` changes. A problem is that they may race in a layout and a page. They may run simultaneously.

\`\`\`  
useEffect(() =&gt; {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}, \[dispatch, userId\]);

\`\`\`

Putting another \`useEffect \` does not seem to solve a problem. You will not know when \`useEffect\` runs, no matter it is in a layout or in a page. If only a page waits until layout finishes loading, it would work, but it does not.

\`\`\`

useEffect(() =&gt; {

if (resourceAStatus === 'idle') {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}

}, \[dispatch, resourceAStatus \]);

\`\`\`

One simple way is ""Fetch data in layout, not in page at all"", but it is not a good practice. You should fetch data when you need it.

webdev,Issue with vertically centered content shifting on wrap,"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm stuck and was hoping someone could help. Essentially, I have a splash/landing page with a logo. The logo is an SVG, it's vertically and horizontally centered. That all works great.

I have a little JavaScript that types in a byline type description under it. It's short. But on mobile screens, it wraps to the next line, which is fine. Only issue is that when it wraps, the element (H1) then shifts the logo above it upwards so the image, and now two lines of text are all vertically centered.

I'd like the text to just go downwards when wrapping without pushing the group of the content upwards.

Here's what I have currently. We're using Bootstrap 5.

Edit: I can see that putting the JS inside the section groups it with the logo to be centered, but we've tried it outside as well and same.

    &lt;section id=""landing"" class=""landing bg-light d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center vh-100""&gt;

    &lt;/section&gt;

    .landing .landing-logo {
    ¬† width: clamp(300px, 50%, 916px);

webdev,CMS or VPS,"Hello everyone! 

2 years ago I made a small website for a charity, they told me it would need to be a static site which would \*not\* change over time. Well, so far there's been plenty of changes which also contain temporary changes (like an event).

Currently I have written a custom, ugly and bad static site generator, but it works in this case. The demand for changes has grown (still not a lot), and there's a request to move some of those responsibilities towards them, so they can maintain some of the content.

So far I've been looking into some CMS systems, and I haven't found a single one that I like. None of them offer the structure that I need/want for something small, or come off as having a snake in the grass on the free tier.

I've looked into Supabase as well, which I think I'd like, but it pauses your project quite fast, and freezes it after 90 days of inactivity. This doesn't suit me at all since it'll probably only be around 2-3 times a year they'll need to update their content. So the project would become frozen every time on the free tier.

I've also looked into Firebase, which looks like something I'd like to learn, but it doesn't offer image hosting on the free tier. And the Blaze plan looks good on paper, but I'm really afraid of having bots/abuse ramp up the requests/usage costs.

I've also looked at (not in detail yet) VPS. This is something that I'd love to learn, since I'll get full control over everything. My main issue with most systems is the control being limited. The main drawback here is, I'm terrified of unauthorized access, leaks, hidden costs, file uploads being abused and wrecking havoc... basically, a LOT of variables I'm not familiar with that could go wrong, I think... is a VPS really a safe option? What are some decent (and okay-ishly priced) VPS options?

Would you change the client? To a fork or consider to change completely?

webdev,"Is front end development dying [NOT duplicate, serious topic]","I'm sure there are lots of more exprienced developers out there, since I was professionally in the industry for 3 years now and I was working freelance before but things have gone much worse from my perspective. 

I'm not going to start AI will make us homeless stuff, but the way is front end viewed is the problem.

I think it is a nail in the coffin for this field. imagine this. so, we have backend colleagues. they are getting paid more than us and more important than that, they have PRESTIGE. 

even if they write a simple SELECT query, the employer and others think that it is a rocket science or something, but for a front end developers... "" it is just a simple button bro "". 

it almost took me 2 months to optimize the prescription section of our medical web app. we've had heavy lists and extremely dynamic forms and technical challenges.. but we've done something extremely good. 

and now after 2 months the only thing I heard from my boss was "" this was the least you can do, it is just a simple button "" 

and I don't blame him to be fair. this is what most of the industry thinks. 

  
I feel like the blue collar part of the developer society. you took the most effort, get paid less and no one values your job. 

and even worse than that, compared to Java or C# (Scala or .NET Core), front end is just a shit party! no rules, no strong foundation and god forbid for example if Vercel rolls out a new update and changes the whole structure of the framework! 

on the other hand, from my personal experience, I really enjoy reading .NET core documents. everything is very well structured and you don't have to give blow job  for AI or Stackoverflow developers to get your answer.

just a great Microsoft community. 

  
so, my question is... is it worth it? really after 3 years and couple years of freelance, I just started to regret my choice. 

it was like that in 2016 let's say...
