math,"Justin Clarke-Doane | Mathematics, Reality, and Morality | The Cartesian Cafe with Timothy Nguyen","Justin Clarke-Doane is a professor of philosophy at Columbia University, whose interests span metaethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of logic &amp; mathematics.   
  
In this thought provoking-discussion, Justin and I go deep into topics that are typically neglected by most mathematicians and scientists, namely the philosophy of mathematics and morality. Justin has contributed to both these areas via his book Morality and Mathematics, which takes the view that the standard position of being both a mathematical realist and moral antirealist is incoherent. Perhaps the most novel aspect of Justin's work is the treatment of the philosophy of mathematics and morality side-by-side, showing how these two topics, which are usually thought of as being unrelated, in fact have strong analogies. Along the way, we discuss many other foundational topics in epistemology and ethics, with elements of set theory, metaphysics, and logic sprinkled in.

math,Math became my unexpected escape from life,"I’ve always been fascinated by math, even as a kid in elementary school. Back then, I thought I liked it simply because I was good at it. I never really considered math as something I’d study seriously in university or as a particularly “useful” pursuit—it was just there.

Long story short, I ended up pursuing the path to medicine. But I often found myself struggling with mental blocks in life. Problems or worries would get stuck in my mind, and I couldn’t seem to shake them off.

Then came linear algebra. I took it as an elective, and it was my first real exposure to proof-based math. Honestly, I struggled with the proofs a lot, but something unexpected happened. After the course ended, I realized how much happier I was during that semester. Math had completely occupied my mind—there wasn’t room for other worries to creep in. That struggle, that focus, made my brain feel calmer.

Now, I’ve decided to make math my “side quest” alongside medicine, and I feel incredibly satisfied about it. These days, I carry an abstract math book with me almost everywhere. Whenever I feel down or overwhelmed, I’ll open it, read a few pages, and immerse myself in it. It’s like a reset button for my mind.

Currently, I’m enjoying a book on Galois Theory, and it’s been amazing  so far. I just wanted to share this experience and see if anyone else can relate. Do you also find joy in math as a way to calm your mind and bring clarity to your life?

math,"People who do research in math, did you occasionally feel like the results you discover are embarassingly trivial?","I hope the title manages to adress the question I am asking. So I am currently working on some stuff in low dimensional topology, more precisely I try to characterise a specific set of simple closed curves on surfaces by using homological considerations that are eventually needed for proving the main theorem of my work.  
  
Without getting too much into details, I am studying the behaviour of certain loops on  surfaces and I just recently finally managed to pin it down and give a full characterisation of these elements I was trying to understand for quite some time. First I witnessed some patterns by doing a bit of combinatorial considerations and once I understood what happens, I started proving what I had witnessed. The following day I noticed that everything I proved essentially comes down to basic linear algebra and now my proof is literally a few lines of nothing than very elementary linear algebra. 

To be fair, it is not entirely obvious at first glance.  The result itself is still novel in the sense that it helps me eventually prove a much more significant statement but still, once I found the proof, it felt utterly trivial all of a sudden.

I will of course discuss my results with my supervisor who can immediately tell whether or not my results are useful, but am still interested in hearing some of your experiences. Have you ever had a similar experience or feeling?

math,Converting Elliptic Curve real coordinates to finite coordinates.,"So basically I don't understand how my point specified here in the picture can be converted to a finite field.

I understand that the more big the finite field modulus is and the more precise the ""quantization"" will be, so that point will probably never exist in the majority of finite fields, even the ones with very big modulus.

Let's say I can accept an approximation, how would you convert this point's real coordinates to finite fields coordinates?

math,Question about the Grigorchuk Group,"Hi, I'm currently reading this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607384) about the Grigorchuk Group and there is this proof I don't understand.

Lemma 7.1 says, every element g in G has all of its reduced decompositions of the same type (i), or of type (iv), or of mixed type (ii/iii).

The types are

* (i) a\*a\*...\*a
* (ii) a\*a\*...\*
* (iii) \*a\*...\*a
* (iv) \*a\*...\*

where every \* stands for one of the generators b, c or d.

The proof given in the paper is really short and honestly I don't understand it one bit. It goes like this:

The number of a's in a reduced decomposition of g is even iff. g stabilizes the vertices on the first level^(1). Thus g cannot have decomposition of type (i) and (iv) at the same time. (WHY?) The fact that decompositions of type (i) and (iv) have odd length, while those of type (ii) and (iii) have even length, implies the result.

If someone who is familiar with the Grigorchuck Group could explain this proof to me, that would be great :-)
