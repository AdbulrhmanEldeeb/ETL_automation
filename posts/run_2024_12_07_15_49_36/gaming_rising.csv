gaming,One handed game suggestions? (mouse only),"Hey gamers,

I've broken my left hand (keyboard hand) and I'm looking for some game suggestions to keep me busy whilst I'm off work for a bit.

I've already tried/aware of:
- This War of mine, I liked it and will probably keep playing it
- Civ 6, I will be playing this
- inscryption, already own it and have almost finished it prior to breaking my hand
- slay the spire, played it heaps and over it
- One Finger death punch, wasn't for me


I'm open to buying a mouse with a bunch of extra buttons if I find a game worth it. 

P.S: I know this has been asked before however there haven't been any fairly recent posts, especially ones specifically referring to mouse hand only
