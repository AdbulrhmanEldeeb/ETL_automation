gaming,One handed game suggestions? (mouse only),"Hey gamers,

I've broken my left hand (keyboard hand) and I'm looking for some game suggestions to keep me busy whilst I'm off work for a bit.

I've already tried/aware of:
- This War of mine, I liked it and will probably keep playing it
- Civ 6, I will be playing this
- inscryption, already own it and have almost finished it prior to breaking my hand
- slay the spire, played it heaps and over it
- One Finger death punch, wasn't for me


I'm open to buying a mouse with a bunch of extra buttons if I find a game worth it. 

P.S: I know this has been asked before however there haven't been any fairly recent posts, especially ones specifically referring to mouse hand only

gaming,Bring Back Good Co-Op Games,"Marvel Rivals came out. Was pretty cool for like 15 minutes and then I just felt kinda bored and a little sad. 

I’ve been playing games since the 80s and idk, I’m just tired of PvP stuff. Really missing the cooperative games of old.

I remember stuff like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or Left 4 Dead or Gauntlet Legends or Halo or even Destiny or the arcade beat em ups like X-men or the Simpsons or Turtles game when it first came out and these games were just so epic and fostered such great teamwork and camaraderie. Helluva dope feeling and rush having to work together to win. Especially back in the days of arcades, nothing cooler than actually assembling 4 people dedicated to pulling it off.

Idk. Everything just feels so competitive, battle royale, hero shootery, and it’s just beginning to feel unnecessary and kinda forced and stale.

Maybe I’m just feeling nostalgic and outta touch lol but I feel like bringing these kinds of great co-op games back in a modern sense in actual abundance would really inject some love and positive vibes back into the community while also, bringing in a whole new demographic of gamers looking for something less demanding and stressful than PvP gaming which I feel like is just low key bloating the market at this point.

P.S. this is no dig Marvel Rivals or to gamers that enjoy these games, I’m just getting this off my chest lol sorry it’s late, I’m high, rant over.

lol nope just a husband, father, business owner and student. I’ve been playing games since the 80s. I know major titles and indie games exist guys no offense lol. Mostly all the ones that have been named so far are not new names to me or games I haven’t tried at some point that just didn’t capture my interest.

Edit: Idk why I’m getting downvoted so much lmao are you taking offense to the fact that I just don’t like the games you’re suggesting as much as you or others do or haven’t played them? 

Idk I think I’ve been pretty respectful about the games I have talked about, even the ones I may not care for as well but idk. Either way, I’ve played Indie game guys. I’ve played games like stardew valley (well technically my wife played and I watched) or warhammer (specifically the vermintide one) and that was honestly years ago. Maybe I’m wrong but, those I don’t feel like are recent games (came out this year) and when I did watch/play them, they weren’t my cup of tea. I guess I should have been specific (like when I mentioned Destiny, I meant specifically the first one as I played 2 and did not care for it as much).

I’m almost 40 and a pretty avid gamer blessed to be able to play a PLETHORA of games over the last few years through different means (work, personal life, events), with 2 kids and a wife who are all also gamers either various taste whether that be in console (we have most past and present) or game type. I do not live under a rock, maybe a more a pineapple under the sea and my only burden is the business of life but, I’ve still found time to do my gaming and follow my hobbies (for business/pleasure) so I’m not completely out the loop.

I’ve had some great suggestion here to help solidify the push to try certain titles (maybe the art style has been putting me off or mechanics or story didn’t capture me) that I have been putting off or stayed away from. And I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and even opinions but let’s not trip on each other off of video games. The post was meant to just be light hearted and random, not this deep dive into my personal gaming preferences or an attack on others interest lol. 

From one gamer to another, let’s try to foster more positivity and cohesion so we gamers don’t always have to carry the title of toxic and negative and build a more appealing and inviting community.

Player hit Goblin with a heavy attack inflicting 10 damage

Goblin hit Player with “Fireball” but Player managed to block 5 damage. Etc

I have a group of 2 fellows and the 3 of us like to play games together. We have recently played Divinity Original Sin2, and are wrapping up our 2nd playtrhu in BG3 after a brief stint in Diablo 4 VoH. 

My question is simple: Is there any game out there that will allow me to play with my mates (required) and also help scratch various itches? My itches include RPG elements/good story/PvP (but not JUST PvP), and stretegy. I know that sounds like MMO stuff, but we all played WoW and various other MMOs for years and years and now we are in our late 30s and cannot commit THAT kind of time. 

  
Up next on the roster is Warhammer 40k Roguetrader, which is a lot like BG3 I think - story, strategy, and RPG elements, but misses that one itch to scrath of PvP.

gaming,Choices matter hell...,"I have a very big issue with this type of games.

It's not a rule, but more often than not it completely breaks the game for me.

My problem with those games, is that in most cases you get locked out of part of the content, based on the decisions you made.

In my opinion this is a very poor game design, artificially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs, if you want to see complete content.

As I never do more than one playthrough of any single player game, I feel somewhat robbed of a full experience.

Another complaint that I could log, is that at their launch many of these games are not balanced well enough, meaning if you pick a ""wrong"" side, you might be underpowered, compared to others.

This inherently leads me to not playing them until at least one or two major patches land, or I might skip them completely, if they fall off my radar.

If I am being completely honest, I would also have to blame my OCD, for wanting to see, and do, everything there is in every game I play, and wanting to min-max my character(s) each time.

Anyone else out there, with similar issues?   

Edit: based on early comments, I want to elaborate.

gaming,Marvel Rivals unpopular opinion ,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, I've been waiting since the first play test for the game to release, but between godwaful matchmaking and low-key pretty unbalanced hero's, I think I'd rather play overwatch 

Sure, there's something to be said about running around as spider man punching dudes into the sky and webbing them up, or using Loki's decoys to escape and punish people, but overall the balance on character abilities feels extremely lacking. 

Like why is punishers ultimate so broken, but scarlet witch needs to be within slapping distance to get a kill with it, while having a huge red **SHOOT HERE SIGN** on top of you. Making it early impossible to use even if you get the drop on people.

That's not to me to mention the amount of times Hawkeye has one shot me across the map, or how groots stun ability lasts like 10x as long as Wanda's. 

Just feels like after that many play tests, the balancing should have been in a better spot at launch.

I also understand that there are warnings in the game saying that but those are meant as a precaution towards particularly epileptic people and the brain dance cutscene is a forced watch if you want to progress in the story.

But my initial thoughts are more so about how great of an initial “free to play, GaaS package” this game is starting out as.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs.

Teardown is a game where you can destroy anything and everything. It’s the perfect vandalism/heist game too. But I do not recommend the DLC’s. Most are hit or miss. But there is a modding community that frequently makes new content for others to play.

As for Children of the Sun. It’s a game where you have one single Sniper Rifle bullet, and you must make the bullet change trajectory to kill multiple enemies. 

Think of it like the Sniper Elite games, but it’s also a puzzle as well. You have to find out the best path and use shortcuts to your advantage.

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't buy weapons or armor. Like its predecessors, you also heal out of combat, KOed characters revive after a fight, and in this game, your healers can be revived KOed characters an unlimited number of times during a fight. As a result, a lot of commonly seen RPG items aren't in this game removing a lot you can spend money on.

There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.

None of this makes these games bad, it just feels weird to carry around so much cash and not have a use for it.",Sensitive-Hotel-9871,1h6g2sj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6g2sj/what_game_has_the_biggest_issue_with_money_being/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6g2sj/what_game_has_the_biggest_issue_with_money_being/,2024-12-04 13:32:56,488,0.86,488,0,610,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6g2sj

gaming,Quick review of (almost) all current mini bluetooth controllers!,"Images here: https://imgur.com/a/SZ3VbEy


I love local multiplayer and the easiest way to find people for it is on the go. Lugging around proper full size controllers* would be a chore, and with micro size I can always have even 4 without thinking.

So for starters: my use case is quick plays, 30-90 minutes. Using these regularly for long time would get uncomfortable (and carpal-tunnely I suppose).

The landscape of small controllers is pretty dire to be honest: 8BitDo (for a long time the only option) and rando chinese suppliers.



**8BitDo Lite 2**

It has every button from a classic PS/Xbox layout - including stick click/L3+R3. High quality plastics. Shoulder and trigger button placement is genius and usable. Joystick has a good movement area. Clicks and presses are exquisite. Size is great for the hand, and still light. This is the one controller I could imagine being usable in daily gaming even.

This would be my dream controller. IF it had XInput. Unrelated, but I'm mighty pissed at 8BitDo for not including this with newer models. Yes, these are all aimed for the Switch, but it would have costed next to nothing to add one more mode. Vibration also only works in Switch mode. Yes you can remap with XOutput and the like, but it's a hassle and strangely does not work in every game.

Modes: Switch, Android
Verdict: so close to be perfect, but not reaching it


**8BitDo Zero 2**

My current go-to mini controller. Has XInput. Sadly charges via micro usb (all other are usb-c). No vibration. Buttons feel right. The L/R button is clickable from all directions despite the length, but not really comfortable - which isn't a problem, this size is only used for simple layout games anyway. I wish it would have toggle for modes, there is no visible sign in which it is (toggle is via shortcut combinations).

There is now also a Micro with the same layout as the Q36 below - not ordered becaus missing XInput and I had enough of that after Lite 2)

Modes: Switch, Android, Windows
Verdict: ol' trusty working horse, shows it's age

**LinYuvo Meteor**

Now this is an interesting animal. You can order it for less than half the zero. It has bajillions of color options - I suggest ordering the covered ones, as the LEDs are so bright that you wouldn't want to use them on transparent versions, despite them looking cool as well. It has a circular dpad which I'm neutral about. For some it's easier to hit corners, but it's not as easy as eg. XBox controller's circular one. But it's really clicky, and a bit hard to press, as you can read in the few reviews it has. So dpad is certainly it's biggest drawback. Has vibration. It has a really interesting feature, you can replace keys - dpad with joystick directions and L/R buttons with trigger - without any software, just shortcuts! You can also toggle the light effects and colors, there are quite a few, as gimmick, or turn it off completely (will be remembered).

Verdict: price/features orders of magnitude better than the Zero 2, even Micro. Buttons just don't feel that good, but it's a close call.

**ShanWan Q37**

There exists a version with horizontal and cross (PS and XBox style) joystick placement. You can tell they used CADs from 8BitDo, the inputs have the same appearance - albeit with a very, very cheap plastic. The rounded off body is a bit smaller but thicker and overall harder to hold. But the presses feel ok. There is vibration - both sides even. It has a weird gyro mode in non-switch mode as well where gyro controls the joystick. Can be accidentally triggered and a useless gimmick. But a very welcomed feature is that every single key can be remapped (including this shortcut). It needs a seemingly unrelated mobile app (""GamepadSpace"") - connecting is hacky as you need to enter firmware upload mode - but once done, you are free to customize, even sensitivity, and everything is saved to the controller. This is great, especially since very stupidly in XInput mode the buttons match the switch layout (eg A is B) by default. Until now you would think this is in the endvery ok controller, but you'd be mistaken. Sadly it all falls apart by how incredibly bad quality this controller is. You will get constant disconnects, lag, ghost presses and stuck input. It's just bad, and generic QC issue. I had multiple controllers showing the same sign.

Verdict: It could be the ""good version"" rip-off of 8BitDo, but sadly it's just a mess, and costs the same as 8BitDo.

The same as Q37, just with copying the 8BitDo Micro form and layout - which makes it even more sad that it's bad.

**Keychain controller**

Being available for 8+ years this is more like an afterthought rather than a serious contender, I included it only for fun. But it's by far the smallest you can go! It only has Android and keyboard function. The ""joystick"" is actually moving only on a 2D plane. Very practical and interesting, but a bit hard to move. Buttons are too mushy. But it is useful as a remote, eg. A is mapped to take a photo in Android.

As the title says, I'm not looking for a game with a ""sad story"", but rather an open world game where the world, music, overall atmosphere, and the protagonist just feel drenched in a deep sense of melancholy/sadness. I think a good example of what I'm looking for is Red Dead Redemption 1... despite what happens in the end, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a ""sad story"", but rather a story that gives this overwhelming sense that the world is changing, the old ways are dying, and you are powerless to stop it. Just simply stopping to stand somewhere in the middle of the desert plains, and hearing the haunting music in RDR1 gives this feeling, like the whole game just has this constant, overhanging thick layer of melancholy, no matter where you go.
