devops,Which field has the highest demand in freelancing,"Hello friends,

I am a Node.js backend developer with 2 years of experience. I want to start freelancing, but I have no idea how to begin. Based on a friend's suggestion, I created an account on Fiverr and made a simple gig.

My question is: which field has the highest demand in freelancing? I mean fields like frontend, backend development, WordPress, DevOps, data pipelines, data engineering, etc. I want to learn as many skills as possible so that I can set up my own business and avoid working as an employee for a company.

Over the past few months, I have met many people and attended several interviews, some of which were not even related to my field. For example, I gave a data engineering interview where I built an ETL data pipeline using Node.js, Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, and Postgres. I also interacted with companies that develop gambling websites, games, and even crack software to steal user data or bypass paid APIs for WhatsApp and Meta applications.

After working for 2 years, I have realized that most IT companies have middlemen who take a significant cut of the revenue, leaving employees with very little. I want to do something of my own.

I have a few friends who are frontend developers, full-stack developers, and UI/UX designers.

If you have any advice, please share it with me. I’d like to know what strategies I should use, which platforms I should focus on, etc.

I am not interested in frontend development, and I’m not good at designing UIs. I prefer backend development and want to explore more opportunities in server-side technologies. Should I explore fields like DevOps or data engineering?

Thank you.

devops,Rant DevOps and SRE Part 2,"When my colleagues and I joined a multinational corp a few years ago, one of the first hurdles we faced was figuring out how to access their internal network to contribute to the codebase. Installing a VPN on our personal devices wasn’t an option, so we were given two choices: get corporate-issued laptops with a pre-installed VPN or use virtual machines inside their network that we could access remotely from our own devices.  
Since the issued laptops all ran Windows and none of us were exactly fans of it, we opted for the VM option. Personally, I wanted to stick with Linux and avoid the nightmare of juggling two work laptops, especially since I already needed one for other customers.

The company set us up with Citrix Workspace to access the VMs, and honestly, it worked like a dream. The connection was stable, latency was low, and we had great quality-of-life features like multi-monitor support, a bilateral clipboard between the VM and host OS, and even seamless keyboard shortcuts inside the VM. For two years, it was smooth sailing.

The connection was stable, latency was low, and we had great quality-of-life features like multi-monitor support, a bilateral clipboard between the VM and host OS, and even seamless keyboard shortcuts inside the VM. For two years, it was smooth sailing.  
Then came the bombshell: the company announced they were shutting down the Citrix infrastructure and moving to Microsoft Remote Desktop. At first, we thought it wouldn’t be a big deal. But then we realized that while RDP has native clients for Windows and Mac, it offers nothing official for Linux.  
Then came the bombshell: the company announced they were shutting down the Citrix infrastructure and moving to RDP. At first, we thought it wouldn’t be a big deal. But then we learned that we actually had to use not just any RDP client (like the Ubuntu-native Remmina), but the Microsoft Remote Desktop app, which leverages the native RDP client on Windows and Mac that isn't present on Linux.  
This is where things started to fall apart. My colleague on Mac was able to install the RDP client and connect without much trouble. I decided to dual-boot Windows so I could keep using multi-monitor setups, even though it added an annoying layer of inefficiency to my workflow. But our third teammate, who stayed on Linux, was stuck with the RDP web client. That thing is a nightmare—slow, clunky, and missing basic features like multi-monitor support.

The overall experience has been a huge downgrade. RDP connections aren’t as stable as Citrix, and most of the little conveniences we’d taken for granted are gone.

Even the keyboard shortcuts and bilateral clipboard, which are supported by the app, have been forcibly disabled. Personally, I’m managing to limp along with my dual-boot setup, but I can’t imagine how much worse it must be for my Linux-only colleague.  
For some of the developers on our team, there’s a workaround: they write code on their local machines, upload it to the VM, and commit from there. But as an SRE, I don’t have that luxury. My work revolves around managing CI/CD pipelines and deployments, which means I have to do everything inside the VM.

devops,How are you doing serverless development?,"This is turning into a bigger issue. Trying to keep this short and concise but I want to describe the problem as completely as I can.

We're in AWS. Most of our app is serverless. While it is possible to run some stuff locally against deployed microservices we are starting to run into more scenarios where we need to deploy code and infrastructure to a serverless setting to be able to develop (test) anything.

We have the following setup:
1) 3 environments - production, staging, development
2) Theoretically development is _supposed_ to happen in the development environment. But of course to save time and money it doesn't happen that way. There are whole feaures unavilable in that environment so a lot of times we are developing in the staging environment.
3) PRs are required to get into staging and production but not for development. The idea of the develop environment/branch was that it was a shared feature branch since we also lack the ability to deploy feature branches to a serverless envirment. This is tough because we all have to share the environments.

The above setup ultimately leads to the following problems:
1) Rapid fire commits. Broken builds and failed deployments aren't as big of an issue here. We're having to push out small change after small change because we don't have the ability to test a lot of our work locally. (we lack local instances of dynamo, queues, topics, lambdas, etc). On some level locally we can run against deployed services. This only gets us so far.
2) I am constatly waiting around for PR approvals into staging when working on features that aren't available in production. Like completely wasting my time waiting. Actually I wrote this post up while waiting for a PR. This is one of those scenarios where we think we saved time by not setting up the proper infrastructure in the lower environment but now everyone is waiting half a day for their 2 line null reference PR approved to deploy to staging.
3) With the rapid fire commits we have single stories spread out of probably 20 commits on avergae. So it is literally impossible to have a 1-1 mapping of story -&gt; commit. This makes something like hotfixing much more difficult.
4) whole features aren't being reviewed like they should. With spreading the commits out because of the development experience whenever someone is presented with a PR they are only looking at a small piece of the story.

Using a current project as an example: we're building several state machines in AWS. These are super useful and they work well. But its impossible to work on these without having to push code to get it tested. The infrastructure is closely tied to the code too, so its not like I can build something to fake the invocation that is going to be sufficient.

I've heard about localstack and I would imagine that's the perfect solution but of course our management wont' consider it because of cost.

Any other ideas? Branching strategies? Am I missing something obvious?

Additionally, productivity studies reveal that teams using AI tools reduce development timelines by up to 30%
