devops,What's makes a hard problem to solve ? ,"Setting up a high-availability cluster with load balancing might seem like a tough challenge for some, but for a DevOps engineer who works with Kubernetes daily, it might not be that difficult.

Recently, I came across a post where someone claimed to monitor developer productivity by counting commits and merges. Unsurprisingly, this approach wasn’t well-received by the developer community on LinkedIn. Most responses were along the lines of, ""Some developers solve hard problems, while others just color-code buttons.""

It got me thinking: what actually makes a problem ""hard""? How do we determine whether a problem is genuinely difficult? Can problem difficulty be categorized or measured numerically? If so, how?",Samurai_2k,1h8ugxe,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h8ugxe/whats_makes_a_hard_problem_to_solve/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h8ugxe/whats_makes_a_hard_problem_to_solve/,2024-12-07 15:11:29,4,1.0,4,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8ugxe

devops,The state of industry certs,"I’m curious of this sub’s opinion on industry certs. I used to be a big advocate of cloud certification, largely because they were a nice forcing factor to learn new things, test my knowledge, and have something tangible to add to my resume. At one point I held nine between AWS and Linux Foundation. 

Recently life has been busy and I allowed my AWS SA Pro cert to expire. My DevOps Pro is expiring in February, which I’m a little more concerned about because that’s more in line with what I do on a day-to-day. That said, I see people posting on Linkedin all the time about getting certified, and it seems it’s really becoming less of a hot commodity these days.

As someone with 10 years of experience at this point, I’m questioning the continued importance of certification in my career. I have always told people I’ve mentored that certification is one of the best ways to accelerate your career, but does it get to a point of diminishing returns? I could use some advice from people in a similar position or more senior than myself.

I will be working with a team of 7, being 2 of us SRE and the rest are developers.

The hiring manager asked me I have some experiences in Kubernetes/CICD. And I told them the honest truth that I do not have any direct real professional experience w/ Kubernetes or CICD but has self learned docker/kubernets/gitlab CICD and implemented it in some of my projects. And I think that honesty was what he needed to hire me.

Given that, I am anxious on my new role. What if I cannot deliver a certain automation/pipeline needed by my dev? What if I cannot code a everything they ask of me? Damn, it feels scary.

devops,Which field has the highest demand in freelancing,"Hello friends,

I am a Node.js backend developer with 2 years of experience. I want to start freelancing, but I have no idea how to begin. Based on a friend's suggestion, I created an account on Fiverr and made a simple gig.

My question is: which field has the highest demand in freelancing? I mean fields like frontend, backend development, WordPress, DevOps, data pipelines, data engineering, etc. I want to learn as many skills as possible so that I can set up my own business and avoid working as an employee for a company.

Over the past few months, I have met many people and attended several interviews, some of which were not even related to my field. For example, I gave a data engineering interview where I built an ETL data pipeline using Node.js, Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, and Postgres. I also interacted with companies that develop gambling websites, games, and even crack software to steal user data or bypass paid APIs for WhatsApp and Meta applications.

After working for 2 years, I have realized that most IT companies have middlemen who take a significant cut of the revenue, leaving employees with very little. I want to do something of my own.

I have a few friends who are frontend developers, full-stack developers, and UI/UX designers.

If you have any advice, please share it with me. I’d like to know what strategies I should use, which platforms I should focus on, etc.

I am not interested in frontend development, and I’m not good at designing UIs. I prefer backend development and want to explore more opportunities in server-side technologies. Should I explore fields like DevOps or data engineering?

Thank you.

devops,How are you doing serverless development?,"This is turning into a bigger issue. Trying to keep this short and concise but I want to describe the problem as completely as I can.

We're in AWS. Most of our app is serverless. While it is possible to run some stuff locally against deployed microservices we are starting to run into more scenarios where we need to deploy code and infrastructure to a serverless setting to be able to develop (test) anything.

We have the following setup:
1) 3 environments - production, staging, development
2) Theoretically development is _supposed_ to happen in the development environment. But of course to save time and money it doesn't happen that way. There are whole feaures unavilable in that environment so a lot of times we are developing in the staging environment.
3) PRs are required to get into staging and production but not for development. The idea of the develop environment/branch was that it was a shared feature branch since we also lack the ability to deploy feature branches to a serverless envirment. This is tough because we all have to share the environments.

The above setup ultimately leads to the following problems:
1) Rapid fire commits. Broken builds and failed deployments aren't as big of an issue here. We're having to push out small change after small change because we don't have the ability to test a lot of our work locally. (we lack local instances of dynamo, queues, topics, lambdas, etc). On some level locally we can run against deployed services. This only gets us so far.
2) I am constatly waiting around for PR approvals into staging when working on features that aren't available in production. Like completely wasting my time waiting. Actually I wrote this post up while waiting for a PR. This is one of those scenarios where we think we saved time by not setting up the proper infrastructure in the lower environment but now everyone is waiting half a day for their 2 line null reference PR approved to deploy to staging.
3) With the rapid fire commits we have single stories spread out of probably 20 commits on avergae. So it is literally impossible to have a 1-1 mapping of story -&gt; commit. This makes something like hotfixing much more difficult.
4) whole features aren't being reviewed like they should. With spreading the commits out because of the development experience whenever someone is presented with a PR they are only looking at a small piece of the story.

Using a current project as an example: we're building several state machines in AWS. These are super useful and they work well. But its impossible to work on these without having to push code to get it tested. The infrastructure is closely tied to the code too, so its not like I can build something to fake the invocation that is going to be sufficient.

I've heard about localstack and I would imagine that's the perfect solution but of course our management wont' consider it because of cost.

Any other ideas? Branching strategies? Am I missing something obvious? This has got to be a common problem with all of the serverless architecture these days.",UnC0mfortablyNum,1h85ju1,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h85ju1/how_are_you_doing_serverless_development/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h85ju1/how_are_you_doing_serverless_development/,2024-12-06 16:40:25,10,0.76,10,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85ju1
