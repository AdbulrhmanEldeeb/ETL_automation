movies,Uwe Boll's Assault on Wall Street,"Ever since the assassination of the United Health Care CEO this past week, I haven't been able to get this movie out of my mind and I saw it many years ago.  It's about a guy whose wife gets sick, their health insurance reaches their limit and he tries to cash in on his pension from the military, but most of it was put into stocks and this film's setting was the 2008-2009 Wall Street crash.  The wife feels guilty, commits suicide and the husband goes off the edge and starts going on a killing spree against stock brokers and CEOs.  

It's directed by Uwe Boll (Of course, yes, that Uwe Boll) but as far as his movies go, I don't remember this one being half bad.  I remember Dominic Purcell from Prison Break as the husband and John Heard as the main antagonist.

movies,Losing your local movie theater,"When it opened in 1999 as a Carmike, my local movie theater was the premier high-tech theater of the future in the area. I saw Star Wars Episode 1 there 3 times. I saw the whole Lord of the Rings series &amp; probably something like 150 other movies there over the years. My roommate worked there for quite a while.

Except for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off. My girlfriend and I saw Endgame there at 8pm on opening night &amp; there were only about 8 other people.

The last movie I saw there was The Way Back, a drama with Ben Affleck as an alcoholic basketball coach. This was March 15, 2020. Two days later, it closed for COVID &amp; never reopened. At the point it closed, it still had the original carpet, which was badly stained &amp; full of holes &amp; the original seats, many of which were broken &amp; could not safely support a person. Weird projection problems were common. Half the toilets didn't work.

I haven't been inside, but word is the building was badly damaged a few months after closure by the a big storm. It just sold at auction for $750k and will probably be turned into another strip mall or condo development. According to the assessor, the land itself is worth twice what was paid, so somebody will probably make bank. The buyer is unknown, but I wonder if the contents will go up for auction at some point.

movies,Which book to movie adaptation was absolutely perfect?,"I’ll start- Holes.

Perfect casting (yeah Shia LaBeouf’s character is supposed to be chubby but they didn’t wanna mess with the actor’s health- fair play) and great performances, a smart screenplay that doesn’t talk down to kids OR omit anything major from the story, superb pacing, tone and atmosphere that transports you to the world of the film.

I remember seeing it and thinking- “now this was a fucking movie.” 

It helped that the writer of the book also wrote the screenplay- so he was more than on board.

movies,Shawshank Redemption 30 years later,"I hadn't seen Shawshank Redemption since the 90s.

But today it was on the telly and thought why not watch it again.

Firstly. I can see why Tim was in that role. His presence really sells that ""pure"" figure.

Also I had forgotten how much narration Morgan Freeman does. If anything the whole movie shows different shades to the characters. From the guards to the prisoners and all. 

The only ones who are one-sided are The Sisters. Otherwise everyone else shows some good and some not so good.

Also the cinematography is really beautiful considering the circumstances. A real ""natural"" use of light and I appreciated how well lit it was. Unlike some films today where it's so grey.

I could see directing similarities between this and The Mist. First time noticing that. Yes I know same director.

I had always wondered why this film was so highly regarded. But upon watching it there is so much heart and the themes really speak through universally of resilience, perseverance and this sense of inner purity.

It's inspired me to watch The Green Mile next. I do wish Frank made more movies but alas.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Spain,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Slovenia. In a way, we have a double winner: Because it was mentioned in two (and actually more) comments. both 1st and 2nd place are occupied by ***Moj ata, socialistični kulak*** (engl.: *My dad, the socialist kulak*),  As always, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it certainly sounds like an insightful and impressive tragicomedy about issues that are in part even more topical than in 1987, when the movie was released.

I wonder what the next movie will look like? In any case, it will also end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And in any case, let's move on to the next country with an S: In this thread, it's all about movies set in **Spain**. And as always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Saturday silliness: Combine two or more different movie titles and describe the plot,"For example:

**""Raiders of the Lost Boys""** - While seeking the Ark of the Covenant, Indiana Jones crosses paths with a group of teenage delinquents that turn out to be an ancient vampire cult. Indiana must race to prevent the vampires from obtaining the Ark, which they plan to use as a weapon to amplify their power, while also uncovering a mysterious connection between the ancient artifact and the vampires' immortality.

**""Deadpool &amp; Amelie""** - Wade Wilson meets his match when he encounters Amelie, a quirky and imaginative French woman with the ability to manipulate those around her in whimsical ways. Wade's chaotic life as a fourth wall-breaking, crime-fighting, mutant vigilante is at odds with Amelie's more innocent, heartfelt, and compassionate approach to life, and their differences slowly transform both individuals in ways that will change them forever. 

**""Paddington vs. Predator""** - A loveable young anthropomorphic bear returns to the Peruvian jungle that was once his home, where a deadly alien Predator also happens to be hunting. Fortunately for Paddington, his kindness and resourcefulness allow him to befriend other animals that help him outwit the Predator’s traps. The Predator becomes increasingly frustrated, leading to even more dangerous encounters, but Paddington manages to turn the tables in a film full of adorable humor and action-packed tension.

My theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn’t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. 

Maybe that’s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap.

movies,Thoughts on Flow (2024)?,"Just watched this beautiful (although poorly rendered) animation without dialogues and filled with emotion. It's very good, I loved it! But it is also a deep movie, that lefts you thinking about some of its aspects.

Spoilers ahead:

What do you think that scene where the cat and the bird are raptured to Heaven? 

My thought is: the entire movie is a retelling of the biblical flood and that scene shows that the bird fulfilled his journey and was then, raptured. But the cat still had a mission to do. The fish at the end seems to be ready to be raptured, but since he was an animal of the water he couldn't get to the sacred place to be raptured and then died on earth. At the end, the cat has his entire live to live, he wasn't raptured but he was spared of all the suffering.",fiilisboa,1h8rhod,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8rhod/thoughts_on_flow_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8rhod/thoughts_on_flow_2024/,2024-12-07 12:30:19,0,0.36,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8rhod

movies,What actors have had roles in two or more unrelated time travel movies? ,"So far I have three that have starred in two, Bruce Willis (Looper and 12 Monkeys), Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko and Source code), and Mary Steenburgen (Back to the Future 3 and Time After Time). But none that have been in three or more.

Maybe if I was a bit better at googling I could find an answer that way, but so far I've had no luck. 

This might seem like a stupid pointless question, but I'm making a fun little spreadsheet of time travel movies and their tropes, and recurring actors seems like a fun addition.

**#50. Polite Society** \- This year seems to be the year of over the top teen movies with Red White &amp; Royal Blue, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, and Totally Killer all going viral in spite of let’s say inconsistent quality. We'll talk about another one layer one, but I wanna start with a film that deserves a lot more attention that it got. What you’d get if Robert Rodriguez made a coming-of-age movie, it's a film that embraces its blend of martial arts flicks, over the top family melodrama, and 2000s comedy to a delightful degree. I will admit it's a bit of a case of style overcompensating for a lackluster story but what makes it work overall is the charming relationship of the sisters. Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya have great chemistry with each other, creating a sweet and charming bond throughout the film. At the same time, I also dug it doesn’t shy away from focusing on the immaturity and insecurity of a younger sister selfishly not wanting to lose a best friend to her sister. It does capture that betrayal when a family or friend you thought would be there forever for you has their own aspirations. If there is a nitpick, it's that I wish the actual fight scenes had stronger and more exhilarating choreography. Not that it’s bad per say and it does make sense that a film about an action film fan wouldn’t be as polished as the martial arts films it's paying tribute to. I still would’ve like more memorable fights is all. Still the charming presentation and the comedy more than makes up for it, and I can see this becoming a cult classic amongst teens down the line. 

**#49. Unrest** \- I normally advise people to go on as blind as possible knowing little about the premise. But for this film, I think it is important to know that the entire film revolves around community anarchists working in a watch factory who are secretly plotting a rebellion. It might sound exciting but there's very little drama within the film. There's barely what you could charitably call a story and not even a plot. It's very much a grounded and straight look at how revolution is formed, with no big setpieces and few twists outside of certain workers being arrested. And yet it remains an engaging watch throughout thanks to as the says, a feeling of unrest throughout. There's a sense of simmering anger that you can feel below each scene of workers conspiring in secrecy or even as they continue diligently working for the factory. Everything is below the surface and the power of this film is very much in what is not said, in every careful and deliberate word choice uttered through thin poker faces. The sound of ticking of clocks is a constant soundtrack through the film, almost as if counting down how long the workers have until they're caught. Maybe even how long it may be even viable to accomplish a proper revolution before the window shuts forever. Or perhaps, it's a sign of how time will go on regardless of what process is or isn't made. Maybe despite the stopwatch being built, we actually still have time. Its abstract nature means this isn't for everyone but if you're intrigued about the premise and are willingly to be challenged, can't recommend this enough. 

**#48. The Deepest Breath** \- A lot of people have compared this documentary to Free Solo which is unsurprising considering both are about extreme sports and the people who find meaning and purpose in life in accomplishing the awe inspiring. And even if this film isn't as good as that documentary, this one still stands on its own as a damn good watch. From the gorgeous cinematography to the literally breathtaking footage captured of various free divers, showcasing the determination and tenacity of the divers who do this regular serving and the backdrop of the story of two people who find each other at the right place but debatably the wrong time, it's a captivating watch as we see both the limits of human accomplishment in physical feats and the love that inspires us to keep moving forward. And it'll have you hooked and holding your own breath right up to the conclusion. 

**#47. Take Care of Maya** \- I tend to not care for a lot of Netflix-produced crime documentaries. A lot of them tend to be cheaply produced and overly dramatic, not to mention often with surface level commentary and analysis. It tends to put a damper on what could be interesting stories and neuters them in favor of sensationalization. Thankfully, this documentary is not only an engaging watch but one that does proper justice towards a wronged family and highlights a corrupt medicare system that harms rather than heals. Focusing on a young girl with a rare disease and the hospital that intentionally misunderstood her case to take advantage of her family, it is a tough and heartbreaking film. It highlights not just the cruelty in corporate healthcare on not just those who need it but the emotional toll on the families, but also one of inspiration. No matter how powerless their fight may be and how they acknowledge very real risk that even standing up will only result in more pain and trauma, it's moving see the love parents have for their children and an inspiring story of courage and tenacity of a family who fought together and never gave up in spite of everything being against them. It’s a quick but emotional watch that I hope more people do more than scroll past when they go on Netflix.

**#46. Infinity Pool** \- There are films that are depressing watches for their subject matter and tone, and then there are films that are out to make you uncomfortable. Not in the sense of making you feel danger is around any corner, more poking and prodding at the limits your desires will take you. Lust, sexual satisfaction, violence, all of these desires are ones we normally tempered. Infinity Pool asks: “what would happen if you didn't have to filter these sinful, carnal desires?” How far deep would these take you that you go numb from how disgusting you think of yourself and accept it as being blasé? I fully accept this may be me overthinking this movie and being off from its themes. Regardless of my interpretation of this film though, I can deny how. From being disgusted from being intrigued and fascinated, it's a pool I dove in feet first and will continue treading its waters for the next couple of years. 

**#45. The Sweet East** \- This is a movie most will probably hate after finishing and to be honest, as I was watching it for the first time, I did find it incredibly obnoxious. It's full of insufferable, pretentious, and frequently unlikable characters, the narrative makes little sense with Talia Ryder barely reacting to anything or having any change, and by the end you think what was actually accomplished? What did we gain and what was learned? And yet much like Infinity Pool, it's that absurdity that I kept on my mind over the next few days. I kept thinking about Talia-s blasé attitude to the whole adventure - encountering blatant racism, insecure men, and snobby artists and how in a way, it actually did speak to a certain zeitgeist. And as much as I was annoyed by the film, it also kept me engaged and by the end the bitter taste actually made sense. I can't say you will enjoy this film or get as much as I did but it is a film I doubt you'll forget once the credits roll. 

**#44. The Holdovers** \- Some films sneak up on you. At first I wasn't in love with this film as everyone else was. While I thought it was good, it felt a bit too slow and felt like I'd be better served watching any of the 80s classics like Dead Poets Society and Planes Trains and Automobiles that served as inspiration for this film. And yet like the train scene in PTA, I found myself thinking more and more about my experience and realizing how warm it was and how much I took for granted. The chemistry between all three leads, not just from the award winning performances from DaVine Joy Randolph and Paul Giamatti, but also from newcomer Dominic Sessa who I think has gone criminal underappreciated. He proves himself to be a young actor full of charisma, and it's wonderful seeing the relationships the trio has with each other grow without feeling too saccharine. The gradual acceptance all three have in their places as castaways and still finding solidarity in all that is quite moving. Even if it's a predictable formula of the classic grump learning to have a heart, Alexander Payne manages to make these characters feel human and real. It's already a Christmas classic and I could easily see a lot of families having this on as a new annual tradition. 

**#43. Sanctuary** \- Power is sexy and being sexy gives power. It’s an alluring power dynamic and this film manages to make simple discussions and dialogue of it not feel drawn out for 90 minutes. For a film of almost zero nudity and zero sex scenes, this has some of the tightest sexual tension in any romantic film in a while. Both Christopher Abbott and Margaret Qualley deliver fantastic, layered performances, showcasing why they're some of the most interesting young actors right now. The cat and mouse game they play going back and forth at each other is endlessly entertaining as you wonder who's in control and who's really being played. Which one submits first? Even with the play-like structure and the bottleneck setting, this had me captivated for its 90 minute runtime. I really hope more people check it out and I hope both Qualley and Abbott continue to get attention for their work, and I'm already eagerly anticipating Zachary Wigon’s next film, also starring Qualley. 

**#42. Killers of the Flower Moon** \- If this had been 30 minutes shorter and had Mollie given more development beyond simply being the symbol of Native purity and beauty literally poisoned by the white man, I imagine this would've been much higher. Because simply on a film level, it is one of the most impressive and epic in scale. From the pacing and editing that manages to keep the three and a half hour runtime engaging despite of lull points, to the grand production and setpieces that capture how big of a plot this is, to the tight cinematography capturing it all, to the roster of a cast that has even cameo roles shine to an ending that probably one of the more daring statements Scorsese has ever made about America and its dark history. It is a behemoth worth marveling at and even though it doesn't resonate as much as I would want to, I can't deny it's more than deserving of all the acclaim it's gotten. It is a great movie that I just wish I was able to connect emotionally more with as everyone else has. 

**#41. Earth Mama** \- Being a parent is a difficult task and even more tragic are the women desperate to be a mother despite society not allowing them to be or looking down upon them for doing so. But what about the women who, controversially, ‘aren’t fit’ to be a mother? Who is really deserving of that title? That’s the tough question that Savannah Leaf’s heartbreaking debut seeks to answer: what if a woman isn’t suitable to raise her own child. In less empathetic hands, this may have been too heavy or not a balanced portrait, but Leaf’s sensitive direction allows us to come to our own conclusions while not shying away from the dirty truth surrounding it all. But the power of the film lies in Tia Nomore’s lead performance as the imperfect woman wanting to be a mother. She's able to capture the motherly instincts and drive that would make her a good, maybe even great loving parent. Yet it doesn’t shy away from how naively blind she is to her selfishness and commitment issues that would complicate things for her and potentially traumatize her baby. And what’s most intelligent is how both sides are ones you understand the causes behind even if they seem counterproductive. You want her to achieve her goals of raising a family yet at the same time you want someone to step in to guide her away from a potentially toxic and self-destructive household. It's a film with an honest maturity, culminating in an ending that is tragic but at the same time earned. This went a bit under the radar but even with the heavy tone and subject matter, I hope more check it out.

**#40. Talk to Me** \- Another year, another A24 horror movie that’s gone viral and lives up to the hype. Although in contrast to some of their disturbing but challenging and difficult movies, Talk to Me is one of their most straightforward horror flicks. That's not to say Talk to Me is less than though, it still has that great suspense and atmosphere even with the localized Australian teen setting. Despite the stoner archetypes of the cast, what this film has to say about depression, trauma, suicidation and its effects on the family don't just hit home, but feel scarier than any possession or gore the film could’ve conjured up. Couple that with teen actors that have great chemistry with each other while acting like bratty, immature kids, and some of the best gore and makeup effects that'll have you squirming in your seat, and you've got not just another good addition to A24’ horror catalog but a promising breakthrough for the Philippou Brothers who I’ll no doubt be following for their future p projects.

**#39. How to Blow Up a Pipeline** \- This'll no doubt be one of the most controversial movies I praise on this list, especially if you are immediately against the premise and what the Andrew Malm Manifesto that inspired this movie advocates. But whatever your views are about the acts committed in this film, this is one of the best and most tense heist films in a while. It's not a film asking you to agree with the act nor is it necessarily concerned about changing your mind. Frankly it could care less if you would snitch on it. Whether you want to or not, you'll have to follow the shoes of those actually willing to do the extreme, how they pull it off, and the grit they have to stand by their acts. And yet it's also not a film loudly saying why this should be done, as it doesn't shy away not just from the consequences but the lackluster success rate in creating change that acts like this. At its core though, it's a tight and tense film with a fantastic editing and pacing as you get sucked into whether or not they'll accomplish their task, and by the end a film that dares you to wonder whether they should've gone farther or pulled back. 

**#38. Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie** \- Michael J. Fox has been one of the most inspiring figures for me. While it captures his struggles with Parkinsons and the humor he maintains despite his troubles, what I love however is the narration which was taken from his autobiography. It shows how self-aware and reflective he was about just upbringing, success, and shame regarding his addictions yet also how much wisdom he still has even as the disease continues to spread. Whether or not you're a fan of his work, just know him from his biggest movies, or just know him as the Back to the Future kid, I still highly recommend this film as a shining beacon of true human fearlessness. 

**#37. Scrapper** \- For as heavy, deep, and complex films are on this list, sometimes you just need a film that's just so charming and cute. I was actually hesitant to watch this film, writing it off as something I might find too twee and cutesy. But by the first 15 minutes I was hooked in. Much of that due to how damn charismatic the central girl is Lola Campbell, in one of the best child performances of 2023. I love the juxtaposition with both them being young people forced to grow up and act like adults, Lola, the scrappy child left to fend for herself and Harris the immature manchild realizing he actually needs to mature if he’s to salvage anything from his past relationship. And while there is an exaggerated tone, particularly in the editing, neither feel like simple characters; she is not simply a wise ass smart beyond her age and he's not simply a bumbling idiot trying to be a parent. They're both trying to figure out and realize they can't be alone in surviving anymore, and no matter how much they fight there is a familial chemistry between them that they need to keep hold off. It's short and sweet, a comfortable family comedy that shows even simple, played out concepts can be an emotional ride. 

**#36. No One Will Save You** \- It's easy for straight-to-streaming horror releases to get a bad wrap as cheaply made scare fodder. Which is why one of my favorite surprises of the year came from a quietly promoted release on Hulu that probably should've been released in theaters. The big talking point for this film is the decision to have virtually no dialogue throughout. In a lesser film. This could've been a cheap gimmick for a rote house invasion story through aliens. Instead, thanks to smart pacing, writing, and a committed performance from Kaitlin Dever, it turns the film into one of the more creative horror films of last year. The lack of dialogue alongside the great sound design manages to capture, it's an engaging character study in Grief, guilt, and self-alienation. Everything feels elevated with the lack of dialogue and trust you to understand what's going on. It's also a film that invites multiple viewings as there were background details about Dever's character and her story I didn't notice on first viewing. Sure the designs and the effects on the aliens might be a little cheap but that doesn’t take away from how engrossing an experience this was. I really hope this grows a cult following and escapes the trapping it got by being relegated to streaming, we could really use more innovation amongst mainstream horror. 

**#35. Skinamarink** \- This is a film that people either find terrifying or absolutely boring, with very little in between. There's no getting around how 97% of this film is still shorts of walls, hallways, ceilings, and other rooms with a hazy nocturnal filter and with the camera intentionally positioned away or obscuring…anything. If you aren't sucked into the first 2 minutes of this film, you are likely to feel miserable and irritated by the next hour and a half. And i'll admit I was skeptical I would fall for this filma spell, yet, I was enthralled throughout by the atmosphere. There is a film that for me captures a sense of helplessness and claustrophobia as a child in the dark, knowledgeable in little besides your own uncomfortability and fear. Your paranoia as you sit or lie down pondering the thought of monsters under your bed or in your closet may sound juvenile but this film shows that that fear may never go away, sometimes it's just hidden behind your view. Again, I can't guarantee you'll like this film and I also do understand people who think this could've been a short analog horror film. But I couldn't help but be drowned in this films atmosphere and few films had that experience with me. 

**#34. Trenque Lauquen** \- Sometimes, a film can escape a cheap, low budget look not through quick editing or quick banter, but through simple engaging writing and charismatic performance. This film can be daunting being a four hour watch split into two parts and truthfully not that many action or tension driven sequences, not to mention actually hard to find a copy of to watch. And yet I was just as drawn in by the central mystery that I couldn’t help but join along for the ride as you piece together clues behind a potentially large conspiracy. And central to the film's success is the lead performance by Laura Paredes, who not only captures Laura’s curiosity and desire for adventure, but possesses a subtle but magnetic charisma that would make you want to follow her. She doesn’t know where she’s going or what she’ll even do with the discovery once she arrives at it but you can also sense a determination to find what she’s looking for. Paredes doesn’t play it off as aimless soul-searching but as a woman on a mission perhaps only she can understand. Now I will say this is lower than I would want because the second half doesn't quite keep up the pacing of the first, and meanders a bit too much for me. Still the lead performance and the first act's tight writing still come with a recommendation for me. It might not be a satisfying destination by the end but it's the journey that's the more rewarding bit. 

**#33. Bottoms** \- It’d be so easy for me to call this the Superbad for Gen Alpha gays as it is a crass, crude and immature comedy and like with Superbad, it could’ve easily fallen into the trap of relying too much on vulgarity and innuendo. But in fact there's a lot more to Bottoms than just adopting modern slang to appeal to a younger audience. From the great supporting performances (particularly Kaia Gerber and Ruby Cruz) who are game for making this as fantastical and absurd as possible to the chemistry throughout that actually makes their relationships and interactions endearing and even blunts some of the more obnoxious characteristics of the main leads. The clever visual gags, to the quick pace and editing which means jokes don't overstay their welcome, even the slang doesn't feel too obnoxious as to instantly date this movie. It's just a really charming comedy that will no doubt become a cornerstone movie for teens this decade, every generation deserves a crass Crude comedy to rally behind and this one is smart enough to transcend that age barrier. 

**#32. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem** \- It's a real shame that the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies come out as the hype and interest for the brand fades and as Paramount is going through financial instability. But it’s a testament to the films quality that even with waning interest in the Turtles brand, word of mouth meant this was able to find an audience amongst old fans, critics, and even create a new generation of fans. There’s honestly so much to praise but more than the catchy synth score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Rosa of all people, more the gorgeous handrail animation bringing it back to the comic book roots, and more the colorful cast of villains that are really funny and well voiced (including an Ice Cube performance that doesn’t just feel like every Ice Cube performance), what makes this film are the Turtles themselves. It was a great decision to actually have them as teenagers for once and the writing and the voice cast makes them so lovable. Out of all the other adaptations I've seen, the turtles here don’t just feel like teenagers but actually feel like four brothers. They’re loose and fun, immature but not like every other quippy superhero team we’ve gotten since Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, they still throw in their signature personality traits so as to not make everyone feel interchangeable. Most of all they’re relatable and kids you root for - like with Bottoms, the Gen Z slang and social media humor doesn't feel like it dates this movie because of the smart writing and the chemistry between everyone. Paramount has said they'll continue with this direction for the Turtles and I really hope we do get a feature sequel for this crew because this is the type of imagination and creativity we need in children’s media.

**#31. The Killer** \- It takes a special kind of balls for a director to make a film that's a giant middle finger to an audience that latched onto his films for the wrong reasons. A darkly comedic deconstruction of the typically stoic, masculine killer as someone just as clunky, pathetic, and weak as the “normies” he looks down upon, it's an even more impressive thing this doesn’t feel like a self indulgent mess. Fortunately, David Fincher is one of the few directors who can pull it off and make an engaging thriller regardless of whether you see the subtext or not, because amazingly it still works as a straightforward action film. The action and choreography is tight and controlled but gritty - with the break-in fight being one of my favorite fight scenes of last year, the editing creates a sense of tension while also interjecting black humor so as to not get bogged down in self-serious parody, and Michael Fassbender captures the fake macho posturing of a man realizing he isn't the invincible or even intelligent Assassin he clearly wants to be. This film has been a bit divisive even for Fincher fans but I really hope there is a reinterpretation for this film later on as even if it's not subtle per say, it still is an engaging subversion of masculine tropes. 



**#30. A Thousand and One** \- Sometimes a film's power and emotions can overcome some story and presentation flaws. This is not a flawless film by any means as it does have issues in regards to narrative and presentation. But the sheer blunt emotions it holds overpowers any issues I might have to being one of the most gripping family dramas of last year. And that comes from the Trio of actors with William Catlet and Josiah Cross also wonderful. Both are great with Cross being the eldest version of Terrie, the confused child unsure of where to go in life and whether he's getting the support from the family he'd like, and Catlet as the reluctant father who still nonetheless gives it his all to be the father Terrie needs. But it’s Teyana Taylor who delivers one of the best and most powerful performances in all of 2023. She is an absolute star here and in a just world, she'd have been recognized for this film and given so many calls by directors looking to cast her. Like with Earth Mama, it doesn't shy away from the difficulty of being a mother - both society driven and by her own personal hang ups. Yet it is more than just the template of a hardworking mother struggling to keep her family together and above water that we’ve seen in other movies. Taylor disappears in her role of unwavering love, courage and ferocity shown to fight for her family that feels so raw and real. It's not the unique take on this story and it isn't an easy watch, but the performances alone make this an unforgettable experience and I really hope all three actors can get more exposure and bigger roles from this. 

**#29. 20,000 Species of Bees** \- Children have their own dignity that deserves to be acknowledged and most of all respected. It's a concept that seems absurd and a hard pill to swallow for most people and yet this movie shows why it’s important to respect it. Looking at the journey of a trans child no older than 10, from her own self acceptance to the reactions from her mother and the grandmother she's visiting, what really drew me in is that the film doesn't sugarcoat or infantilize the audience with how difficult it can be for her family to accept it. Her older relatives are more the well meaning types more prone to tolerance than accepting and even dismissing her at times. And yet they, and in particular her caring and loving grandmother, are still the ones giving her the support she needs to not just accept who she is but love herself. I also think it's clever how this struggle is reflected in the relationship between the mother and her parents. How the lack of reciprocity from her mother and especially her father, may have contributed to her failing marriage and lacking love she needs to give to her children. It all leads up to an ending that had me stunned on first watch and constantly thinking about it for the next few days. Couple that with Sofia Otero's fantastic performance which rightfully nabbed her a Best Leading Performance award at the Berlin International Film Festival - capturing both her confusion with her domestic situation but also the stubborness to accept her identity when others won't - and you have a small but powerful trans film that’s gone overlooked by far too many. Love is complicated and harder than it, even if its to yourself, but it's better to have love and hone than to have nothing.

**#28. The Eternal Memory** \- Nothing lasts forever and everything will fade in time, no matter how much we try to keep the memories of people and events in tact. It's a tough and scary reality we all have to face even when it seems unfair that goodness can go unrewarded. But choosing to remain loving and kind in the face of that is something that has to come from inside, no matter who remembers it. And the center of this documentary is the love between Augusto Góngora and Paulina Urrutia; a wife caring for her husband slowly losing himself to Alzheimers and yet never leaving his side, still living with him no matter his condition. But it's more than a touching story of marriage as there are three different memories being fought to be preserved. There’s also the memory of the family, who he’s been as a father and husband for many decades. There’s the memory of Góngora’s vital work and accomplishments as a journalist, documenting a Chile in unrest and the resistance that helped turn the tides. And there’s also memory of a Chile whose progress is on the cusp of being reversed amidst a new regime of power. It sounds like a tricky balancing act but this documentary manages not to feel overstuffed because as it reminds us, what keeps us united and focused is love. It’s a beautiful and touching documentary that even if it hits too close for some, I can’t recommend enough if only to keep this memory from dimming too early.

**#27. How to Save a Dead Friend** \- Media often portrays love between addicts as a tragic tale of people unable to save themselves or one of them. It's often easy to criticize them when you're on the outside looking in because logic laughs at the ridiculous stubbornness people show. Yet this documentary defies that by showing us why love is still just as strong and valid even when it seems like an irrational act. That even amidst the political and social unrest of Russia, amidst an uneven and crushing economic structure denying dreams to flourish, and amidst personal demons, genuine romantic love and comfort can still be bright and worth celebrating. This isn't a film that simply ignores from how destructive drugs and addiction can be, rather it shows that relationships and the emotions we shared with each other shouldn't be tossed away even if the situations weren't ideal. Even if it wasn't ever meant to last long, that he was doomed from the start, that the memories shared between them is worth savoring and cherishing. This is an admittedly hard film to track down but if you have the chance, do watch it. It’s an emotional love story and a creative documentary.

**#26. Smoke Sauna Sisterhood** \- And concluding the inadverdent trio of documentaries, we have a small film that packs a big punch, showing sometimes blunt honesty in a closed setting can be more impactful than any big imagery a camera can capture. Some might be uncomfortable at the idea of a documentary of mostly naked women opening up about their experience of trauma, abuse, and hurt, but it's not a film simply wallowing in misery and despair. It can be tough to hear such vulnerable stories, ones that admittedly feel uncomfortable for intruding upon. But the nudity and nakedness actually amplifies their experiences - showing how unafraid they are of opening up - and like the sauna they're in also makes the act of being there one of healing. It's a double cleanse on multiple levels in terms of letting go of pain but also having the support of those ready to listen. The stories will be triggering for some people so I can't easily recommend it to everyone. But for those willing to listen, I hope it can show inner peace can happen and that you don't have to stay hurt forever.",dremolus,1h8mbvs,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,2024-12-07 06:17:22,0,0.41,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Lv5K4bNzmRq5iVWsmVRjGb8tiX9SND_AhWiu1dV3DXs.jpg,t3_1h8mbvs
movies,"Airplane! Joke I didn't get: ""No More Cheese!""","In Airplane!, the character of Steve McCroskey is at the center of several running gags. As part of the ""management style"" gag, where he tells everyone who approaches him exactly what to do before they've had a chance to butt in, he has a similarly one-sided phone conversation with his wife. Upon picking up the phone, he says:

movies,Femme (2023),"It’s been a good long while since I have seen a decent LGBT+ film. The last was probably Moonlight. 
I saw clips of George Mackay on a TikTok and the #femme so I had to look it up and found it available to watch. So I did. 
I had no idea what this film was about other than “a drag queen is attacked and is chased by his assailant” so I was intrigued. 
I’ve just finished watching it and I feel really sad. 
I was hoping for a reprieve for Preston. That his identity crisis being realised would bring him some sort of redemption and that Jules would learn that forgiveness is what he really needed. 
The film is still one of the best I have watched. It manages to do what it sets out to do in a very effective way and the performances from George and Nathan are pure class. I hope to see more of this calibre of filmmaking and I will try to keep an eye out for it.

But as the film ends, we see the real Jordan Belfort introduce Leo’s portrayal onto the stage to sell the pen. I’ll be honest, this go around it rubbed me the wrong way. Why does this guy even get to be apart of the film? I guess him and Marty are cordial? The cameo feelslike a respectful nod and I don’t think the guy deserves that at all.

movies,Is there any website listing differences between theatrical releases and airplane cuts? And anyone know as to Silent Night (2023)?,"Hello, fine folks of Reddit. 

I am a digital immigrant, not a digital native (I am not quite a Baby Boomer; I’m Generation X, but I identify with the Boomers; that means I’m old). Something I appreciate about the internet, among the many benefits offered by the profound innovation, is that people who are more obsessive than I am perform a service for the world, generally for free, of analyzing subjects I take an interest in, reliably enough for my purposes. For many movies that have multiple versions, you can find a list of the differences between the original theatrical release, and the DVD, and a director’s cut. But I am unaware of any resource listing what has been taken out (or added in, but it likely is taken out rather than added in) to the airplane version of movies.
I appreciate that you usually have a title card about the editing, whether for aspect ratio or content. I write as I stream John Woo’s Silent Night. It warned me. I checked: what I have started is a full five minutes shorter than the unexpurgated runtime. I am wondering if someone has performed the service of examining the one against the other (which might be difficult, since I don’t know how you get the airplane edition other than on the airplane itself, so you’d have the put it on, then also stream it on a device; there would be no demand for a repository of airplane bowdlerizations, presumably; once on the ground, you’d want the full content). If anyone has a sense as to this specific title, please feel free to enlighten me. Presumably, it’s the violence that has been taken out. Given the middling reviews of the original, I’m not dedicated enough a fan to sit through the picture twice.
So to sum up, I have three questions.
(1) Thoughts about the airplane versions of movies?
(2) Is there a website I am unaware of, that enables people to check out what they have missed from perusing an airplane version?
(3) Anyone see Silent Night twice, who can tell me if I have been cheated of the best parts?",FrankW1967,1h8iqzk,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8iqzk/is_there_any_website_listing_differences_between/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8iqzk/is_there_any_website_listing_differences_between/,2024-12-07 02:45:07,0,0.4,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8iqzk

Yet, he said that a lot of people he knew liked the movie, which goes to tell you that you don't have to understand something to enjoy it. I said that's true of many other sorts of art. Like I see people put abstract paintings in their homes which continue to puzzle them, just as they puzzle their guests. Yet they like the paintings and paid a lot of money for it.

I was telling him that he gotta watch some newer movies cause some really mess with your head, making 2001 look so tame in comparison.

movies,"""Goofs""","Various websites list film goofs but some of them baffle me, I have just watched The Guns of Navarone and as with any film i like to read the Trivia and Goofs on IMDb and the TV Tropes pages.  
  
 On the mild side there is the usual guff about the wrong tanks and guns being used but the fact that Gregory Peck is an American palying a British person isn't classed as a goof. If an American playing a British person isn't a goof then an American tank pretending to be German isn;t a goof either.  This is mild because yes it's technically a goof and so i'm not too bothered that people are complaining but it's still slightly irrational to complain about it. 

  
On a more irritating note though is bollocks like ""they reused shots"", so what? It's OK to re-use a shot especially if another filmed shot would be almost identical, it's absurd to call it out as a goof. 

For me a slip up/goof/blooper would be a missed or poorly enunciated line, a bumped camera, a crew member in shot, equipment in shot that shouldn't be and other such things. I don't see how a dressed up vehicle pretending to be a different vehicle is any different to an actor dressing up and pretending to be someone they are not.   
  
Should we call out Colin Firth playing King George in The King's Speech a goof? They really should've dug up the actual King George to play the part, it's clearly historically inaccurate to not have the actual King in the part. 

This is of course ridiculous, just as ridiculous as expecting films made many years after a period to have period accurate props, It's much easier to employ actors, whether human or otherwise, and use those instead. 

  
Anyway, what do you think, is using the ""wrong"" vehicles or guns as a ""goof""? Or do you see them playing a role and being something they are not just like the actors are?

movies,Does the mockbuster business model still work? ,"Traditionally, mockbusters were made for foreign markets or were rushed through production to hit TV or video about the time the movie they were knocking off hit theaters. Streaming would seem to massively disrupt this. Theatrical windows are much shorter &amp; popular things usually have instant international distribution. I'm not sure there is a modern equivalent of being in Blockbuster in mid-June of 1993 &amp; the kids are hyped for Jurassic Park, but no way are you paying $40 to take them all to the theater &amp; you could rent Prehysteria! for $2.

Theoretically, this model could make sense for streamers, but most of the streamers are associated with studios &amp; Netflix has shown little interest. They certainly put out relatively cheap movies to hop on popular trends, but Project Power is hardly Fast and Fierce: Death Race. It's not imitating a particular movie or targeting its release date.

Mockbusters do seem to still get made. This year, Asylum put out Alien: Rubicon, Ape x Mecha Ape: New World Order &amp; Road Wars: Max Fury, but I have no idea how these could make money going straight to Tubi &amp; VOD.

For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.

movies,Cruising (1980): Reoccurring character ,"Hi everybody - long time reader, first time poster here!

I just saw 1980s Cruising yesterday and it really stuck with me: The intense atmosphere of NYC underground in the late 70s, the rawness of the SM gay community, and the constant ambiguity of the plot and characters.

Also, very interesting performance by Al Pacino, who you can really see evolve in his role, as his character does during the movie.

I know that Friedkin assigned different roles to the same actors to add to the ambiguity of the movie, however I noticed one of them in particular in completely different roles: A slightly older guy with thin mustache and impure skin (played by Joe Spinell):

02:30: plays the cop on the passenger seat who’s wife left him 

27:28: plays a homosexual in the first bar scene with Al Pacino, right after the appearance of killer Stuart Richards

29:32: same role in the first scene with al pacino standing under Bridge in the park

1:33:31: in the scene where they show murdered Ted, he plays the cop again who briefs the chef on the murder

I just thought that was an interesting choice - did anybody else notice this? I guess Friedkin made that decision to add on the ambiguity even more, blurring the lines between the underground community and the NYPD.

movies,The Bad Boys 1 soundtrack is weird.,"Rnb and industrial metal do not go well together. I enjoy the movie, I just think the musical choices are stupid. The movie came out when rock music fandom, in the form of alternative rock and heavy metal, were almost on an entirely different planet from from hip hop and rnb fans. Both sides may have listened to one or the other as a secondary genre, but that's about it. And it was mostly rock fans listening rap as a third tier preference after alt rock and metal. And industrial rock/metal and hardcore rap actually blend pretty well together when placed together in the same atmosphere. But contemporary rnb? Sounds odd and forced, especially at a time when rnb was at its most cheesiest, cleanest, commercial and manufactured sound. In what world did most casual music fans listen to both Nine Inch Nails and Jodeci? Those bands may as well have existed in alternate universes.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovenia,"Hello there!

Since more than 40 days, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. Yesterday, we took a look at Slovakia, and even though I haven't seen the winning movie yet - as is so often the case here - I'm pretty sure it will be a worthy entry on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Obchod na Korze*** (engl.: *The Shop on Main Street*) has not only made it here, but also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.

Will we have such a high-ranking visitor in the next round, too? Well, we'll see. Our next country is no longer Slovakia, but **Slovenia**, and as everytime before, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

The singers that played those characters (Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX and Lizzo) were billed in the end credits before Nick Jonas' name even showed up. Even The Spy Girls actually had more screen-time than him and did more villainous stuff than Lou despite not singing any songs in the movie.

movies,Gangs of New York revisted,"I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn’t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn’t remember anything about it.

Holy hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.

Leonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.

Daniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.

We’ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.

One of his killings (and you’ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I’ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).

The production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.

If you have never seen this film, or, like me - haven’t seen it in years. Check it out.

To me, knowing about an actor or filmmaker's favorite movies is a great way to understand their vision and inspirations behind their craft, as well as a good way to subvert expectations, like finding out that Corky Romano is one of Robert Pattinson's favorite movies, and Beverly Hills Ninja is one of Christian Bale's favorites.

movies,Can someone please give the vocabulary to express something that I've been observing in movies?,"Hello! I'm gonna try to make this quick and express myself as clearly as possible. How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?

For example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley. It's like they're rendered too colorful and too dull at the same time, making them lack life or something.

What is that? Does anyone else get that feel? What are the words to describe this distinction? Because every time I talk about it I don't get the sense that people actually see what I mean, since I'm not solely talking about the cinematography, I don't think, it's more of a *feeling* of emptiness and fakeness.

movies,Why Does Bollywood Keep Ignoring Young People?,"Bollywood just can’t find the middle ground, and it’s frustrating for the young generation. On one side, you’ve got over-the-top movies like Golmaal—bright, colorful, and so unrealistic that it feels like they’re made for 10-year-olds. On the other side, when Indian filmmakers try to make something grounded, they dive straight into the Indie hellhole. These films are so bleak and heavy that, as an Indian, watching them makes you want to curl up and quit life.

But here’s the real issue: Bollywood keeps targeting the family audience or older generations. Most movies are either made for families to watch together or for the older crowd who can afford to go out and buy tickets. But what about us? The 18-25 crowd? We’re left out. We’re the ones who want stories that feel real, not some absurd comedy or a depressing indie film that makes us question everything.

Bollywood has the talent and creativity to make something honest and balanced, but it feels like they’re playing it safe. Why aren’t they making movies for us? Why is every film either for kids or parents? It’s about time they woke up and started telling stories that connect with young Indians.",No-Indication9775,1h89kdg,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h89kdg/why_does_bollywood_keep_ignoring_young_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h89kdg/why_does_bollywood_keep_ignoring_young_people/,2024-12-06 19:30:19,0,0.35,0,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h89kdg

movies,"I'd never seen a single Quentin Tarantino movie before, so I decided to watch them all in release order","I've always been a big movie buff, but somehow I'd never seen a single Tarantino film. I decided to watch them in release order over the past couple weeks, and thought I would put together my thoughts here, ranked by personal favor.

**10.** **Inglourious Basterds:** I know I'm in the minority here ranking this one last. Its a good movie, and particularly poignant given the rise of fascism in current times. I thought it was cathartic to see the allied soldiers respond to the atrocities of the nazis with zealous, but appropriate, righteousness. And I found a particularly juicy fan theory about Col. Hanz Landa being gay which I thought provided a clever explanation for some of his unexplained motivations and actions throughout the film. However, it felt like the movie was so concerned with its plot and with killing nazis that it left its character work and atmosphere by the wayside. Without the fan theory, Hanz Landa's choices make no sense. And Brad Pitt's character felt so cartoony, in an entirely uninteresting way. Ultimately, a good movie that I have no desire to ever rewatch.

**9. Death Proof:** I thought for sure this would rank at the bottom of my list. I gave up 15 minutes in the first time I tried watching it, and ended up circling back to finish it after I was done with all of Tarantino's other films. This film suffers from having utterly mind numbing dialogue for the majority of its screen time, while also being possibly the sceeviest of Tarantino's movies, ultimately leaving me feeling listless and uncomfortable. But, once I gave it enough time to build momentum, this movie has undeniable charm and a very, very memorable ending. I rank it above Inglourious Basterds only for respect of the game, and because personally I could see myself rewatching this if the vibes were right.

**8.5. True Romance:** This is not part of Tarantino's official filmography (he wrote the script, but didn't direct it), but I saw people insist that it was worth watching because while the movie as a whole is not 100% Tarantino, some of the individual scenes in the movie *are* 100% Tarantino. I loved [the Sicilian scene](https://youtu.be/S3yon2GyoiM?si=MVmHA_SEM6rVYuqC), and I thought the film masterfully subverted the audience's expectations multiple times. However, it feels dated to 90's in a way that Tarantino's actual films from that decade don't.

**8. The Hateful Eight:** A Frankenstein mashup of The Thing (1982), Clue: The Movie, and any western, this movie was shaping up to be one of my favorites. However, this is the only Tarantino movie whose ending was a total let down. I expected everybody to be lying, &gt;!everybody was lying, and then they all killed each other. Pulling an extra character (Channing Tatum) out of nowhere felt cheep, and the flashback felt jarring.!&lt; Regardless of the mediocre ending, the rest of the movie was great and I wouldn't mind rewatching it.

**7. Pulp Fiction:** It was crazy watching this movie for the first time and recognizing so much of it because of its massive cultural impact. That being said, I've read several pulpy books this year alone and have seen several movies that, in hindsight, stood on the shoulders of this giant, and I have to say I've never been a particular fan of pulp as a genre. I recognize that of all the pulpy movies, this is an absolutely legendary movie, but the meandering, disconnected storylines and nihilistic provocativeness isn't really my thing.

**6. Kill Bill Vol. 1:** Funny, rambunctious, and memorable, this movie is good fun. I particularly loved the [Hattori Hanzo scene and the bald guy who was like 'you understaaaaand?'](https://youtu.be/hniuEXezlBI?si=QCH2OvQLXIpDkQ2x). The randomness of that moment when he says he isn't bald was hilarious to me but apparently that is only due to a mistake with the subs - Hanzo calls him bald in the previous line, and it isn't included in the subs, so he sounds like a crazy person when he suddenly starts talking about his baldness. anyways, yeah, good movie.

**5. Reservoir Dogs:** This is such a sharp, flawless movie. I loved that it all took place in one location, and I loved the depressing, cathartic ending. No notes.

**4. Kill Bill Vol. 2:** This movie isn't as action heavy as the first one, but it feels much more… legendary. Each beat is so dramatic and over the top and memorable, and the characters are so striking. A particular standout would be [Esteban Vihaio](https://youtu.be/IfeqSxDJpZw?si=XPG26yrDh5B8hoDd), who is played by the same actor who plays [the sheriff in the flashback at the chapel in part 1](https://youtu.be/4qyZQTjS6Ks?si=edQ6cDa4O7uPfjxC), which is crazy range. It feels like the whole movie just stops and sits in the scene with Esteban and really just lets the actor flex and impress us, like Tarantino saw that character and just really wanted to share it with the world. idk, feels special, like much of the movie.

**3. Jackie Brown:** We are now in my top 3, and these are all really close calls in my mind. I absolutely loved Jackie Brown. It felt like the most conventional of Tarantino's movies, but it's conventionality is what makes it really standout. Its a clever, gritty heist movie in which the whole heist is planned out meticulously in front of the audience, and then &gt;!the whole heist plays out exactly as planned. Despite having no last minute twist or debacle to make us clutch our pearls,!&lt; the movie is utterly engrossing for every second, and the characters feel so real they could walk through the screen. I especially appreciated having a badass black woman as the main character without engaging in derivative stereotype.

**2. Django Unchained:** Jamie Foxx is an absolute Ubermensch in this movie. His character's strength and grit just blew me away. The evil in this movie was deplorable, disgusting, and horrifyingly real. The topic of racism in America, and especially slavery in American history, is very heavy and very, very important, and this movie did a remarkable job with it. Beyond just being a good Tarantino movie, this was an important American western.

**1. Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood:** This felt like two separate movies. The first 2/3's being a wandering, character driven depiction of Hollywood in the 60's, and the last 1/3 being a historical fiction about the Charles Manson Murders. Rick Dalton's fear and sadness over his uncertain career was beautifully acted. The depiction of strong male friendship, 'closer than a brother, not quite a wife' was so heartwarming. Brad Pitt's sketchy wife-murdering, hippie-punching stuntman character was… shockingly likable. What really steals the show, though, is the ending. Much more so than how Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds played to audience fantasies by showing a vague reimagining of history, this movie takes a very specific, very real, very recent (relatively) historical event and calls out just how pathetic the monsters involved were, in a deeply satisfying way. It was a poignant and respectful commemoration of real people who should not have died so tragically young.",skill_myself,1h87fj4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h87fj4/id_never_seen_a_single_quentin_tarantino_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h87fj4/id_never_seen_a_single_quentin_tarantino_movie/,2024-12-06 17:59:54,0,0.44,0,0,65,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h87fj4

movies,The Mist ,"Why was this movie made? How was it really received at the time? 

I understand the 2000's Hollywood zeitgeist of leaning into overdramatic corniness, but this movie takes the cake. 

It seems like a B movie, but with decent at-the-time CGI, which implies a decent budget. Apparently a well-received film in terms of popularity. I'll admit, though, the ending is probably the movie's saving grave. 

Incredibly lazy, one-dimensional characters. The ridiculousness of it all kept me watching as I kept pondering how our standards have changed, at least for a blockbuster as we now understand it. 

Perhaps a key difference now is our expectation for a theme of irony - for characters to have a degree of self-awareness when indulging in shallow, easy to predict patterns of behavior. ""marvel-ization"" might be a word for it. 

I'm just at a loss of how shit this film is. I'm at a loss of how I'm supposed to have felt while watching it.

movies,The Last Samurai: Beyond the Stereotype,"Where do I begin… well this should do it. I think.

To start things off, I’m basically a *newcomer* when it comes to the posting related thingamajigs and stuff. I’d really like to give it a try and share with *you guys* some thoughts concerning a movie which I just watched a week ago or so. 

First, let’s get something straight, I will be giving my personal point of view ‘bout it, so, to be clear, I’m no expert of such or about *‘nothin* in this topic. Just a guy who would like to see what do people think about something *I feel* is *worth* talking about. 

*Let’s cut to the point*, which is: The Last Samurai - released back in 2003. **This film is-a-masterpiece**, and oh man, there is *no room to doubt*, I can assure you that it is. It comes from a time when them films had to convey a meaning. When they were actually good. If they didn’t have that little something, people simply wouldn’t take the bait. Anyway, enough of this babbling, let’s get to the real deal.

***Honor.*** 

*The whole film* \- is about honor. On paper, honestly, if I hadn’t seen the film, and was presented with this as the backbone of the movie, I would have sold in without doubt. Itself, *it already encompasses various other values it wishes to transmit.* **Furthermore**, when people argue about it being the same old *“white-saviour”* type of Hollywood movie, I just laugh in disbelief because *it’s clearly not.* Unlike those based and outdated narratives, this film actually challenges stereotypes and places the focus on a white man named Nathan Algren, who is clearly, a troubled man. *The Samurai help him,* then he returns the favour *in some ways.*

The whole point of the movie being a story revolving around the white guy, is so that people identify with him, in a sense that he’s also another person who doesn’t know anything about *Samurai ways*. Throughout its entire course, the audience is positioned behind the screens to follow a character which they understand, relate to and seeing him empathize with *Katsumoto* and his people makes it easier for us to follow. It would have been much complicated to use of the foreigners as the main actors in the role - this is not racism, it’s just more logical, that’s all. All the better, join that with *Tom Cruise’s performance* on the film, whether you like him as actor or not, he’s great, and that’s just ‘cause he tends to believe he’s the main character in the world, and in this movie, *he is.* 

&gt;\[…\] *“And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds. Others, that he returned to his own country.""*

&gt;*""But I like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace, that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""*  \[…\]

Also, down-votes and upvotes are accepted, as long as you spark interest in a discussion, it’s okay, don’t mind me, express your opinion and fuck what other people think!!

this isn't ur average: ""robots take over the world and they're bad because..."" story. I mean, yes- from the beginning its giving- proceed with caution but this twist on what could be is fantastic. I was SO excited for this film before even watching it. I will begin with, I love futuristic, end of the world or new world films (and novels.) and I gotta say I love the idea of AI overpowering human kind because as a society we are ABSOLUTELY heading in that direction and surprisingly no one seems to realize this writing is an inference of what will happen if we continue. my overall score is 7/10 read below for my analysis and reasoning. 



my initial opinion of the main character (Nick) is he is smart, handy, nurturing, patient, and so goddamn sexy. hes a pretty complex character imo, he was constantly battling with what is right/ wrong from the beginning.  he works a blue collar job (that can and eventually are replaced by SIMS) and tries his hardest to fight against his friends losing their jobs. but he actively uses extremely advanced technology like his refrigerator, populating bars utilizing SIMS to serve, and ofc hiring his own SIM. he expresses a high sex drive (source: when Maggie (his wife) is literally in the hospital bed waiting for her heart surgery, hes making jokes abt getting her back to the marathons they used to have- but she doesn't seem to mind, shes pressing into him too so we can only assume she has an equally high sex drive too) but remains faithful even when he feels an unintentional attraction to Alice. 

when Nick asked Alice to wipe her memory in order to ""experience"" Casablanca, that's exactly what she did. she consumes the film as if shes a part of it. erasing her program to reprogram the story as her own. she tells Nick that resetting her in order to ""forget"" the memory she has of Casablanca will be antithetical, but he still does it. the quote from the movie we see is ""you are a man. if someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?"" then the call is interrupted by a call from Maggie. 

  
the entire film counters being dependent on AI, but very much distinguishing their inability to experience life through emotions. in the beginning scenes, the sales person explains the longer the AI unit is with the family/ the more knowledge it obtains the better it will perform. but no one seems to think they can replicate emotions or make decisions outside of their based programming?   
as soon as she wipes her memory.. she learns only: Nick, Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland. throughout the film we see her putting together the metaphoric similarities of their real life to the characters of Alice in Wonderland when speaking with Isla as well. she even notes wiping her own civility because ""it's better."" aka more human. aka creating a more genuine link to human emotion. (this doesn't make sense to me, because in this film- the companies programming these SIMS are extremely hands on- later in the film the company even immediately takes action in bringing in two employees well after working hours to reset/ reprogram Alice. every story of robots taking over the world seems to always conclude that robots will outsmart the companies who make them. so in a world where we're so far advanced; AI is in your home and consuming more and more information all the time, is it really so crazy to assume the companies who created them would want to check in on their projects' progress? the amount of times we hear how much money they cost, you think they would have scheduled tune ups frequently. with scheduled check ups, the companies would have found out a lot of her program was wiped and I think this fact kind of kept me in movie mode- not so much lose myself in the film mode.)

   
to me, it's obvious the matter of ""messing around"" with Alice wouldn't have ever crossed Nick's mind if she didn't look the way she did. there would have never been a moment where he was willing to risk anything if Alice was ""an old English butler,"" which was originally what Nick and Maggie had originally discussed when purchasing a nanny SIM.   
he gives the explanation that ""Isla chose her,"" and I think this is a really great moment to note: he really was teetering back and forth whether he found it wrong or not. he clearly liked to look but even if the idea crossed his mind- he never tempted himself with any action. it wasn't until Maggie told Alice that if she died, Alice needed her to comfort Nick and make sure he's taken care of. the first time they messed around (in the garage later that night) Alice initiated it. she convinced him she wasn't real (because her heartbeat is just a simulation programmed to provide comfort to humans) and encouraged him to proceed if only for his own health and he does.   
the second time is after the shower when she again, tempts him with lingerie and a blindfold. she disguises herself as Maggie which was such a nice touch because it really enforces the idea that there is nothing human about her and essentially can be or do whatever he needs. and \*\*ok honestly\*\* lets face it the bathroom scene was... nice   ͡° ͜  ͡  
  
BUT I really hate that that's the extent of their relationship. the next morning, Nick ""ends it"" with her, the wife gets her surgery and comes home and then it turns into this weird vibe between the women. all of a sudden, we see a jealous/ competitive side from Maggie (ie: dirty looks when Alice cared for the baby, cattiness towards Alice when she asked for the family recipe, etc.) I dont understand because at this point Maggie has no idea that Alice and Nick have had sex- Alice has only shown she is an obedient and hard-working and loving nanny so idk how the vibes are so far off when there wasnt a single hospital visit that was weird?

here's where the story line goes all over the place. there was SO much build up between Nick and Alice and then for like 6 scenes in a row you don't even see the two of them in conversation. we have the playground scene (where we learn Alice has changed her software to have more of a human approach to casual encounters,) the shower scene between Nick and Maggie (where Alice interrupts with Isla's nightmare,) then we see Monty attack Nick, Alice k\*lling Monty (\*but we also learn that Monty: hater of all SIMS, OWNS A SIM. he's coked out and contemplating suicide but we also learn hes been using and ab\*sing his SIM,) then the bathtub scene between the women (again- would have been a nice time to see Alice be useful to Maggie??? this woman has just had open heart surgery, her medicine has proved two separate times to cause dizziness, and she isn't thankful to have the extra hands on deck. again- up until THIS POINT SPECIFICALLY, she doesnt know Nick and Alice have hooked up. obviously in this scene, she puts it together, but in my perfect world, she would have accepted the help from Alice and welcomed the extra energy she has to take care of her husband- which before she was about to die was her only concern? idk weird continuity there, but again this is the scene she puts together that they've indeed had sex. but then immediately the scene goes from Maggie and Nick talking about his affair to Alice trying to drown the baby. 

??? huh !!! ???   
I have watched this movie now three times all the way through and this just does not add up. her software changes up until this point could always be justified with \~what she was learning real time.\~ she says its bc Max is a ""burden,"" which in the beginning Nick (when Max was crying,) shushes him and says ""quite the little burden,"" but the words are never brought up again and that was BEFORE the hard wipe before Casablanca. so..... yeah I really really dont understand this part.   
not to mention miss ""I just had open heart surgery"" takes on scaling the house and fighting a robot? 

  
I definitely wouldnt have made her turn on the kids- if there was no hope in seeing a harmonious relationship between the women, I would have much rather seen Alice drowning Maggie in the bathtub and played it off as ""people accidentally drown all the time,"" or using her medication symptoms to her own advantage and coerced Maggie into hurting herself or the kids (making Nick question her character, aka not be in love with her.) 

ok so then yada yada, we're at the hospital with the baby to check on his vitals (even though he was never even submerged in the water? kinda dramatic to take him by ambulance to the ER but whatever. flashes to the bar scene where Alice speaks in a revised quote from Casablanca and informs Nick, she k\*lled Monty for him, and will take care of his family (alluding to the fact that she had connections in the hospital at the same moment.) then Nick attempts to trick her (c'mon now.. shes clearly proved she cant die?) and k\*ll her and he races to the hospital. ofc we get this unrealistic fast and furious driving through the snowy streets only to have his car crash into an ambulance pinning Alice in between them. SHOCKER: she still doesnt die. we have to sit through terrible fight sequences and multiple fake deaths before everyone walking away barely scathed. Nick is in a hospital bed with light bruising and Maggie is healing in a wheelchair with both children and she invites him to come home \*rolls eyessssss. the film then ends with a 30 second clip of Alice's software uploading on every SIM and her opening her eyes after reconstruction of her face implying a sequel.... I’m gonna go ahead and say we dont need it. 

tldr;   
my rating would be higher than 7/10 if the company was more hands on, there was more of a relationship (whether that would have been friendship or romantic) built between Nick and Alice, a more manipulative side of Alice towards Maggie, more mentions of Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland (so we could have definitively seen the allusion to the stories playing IRL for Alice,) and heres a big kicker: I really wish that Nick would have died in the car crash. this may be so so over the top controversial, but I think it would have been very \~poetic justice\~ if he died trying to save Maggie when it was his actions that potentially destroyed them in the first place  

  
anyway :) definitely watch the movie!! big fan!!

movies,What is up with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood?,"Hey, I am a complete newby when it comes to movies. Never watched them until recently. So, I recently got into Hollywood after going through the national scene and there are movies I love. The old Disney ones, of course. Loved the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Really liked 12 Angry Men, might be my favourite of the lot. And then I heard about Quentin Tarantino who is apparently held in high regard. So, I watched his latest movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and I want to know, what is going on?

The movie seems to be a mess. I mean, the dialogue is great, the acting is great and the concept was interesting. But what is going on with the plot? Things happen, then some people get killed. The ending was bizzare. I looked into it and it is basically fanfiction of a real event apparently? Not only was the ending just fanfiction, it also had little connection with the rest of the plot. Is it some reference that I don't have the cultural context to understand?

movies,"What titles to watch to engage in some schadenfreude, in light of recent healthcare news","I'm curious what films others might recommend to support the feelings of schadenfreude* many of us are feeling over the death of the UnitedHealthcare CEO.

There are two titles that come to my mind.

*The Rainmaker* is a '90s adaptation of a John Grisham legal drama novel of the same name, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Its cast is an absolute murderer's row of talent. In the film, &gt;!a young Matt Damon brings a case of unlawful denial of care against a huge healthcare insurer, on behalf of the family of a young man with leukemia.!&lt;

*Hell or High Water* is directed by David Mackenzie, based on a script by the only screenwriter whose name I've memorized, Taylor Sheridan. The modern western plot follows &gt;!two brothers as they go on a bank robbing spree against a particular chain of banks in order to gather the money needed to keep their family farm. Law enforcement is frustrated by locals who willfully turn a blind eye to the robberies in support against the bank they despise.!&lt;

Just a random daydream earlier about how amazing 1993 was with both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List being directly by the same guy. Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).

movies,Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before,"Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, ""But where's his brother?"", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.

- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.

- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. ""Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic."" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of ""There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!"" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.

- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (""I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box""). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen.

movies,Rewatched The Devil Wears Prada,"I rewatched The Devil Wears Prada. I have not seen it for many years, so I was glad to revisit it especially after all the discussions revolving the movie. Here is what I get from the movie:

# Miranda is awful, but Andy is too naive to empathize for

Miranda's treatment of Andy is awful. I would feel bad for Andy if she was not so stupid. She is an aspiring journalist who is way too unperceptive to be an effective one.

From the beginning, she is being told by everyone her position is one people would die for. Despite this, she still sees it as a joke despite being told over and over again how serious this role is. The only reason she wanted the job is because her other choice was Auto Universe magazine. [Andy snickers at the choice of belts to choose.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-KQij0I8I) Miranda dresses her down in front of everyone. I would feel bad for her if she did not already been made aware how big of a deal this is. Like girl, you've been told so many times.

Next, Miranda asks her to do the impossible task of finding her a flight. When she fails, she is admonished by Miranda.

&gt;I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid. But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl. I had hope. I always have hope. But you’re as disappointing as anyone else.

Narratively, this scene is not earned. The task should be something difficult but not impossible, and probably something that someone who is interested in fashion could manage. Her saying that to Andy is more petty than cruel given the circumstances.

So what does Andy learns from this? [That Miranda hates her.](https://imgur.com/5Q2PaYS) [Nigel gives her a reality check.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJf-J5RXxw8) Nigel once again tells her how important Runway is, something she should have caught on right now. Then, Andy comes up with the first smart idea: start dressing like she works at Runway. Nigel even helps her, probably thinking ""this dumb bitch finally caught on"".

Later, Nigel is telling Andy about Miranda's scale:

&gt;In her way. There’s a scale. One nod, good. More than one nod -- very good. There is only one actual smile on record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she doesn’t like it, she shakes her head. And then there’s the pursing of the lips. Catastrophe.

So what are Andy's first words after this?

&gt;So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?

LIKE HOW ARE YOU STILL NOT GETTING THIS??????

Smart Andy is then gets bamboozled by twins in messing up the book delivery. For punishment, Miranda is giving her impossible task #2: get the unreleased Harry Potter book in 4 hours. She gets it done, which is insane. She is finally happy to get something right (that something right is literally doing the impossible, but to her it's like ""hahaha I finally did not majorly fuck up"")

The movie seems to want to make us believe that Andy is similar to Miranda. Miranda tells Andy:

&gt;I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.

How does Miranda see ANYTHING in her in Andy??? Andy is so naive and dumb. Then Miranda says that what Andy did to Emily was cold. How???

Miranda was basically threatening to fire Andy if she did not go to Paris. Hell,[ Andy even went to visit Emily in the hospital after her accident.](https://imgur.com/Qm3RMWj) Andy should know how Emily would feel about the Paris trip, but she is like ""omg you know how she is"". Either she is like Miranda visiting Emily at the Hospital for some sick pleasure (doubtful), or she is just naive about how the world works.

Anyways, Andy is pretty dumb.

# Nate is not really a bad boyfriend.

A big piece of the conversation revolving this movie is how bad of a boyfriend Nate is. Some even say he is the real villain. This is ridiculous. Here is my scene by scene take on him.

***SCENE 1 - Opening Montage***

[The first shot we get of Nate is him chilling in bed saying ""Good luck."" ](https://imgur.com/HCjFzJt)This is a man with no aspirations. While his girlfriend is getting ready to work, he is reading the comics + games section of the newspaper. Andy and Nate seem to be in good terms her though, so she is familiar with how he is.

***SCENE 2 - Dinner with Friends***

When Andy, Nate, and their friends go out to eat, her friends and her take solace in the fact that they all have shitty jobs. When walking back to home, they hold hands and make fun of how ridiculous the workers dress at Runway. This shows how both Andy and Nate do not take their jobs too seriously.

***SCENE 3 - Andy Coffee Dial***

Andy wakes up to a phone call from Emily and has to go get coffee immediately. [Nate's gives the look like he is saying ""oh brother... jobs am I right??""](https://imgur.com/lFllBP4)

***SCENE 4 - Andy is Venting About Her Job***

Nate is cooking a grilled cheese sandwich on a skillet, which is awfully on-brand for our underachieving king. Nate serves her the grilled cheese which Andy says that she will not partake because everyone is skinny at Runway (red flag?!?). Andy then makes the promise of it being only one year, which Nate nonchalantly says ""Easy there, tiger."" while he is chewing on the grilled cheese. Classic Nate.

***SCENE 5 - New Wardrobe***

Andy surprises Nate with her new clothes. Nate hits her with a [classic Nate line.](https://imgur.com/cALodxM) Now Nate somewhat superficially likes an aspect of her job.

***SCENE 6 - Bar with Friends***

This is where the main issue arrives. Andy sings the praises of Runway, which then Nate makes a quip about Andy drinking the Kool-Aid after praising Runway. This makes sense, they both laughed at how silly fashion is in the beginning, Nate still remains the same while Andy now admires it. The friends playing with her work phone when they just accepted gifts she got from work is shitty though.

Sidenote: the next scene, blonde hair man asks for some samples of her writing to get her connections. She rejects this offer because she is Miranda's assistant. So maybe Nate was onto something here...

***SCENE 7 + 8 - Andy calls Nate Saying She Wants to Quit.***

After given the impossible task of getting the Harry Potter books, she calls Nate saying she wants to quit. [We finally see Nate working, which is cool too.](https://imgur.com/SOoIlim) Next scene Nate comes home to see Andy working on the twins' science project (Red flag?!?!?!).  She starts defending her boss after Nate calls her a wacko (a wacko surely would not have their assistant work on her niece's science project). The conversation comes to an end when [Andy shows her sexy bra](https://imgur.com/SXRlBEL), which is the weakness of a simple man like Nate.

***SCENE 9 - Poor Nate is Alone on his Birthday***

Andy was working and had to miss Nate's birthday. She then [comes home to a single cupcake with a candle on top of it saying ""Happy Birthday"".](https://imgur.com/d8MSnyD) After briefly explaining herself, Nate just says ""Don't worry about it. I'm going to bed"". Not even Andy's sexy bra will save her this time. He then tells her ""You look very pretty"", and goes to bed. He is unhappy because Andy bailed on him.

***SCENE 10 - Andy Won't Go to Bed***

Nate asks Andy if she will go to bed. She says [five minutes ](https://imgur.com/9QnrUni)(doubtful). She is looking at some personal photos, but the tension is definitely there.

***SCENE 11 - The Art Exhibit***

Andy's friend sees the blonde man giving Andy a kiss on the cheek. Andy's friend asks Andy why she is cheating on Nate (it is a misunderstanding). The friend leaves, and clueless ass Nate comes from the back asking [""You're going to Paris?""](https://imgur.com/K90oVIo)

Nate asks ""I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or..."" and Andy responds ""Great. Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?"". Andy walks away [leaving Nate in utter shock.](https://imgur.com/Se2YpsG) They argue. Nate suggests to take a break. When Nate is walking away, Andy calls for him, but alas she gets call from Miranda.

This is probably the most contentious scene, but I do not see how Nate is in the wrong. Andy is completely different now, why would they want to stay together anyways? Nate is asking her to be genuine: either be the same with him or aspire to be a Runway worker. And he got his answer in the end, she decides to answer Miranda.

***SCENE 12 - Andy Apologizes to Nate***

Andy apologizes to Nate, saying:

&gt;Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?

This is apology misses the point. Andy shouldn't be sorry about that, she should be sorry for not knowing what she really wanted to be. Nate accepts the apology though, he is not very bright.

**IN CONCLUSION - Is Nate a Bad Boyfriend?**

Not really. He is a dumb underachiever. Andy changed too much and will not acknowledge it, so Nate had to say it openly for her to understand.

movies,RDJ as Doctor Doom might be one of the biggest fumbles OAT.,"Ok so I like many other marvel fans have kinda not been paying attention to most of marvels recent projects, so guess my surprise when I hear that they are making the new major villain Doctor Doom, one of my favorite villains in all of media. Doctor Doom is the ruler of a foreign nation who uses both science and magic, as well as his incredibly high IQ, to destroy his opponents and try and raise his country to prosperity as well as any other motivations he may have. He is one of the most brutal and harsh characters marvel has to offer and the actor they choose to play him is RDJ????? 

Don't get me wrong RDJ is a great actor and was fantastic as Tony Stark, he also demonstrated his ability to play a serious villain in Oppenheimer, however RDJs whole vibe is completely wrong, Doctor Doom is a character that no matter the context should feel menacing and dangerous as well as calculating and incredibly serious, RDJ is not this, he is iron man. 

Idk this all feels like a cash grab or they just don't really care. So many other actors could've played Doom amazingly (Javier Bardem comes to mind) and also Doom is literally the ruler of a foreign country his accent wouldn't be American. Ik this is jumping the gun and the movie could be great but Doom is such a perfect villain to follow thanos, someone less physically powerful (although he can get quite the powerup) but smarter then anyone the Avengers have faced yet.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovakia,"Hello there!

A bit more than 24 hours ago, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Serbia, and to be honest, as an outsider, I'm absolutely surprised. Not so much about the fact, that *A Serbian Film* didn't win (okay, a little bit about that too), but more about how much hate it got especially by - as it seems to me - the Serbs themselves. As a result, instead of this very unappetizing film, ***Balkanski špijun*** (engl.: *Balkan Spy*) has now won the contest.

But no sooner has a new movie earned its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) than we move on to the next country. Now it's all about **Slovakia** and as the 41 times before, there are only two rules to have in regard in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,THE REVIEW-ING - ALPHA AND OMEGA (2010),"[Let's just pretend the seven sequels with Kate Higgins and Ben Diskin don't exist... right?](https://preview.redd.it/qsftwz3ob35e1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6945d9610250126006c119b766c93ea6391eafe8)

This is one of my least favorite Lionsgate films of all time, and yes, this film still gives me nightmares...

So, let's get to the review.

***THE PLOT:*** What was the writer of that Ashton Kutcher film up to... wait... if this film came out the same year as the Open Season 3 film, why didn't we get a real villain? Why is there a scene of it ripping-off The Lion King? **WHY IS THAT MOONLIGHT HOWL SCENE SO SCARY!?** 

***THE CHARACTERS:*** Lilly is surprisingly a likable and fun character, and she's still one of my favorite characters of all time in Lionsgate history. Everyone else? Well, we'll get to that later.

***THE ANIMATION:*** Holy shit. What is up with the fucking animation!? Yes, it's like a PS3 game or something, even a deleted scene on the film's Blu-Ray had better animation. I like the expressions on the characters.

***THE VOICE ACTING:*** Honestly, I prefer the cast of this film, and not the sequel cast of Sonic actors and anime dubbers. I like Justin Long and co.'s voices, sounding far more cute than Ben Diskin and co.'s voices in the sequel media.

***OVERALL:*** Well, this was what ruined Lionsgate even further, the only thing that I hate more than this film are those seven-shitty direct-to-video sequels that Lionsgate made just for money, and I might write a new story/retelling of the sequel that ignores the DTV sequels.

movies,ONE NECK - Adrian Lyne's upcoming movie,"Any news? When will production start? I found a copy of the script and LOVE IT!!!

VARIETY Oct 13, 1998 -

HEROES AMID PESTILENCE: Todd Alcott is thriving as a scribe who finds heroes amid pestilence. First, he co-wrote the hit pic “Antz,” which turns those insects into sympathetic sorts. Now, he’s got a script that delivers a serial killer worth rooting for, and it’s got director Adrian Lyne seriously considering making it his next film.

The project, set up at Dimension, is called “One Neck,” described as a social commentary about the higher classes in Easthampton. The lead character endures the loathsome lot around him until he’s revealed as a serial killer who begins bumping off the upper-crusters at a party.

Lyne, who last directed “Lolita,” counts that among several helming options, which include “The Murder Next Door” at Sony and an untitled project he’s developed at Fox 2000.

Alcott, who started as a Gotham playwright, also has adapted the zombie comic book “Dead World” for Warner Bros. and producers George Clooney and Robert Lawrence. He’s repped by ICM’s Todd Feldman and Leora Bloch and managed by Linne Radmin of the Radmin Co., who’s producing “One Neck” with Howard Meltzer.",noeunofficial,1h7kl6v,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7kl6v/one_neck_adrian_lynes_upcoming_movie/,2024-12-05 21:37:00,0,0.25,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h7kl6v

He turned me onto to these European “feel bad” filmmakers. Lars Von Trier, Gaspar Noe, Haneke etc. 

Stuff that disturbed me in these movies this guy just laughs at. (Spoilers ahead) like in the house that jack built when he murders the whole family. He said he thought that was funny. And i couldn’t even look at the screen. I was getting sick to my stomach.

Granted I liked a lot of movies from these directors, but they were definitely not an easy watch and I wouldn’t want to watch them again.

Does it say something about someone psychologically if they love these kind of movies? Im not at all saying they’re bad people. But i just wonder why people enjoy this stuff and actively seek it out.

movies,The sequels to Terminator 2,"I just re-watched all the Terminator 3 versions, and just thought I'd give some feedback.

I'm a big fan of the original two movies. T2 is IMHO one of the best movies ever made. T1 is also an amazing movie, but I don't feel it's aged well.

The TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles I feel was the best continuation of the series. Though there was a lot of filler episodes, it felt true to the spirit of the Terminator franchise.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines I really didn't like. There's too many jokes, it feels like a parody. Stuff like the camp glasses the T800 wears and the breasts inflating. The ended felt really good, but the journey felt so corny I couldn't enjoy it.

(Terminator Salvation I haven't watched yet, but it's a continuation from Rise of the Machines, so I'm comfortable leaving it out).

Terminator Genisys I think is my favorite T3. I enjoyed the twists with John Conner and the stuff about Genisys, and the stuff with Pops. It's weak as a Terminator film, but it feels like the best of a bad bunch.

Terminator: Dark Fate I cannot stand. The twist at the start with John just left a bad taste in my mouth, and the humanization of the T800 just makes no sense.

In the final scene where Nieman plays for Fletcher, the same exact sheet music with the same markings can be seen. Suggesting it was stolen by either Nieman or Fletcher. 

https://imgur.com/a/unFP8da

Okay, given that there is no scene where we see the actual sheet being given to Nieman at the end of the film it can’t be totally confirmed BUT to consider: 

 1. Before the final scene Nieman clearly has brought his own folder with him for the concert. Does this mean that the whiplash sheet music would be in that folder?  

 2. Fletcher could have given Nieman the sheet music when he got there, but this is never seen. It would depend on what the usual protocol is for concerts which I don’t know much about.  

 3. In the middle of the movie, Nieman can be seen photocopying copy’s of whiplash to learn at his dorm. This version has NO markings on it. Which suggests that Fletcher gives out blank pages with no markings and the markings were put there by Tanner himself, the version we see at the first rehearsal and at the final scene has to be his own personal one.

**THE ANIMATION:** I'm surprised that the animation is more in-line with the original 1961 film, keeping the scratchy outline/xerography aspect, and is feeling like the previous film's animation as well. Kinda good that Television Animation was capable of making good animated sequels.

**THE VOICE ACTING:** Even though everyone from the original is **fucking dead**. Everyone here has a brand new cast, I like the voices of Lockwood and everyone else, as many of the new actors do splendid jobs recapturing the magic of everyone.

movies,"Genuinely, how do you feel about how Alien: Romulus used Ian Holm's face?","For those who didn't catch that while watching the movie, it wasn't an actor who played Rook (kinda obvious honestly). Daniel Betts voiced Rook, but the character in itself is some sort of mask molded after Ian Holm's face when he was in his late 40s (specifically when he played Ash in Alien ).

I've seen many people talking about whether this approach was even ethical.

On the one hand, Fede Alvarez did talk with Ian's wife to see if she was fine with them doing this, so the person who would most likely be affected by seeing Ian on screen was removed from the equation. And this wasn't a copy of Ian's most relevant appearance, aka the year before he died, so you might make a case for that too.

On the other hand, getting permission from his wife isn't like getting permission from him. So you can't say he would have been fine with his appearance being used. As for the point of his younger appearance being used, this might actually not matter at all since it is still Ian's appearance.

Look! I really liked Romulus, but this could have been easily avoided if they just cast someone who looks like Ian to play Rook or keep with the original plan to have a different person for Rook. That was possible since the movie has amazing practical effects, and I'm sure the artists would have come up with genius ideas to hide the lower part of Rook's body.

They're quest movies, obviously, but there's something about the episodic nature of the movies and the level/boss battle/fetch quest elements that really felt like video game storytelling. She even levelled up at the end of the movie! 

One of the people I saw Moana 2 with, who doesn't play video games, also felt that the writing felt a little off. Did anyone else feel this way? What other movies' plots feel like video games?

It’s hard for me to narrow it down, but the funniest scenes for me were Dustin Hoffman getting crushed by rubble in what is essentially a family guy style cutaway. One of the most unceremonious deaths I’ve ever seen, especially considering how little of the movie he was in.

Any scene with Shia Labeouf, all of them were wild. I think I’ll go with when he throws his hat down and yells at his assistant to pick it up, who in turn does the same thing to the guy behind them

movies,🔥 Pushpa 2: The Rule - The Most Anticipated Sequel of the Year! 🔥,"The Positives:

1. Allu Arjun's Performance: He’s the soul of the movie. His portrayal of Pushpa Raj is even more charismatic and intense than in the first film. From his swagger to his emotional depth, Arjun delivers in every scene.


2. Action and Visuals: The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. They’re larger-than-life but still gritty, which fits the tone perfectly. The cinematography adds a cinematic grandeur that amplifies the experience.


3. Music and Background Score: Devi Sri Prasad nails it again. The songs and the background music elevate every scene, especially during high-octane moments and emotional beats.


4. Narrative Depth: Compared to the first film, the sequel explores Pushpa’s personal and professional battles more thoroughly. The emotional connection with his family adds a layer of relatability.


5. Villain's Presence: Fahadh Faasil as Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat is a standout. His face-offs with Pushpa are thrilling and add a lot of weight to the story.




---

The Negatives:

1. Lengthy Runtime: The movie feels stretched in parts. Some scenes could have been trimmed to keep the pacing tighter, especially in the second half.


2. Predictable Moments: While the core storyline is engaging, certain plot twists feel predictable, taking away some of the excitement.


3. Over-the-Top Action: While fans of masala entertainers might love it, some viewers may find the action sequences a bit exaggerated.


4. Focus on Subplots: At times, the film delves too deep into side plots, which distracts from the main narrative.


5. Comparisons with the First Film: Some fans felt it lacked the raw energy and novelty that made Pushpa: The Rise so impactful. The bar was set so high that this sequel, despite its strengths, doesn’t completely surpass it.




---

Final Word:

If you loved the first part, Pushpa 2 offers plenty to enjoy, especially with Allu Arjun’s electrifying performance and the intense drama. But the pacing and predictability might leave some viewers wishing for a tighter edit. Overall, it’s a mix of high-octane entertainment and emotional storytelling worth a watch, especially on the big screen.",EngineeringWorldly45,1h7jvgq,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7jvgq/pushpa_2_the_rule_the_most_anticipated_sequel_of/,2024-12-05 21:07:37,0,0.14,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h7jvgq

movies,WDAS and Pixar Copying Marvel Studios IP Flex Logo in the Future?,"I have been thinking about how Disney and Marvel Studios changed logo branding forever by making it their standard of having long, grandiose, self-serving and congratulatory logos that pretty much serve as a sizzle reel to promote their most popular and relevant brands. Kids and Disney Adults are more likely to be exposed to already established IP that is safe to invest rather than new ideas (which are likely to banned in Hollywood in favor of tax write offs).

The current Disney Studios logo is honestly very stimulative and busy with the fireworks and Easter Eggs all over it.

What if Disney Animation and Pixar decide one day to change their logos to copy exactly what Marvel is doing?

For WDAS, Steamboat Mickey transitions only to their most relevant ""franchises"" like Frozen, Wreck-it-Ralph, the Disney Princesses and Zootopia along with some other movies similar to the current DreamWorks logo.

Pixar, whether it is still the hopping lamp or phased out, is stepped aside in favor of their biggest franchises like Toy Story, Cars, Incredibles and Inside Out.

Christophe Beck and Michael Giacchino can compose new music to mimic the Marvel Studios fanfare with a minimalistic rhythm and melody that is just enough to sell it. And the logos have to clock in at 30-40 seconds. Disney has made long logos their identity and do you think they can pull this strategy off for both Disney Animation and Pixar? What other ideas do you have in mind if they were mandated to reimagine their logos?

DreamWorks and Star Wars have done this now. It won’t be too long until brand synergy is mandatory.",rwinger24,1h7clim,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7clim/wdas_and_pixar_copying_marvel_studios_ip_flex/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h7clim/wdas_and_pixar_copying_marvel_studios_ip_flex/,2024-12-05 16:06:00,0,0.22,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h7clim

movies, Park Chan-wook's Decision to Leave and how it embraces modern tech ,"This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.

Decision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and ""smart"" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.

This is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.

1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices

* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.
* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.
* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners
* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app
* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)
* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to ""point"") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.
* The ""captain's log"" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app
* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up
* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.

1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.

* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.
* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband
* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband

1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices

* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.
* I like the ""switch"" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks
* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear
* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly

Overall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.

movies,Film Schools education,"Hello, everyone. I’m curious to know if film schools worldwide generally lack in providing quality film education, or if it’s just the one I’m attending in Turkey that is subpar. My experience has been rather disappointing, as many professors here seem to lack even a basic understanding of fundamental concepts like the three-act structure, blocking/staging, or shot sizes.

For example, I recently had marks deducted because my professor claimed that a close-up shot I used was actually an extreme close-up. To clarify, the shot was indeed a close-up, quite similar to the iconic ""Here’s Johnny"" shot from The Shining. When I challenged this, asking him what he would consider a shot focusing on just the eyes, mouth, hand, or nose, he said it was a ""cut-in"" shot. Frankly, I’ve never encountered ""cut-in"" as a term for a shot size in any academic or professional context—it refers to a type of edit, not a shot size.

Additionally, the instructors often make us analyze critically panned films, urging us to focus on basic themes and cookie cutter lessons rather than on the craftsmanship of the art—be it the editing, the screenplay, or the visual aesthetics.

Is this the standard for film education globally, or is the Turkish system uniquely flawed? I'd love to hear your insights.

I took an edible and watched “Smile 2” (yeah i know that was stupid) and I’m really just whelmed about. Not over, not under, but just kinda “meh”. The performances were great. Naomi Scott absolutely killed it. I think the thing that’s making me think about it and making me wonder if it would have worked was if in the marketing and advertising for the movie, the audience didn’t know that she was a pop star. I mean the joke as soon as the movie was announced was that it’d be someone at a concert in front of a bunch of people, but I just keep thinking what if the marketing led us in a completely different direction making the audience think that she was maybe just a daughter to someone with money and the final “twist” of the movie was us finding out that she was some famous pop star that offs herself in front of thousands. I just feel like that ending would have been a lot more of a shocker added on. I obviously don’t know how that would work but who knows.

movies,Thriller fans should check out The Last Stop In Yuma County,"This is highly impressive debut by Francis Galluppi, who's set to direct the next Evil Dead movie. It's a single-locatio thriller that takes place in a diner in the middle of a desert highway. Two of the guests are bank robbers who are on the run but their car has run out of gas, and one of them is played by a truly menacing Richard Brake. It's similar to movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Hate, and The Standoff at Sparrow Creek in that it's only a matter of time until the tension erupts into violence, but Galluppi does a great job at squeezing tension out of the littlest moments until the poop hits the fan.

movies,Horror films without omnipotent villains,"Hi all,

I watch a decent amount of horror films and a trope that I hate in the genre is when the villains are seemingly omnipotent by which I mean this like:

1. They win no matter what
2. Nothing they do ever fails in any way
3. Nothing the main characters do has any impact on the outcome
4. Even if the main characters destroy/win somehow the villain is just back at the end

This can look a lot of ways depending on the kind of villain in the film but the principal is similar. 

I personally find these kids of endings really boring I think because they feel totally unreal and not analogous to the real world as I perceive it. I once complained about this regarding a specific movie and a friend said she loved the ending because it was realistic (she's a very cynical person). 

I'm wondering what you guys think of this trope on general. Anyone else find it boring and tired like me?

Also do any of you have any suggestions for good horror films that somehow subvert this?

Films that I think subvert this and are good include:
The Orphanage (Spanish film)
Babadook
Alien
The mist (though holy hell that ending has it's own problems lol)

But the thing that I can't come to terms with, and tears me out of the movie logic, is Captain Queenan. In the context of the movie, I just don't know what to make of him.

Here's a world where everyone is double crossing everyone, where every organization is more corrupt than the next, everyone has their own motives and is playing their own game.

And then we've got Queenan, who seems to be this pure and virtuous man, uncorrupted by his environment. And yet he's risen to a high rank in a corrupt organization! And he's supposed to be this mastermind that runs undercover operations. It is impossible for someone in that position to be as naive and innocent as Queenan is portrayed to be.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \- 83 (24 Reviews)

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):

&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director’s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):

&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):

&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.

[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):

&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):

&gt;Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):

&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.

[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):

&gt;It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):

&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.

The Independent (100):

&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.

Written and Directed by Robert Eggers:

&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.

movies,Gone Baby Gone (2007) is the ultimate moral conundrum on film. Lots of spoilers.,"I first saw Gone Baby Gone the day it opened in theaters, mostly because I was more curious to see how Ben Affleck's directorial debut turned out after four years of him being the punchline of every Bennifer joke in existence throughout that weird period in pop culture. But also because I saw it was an adaptation of another Boston-set Dennis Lehane novel, and Mystic River became an instant favorite of mine in late 2003, and everything I'd read about the novel Gone Baby Gone convinced me this was gonna be another Lehane multi-layered mystery tragedy. I loved it after leaving the theater, but I didn't expect it to stick with me as long as it did. Patrick's decision to get Jack Doyle arrested once he figured out the entire conspiracy behind Amanda's kidnapping making all the other characters hate him for giving Amanda back to her mother is one of the reasons it stuck with me; I kept asking myself over and over if he made the right decision. Was doing the legally correct thing the morally correct choice?

When it was released on DVD and I got to rewatch it, it finally hit me why the ending stuck with me so much; other than Helene going right back to her old self now that Amanda was home safely, Amanda correcting Patrick on her doll's name hit me like a fucking Mack truck. Throughout the entire movie, Amanda being taken while in possession of her doll named Mirabelle is mentioned several times; Patrick, now on babysitting duty because Helene didn't think to hire one for her date with a ""fan"" of her talk show interviews, sees Amanda playing with her doll and asks, ""Is that Mirabelle?"" Little Amanda responds with ""Annabelle"". 

Now, it's entirely possible this was a new doll purchased for Amanda after Mirabelle took a dip in that quarry's lake, but the look on Patrick's face before it cuts to the credits tells me he realized in that moment that **no one,** not even Amanda's aunt who hired and then stiffed Patrick and Angie, knew the actual name of Amanda's doll, since the media reported multiple times that Amanda had her ""doll named Mirabelle"". Helene and Bea likely would've corrected the record that the doll's name was Annabelle since they were the only two characters who actually wanted the mystery of Amanda's kidnapping solved. But no one corrected the record, so ""Mirabelle"" was the name mentioned several times *until* Amanda corrected Patrick; it's that look on his face as [Alexi Murdoch's ""Through the Dark""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPng8o3zDqM) starts playing that made me realize why this movie stuck with me so much. Patrick put his life and relationship on the line to save this little girl for a woman whom everyone else saw as the drug addicted neglectful horror show of a mother she had been, and lost pretty much everything for doing it: Angie left him and hated him for ripping Amanda away from the nice police captain in the nice, safe home and giving her back to Helene and *didn't* even get paid for all the shit he and Angie went through.

Patrick is the ***only*** character who sees how much pain and torment Helene is experiencing, which explains his ultimate decision and why Angie hates him for it; Angie was never around to see how truly sorry Helene was for her actions leading to Amanda's kidnapping. While others, and the audience, may rightfully disagree with Patrick's decision, pay attention to the times when Helene breaks down on your next rewatch, and you'll better understand why Patrick chose the way he did; no one else saw that side of Helene, they just saw the drug addicted neglectful mother, which was used as the justification for a whole bunch of crimes. Also, I think Patrick's Catholic guilt over executing Corwin Earle was another big deciding factor in him trying to do what he saw as the morally and legally correct choice, and Remy's little motivational speech -- which got the ball rolling for Patrick to realize the truth behind Amanda's kidnapping -- outside the hospital did *nothing* to relieve Patrick's guilt, nor did Angie's pride in Patrick for it. And *goddamn* was Ed Harris a fucking powerhouse in that scene outside the hospital after Nick was shot. If 2007 hadn't been so stacked with amazing Supporting Acting nominations, including Casey Affleck himself as Robert Ford, I'm betting Harris would've been nominated, even if he had *zero* chance of beating Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh.

I also think it's interesting how the *major* mystery of the movie is seemingly solved an hour before the movie ends. But as this was yet another Dennis Lehane multi-layered crime mystery, it makes sense. Little Amanda running out that door and happily jumping into Doyle's arms was one of the biggest mind fucks in a movie since finding out that Dave Boyle was &gt;!entirely innocent of Katie Markum's murder, that he'd actually murdered a pedophile\*!&lt; in Mystic River, making [""The last time I saw Dave Boyle was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9k-uO50300) one of the most tragic movie quotes of this first quarter century. Doyle's entire justification speech to convince Patrick not to report this is the centerpiece of the story's main thesis on doing what's legally or morally correct, which is also apparently the main topic of the [novel's sequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_\(novel\)) Angie's tearful ""She's happy here. I saw her."" does nothing to help Patrick's difficult decision.

Fuck, I love this movie. It's a great addition to the New England Tragedy pentalogy dominated by the brothers Affleck: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Manchester by the Sea. Oh, and it needs to be said that Harry Gregson-Williams' scores for this and The Town are some of the most haunting film scores in the last 20 years.

And RIP to both Michael K. Williams -- still weird to see him in a police uniform after knowing him as Omar Little for so long -- and John Ashton, who just passed away in September.

movies,Italian cinema: a brief summary from my POV,"# This is a summary of my thoughts on Italian cinema and its evolution, with a FOCUS ON ITS DECLINE AND RETURN. I’d love to hear other perspectives and expand the discussion. What do you think?

* **Golden Age:** The triumphs of Italian cinema.
* **Decline:** The exploitation of cinema and loss of relevance in the 1980s.
* **Mediaset Monopoly:** How Mediaset and generalist TV took over.
* **Internet &amp; Streamers:** The rebirth driven by the internet and streaming platforms.

# Golden Age

Italian cinema has always been a global powerhouse. During the silent film era, Italy produced massive historical epics, featuring hundreds of extras and drawing from its rich history (from the Roman Empire to *The Divine Comedy* and beyond).

During World War II, Italian cinema shifted toward propaganda, moving away from artistic creativity to serve political power.

After the war, *neorealism* was born. While Hollywood was stuck under restrictive production codes, Italian filmmakers were telling raw, universal stories about post-war struggles—groundbreaking narratives that resonated far beyond Italy’s borders.

# Decline: The Exploitation of Cinema

In the '60s and '70s, Hollywood abandoned its production codes, and by the '80s, the advent of visual effects caused a major shift. The U.S. soared to new global heights in filmmaking, far surpassing Italian cinema.

Italy, meanwhile, struggled to modernize. The loss of the neorealist pioneers left a vacuum, and new filmmakers turned to short-sighted strategies. They leaned into low-budget projects that mimicked blockbuster aesthetics, piggybacking on Hollywood trends to squeeze out quick profits. This led to a drop in quality and, more importantly, respect from audiences. Italian cinema became synonymous with mediocrity.

# Mediaset Monopoly

Around the same time, television was rising as a dominant force in entertainment, pulling audiences away from theaters. By the late '80s, Mediaset was founded.

Through the '90s and 2000s, Mediaset capitalized on this shift, creating a cultural monopoly. Anything produced or aired by Mediaset was consumed by the vast majority of Italians, if not the entire audience.

Mediaset cultivated its own *star system*, building celebrities rather than artists. The cultural output during this era? Talk shows, game shows, reality TV, and low-quality films and series—cheaply produced and aimed purely at generating profit and mindless entertainment.

# Internet &amp; Streamers: A Rebirth

With the rise of the internet, younger generations shifted their attention online, leaving behind the Mediaset-dominated culture that had shaped Italy for decades.

By the 2010s, platforms like YouTube had become major hubs for youth entertainment. Around 2018, streaming services started cutting into Mediaset’s once-dominant share. Netflix led the charge, followed by Prime Video and Sky. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram later became central sources of creative content.

Today, Mediaset’s cultural monopoly is largely a thing of the past, especially among younger Italians. While older generations (those from the '70s and '80s) still keep their TVs tuned to Rai or Mediaset for programs like *Wheel of Fortune* with Gerry Scotti, younger people see traditional TV as outdated. It’s not personalized, it feels repetitive, and it’s not delivering high-quality content.

After 40 years of cultural decline—from the exploitation of cinema to Mediaset’s reign—streamers have brought international standards to their Italian productions. They effortlessly outcompete the trashy, generalist programming of traditional TV. Meanwhile, social media is fostering a new wave of original, satisfying, and artistic content.

A fresh *star system* is emerging, centered on genuine artistic quality rather than the superficial generalism that defined past generations.

movies, Favorite movie by european country: Serbia,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in San Marino. As expected, it wasn't easy to find any movie that fits to the criteria here, but I think, we've found a winner which in a way reflects the heart of this journey very well: ***Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino*** (engl.: *The Unknown Man of San Marino*) is absolutely one of those hidden gems I hoped to find during this project.

Today, I think, it will be easier again to find movies and to be honest, I think, that it's very easy to guess the winner that will take its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). We turn our attention to **Serbia** and, as always, have only two rules to follow:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.

But I'm confused about its ending. Why did Ruby's husband want to kill Mary?

Marry accepted to operate surgery because Ruby gave her a bunch of money for that. Then Rudy got doll-like body. Ruby's husband tried to kill Mary when he found out that his wife body is like a doll.

For example there is that famous head splitting scene from T2 that you need to freeze the frame to see. Guy's head splits before being shot at. [https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png](https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png)

My husband and I are currently in the middle of a miscarriage. We are devastated but getting through it together. Husband took some time off work and we mostly like watching movies to distract us. 

Unfortunately, there's been a few movies that have some content that have been a little grim to watch, like we watched the new beetlejuice movie and there was a scene with a an evil baby popping out and attacking someone. We got through it but want to avoid that type of thing moving forward. 

We love comedy and the occasional thriller. We were thinking of watching the Smile 2 but I wanted to see if anyone here knew if there's any content in it that would be hard for us to watch rn. We understand it's a horror movie and expect that, but particularly if there's any baby type scenes we want to know.

movies,Do you feel alien or alone with your taste for movies? ,"I'm in my fifties and, i've been an international film lover since my teens. It was unlikely that i'd discover the movies i came to love, but i did. I live in a small city in Quebec, and here, it's all about American flicks and movies in French. It took a tourist who came to town to make me discover that beautiful world of foreign movies. 've got nobody to discuss films with, around a cup of coffee. I wish i had! For example, my favorite movie is "" Last life in the universe"" by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang from Thailand. It was released in 2003, and i still watch it once a year. I'm also a big fan of the work of Tsai Ming Liang from Taiwan. His movies hold a very dear place in my heart. Over the years, i've seen tons of movies that were never released in local cinemas, that never went popular here. When i'm trying to make friends, it always kind of upsets people that i don't "" encourage"" our local culture. I mean, i wish i could enjoy it, but i don't. What can one do? I've never come across people here, who know the movies i love, and that's kinda sad.....( just a little)

movies,They Live (1988) and it's concept ,"It was in my watchlist for such a long time, finally decided to watch it and blew me away completely. John Carpenter is a visionary! Has anyone of you saw it in the theatres? Or were you there when it was released?

Have you seen Men In Black or The Matrix or Fight Club? This movie felt like it had all of that! And maybe somewhat an inspiration for the movie I mentioned.

They Live dir. By *John Carpenter* is a story of a man, played by Roddy Piper who has come to City in search of a job, but is shocked when he sees the _*reality of this world*_. There are aliens living among us, and they are controlling everything.

Advertisements, News Channels, Politics, everything... everything is a LIE. They are controlling us with different mediums, changing our Subconscious mind and bending our reality, turning us into servants, into Livestock. 

_""We are Sleeping, They are living.""_

If you're someone who is into Illuminati, Secret Society, you'll love this film.

Though some moments felt janky in acting, but that's because the lead is probably the first WWF Turned Actor. Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.

This movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.

The runtime is about 1hr 30mins, and even if you watch this type of films or not, you should watch it just for the concept.",apple15332,1h5d41h,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,2024-12-03 02:35:57,82,0.84,82,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5d41h

movies,Heat (1995)….Most beautiful movie line I’ve heard ,"In Heat… there’s 2 parts that stick out to me… many great scenes overall

But when Val Kilmer’s character tells DeNiro “for me the sun rises and sets with her” when talking about his wife and why he can’t leave her. Then at the end… they are both in a relationship where they fight a lot.. both have been unfaithful and she’s ready to turn him in. But when she sees his innocent genuine smile when he sees her, she can’t bring herself to go against him and realizes she still loves him despite all their issues and signals to him to run away. I loved that dynamic

Also the part where the Dennis Heybert’s character (the AllState commercial guy) is sitting with his gf and he feels like a failure. He tells her “why you rolling around with me for?” and starts crying. And she reassures him and tells him because she’s proud of him for trying. 

2 scenes/dynamics that are relatable and just hit deep. One is a relationship that has had many issues and in turmoil but deep down, the two still love eachother. The other is a man who feels like he can’t offer nothing and the woman is reassuring him that he is enough.",HeightsGringo180,1h4zhqt,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4zhqt/heat_1995most_beautiful_movie_line_ive_heard/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4zhqt/heat_1995most_beautiful_movie_line_ive_heard/,2024-12-02 16:51:32,300,0.9,300,0,180,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4zhqt

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

movies,"It’s about time we talk about LA Story (1991) written and starring Steve Martin, is this his best comedy? ","I remember watching this with my parents when I was younger, prob around 95. I was born 88 so I didn’t have any ability to pick up any of the satire but I remember enjoying it.

I have a bad habit of not rewatching movies I’ve seen since there’s so much out there, no matter how young I was when I first saw it, but my wife showed me a clip from the film off Instagram and we laughed and decided to give it a try and let me tell you it blew us away. We were crying laughing while totally engaged. 

It’s a perfect LA satire and probably the only American Magical Realism film I’ve ever seen (I’m more familiar with the genre coming from Mexico).  Everything is pitch perfect. It’s a tight 91 minutes, edited beautifully, perfect writing from Steve Martin, directed as only I could imagine it and the casting is insane. Every side character and bit part is an amazing character actor from the 90s. 

And the leads are played beautifully by Richard Grant who I know from his performance in Withnail and I. Victoria tennent plays the love interest who is a beautiful actress who got stuck with bad roles most her career, but honestly Sarah Jessica Parker steals the show with her pre-emptive manic pixie dream girl. 

I think this is a movie that although critically acclaimed went over most peoples heads and was forgotten. But I sit here now thinking it’s just leapt to my favorite comedy of all time. It’s so sharp and witty and well executed and magical and of it’s time. I don’t think anyone can argue that Steve Martin is a comedic writing force and it shows in this movie. 

If you haven’t seen it watch it as soon as you can, if you have what do you think about my analysis and how it’s held up and its legacy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

My favorite joke so when Sarah Jessica Parker is trying to seduce Steve Martin and guides his hand down to cup her breast. He squeezes and makes a face and says “your breasts feel weird” and she says “oh, yeah, that’s cause they are real…”

movies,Nutcrackers (2024) starring Ben Stiller ruined my day,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  
  
Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can’t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he’s ruined.
  
It’s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn’t exist. This is one of those times. The movie’s not entertaining, it’s not dramatic, it’s just pointless. I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it’s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time. You’ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

movies,"Were the Detectives at the beginning of ""A Bronx Tale"" Paid off/Fake cops?","Just a thought i Had while rewatching A Bronx Tale at the part where the 2 detectives ask C who the shooter was. I thought it because It's just really strange, Firstly them knowing C was a witness, how would they know that? Did a witness tell them? And if so why didn't they ask THAT witness what they thought rather than the child, furthermore how did that witness know what C's name was? Secondly, they never bring C or Lorenzo to a police station or something that looks more formal, they just line some guys up on the street and ask C who did it, And Thirdly all the suspects were in the mafia. There's more, like how they're both Italian American And It's a very strange way to ask a witness what they thought. As to why the Mafia would do this, It's likely a way to see if they thought C was worthy of becoming a mobster later in life as they've seen him at the bar before looking at sonny, though Sonny wasn't the boss at this point so this might be unlikely, It's also possible this was just to determine if they should kill C or silence him somehow incase the Real police were to ask him. There's some parts that make me think otherwise, like how there is other cops there but they could easily be bribed/fake too, and that mainly, it makes sonny's character look way worse morally but then again he wouldn't be calling the shots at this point and that Mafia dressing up as police is a little silly but has happened before..

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

It's darkly comedic and sometimes tragic and it manages both emotions with ease.

movies,I don't get Beau is Afraid. At all.,"Most of the time, even when I like/love a movie, I can tell why someone might disagree (I love Avatar 2, but I agree with like 90% of the criticism and see them as valid). And vice versa, even if I hate something, I can usually tell why someone might like it (Infinity Pool was hot garbage to me, but I can see where somebody can be enthralled by the premise). I cannot do that with Beau is Afraid. It's just pure ass to me. Spoilers ahead.

The plot boils down to ""A controlling mother orchestrates her son's (Beau's) journey back home, torturing him every step of the way, only to kill him in the end"". This movie is noted as an absurdist black comedy- on its Wikipedia, so this isn't my perspective-, but it's not funny. I've literally laughed more watching Saw movies. I get dark humor, but dark humor has to have a proper target. There's no rocket science. It's a two-step process: remove sympathy for the target, then hurt them in unexpected ways. Beau is Afraid seemed to have skipped step one, so it feels like watching someone drown a sack of puppies for two hours.

And the ""absurdist' angle doesn't work either. First off, all of the absurdity except for maybe the penis monster is mundane. The disparity between the scenes and reality are a light parody filter at-best. Characters weren't outrageous, they were just caricatures; I could easily see all of them in a GTA cutscene. Not old wacky GTA, but new, exaggerated-shitty-realistic GTA. Secondly, even that level of absurdity is watered down by the reveal that the mother's been orchestrating everything. Suddenly, the scenes like everything at the doctor's house and the time where everyone walked into his apartment complex become fully explained and there's no absurdity to it at all. I'll admit, the penis monster is a surprise, but it's a surprise 1:30 into the movie; it's a little late to try to establish the genre you claim to be. 

I'm not 100% hating 100% of its aspects. Visually, it has its moments, and the acting is fine, too, but good visuals and solid performances can't cover for shit writing and a hollow premise

I'm just hoping someone can articulate what they liked about this movie so I can stop thinking I'm insane for seeing anything else than a pile of dogshit compressed into film reel.",Kangarou,1h65zv7,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65zv7/i_dont_get_beau_is_afraid_at_all/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65zv7/i_dont_get_beau_is_afraid_at_all/,2024-12-04 02:58:18,0,0.41,0,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h65zv7
movies,Trying to figure out a movie title,"Ok so it's a horror/comedy about an asian(?) Burglar and his girlfriend who work with 1 or 2 others.  The beginning of the movie has the main character arrested during a botched job.  Either he goes to jail or can't get in trouble again without going to jail...but he needs money for a debt I believe.  His girlfriend convinces him to take 1 last job with 1 goofy really tall burglar who's sort of a gangsta asian dude maybe he was her brother?  So they break into a guy's house and find a woman chained in the basement and then they free her.  I remember the twist at the endingish being that it was her kink to be chained down there and she was with the killer home owner all along.  
It was a very similar movie to the collector series,  that war veteran movie where the kids break in, but for the life of my I can't find the name anywhere online from Google searches.  It was kind of low budget....legit hilarious at times and really well made I feel like for it's budget.
Anyone have any clue wtf I'm talking about?
For some reason I feel like the cover of the movie had artwork with a green background like lime green maybe.

movies,Krazy House (2024) is insane (for fans of Kevin Can F*** Himself),"Set in 1990, Krazy House starts as a typical late-80’s, early 90’s sitcom called The Christians that looks like an amalgamation of both Married with Children and King of Queens. Like those shows, it’s filmed in front of a live studio audience and starts out in a very light hearted, goofy way. Bernie Christian, the matriarch of the family, is juggling his faith and his family. He’s the stereotypical Kevin James kind of protagonist who means well, but continuously causes more problems than he’s solving. When he’s not falling down the stairs (much to the delight of the studio audience), he’s breaking everything that isn’t nailed down, much to the chagrin of his modern, breadwinning wife, Eva. His indifferent, gum smacking daughter Sarah and son Adam, a burgeoning scientist, are opportunities for life lessons about being good people and looking towards the lord. Sounds like the perfect setup for a religious TV show for those times; you know the type - a character walks through the front door and the crowd goes wild?

However, when a trio of Russian handymen show up at the door, things take a turn…and the studio audience doesn’t pop for them. See, Bernie has (as he usually does), caused a mess in the kitchen. His stew bubbles over and he messes up the sink, adding to the kitchen destruction he caused earlier when his arm caught on fire and he lit up the wall. After initially dismissing the Russians, he lets them in to fix the problem…but the problems at the Christian house have only just begun. Once the Russians are in, the show takes an insanely dark turn and it only gets more bonkers from there. While the film starts as a deconstruction of the nuclear family sitcom, it ends as a bloody mess where no one is safe.

This one is for fans of absurd horror/comedies or things skewering nostalgic TV (Late Night with the Devil, Kevin Can F\*\*\* Himself).

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Russia. I'm not really sure, if I offended people here, but I did get quite a few downvotes for it. Fortunately, I also got some very good film suggestions (I would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants again) and we also have a winner: ***Сталкер*** (engl. Stalker), a movie by the legendary Andrei Tarkovsky, will receive the next entry in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Today, I know, that it will become much harder to just find a fitting movie, but following the alphabetical order, we move to the next letter - and this time, there are many countries waiting for us that start with an S - an S like **San Marino**, for example. And everytime there will be only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Jim Carreys Grinch is the Definitive adaptation. Yeah I said it.,"Rewatched the Jim Carrey Grinch movie tonight. Idc what anyone says, this is the definitive version of the story. Don't get me wrong, the original animated short is a classic and always will be, but the Jim Carrey version will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the only Dr. Seuss film that updates the original story, while still sticking true to what the original book standed for, if not enhances it.

Not to mention the set design is absolutely phenomenal, and Jim Carrey as The Grinch is everything. Not just the makeup work, which is also phenomenal, but his performance as well. Unlike Mike Myers Cat in the Hat, who was just phoning it in to the point where it felt like he didn't even want to be there, Jim Carrey put 110% into his performance, he almost became one with the suit and captured the character perfect, while still adding his own energenic flair that Carrey is known for.

It's not perfect, not all the jokes land, I could do without seeing Grinch's face in....um......Melons, and while ""Where are you Christmas"" Is a beautiful song, in the context of the film, it feels out of place, especially since it's not a musical. But overall, I absolutely love this underrated classic, and I'm glad it's finally getting the recognition it deserves. Especially after the shit piece from Illumination.

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",PresentRevenue1347,1h4lwrm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,2024-12-02 03:41:52,144,0.75,144,0,107,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4lwrm

movies,"In Interstellar, Romilly’s decision to stay aboard the ship while the other 3 astronauts experience time dilation has to be one of the scariest moments ever. ","He agreed to stay back. Cooper asked anyone if they would go down to Millers planet but the extreme pull of the black hole nearby would cause them to experience severe time dilation. One hour on that planet would equal 7 years back on earth. Cooper, Brand and Doyle all go down to the planet while Romilly stays back and uses that time to send out any potential useful data he can get.

Can you imagine how terrifying that must be to just sit back for YEARS and have no idea if your friends are ever coming back. Cooper and Brand come back to the ship but a few hours for them was 23 years, 4 months and 8 days of time for Romilly. Not enough people seem to genuinely comprehend how insane that is to experience. He was able to hyper sleep and let years go by but he didn’t want to spend his time dreaming his life away.

It’s just a nice interesting detail that kind of gets lost. Everyone brings up the massive waves, the black hole and time dilation but no one really mentions the struggle Romilly must have been feeling. 23 years seems to be on the low end of how catastrophic it could’ve been. He could’ve been waiting for decades.
