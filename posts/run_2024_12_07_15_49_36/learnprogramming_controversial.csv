learnprogramming,Is it really worth it pursuing CS/SWE,"As the title says, I’m wondering if it’s really worth still pursuing a CS/SWE degree at this point. It’s almost 2025 and a lot of people have been saying that CS is the new art degree or that’s it’s nearly impossible to even get a job as a junior engineer (since many listings say you need like 2-5 YOE). 

The main thing is I’m currently a year and a half away (around summer to fall 2026) from graduating with a degree in software development. The school I’m going to doesn’t really go over much coding but more into the technical aspects of how code works instead. So, I’ve been trying to learn on my own outside of school on things such as Java and Spring Boot. But after seeing all the posts and people saying how hard it is to get a job, employers not replying back or sending rejecting letters, and applying to 100+ jobs, I’ve lost motivation to keep pursuing becoming an SWE.

I did make some dummy Go packages and published them on Github and downloaded then right away in my Go project which tells me that all Go packages are hosted on git repos and not on pkg.go.dev and that a Go package does not need to be listed on pkg.go.dev in order to download it for your project.

To my understanding, npm, JSR, Packagist, pub.dev and crates.io host the source code of the package? Why do package repositories exist?

\- Then he will be able to see data about the customer (or even fast order as last the one), edit/create new address  
\- Then he will be able to mention how many pizzas  
\- Then he will be able to apply slices amount and toppings (for example onions on 2 slices)  
\- Then he will be asked to ""pay"" (will just click continue cuz it is not real)  
\- Then the order will be move to ""in progress"" and there will be able to put ""On Delivery""

Roles:  
\- Employee - will be able to create orders, update status  
\- Manager - has everything as employee, but will be able to CRUD employee

learnprogramming,Resuming programming studies after a break,"Hello  
  
I want to get back to studying programming, which I stopped doing almost a year ago due to life circumstances. I’m not sure if I’ll end up pursuing it professionally or not, though at the time, I started with the idea of finding a job. I’m 32 years old, and I don’t know if it’s too late. Regardless, it’s something I’d like to keep learning.

I started learning on my own because I got into programming out of necessity, having to deal with scripts written in LUA without any prior knowledge. I should mention that I’ve been using computers since I was a kid, although I never focused on studying anything related to them in depth. As a result, I’m quite comfortable with computers and started teaching myself through YouTube and the internet in general. I tried an online cybersecurity course (Cisco) and also video game development with Unity. In the end, I chose web development and took a couple of free courses, not very in-depth, offered by the employment service in my country, the last one being a full-stack course with Laravel and Angular. And here come my questions.

I don’t like frontend work very much, meaning creating designs and making everything look nice. I prefer backend, databases, and those kinds of things. Although I understand that it’s important to have basic knowledge of how to create a simple frontend. So my question is, after this time and having been completely disconnected, should I continue where I left off, with JS and PHP? Would you recommend any other language or framework for building web applications? Is there something I could focus on that doesn’t require frontend work?

Any advice is appreciated

learnprogramming,Replacing a spreadsheet with a web app?,"I have a book tracker spreadsheet, specifically a Google sheet with some Google App Script and unusual functions (for a book tracker spreadsheet)

I would like to learn some coding to replace it with something easier to edit on my phone/tablet ( adding data is easy , editing on android is clunky). I'm aware basic book trackers seem to be a very common coding project and normally I'd look for something pre existing and try to tweak it but none of the existing examples I can find seem to fit what I want to do at all so I figure now is a good time to learn some ""proper"" coding.

My thoughts are to make a web app so that I can acess it across Android, Windows and Linux as I use all 3 (I already know a bit of HTML/CSS/javascript). Have the data in some kind of database that I can host locally (have a small home NAS I should be able to put it on) so I can back up CSV data in case I want to move back to a spreadsheet, and to have something else like Python to do the query, calculations and generate graphs/pie charts (I belive matplotlib should do this)

But this is where I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with info and weighing up pros and cons, I'm not a professional by any means, I just play around with things for fun so I think my lack of correct terminology is hindering me in my searches ... but I am currently  looking at either: 

Python &amp; SQLite- this seems to be the simplest option for installing and as an added bonus Calibre library management software uses Python for plugins so I might be able to get some kind of integration

Or

Django &amp; postgresSQL - Django seems to get mentioned a lot when it comes to Python as making things easier for web/server things but I can't seem to find in what ways, I've seen a lot of people say that postgreSQL is their favorite too but I'm not sure any of the advantages will apply to me as a single user 

Or

Maybe I'm just barking to the wrong tree entirely and should consider a different  approach entirely from Python?

1. Is there still opportunity/ Job security? 

2. Is it worth all the effort to learn it ? 

3. Is there really a lot of age discrimination? 

I have been leaning coding for a bit now, and everytime it starts to get really hard I ask myself am I just wasting my time anyway? I love the idea of being able to build whatever I need for home use, but as far as a career 

Things I keep hearing 

It's so hard to get a job just to be laid off a few months later.

projects to learn coding that would give med school a run for its money. 

If you are in your 30s which I am you are considered unable to keep up.

learnprogramming,Am I just not getting this?,"Hey guys!  


I have been learning C++ independently now for almost a month! Needless to say, I am working on a Rock, Paper, Scissors game right now and I was having an issue where I am using cin to gather a char for my  loops and functions, but I was testing it to see what kind of problems would arise if... say someone entered something greater than a single char. Problem happened obviously, and then I tried to fix the problem on my own, nothing I did would work. I then checked out a couple of stackoverflow questions and even posted one myself! (Which I'm not super happy about). The StackOverflow question I asked got me pushing in the right direction, introducing me to cin.ignore(). Plugged that into my code, still had the issue! Couldn't find the solution online anywhere... so I resorted to asking CoPilot (AI). Because of that I was able to figure out the missing parameter I needed in the cin.ignore() function. My question is... I feel like I cheated in a way because I had to ask around for help and even resorted to asking AI as well. My goal is to become a professional Software Engineer, and me having to google around and ask help from others including AI kind of gives me second thoughts as to if I can actually do something like this. Is it common for professionals to seek questions and help in this way?

learnprogramming,Figuring out full stack coding?,"So I’ve been researching about web development, let me just get this right, so there’s three parts 

- Desginer (Figma)
- Front end dev (html,CSS,JavaScript)
- back end dev (PHP, JavaScript)

Let me know if I got this right, the designer just makes a glorified Canva template, the figma file doesn’t actually do anything but become a blueprint (headache) for the front end dev which will guide him on where to put containers and such, the front end dev then creates the physical webpages, places the forms, buttons, containers, etc. however these can link to each other but the they don’t actually perform any function.

The back end developer has to take the website from the front end dev and pretty much connect the dots? Get data collected from forms, tell it where to place that data, establish security measures, pretty much make the website function from page to page.

That’s my understanding of everything so far but now I’m learning with code.ai you can just turn images and screenshots into figma designs using ai, and with visual copilot you can now covert figma designs into front end code in React? So if these actually work all that is needed is backend and decent knowledge of front end. Idk if I’m missing something and maybe the ai tools aren’t all that great yet but I still feel as if front end feels like a lot of work and bit excessive and I also feel as if most people could replace designers by making there own design on figma or just screenshooting a design they like and editing from there.

learnprogramming,HELP! Help me understand E-R diagram of these entities,"Hello everyone, I've been trying for more than a week to create the E-R diagram for these relationships that I'll explain below, but I still don't have a clear understanding. I don't know if it's because of a lack of foundation, or if the situation might be ambiguous. The thing is, I’ve created my first task management application, and it’s working, but the issue of cardinalities in the E-R diagram is still unclear to me.

Let me explain: there are 3 tables: **USERS**, **TASK**, and **TASK\_USERS**.

* **USERS** has Id(PK), Name, Email, and password.
* **TASK** has Id(PK), Title, date, and createdBy(userId FK).
* **TASK\_USERS** relates the user Id and task Id, and has userId(FK) and taskId(FK).
* **USERS** can create 1 or many **TASK**.
* A **TASK** can only be created by 1 **USERS**.
* **USERS** can assign 1 or many **USERS** to a**TASK**.
* Many **USERS** can be assigned to many **TASK**.

This is the schema I created: [https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT](https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT), but I think it’s wrong because I believe the relationships between **USERS-TASK\_USERS** and **TASK-TASK\_USERS**, depending on how you look at it, should both be N:M, right?
