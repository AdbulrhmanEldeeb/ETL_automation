gaming,Question about FFVII REBIRTH,"Hey Hive Mind, 

My partner and I are playing Rebirth and are both big on getting every piece of loot in any game we play. 

This game feels way more open world so far, but does it work like Remake where we hit a point and can no longer go back to old parts of the world? Do we have to do all exploration of the world/loot hunting as the story progresses, or can we just open world travel to check out areas after the story moves us to another part of the world?

Player hit Goblin with a heavy attack inflicting 10 damage

gaming,Choices matter hell...,"I have a very big issue with this type of games.

It's not a rule, but more often than not it completely breaks the game for me.

My problem with those games, is that in most cases you get locked out of part of the content, based on the decisions you made.

In my opinion this is a very poor game design, artificially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs, if you want to see complete content.

As I never do more than one playthrough of any single player game, I feel somewhat robbed of a full experience.

Another complaint that I could log, is that at their launch many of these games are not balanced well enough, meaning if you pick a ""wrong"" side, you might be underpowered, compared to others.

This inherently leads me to not playing them until at least one or two major patches land, or I might skip them completely, if they fall off my radar.

If I am being completely honest, I would also have to blame my OCD, for wanting to see, and do, everything there is in every game I play, and wanting to min-max my character(s) each time.

Anyone else out there, with similar issues?   

Edit: based on early comments, I want to elaborate.

gaming,Bring Back Good Co-Op Games,"Marvel Rivals came out. Was pretty cool for like 15 minutes and then I just felt kinda bored and a little sad. 

I’ve been playing games since the 80s and idk, I’m just tired of PvP stuff. Really missing the cooperative games of old.

I remember stuff like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or Left 4 Dead or Gauntlet Legends or Halo or even Destiny or the arcade beat em ups like X-men or the Simpsons or Turtles game when it first came out and these games were just so epic and fostered such great teamwork and camaraderie. Helluva dope feeling and rush having to work together to win. Especially back in the days of arcades, nothing cooler than actually assembling 4 people dedicated to pulling it off.

Idk. Everything just feels so competitive, battle royale, hero shootery, and it’s just beginning to feel unnecessary and kinda forced and stale.

Maybe I’m just feeling nostalgic and outta touch lol but I feel like bringing these kinds of great co-op games back in a modern sense in actual abundance would really inject some love and positive vibes back into the community while also, bringing in a whole new demographic of gamers looking for something less demanding and stressful than PvP gaming which I feel like is just low key bloating the market at this point.

P.S. this is no dig Marvel Rivals or to gamers that enjoy these games, I’m just getting this off my chest lol sorry it’s late, I’m high, rant over.

lol nope just a husband, father, business owner and student. I’ve been playing games since the 80s. I know major titles and indie games exist guys no offense lol. Mostly all the ones that have been named so far are not new names to me or games I haven’t tried at some point that just didn’t capture my interest.

Edit: Idk why I’m getting downvoted so much lmao are you taking offense to the fact that I just don’t like the games you’re suggesting as much as you or others do or haven’t played them? 

Idk I think I’ve been pretty respectful about the games I have talked about, even the ones I may not care for as well but idk. Either way, I’ve played Indie game guys. I’ve played games like stardew valley (well technically my wife played and I watched) or warhammer (specifically the vermintide one) and that was honestly years ago. Maybe I’m wrong but, those I don’t feel like are recent games (came out this year) and when I did watch/play them, they weren’t my cup of tea. I guess I should have been specific (like when I mentioned Destiny, I meant specifically the first one as I played 2 and did not care for it as much).

I’m almost 40 and a pretty avid gamer blessed to be able to play a PLETHORA of games over the last few years through different means (work, personal life, events), with 2 kids and a wife who are all also gamers either various taste whether that be in console (we have most past and present) or game type. I do not live under a rock, maybe a more a pineapple under the sea and my only burden is the business of life but, I’ve still found time to do my gaming and follow my hobbies (for business/pleasure) so I’m not completely out the loop.

I’ve had some great suggestion here to help solidify the push to try certain titles (maybe the art style has been putting me off or mechanics or story didn’t capture me) that I have been putting off or stayed away from. And I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and even opinions but let’s not trip on each other off of video games. The post was meant to just be light hearted and random, not this deep dive into my personal gaming preferences or an attack on others interest lol.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs.

Teardown is a game where you can destroy anything and everything. It’s the perfect vandalism/heist game too. But I do not recommend the DLC’s. Most are hit or miss. But there is a modding community that frequently makes new content for others to play.

As for Children of the Sun. It’s a game where you have one single Sniper Rifle bullet, and you must make the bullet change trajectory to kill multiple enemies. 

Think of it like the Sniper Elite games, but it’s also a puzzle as well. You have to find out the best path and use shortcuts to your advantage.

gaming,Ghost of Yotei pushback,"So, the latest anti-woke controversy is brewing, and it's giving me a lot of amusement, honestly.

Not gonna delve too far into Ghost of Tsushima because I haven't personally played it, so I'm not able to offer my own opinion on its gameplay or quality, but it was generally highly acclaimed.

Now, following the successful launch of a new IP, the obvious goal for gaming companies is to turn it into a franchise, so a sequel started getting discussed almost before the ink dried on the sales reports. 

Sony just had their - otherwise honestly lackluster - press event to announce upcoming products. 

One of those products was the intended sequel, Ghost of Yotei. As opposed to a direct sequel to the first game, continuing the story specifically of the male protagonist of the first game, Jin Sakai, Sony opted to turn the Ghost series into more of a related anthology apparently; Yotei follows a new character, a female samurai named Atsu.

And there was considerable backlash about that sequel, which Sony apparently didn't expect. 

That backlash has split into three slightly overlapping camps; I'll discuss two before zoning in on one specifically.

The first, and honestly the most reasonable and valid of them, is the gamers who were specifically looking for a continuation of Jin's story. Disappointment there is totally understandable; regardless of how complete a story is, if you are invested in the character, you want there to be more. More time with them, more insight into them, more story about them, more interaction with them, more. 

Since Yotei is still in development, we don't know how much of that there is. It's entirely possible that Sony is taking a page from Mad Max here and using the first game as an origin story for someone who then appears as a recurring character in other people's stories; we *do not know.*

But that viewpoint, that **""we wanted more Jin and this isn't that, wtf""** is the sane people objection to the announcement.

Second is objection to the voice actress. This is less reasonable but comprehensible, because Erika Ishii is a known and outspoken activist. This doesn't affect their voicework in the game one tiny bit - and the people who have discussed it so far have said it is absolutely top notch - but if you disagree with someone's personal stances, disapproving of their choice for your media is understandable.

For me, Erika is a fantastic choice; if you're not familiar, they are on Dimension 20 and a lot of other Dropout network stuff, and is a fairly prominent activist for LQBTQIA+ rights, but they're also immensely talented, creative, and funny. Especially on Dimension 20 you can see this; their characters are usually only second to Emily Axford's routinely game breaking creativity in terms of their impact, and despite their often super extra appearance on the show, they are very very good at submerging herself into the character, which is honestly literally the entire goal of voice acting for video games.

So, the people who are objecting to the game based on Erika have, you know, no taste and are also bigots, but at least it's a comprehensible sort of consistent bigotry.

The third group of objectors, however, is the one I think is funniest.

Now, I'm gonna reveal something totally unimportant that actually I promise will be sort of relevant: in video games, I almost always play a female character. *(In fact, one of my very few actual gaming regrets involves this; right after launch, I decided to play Genshin Impact with two accounts, one for each Traveler, and the account playing as Aether, the male Traveler, got so much luckier in the gacha that I ultimately ended up with that as my main account, and I'd frankly much rather be playing as Lumine.)*

My reasoning is, maybe silly, but very simple: I think girls are pretty. If I'm gonna be playing a game for hours on end and staring at a single character the whole time, I'd rather be looking at a girl. Not because I identify as a girl, but because I think looking at girls is a lot more fun than looking at other guys.

So, the third group of people who are objecting to Ghost of Yotei is entirely made up of guys, who are objecting on the exclusive grounds that they don't want to play a female character.

Unlike the other two reasons for objecting to the game, which while not necessarily reasonable are at least based on something that's a real thing, these guys are objecting based on the fact that a virtual avatar - an inherently unreal, sexless thing made of pixels - is shaped with slightly more curves. 

In other words, they're so utterly dedicated to staring at male bodies that the idea of looking at a female body makes them utterly revolted.

Now, as a guy who likes looking at girls, I gotta say, even as heterosexual as I am, I can't imagine being *offended* that I had to look at a guy; the most I can muster would be *disinterest.*

And that's what makes this so funny for me.

Can you even imagine *how* gay you have to be, to be willing to start a huge flame war online over the idea that you might have to *not* stare at a male for hours and hours on end for the entire duration of your gameplay?

That's way gayer than I am straight, man.

They keep saying it's ""woke"" or ""DEI"" as cover.

But y'all.

They're really saying that they *hunger* for those tasty man butts.

That's fucking funny.

Just simply stopping to stand somewhere in the middle of the desert plains, and hearing the haunting music in RDR1 gives this feeling, like the whole game just has this constant, overhanging thick layer of melancholy, no matter where you go.

gaming,Quick review of (almost) all current mini bluetooth controllers!,"Images here: https://imgur.com/a/SZ3VbEy


I love local multiplayer and the easiest way to find people for it is on the go. Lugging around proper full size controllers* would be a chore, and with micro size I can always have even 4 without thinking.

So for starters: my use case is quick plays, 30-90 minutes. Using these regularly for long time would get uncomfortable (and carpal-tunnely I suppose).

The landscape of small controllers is pretty dire to be honest: 8BitDo (for a long time the only option) and rando chinese suppliers.



**8BitDo Lite 2**

It has every button from a classic PS/Xbox layout - including stick click/L3+R3. High quality plastics. Shoulder and trigger button placement is genius and usable. Joystick has a good movement area. Clicks and presses are exquisite. Size is great for the hand, and still light. This is the one controller I could imagine being usable in daily gaming even.

This would be my dream controller. IF it had XInput. Unrelated, but I'm mighty pissed at 8BitDo for not including this with newer models. Yes, these are all aimed for the Switch, but it would have costed next to nothing to add one more mode. Vibration also only works in Switch mode. Yes you can remap with XOutput and the like, but it's a hassle and strangely does not work in every game.

Modes: Switch, Android
Verdict: so close to be perfect, but not reaching it


**8BitDo Zero 2**

My current go-to mini controller. Has XInput. Sadly charges via micro usb (all other are usb-c). No vibration. Buttons feel right. The L/R button is clickable from all directions despite the length, but not really comfortable - which isn't a problem, this size is only used for simple layout games anyway. I wish it would have toggle for modes, there is no visible sign in which it is (toggle is via shortcut combinations).

There is now also a Micro with the same layout as the Q36 below - not ordered becaus missing XInput and I had enough of that after Lite 2)

Modes: Switch, Android, Windows
Verdict: ol' trusty working horse, shows it's age

**LinYuvo Meteor**

Now this is an interesting animal. You can order it for less than half the zero. It has bajillions of color options - I suggest ordering the covered ones, as the LEDs are so bright that you wouldn't want to use them on transparent versions, despite them looking cool as well. It has a circular dpad which I'm neutral about. For some it's easier to hit corners, but it's not as easy as eg. XBox controller's circular one. But it's really clicky, and a bit hard to press, as you can read in the few reviews it has. So dpad is certainly it's biggest drawback. Has vibration. It has a really interesting feature, you can replace keys - dpad with joystick directions and L/R buttons with trigger - without any software, just shortcuts! You can also toggle the light effects and colors, there are quite a few, as gimmick, or turn it off completely (will be remembered).

Verdict: price/features orders of magnitude better than the Zero 2, even Micro. Buttons just don't feel that good, but it's a close call.

**ShanWan Q37**

There exists a version with horizontal and cross (PS and XBox style) joystick placement. You can tell they used CADs from 8BitDo, the inputs have the same appearance - albeit with a very, very cheap plastic. The rounded off body is a bit smaller but thicker and overall harder to hold. But the presses feel ok. There is vibration - both sides even. It has a weird gyro mode in non-switch mode as well where gyro controls the joystick. Can be accidentally triggered and a useless gimmick. But a very welcomed feature is that every single key can be remapped (including this shortcut). It needs a seemingly unrelated mobile app (""GamepadSpace"") - connecting is hacky as you need to enter firmware upload mode - but once done, you are free to customize, even sensitivity, and everything is saved to the controller. This is great, especially since very stupidly in XInput mode the buttons match the switch layout (eg A is B) by default. Until now you would think this is in the endvery ok controller, but you'd be mistaken. Sadly it all falls apart by how incredibly bad quality this controller is. You will get constant disconnects, lag, ghost presses and stuck input. It's just bad, and generic QC issue. I had multiple controllers showing the same sign.

Verdict: It could be the ""good version"" rip-off of 8BitDo, but sadly it's just a mess, and costs the same as 8BitDo.


Modes: Windows/Android, Switch, Playstation

**ShanWan Q36**

The same as Q37, just with copying the 8BitDo Micro form and layout - which makes it even more sad that it's bad.

Modes: Windows/Android, Switch, Playstation


**Keychain controller**

Being available for 8+ years this is more like an afterthought rather than a serious contender, I included it only for fun. But it's by far the smallest you can go! It only has Android and keyboard function. The ""joystick"" is actually moving only on a 2D plane. Very practical and interesting, but a bit hard to move. Buttons are too mushy. But it is useful as a remote, eg. A is mapped to take a photo in Android.

Modes: IOS/Android, Keyboard",poisonborz,1h6svb8,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6svb8/quick_review_of_almost_all_current_mini_bluetooth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6svb8/quick_review_of_almost_all_current_mini_bluetooth/,2024-12-04 22:15:09,12,0.62,12,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6svb8
gaming,I've become a demotivated gamer,"I often get into a new game that I've looked forward to, either at launch or because of discounts on Steam, but then I play for maybe 2-3 hours, a would-be normal session which I would naturally resume the next day or later in the week except... I don't.

I feel like in 2024 I've started so many games that I intended to play through but as soon as I get the first break from them the thought of booting them up again a day later, or the week after declines completely. FTR I don't actually ""game"". I never played League or CS or anything, and even my WoW days clocked in at lvl 50 during the Lich King stuff.

But I always had an affinity for single-player games that are anywhere between 12 hours or 100 hours long. I would get hooked on them, love them and obviously play them until the credits roll, especially RPGs. But now it's weird. I love it, I really have nothing negative to say but I just can't get myself to play it again. For example, I made it to Chapter 3 in Half Life Alyx, finally playing a VR game -- loving it. I don't feel like playing it at all right now. I made it almost to the end of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and I'm like bruh... I don't even hate it like all the haters do, why am I suddenly not playing it anymore?

2) Graphics aren’t an issue.

3) Strategy games are a good shout if they aren’t overwhelming.

4) Need something I can pick up and put down as and when I’ve got 5 minutes.

5) Need to have a story behind them to some degree.

6) Love to grind levels/stats/materials anything but need to have a reason for the grind, grinding for the sake of grinding is a no go.

7) This may be controversial but I love open world/survival/crafting games

Games I’ve played and completed/got bored of recently and don’t want to go back to are as follows.

BG3
Elden Ring
Total war warhammer 3
Final Fantasy 7/9/10/7R

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't buy weapons or armor. Like its predecessors, you also heal out of combat, KOed characters revive after a fight, and in this game, your healers can be revived KOed characters an unlimited number of times during a fight. As a result, a lot of commonly seen RPG items aren't in this game removing a lot you can spend money on.

There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.

The silver lining is that it seems atleast Chinese devs are interested in keeping the genre alive, if games like Lost Soul Aside, Where Winds Meet, and Project Perciever are as good as their trailer like Black Myth was then that will be amazing

Now every game wants to have soulslike mechanics like a bonfire rest/save point that respawns enemies, losing resources on death, single target lock on combat focused around parry and dodge roll, etc",Imaginary_Cause2216,1h6ej0b,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6ej0b/soulslike_are_killing_the_character_action_hack/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6ej0b/soulslike_are_killing_the_character_action_hack/,2024-12-04 12:10:33,0,0.42,0,0,35,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6ej0b

I love mounts and transmogs in wow because I love building my own aesthetic based around my greatest moments.

I have loved games such as The Last of Us, Days Gone, Zelda and so many more and I played almost every day especially since the ps3 days.
Recently my hands and wrists have gotten a little painful so I haven’t played in a few weeks. The thing is I don’t miss it. Right now as it stands if I never played again it wouldn’t kill me.
It made me wonder how many of us are playing for the love of gaming or because it’s become an easy habit to fall into.
When was the last time any of us stopped playing for a week just to catch our breath so to speak?
This is a hobby that can consume thousands of hours.Maybe we should set aside some of those hours in levelling ourselves up rather than our avatars.

After a few minutes of gameplay I was literally hooked. Running around, hearing the old sound effects and all that stuff - everything felt so nostalgic

gaming,I actually found a good mobile game and I want to talk about it. ,"The name of the game is Arcane Rush Battlegrounds. 

It’s a battleroyale card game that’s perfect for folks looking for a TFT like experience but something more casual. 

The game starts with 2 groups of 8, the top 4 players of each group then duke it out to find the top player. The original group stage is based on points and the second stage everyone gets 3 life and last one standing wins. 

The cool thing with this is that you’re playing against offline players. So there is no time pressure if something comes up which is great. I found that in the beginning it was very easy to score first place as I am getting to higher ranks I do take some losses against the AI. You earn gold for each elimination you achieve while offline. 

There is also an arena that takes your top builds from the battleroyale to test them against other players and I have found this to be very challenging. 

The game has dealers that have their own cards, and a hero collection they can draft from every game. On top of their being a number of unique races to play while in game each with their own strategy. My personal favourite race are demons and the discard strategy they play with. 

The only time the game pushes ads is to gain extra gold rewards or arena battle chances. Otherwise there are no ads. 

The negative, each of the races are kind of insular, there isn’t many combos to be found. If you start building a race your only real option is to fully build that race since they are all designed to work with themselves. Also the cost of upgrading your dealers is high,300 gold a shot where dailies may not give you enough to enough gold for an upgrade. There are currently 2 dealers with a third on the way and I hope they make some changes to upgrade costs or the amount of gold you can get. 

Well that’s the long and short of it. I hope you all check it out because I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the game. 

Thank you.

Classic Activition Games in Call of Duty Cold War: in Cold War there is a section where you go through a mock city used by the russians to train for a US ground invasion. In this mock city you can find arcades with classic activition games.

I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004).  Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.

The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I'll play that now for online multiplayer.  I'm curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?

Also, I think it's cool that the original Unreal Tournament (a game from 1999, which I originally played on Windows 98) still runs without a problem on modern PCs (I have it on my current PC, which has Windows 11 and an Intel i9-9900k and an Nvidia 3080 TI).  I have the Game Of The Year edition from Steam though, so I think it was pre-packaged to work on modern PCs.

gaming,"It might sound weird, but I really like when the corpses are done well and remain instead of magically disappearing","TES has probably my favorite approach to this. When you kill an NPC, their body and gore remain for a while before they disappear. You can not only loot their corpses but move them around. After a big battle you look around and see how many lives were lost, how terrible was the encounter, and it feels nice and realistic.

Games where enemies get Thanos snapped like in Elden Ring or turn into a puddle of blood and few random ribs Dragon Age: Origins style or turn into a lootable pouch like in Witcher 3 kind of lack that magical feeling of realism.

gaming,Is a PS5 or a higher refresh rate monitor worth it? (Maybe OLED),"Let’s say for example I have a 165hz 1440p monitor, but can push well over 200fps and then some as it is. Is it truly worth investing in a monitor that can handle that and then some? Potentially OLED too?

Or would it make more sense to invest in a PS5 to have as a system to play older games that are basically dead on PC, but very much alive on Series X/PS5. I know gamepass exists, but I’m not exactly interested in that. 

Kinda curious on feedback of what everyone thinks. I’ve only experienced an OLED TV, and it was incredible, and I don’t necessarily need a console but….i really only prefer the PC for things like MMOs where it really shines.

gaming,"Witcher 3 is almost a decade old, RDR2 is 6 years old. How are these still just about the best graphics? Are there no graphically stunning “show stopper” titles in the last 6 years to compete with them? Have video game graphic advances slowed to a crawl now?","**EDIT** I thought this was clear in my post, but maybe not. I am not saying there aren't better graphics to be found into today's games. I am saying they don't look a Decade better, they don't look 6 years better. For example, Legend of Zelda OOO came out in 1998, Crysis came out in 2007, that's the same gap between the release of Wild Hunt 3 and now. Skyrim came out in 2011, and 6 years prior to that, same gap as between RDR2 and now, the most graphically amazing game just released was the King King movie tie game. There is an ocean of difference, graphically, between Ocarina of Time and Crysis, between King Kong and Skyrim. You could show your grandma a picture of the two and she'd be able to easily point to the one with better graphics. But if you showed Wild Hunt 3 or RDR2 or Battlefield One next to many or even most big budget graphically cutting edge titles of the day, your gran probably couldn't say which have better graphics. The gulf is REALLY narrow compared to the same time span in the past. And if you look up just about any listing of the most graphically impressive games, RDR2, a 6 year old game, is still near the top of basically every list.

Was recently doing an RDR2 play though and was blown away coming back to it, just how damn good it looks. I remember it looked good, but I mean it looks GOOD. And I remember thinking the same about a year ago when I picked Witcher 3 back up. 

Hell star wars battlefront 2 was released in 2017, battlefield 1 was released in 2016, and you’d be hard pressed to find games in their genres released this year that look any better. 

I’m not saying games now look bad, they just don’t look a decade better than Witcher 3. I feel like for most of my life video game graphics have been making continuous leaps. I can’t think of any other time since, hell, the N64, when you’d go damn near a decade with the top tier most graphically impressive cutting edge game not really looking much better than those from 6, 7, 9 years prior. 

Are there graphical powerhouses out there I’m just not aware of?

Control is the only one I can really think of, and control looks great, I just don’t think it looks that much better than say rdr2, maybe slightly better lighting system? But it’s hard to compare since almost all of control takes place indoors.

In other games changing the controls can be more difficult than it needs to be but Ubisoft just gives you the power to do what works best for you.

I noticed Ubisoft really puts a lot of controls in the players hands when it comes to the gameplay as well.

In star wars outlaws you can change little things like turning on or off the mini puzzles when working on terminals or unlocking doors. You can change the text on the cards in the card games so it's easier to read among other things. I love this especially as you can turn off whatever you want so it doesn't hurt the flow of the game.

gaming,Deep Rock Galactic made me appreciate Indie games more,"Now to be honest, I'm still not that much of an Indie fan. I prefer my games to have a realistic artstyle, to have high visual fidelity, to have hollywood like moments and real time cutscenes and overall the polish only a AAA game can provide. Really, you couldn't bring me to touch an Indie game, because I got burned badly by some and after those experiences, they all looked so cheap and not worth the money.

That said, after a friend finally persuaded me to give DRG a chance and after I played it for a while, both with him and alone, I realized that indie games do can be fun and that stylized graphics can look good. I was really surprised at how fun the game is and over time, my mindset changed to:"" If this Indie game is fun, maybe others are as well."". 

And so I did try them and while most of them still aren't to my liking, I did find a few that I enjoyed (Ready or Not, Executive Assault 2, Cavern of Dreams or Eternal Evil to name a few). It also helps that Indie games become better and better and can reach AA quality levels nowadays, while also having a realistic artstyle.

That said, my tolerance still has limits. If I see any pixelart or cell shading in a game, I still instantly lose any interest, same with obvious pre made assets. And for stylized graphics, it really is a case by case situation. While I tolerate Running with Rifles for example, you can hunt me to the end of the world with Battle Bits Remastered or anything made with Synthy.

However, when you have a game like Ready or Not or SCP 5K, where you can show me ""Here, look. This game looks realistic, this game is dark and gritty and looks like a AAA title on the surface"", then you have my interest and usually a buy as well, if the end product is well made.",Nino_Chaosdrache,1h4elho,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,2024-12-01 21:51:06,0,0.18,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4elho

It’s more like driving a Sea Do than a truck, but over twenty years later, it hasn’t been beaten. IMO, of course

Even Halo 2, which had amazing vehicle combat, lost something with destructible vehicles.

Hoping beyond hope that you’re able to pull off the landing and make it back to base with your flag

EDIT: Thank you for your concern (those of you who said something).  I will not be skipping meals due to my gaming addiction.  I'm a little high on cannabis and thought my ""post desperation"" would help to show how much a retired old man appreciates every dollar (and some of the cheaper games have the best stories or are crazy challenging/interesting).

EDIT 2:  To everyone who contributed, thank you!  So far I pulled the trigger on....

Kingdom Come : Deliverance (with all DLC) for $3.99

&amp;

Cities for $2.99

(...and again... thank you!)

  
EDIT 3:  I'm blown away at the responses.  You people are awesome!!!  I'm in the middle of playing Kingdom Come, but will likely purchase one or two more (Mad Max for sure), then wait til the Winter Sale for some of the other suggestions (like Satisfactory or Rimworld) and THEN in 6 months I'll be playing the FREE version of....

A couple of Qs from that:
- Which games use the dual sense feature?
- Do you know any reviewer at least touching on that? Nowadays it’s never really mentioned when a game is available on both platforms for there’s anything specific for the PS controller
- For those of you having the luxury to have both consoles, where do you decide where to buy your games? I’m looking at The Plucky Squire for example, I want to buy it but no idea of the PS5 dualsense adds something to the experience or not, it’s kind of weird really developers don’t really take the time to mention it. Given Xbox tends to be better with back compat and allows for Play Anywhere (thus PC or handheld) it seems safer to buy on that platform, unless I’m missing something.

gaming,Horses no longer gallop in Red Dead Redemption 2,"
Just as the title says, my horses will no longer gallop or even stride at a decent pace.  My horses only trot at the slowest speed, just happened out of nowhere today while playing on my Xbox Series X.  Even horses I steal from NPCs will stop and just walk.  I only just got the game a couple weeks ago, too.  I have tried every possible solution I could come across:

* I fed the horse
* groomed it over and over
* patted the horse
* removed the saddle and put it back on
* rode without a saddle
* switched to different horses at stables
* reloaded the most previous save
* reloaded old saves
* changed controllers
* closed the game and removed it from Quick Resume, waited a minute to relaunch
* did a hard restart on the XSX console
* I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it

All those things and my horse(s) will not move any faster than a walking stride.  This has affected every single horse across all my saves.  I have already put plenty of progress into the game, but now I either have to go without a horse or play at a snail’s pace

gaming,When was the last time a game made your jaw drop in awe?,"I had been running an older PC that was using a 3070ti but unfortunately, the computer had actually been dropped a few feet from my desk during one of my seizures. Still worked fortunately but it had like a weird effect on the graphic card, tried everything from disconnecting it from mobo and reconnecting it making sure it was synchronized correctly. With luck it kept working but when I would try to run games, especially games with more intense graphics you could really notice it so I wouldn't buy new games. Latest game I was playing was deadlock beta but you really noticed it even at the lowest of settings and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

Finally decided it was time to get a new computer so I built myself a new one and gifted it to myself as an early Christmas present (Dec 11) and got it up last week after building it myself. Currently running an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU, 4080 Super GPU, 64gb of memory.

The first game I bought and tried playing was Warhammer 40k Spacemarine 2 and immediately upon loading the initial load video, I was just in awe and my jaw dropped as I couldn't believe it. It felt like I was actually there and even more in-depth than ever before. Reminded me why I loved gaming on a computer so much and what it felt like when it was working in sync perfectly.

The hardest difficulty was the way most games were meant to be played, forcing you to use strategy and actually think about the build of your character. It's also more immersive, adding the feeling of fear and suspense in tense situations.

gaming,"Those who've replayed the Portal games, how different has your experience been?","I was just thinking about these games and how great they were. How the pure joy from playing it is going on this whole world of discovery. I think these games, especially the second, are the most incredible experiences I've had gaming, simply because I didn't know what the hell was going to be coming next and there was this thrilling sense of escape and exploration.

 Also, just the progression of Glados as a character and some of the hilarious things she said. Stephen Merchant in the second game, just amazing - and of course, JK Simmons was just so weird and delightful. 

The small little story element Easter eggs, like the secret room with writing scrawled across the wall saying, 'There's no cake!' (or similar).

The amazing songs at the end. The euphoric feeling of listening to them. 


Anyway, I am getting the itch to play through again from the beginning. How different has your experience been revisiting them?

As they're puzzle games, they're obviously the sort of games you have to leave for a while.

gaming,Why do people think games should be balanced based around casual players?,"I've seen the argument that developers should ignore competitive players and instead focus on what casual players think, but it really doesn't make sense to me at all. I get that casual players make up the vast majority of the player base, but they still don't really know what they're talking about when it comes to what is good and bad in a video game.

For example, a casual Smash Bros Ultimate player might think Ganondorf is overpowered because his attacks all deal a ton of damage and have high knockback. In reality though, Ganondorf has been bottom tier in every game post-Melee, including Ultimate where he is the single worst character in the game. His atrocious mobility, frame data, neutral game, and recovery all make him one of the few characters that are borderline unusable against anyone that knows what they're doing.

The casual player in that circumstance may want Ganondorf nerfed even though he's already terrible, further crippling an already weak character. Their issues with Ganondorf can be solved if they just improve at the game, but they want him kneecapped instead. Why should the developers listen to them?",IndividualNo3351,1h1iz0e,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h1iz0e/why_do_people_think_games_should_be_balanced/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h1iz0e/why_do_people_think_games_should_be_balanced/,2024-11-28 00:08:32,0,0.14,0,0,63,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h1iz0e

So now I want more of that experience, but I'm worried that most CRPGs would bore me as I'm not a fan of D&amp;D and the thing about BG3 that makes me love it so much is the fact that characters are likable, combat is fun, graphics are great, you get those immersive closeups during conversations, and everything is voiced.

I saw some gameplay of a few CRPGs on YT and I noticed they're usually not fully voiced, the graphics are outdated, and there are no closeups on characters during conversations, which makes the game not feel immersive to me.

There's a sale on Steam and I was looking at these games: Rogue Trader, Pillars of Eternity (1 &amp; 2), Divinity Original Sin (1 &amp; 2), and Pathfinder (Kingmaker &amp; PotW).

gaming,What are some of the better purposes for coins and collectables in modern platformers?,"Coins and 1-Ups were a precious commodity in games like the SNES Donkey Kong Country series, but these days many find the whole lives system antiquated, and more demoralizing than it's worth.

So, in a modern context where checkpoints are plentiful and there's no Game Over screen, do you think many games have figured out a strong alternative benefit to coins?

I don't think RPG elements work in something as simple as a platformer, so I tend not to consider them.

Games like Mario Galaxy wanted to keep 1-Ups, tho the game wasn't challenging and the checkpoints were forgiving enough that they made minimal difference.

Mario Odyssey has Skins purchasable with coins which is fine, but less interesting from a mechanics perspective.

Buying Power-Ups could still be fun.

gaming,Q: Is there any game award show you have some respect for?,"We all know The Game Awards featuring Geoff ""I host everything in gaming"" Keighley is considered, at least to the majority of gamers, as the be-all end-all of gaming award shows but that's mainly because he went to so much effort to make it like movie and television award shows which equally have been garnering disdain for being propped up ""buy your own award"" venues for companies.

TGA isn't the only one out there, and some of the others have a decent reputation because of their more rigorous voting processes or blind nomination selection. **With that in mind, do you have any kind of respect towards any on this list or do you just hate all award shows regardless of ethics or dignity?**

* **The Game Awards** \- votes made by games journalists (90%) and general audiences (10%), note that it's not confirmed if that means individual journalists or the publications themselves via a series of internal voting processes
* **D.I.C.E. Awards** \- votes made by members of the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, made up of studios and publishers (similar to the Academy Awards)
* **Famitsu Awards** \- votes made by magazine readers, primarily a Japanese audience
* **Game Developers Choice Awards** \- nominations are made via an invite-only 500 member committee called the International Choice Awards Network with additional nominations made by Gamasutra journalists, then votes are made by the entirety of ICAN at the start of the Game Developers Conference
* **The Golden Joystick Awards** \- the oldest continuously running award show (1983), originally voted on by the British public but now an international public vote
* **Japan Game Awards (formerly CESA Awards)** \- winners determined by a combination of a CESA panel of juries, public votes, and sales figures
* **SXSW Gaming Awards** \- nominations submitted by the general public then narrowed down to 5 per category by the 40 member SXSW Gaming Advisory Board, votes made by the general public

**Personally I'm not a fan of award shows** as I think they demean gaming as an art and don't recognise the work of the individuals behind them in a lot of cases. It's a similar issue with how the Oscars recognise the actors and directors, then every other category just credits the work but not the people or lead in charge of that team.

But out of the main gaming awards shows, **I at least give credit to the Golden Joysticks** for being the only one voted on exclusively by the general public (and not those who can buy their award) **and the GDCA** because it's developers voting for other developers' works so it's a recognition of technical achievement as well.

Edit:

Some more thoughts: Popular vote alone is not necessarily worse, industry vote only is not necessarily better; this is why I mentioned the Golden Joysticks and GDCA in particular.

The Golden Joysticks have always split the Game of the Year into its PC, console (sometimes separate consoles), and ultimate categories. And rarely has a game won all three, even if it exists on PC and console. For example, the 2024 winners were Satisfactory (PC), Helldivers 2 (console), and Black Myth Wukong (ultimate GotY). They're also more stringent with the votes when looking for fraud, bot votes, and false votes; if you're in the UK you can vote from your phone and it's unlikely anyone would pay for an extra phone just for this event, if you're outside the UK then votes are tied to your email address and additional checks are done to make sure it isn't a throwaway. So surprisingly, it doesn't always go the way of the public making weird or joke choices, but that's only because they're not given complete freedom to enter whichever game they want as their vote.

The Game Developers Choice Awards could be seen as a circle-jerk between devs, I admit. But it seems less likely than what goes on with DICE or TGA, as it's individual developers voting and not a company or journalist. Because of this it seems like it would be harder to buy off votes of so many people without word getting out, and even if they did it would be too high a price to pay. Even if they did, there's no guarantee those paid off would vote how they say they're going to as the votes are anonymous and developers can't vote for games they've worked on.

Basically the former seems more in-line with general user reviews from a gameplay while the latter seems more in line with how developers judge each others' works from a technical perspective.",Safebox,1h15bsk,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h15bsk/q_is_there_any_game_award_show_you_have_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h15bsk/q_is_there_any_game_award_show_you_have_some/,2024-11-27 14:17:37,0,0.34,0,0,73,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h15bsk

gaming,Lets talk about damage modelling,"Persistent day dream so I'm going to write it down to get it out of my head.

In the genre of combat driving games and mech something that has never quite hit right is damage modelling.

Back on the atari ST I was playing an F1 game and tire wear was modelled and being ""back then"" your imagination filled in the blanks. For some reason that sticks with me.

F16 fighting falcon, again on the Atari ST - getting the bird back with all the warning lights flashing and a broken under carriage. Real sense of achievement.

Fast forward a bit, Mech Warrior 2. Heat management, per limb damage. Seeing mechs with arms missing etc. All good.

Wipe out! Ps1. Speed and weapons! Bounce off things and slow down or boom and respawn. Classic fun.

Rollcage, more of the same but wheels on the ground and you could knock buildings on top of people. That was extra fun.

split second, blur. All had weapons and stuff but the damage modelling was nill. Split second environmental stuff although scripted was cool.

Burnout? no weapons but good deformation

Special shout out to Soldier of fortune 2s ghoul engine and their damage model. Gory as you like with the easter egg that if you get a cross body shot just right intestines would fall out.

Another shout out to Frostbite engine and battlefield building damage.

Mech games, damage is basically red amber green done with soot.

With the crazy amount of cores we all have aren't we ready for deeper damage modelling.

There are physics voxel games (abriss?) that go to the extreme. Of course we cant build games in that engine yet with tiny voxels and individual physics but there is a half way house between full material simulation and red/amber/green.

My ""realistic"" expecation using a mech game as an example;

3 damage layers CC/CH/SK

Core function, chassis, skin.

In essence its just 2 layers of armour over a health bar.

* Core function can keep Red amber green
* Chassis - 4 states - pristine, battered, buckled &amp; failed
* Skin - this is where the visual effort needs to go.

3 types of damage (possibly 4)

Energy, kinetic, explosive (environmental)

Example base weapon damage value distribute across the 3 layer cc/ch/sk

* Energy - various sized soot marks and has to wear through skin first. 5%/10%/85%
* Kinetic - holes in skin, chassis and core. 5%/60%/35%
* Explosive - soot and holes. (possibly just scaled up from the above) 15%/60%/25%
* Environmental - basically same as kinetic but without holes. Crush damage from falling masonry or bumping into a tree. Imagine an urban setting where you get staggered in to a building and it collapses on you.

Seeing games like borderlands with crazy amounts of gun stats makes it seems straightforward to implement a damage table like the above and churn out relevant textures and model deformations.

(core damage distribution across multiple components is a complexity I haven't thought through)

Slap on the Frostbite building damage and you can create a visceral mech game. If anyone has played Pacific Drive - the car is the star. Now change that to a mech.

This approach could also be applied to combat driving games. Added bonus of damage effect on car handling. Trackside buildings and collateral damage.

Easy if lengthy to type out. AAA studios are churning out cookie cutter games and this doesn't feel to outlandish to expect and its more meaningful than just reflective puddles and shadows. Also can scale across console generations with PCs getting the largest asset stack and it gets scaled back from there.

A final thought, in death race film (remake) a driver had ""the tombstone"" as a bullet proof shield. There's a scene where its getting chewed away but autocannon fire. That experience of seeing your armour flaking away and crumbling. Having that rather that hit markers or little shield icons, thats what I'd like.

Now this is written down I can dream up something else.",Olly230,1h118p6,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h118p6/lets_talk_about_damage_modelling/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h118p6/lets_talk_about_damage_modelling/,2024-11-27 10:22:29,0,0.48,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h118p6

I’m so used to avoiding contact that even though I know I can dash through them for backstab damage, I have a hard time turning off decades of experience. I’ve found that in other games, enemies are doing things that I’m not expecting, like leaving what appear to be clearly delineated zones to look for me, chasing me through changing screens, etc. Most of the games I used to play had enemy behavior limited by hardware restrictions, but as they fall away I’m finding modern gameplay mechanics are killing me until I adapt.

gaming,I want to ramble about Vectorman,"Ahoy! One of my absolute favorite games, Vectorman, has just been added to Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about how amazing it is here and maybe convince somebody to give it a shot if they haven't already. 

For many Vectorman is seen as ""that really hard Genesis game with the DKC like graphics"", only known for it's visuals and for people not being able to get past the early stages. It is a very difficult title, one that requires practice to get far in, but it's arguably not as bad as some of the most notorious NES titles on that front. By playing cautiously and learning what makes each level tick you can slowly master it, a process that can be very satisfying.


 It helps that those visuals are such a spectacle. The 90s cgi pre rendered models are not only different from other games but genuinely impressive in their own right beyond comparison to DKC or Ballz 3D. The orb based and mechanical designs are totally distinct and every character moves with a fluidity rarely found on a 16 bit platform. Vectorman himself is possibly the most expressive character on the genesis with tons of unique movements. He comes off as effortlessly cool in much the same way as Master Chief but with even less dialogue. His different transformations happen seamlessly in gameplay. The lighting baked into every stage and how it ""reflects"" on the sprites is stunning to behold. I'd say there are 2d games on cd based consoles that are way less visually impressive. It truly is amazing what they were able to do with the hardware. The variety in locations is also great. A lot of them combine mechanical  and natural with more out there colors and background elements including different weather patterns. The only game that looks even remotely like Vectorman is it's own sequel. The electronic soundtrack is also incredible. 


The game feel, much like and partially dur to the animation, is very fluid. You run, shoot, and platform through stages with a lot of speed but the game rewards precision. You are a big target and most enemies require good aim or multiple shots to take down but you also have rapid fire even with the most basic weapon. You also have a double jump that also doubles as an attack to enemies below you which can sometimes be the key to beating certain bosses and is great for some of the very vertically focused stages. Vectorman may be a big robot but he moves with a lot of grace and momentum and the transformation power ups add variety while increasing the pace even further. There are also a few short gimmick levels where you fight the main boss Warhead in a shift of gameplay style which are confusing at first but quick if you know what you are doing. All of this gives the game a very kinetic flow and smoothness many similar titles lack.



I could continue writing this for probably hours going into a lot more detail about the story, contests (Yes multiple), cheat codes, promo material, speedrun strategies, sequel (multipleish), and more but I want to save that for a potential future project.

I don't even play the main campaign, I just turn off the mini-map and wander around, enjoying the atmosphere and experience. A game I always wanted to get into but just couldn't enjoy is UnReal World. The conceptual design, world-building, and player agency is what sold me, (not to mention Mandalore Gaming's review) but the sum of its parts never kept me coming back for more. UnReal is a game that I'll reinstall every so often, thinking this is the time it'll stick, but I can never overcome the first few hours whatever scenario I pick.  Playing Primal again got me thinking just how amazing a combination of the gameplay of Primal and the depth of UnReal World would be a dream game for me.

It's incredible to me that the story of the game centers around a man taking the dead body of a woman to a forbidden land and doing the dirty work of a God to hopefully resurrect her. He will not accept that she's dead and fights to bring her back to life. Whereas you, as a player, goes about defeating the colossi in the forbidden land by scaling them, hanging on for dear life, and hoping not to get flung to the ground and stomped.

What I'm saying here is: Both the point of the story and the mechanic of the game itself revolve around the idea: ""Hold on, don't let go.""

The main character's position in the story is also the literal control tactic you used to beat the game.

I haven't played these in a bit of time and looking at the Steam reviews E.V.E. and Elite Dangerous are getting some flack at the moment. I have been away for quite awhile so it won't be an easy 'jump back in' but which of these two would you recommend?


---------


Update: Thank you for all the replies! I have jumped back into E.V.E. for now (as it is free!) and will keep an eye out for X4 to go down in price (currently around £40). I _may_ even jump back into NMS which I completely forgot about as I already own that one! I have also downloaded Endless Sky so I have a bit to get on with! Thanks again!

gaming,"An argument for playing Alien: Isolation if you're interested, but scared
","Please disagree if you've played and think, ""Yeah, no. This is 10,000% full of shit. Nice try, Xenomorph.""  
  
**But at least on NORMAL difficulty, I really think this game is on your side and wants you to beat it.** Some games make you have fun via good storytelling and great dialogue. Other games make you have fun by throwing lots of action and enemies at you and putting you in a flow state. I think this game makes you have fun by TERRIFYING you, but not in a frustrating, or time-wasting way.  
  
I realized this (or convinced myself of this) like 45% of the way through my recent first playthrough. And once I realized it, I moved swiftly through the remaining 55% and I sincerely, absolutely loved it. I didn't rush the second half or anything, but the first 45% took me a very long time, and I would spend each play-session kind of procrastinating booting the game up. I felt so much dread and anxiety just looking at the main menu with the GIANT face of Jupiter staring at you lol.

You constantly see Jupiter throughout the game, always reminding you of how small or helpless you are.

But I think a big part of my dread actually came from the save system. You can't save whenever you want. You have to do it at certain checkpoints. And that whole concept just made me very tense, and I loathed the idea of losing good progress.  
  
But this idea that ***""the game is on your side""*** occurred to me when I came across a checkpoint, then struggled through a 15-minute tense chunk of the map, and then came to another save point. I thought, ""Huh. That was like a quick, self-contained section."" And then I realized that the whole game is sort of structured that way. You have 19 main missions, but I think each mission can be broken apart into lots of tiny sections. Each save point is like the beginning of a mini-chapter.  
  
When you die, it can feel devastating. But then you realize that you never really lose that much progress. They are very generous with the save points.  
  
And so I think the game makes a double-edged agreement with you. It agrees to let you save a lot, but in return you have to be ok with getting REALLY fucking scared lmao.  
  
If the game was bullshitty, I think the save points would be like 30-minutes apart. And then if the alien grabbed you from above, it would feel super frustrating and stupid and more annoying than scary.  
  
But the way it works in actuality, if you die, it only takes like a minute or two to get back to where you were. You move much faster the second (or third, or sixth...) time around because like half the battle is being lost and not knowing the map. So the game can kill you in all sorts of horrifying ways--""THE XENOMORPH CAN DO THAT!?!??!""--but because it doesn't waste your time, you're having FUN being scared, and aren't loathing having to replay large sections.  
  
This makes it even more effective because you lean in and cooperate with the experience of being scared. You aren't pulled away from the experience because you're dreading having to replay long sections.  
  
I really don't think this game wants you to give up. It is also strangely therapeutic to face all of this anxiety and fear head-on, and slooowly make relentless forward progress through it all. You can hide in a locker as long as you want, but eventually, you have to get out and press forward.  
  
I think anyone with a normal tolerance for fear can have a great time with Alien: Isolation. (But for people who actually suffer from high anxiety, it might be too much. The game is legitimately scary.) BUT IT'S ON YOUR SIDE! (But your neck will hurt because your shoulders will constantly be up by your ears.) BUT IT WANTS YOU TO BEAT IT!

Rare under Xbox released some amazing and creative games:

-Grabbed by the Ghoulies got punished by the hype of being the first ""Xbox Rare"", but on his own is a fun, little game with a lot of ideas. Is it perfect? No, not al all. But is fun, and full of the ""Rare magic"".

-Kameo, pretty much the same thing. Is not perfect at all but it got a lot of fun ideas and is overall a quality launch game.

-Viva Pinata is fu***ng awesome.

-trouble in paradise is more VP so is fu***ng awesome.

-ok, N&amp;B. This is controversial and i agree on most of the surface criticism: yes, the game is not a good Banjo Kazooie sequel, and it was the wrong game at the wrong time. But on his own is a very good game. The idea is great, and the builder is extremely well done. Proof of that, Tears of the Kingdom has clearly taken a lot of ideas from this game, im sure about that.

-Rare Replay is, at least for me, the best collection of all time

-Sea of Thieves gor a rough release but as it is now, Is one of Rare's best games, and probably their biggest success.

gaming,Games that started off underrated but become overpraised as the years progressed and their fan base grew?,"So we've played titles that fell under the radar: whether because of poor marketing, heavy competition, or just the general shenanigans of the Steam algorithm, it ended-up not catching many eyes save those of a dedicated bunch, who in turn propagated its name enough to the point where it achieved cult status.

That's all well and fine, and a sign that game development never truly ends with publication. It led to titles like Among Us turning a profit for their company, which is what we all want at the end of the day.

However, have there ever been cases where you noticed a lesser-known title go from underappreciated to being over-hyped by its fans? It's not that the game itself is bad, but the sum of its parts do not equate to the image painted by enthusiasts?

For me, I would say SOMA falls under this category. Despite being made by the devs of Amnesia, it didn't catch as many eyes. Yet any praise you do hear for it no doubt speaks of an existential masterpiece that's unfortunately not QUITE accurate.

But, I’m also of the opinion that too many options is bad. For instance why do I have 20 sliders to shape how my lips look? Now I now some people enjoy spending five hours using those sliders to make the perfect character, but for those who don’t we are left with like 10 male and 10 female presets max normally.

I wish more cc’s would provide more presets for individual features. I want to choose lips 12 to go with nose 34 to go with eyes 23 and eyebrows 56.

gaming,"If You Don’t Mind, I’d Like To Share a Story About Why Today is Special For Me","Hey all, if this sort of thing isn’t allowed then I apologise and please delete.

I’ve played games since the 90s. I remember my Dad playing RE1 and 2. They terrified me, to the point that even my younger sister would do a zombie impression which also terrified me.

a few years pass, I carry on playing games. I used to buy a gaming magazine religiously, Nintendo Official Magazine (lovingly referred to as NOM). One issue had a huge feature about how great and different this new Resident Evil 4 was. At that, before CEX and trading standards intervention, people of any age could trade in games. No age restriction, no ID needed.

for me, this felt like a conflict tailor made for me. I knew I was too scared to play a Resident Evil game on my own, but at the same time, if NOM said a game was a must play, then I did. I bought PN.03 and Geist as a 12/13 year having no idea what they were.

anyway, I buy RE4. I’m anxious at first, but quickly - and surprisingly - I’m pretty good. My Dad comes in asks me what I was playing. When I told him, he looked shocked, then proud in the way only parents can be. It was like a tiny passing of the torch. ”you’ll be a man, one day son” kinda thing.

so RE4 becomes one of my top 5 games and I play it every 5 years or so.

fast forward 20 years. I still game and whatnot. A close friends dies in a car crash which hits me hard. I turn to hard drugs, end up homeless, cut myself off from friends and family cos I didn’t want them seeing me like that.

long story short, I end up having to do a 6 month prison stint on drug-related charges.

whilst I was inside, I detoxed from drugs, became a tutor to teach people how to read and write. Since release, I found my own place to live, and got a job in a library.

I’ve been sober for 19 months, and I’ve finally saved up enough money to buy as PS4 and Resident Evil 4 Remake and I so fucking excited boys and girls.

I feel so fucking grateful that I could change my life around to get to this point.

I’m wondering if things get better or change drastically as you get further into the game?",filmeswole,1gzev24,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gzev24/does_dave_the_diver_get_better/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gzev24/does_dave_the_diver_get_better/,2024-11-25 09:14:03,0,0.44,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gzev24

gaming,Real Life Video Game Cars,"I'm having trouble looking up real life video game cars on google, I keep getting results for the Cars video game. 

I'm basically looking for things like the promotional Jeeps that Black Ops had tie-ins with a while back or like the Warthog made to promote Halo 5 (or was it Wars 2?). Things like that. Does anyone know of other video game cars that were made in the real world for promotional reasons? I'm explicitly looking for promotional tie-in cars, not fan-made cars. I found some dude's cool Mad Max car, but that was a movie long before it had a video game, and it wasn't an official promotional tie-in.

gaming,New Monopoly on Switch and probably every other console against AI,"First game I started playing ever after downloading last night was against 3 normal AI. Was kicking their ass and came down to one going bankrupt to another who only had 19 cash. Couldn't figure out how to mortgage to pay the fees on the incoming mortgage properties and got stuck in a loop. 0 stars and Nintendo return policies are so bad I don't think it'll be even worth it to bother. Stay away even if you love Monopoly like I do. Got removed from r/NintendoSwitch because it apparently was a Rule 3 - No limited-scope questions...wasn't asking anything just saying fuck this release and I don't want anyone else wasting there money. Edit: Not sure if it was clear but the loop the AI got stuck in blocked finishing the game, reloaded 4+ times and still ended in them being stuck.",GrayF0X86,1gz9laj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gz9laj/new_monopoly_on_switch_and_probably_every_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gz9laj/new_monopoly_on_switch_and_probably_every_other/,2024-11-25 03:29:41,0,0.32,0,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gz9laj
