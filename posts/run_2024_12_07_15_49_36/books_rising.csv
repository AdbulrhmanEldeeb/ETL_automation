books,Life among the aliterate (a small rant),"In terms of aliterate, I mean people who know how to read, but don't care to. A familiar quote, ""I had to read in college (or high school) but I don't need to anymore.""

I grew up in a household of readers and have family who are still voracious readers.

20 years ago, I moved from a major Northern U.S. metropolis to a major Southern U.S. metropolis.

In my former home everyone I knew read all the time - different stuff, but they read. Poor people, rich people - for most it had been a lifetime avocation. And they did love reading.

When I moved, my partner (who was a former publishing person like me) and me continued our reading adventure. 

But NO ONE is our social circle reads here. Not books, not anything. Our friends don't even have books in their homes. They come to our house and see the books crammed in the 6 big bookcases and usually the first comment is ""Did you read all of these?"" - like it's some aberrant thing, like it's an impossible thing to do.

And they seem suspicious - like, what kind of person would read those books? Definite suspicions about the science books...

I get the impression that if the books were replaced with sports memorabilia, everything would appear normal to them.

I have learned not to talk about my love of reading. I know they will never understand. It's kind of lonely except for the reddit connections - and then, that's just shorthand for any real discussion about anything substantial.

At least my partner still reads - much more than me.

I agree with this very rude plea from noted director and author, John Waters:  
**“**&gt;!If you go home with somebody, and they don't have books, don't fuck 'em!!&lt;**”** “It wasn't until I started reading and found books they wouldn't let us read in school that I discovered you could be insane and happy and have a good life without being like everybody else.”",BigJobsBigJobs,1h86yrm,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,2024-12-06 17:40:26,347,0.78,347,0,346,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h86yrm
books,"""One does not read a book: one can only reread it"" - V. Nabokov","I finished my first time through *The Brothers Karamazov* (the Katz translation; excellent, btw) on December 2. 

Noted weirdo Vladimir Nabokov said once that one doesn't read a book, one only *re*reads it. It's his fancy way of saying that the first time through a book doesn't really count, since the reader is mostly just trying to make sense of the scale and dimensions of the story. It's the reread where the book starts to really reveal itself to the reader. 

So, I picked up the McReynolds translation (from Norton*) and started the introduction tonight (December 6 -- this will be relevant in two shakes).

[* The McReynolds is worth it if only for the ""Names in *The Brothers Karamazov*,"" which goes into the etymological roots of the names.]

In the introduction she mentions two scenes that I have *absolutely* no memory of (both quotes come from p viii in the Norton Critical Edition):

1) ""But we also share Ivan's indignation as he recounts the tale of Richard, whose life was taken away twice -- once, symbolically, by the biological parents who gave him away as chapel to some shepherds, and then by his social family, his fellow citizens of geneva, who chop off his head in brotherly fashion.""

2) ""We real from the vision of the naked, terrified little boy ripped apart by hunting dogs before his mother's eyes.""

So, in conclusion: if you love a book once, it's probably worth reading twice, because what if you, too, don't remember two horrible deaths?

Do you reread ever? Is once enough? Is Nabokov full of beans?",Mike_Bevel,1h8e5y1,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8e5y1/one_does_not_read_a_book_one_can_only_reread_it_v/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8e5y1/one_does_not_read_a_book_one_can_only_reread_it_v/,2024-12-06 22:54:55,90,0.78,90,0,91,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8e5y1
books,"I went through a phase where I collected tons of books to keep on my shelves, and it had a negative impact on me. I want to talk about it in case anyone else has experienced the same thing. ","I love books. I always have. Not just reading them, but looking at them, holding them, feeling them, turning the pages, admiring the covers, seeing them displayed on my bookshelves so prettily, reorganizing my shelves. Books are art to me. Over the past few years one of my main hobbies was exploring used bookstores for fantasy, science fiction, lit fic, history, and poetry. I live in an area with many amazing ones and I would spend hours on my days off exploring them and learning about all the authors I wanted to read. The vast majority of my collection is used books and I often would only be spending a few dollars on one book even for very popular authors and that’s how I justified to myself that it was ok I was doing all this buying.

I told myself that I was ""collecting,"" which was a very different thing than hoarding in my mind. Books are my hobby, right? So it's okay that I collected so many.

I had this notion that I was building a little library for myself, a beautiful display that I could always go to and find my next read. However, this did not work out the way I thought it would. I enjoyed my time collecting these books very much but over the past week or so I've had to confront the negative impact this has had on me personally.

Problem 1: If a new release came out that I really wanted to read, one of two things would happen. One: I wouldn’t let myself read the new release because I knew I had so many books on my shelf. I needed to get to the ones I already owned. Two: I would read the new release and feel this creeping sense of guilt that I had just spent money or spent time on yet another book when I already owned hundreds at home.

Problem 2: My taste in genre had a rather drastic evolution this past year. I had been collecting mainly fantasy as that has been my lifelong literary interest. But this past year historical romance took over my reading and I began collecting that genre too. I adore my fantasy collection and I have good memories of exploring certain used bookstores that I love dearly, but the genre switch took my a bit by surprise.

Problem 3: I discovered my love of audiobooks this past year. I was a person who could never do audiobooks for some reason, my brain just would not focus on the story, and so I really thought I would be reading all these physical books. Well, not sure how it happened, but something changed in me and now I LOVE audiobooks. I find myself searching for a good audiobook more than a physical book now.

Problem 4: Looking at my shelves started to make me feel like a hoarder. I own enough books for the next five years and when I don't even know where I'll be living during that time and when libraries exist, there's no logical reason for me to own that many. The joy of going to a bookstore is gone for me now, and the only way to get that back is to simplify what I own so one day I will have an actual reason to go book shopping. The thing I once loved so much, I began to see as clutter, and that makes me sad. I don’t want to see books as clutter anymore, and the only way to prevent that is to literally de-clutter my bookshelf and therefore de-clutter my mind.

And so now as I write this there are four large bags of books by my shelves ready to be taken to a used bookstore or a thrift store over the weekend. Something snapped in me last week and I sat down in front of my shelves and just started pulling books down and putting them into the bags and it was as if my mind just knew which ones I didn’t need anymore.

I will no longer buy a book because “this looks really interesting and I’ll read it someday.” I will no longer buy a book because it has a gorgeous cover. I will no longer buy a book just because it's been on my TBR for a while and I found a cheap copy.

The reason I wanted to post this is that I know there are other people who struggle with this ""collector"" mindset the same way I do where you get that little thrill of buying books to add them to your shelves and you justify it to yourself because, in the moment, it really does make you happy and you really think you will read it soon or someday in the future.

This is just my personal experience. If you own a home with a personal library with hundreds of books and that brings you joy then that is AWESOME. We're all different, and I'm having to face the fact that who I am as a reader has changed drastically, and that's okay.",FusRoDaahh,1h85uop,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h85uop/i_went_through_a_phase_where_i_collected_tons_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h85uop/i_went_through_a_phase_where_i_collected_tons_of/,2024-12-06 16:53:13,272,0.81,272,0,139,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85uop
