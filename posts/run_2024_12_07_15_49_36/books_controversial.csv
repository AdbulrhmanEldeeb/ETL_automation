books,The best thing that ever happened to me ...,"So…. this happened on a Sunday when I was extremely bored and I'm the kind of person who chooses books over anything to get rid of boredom. When I was scrolling through Goodreads, I laid eyes on a book with some kind of a crucifix on its cover. I immediately picked that book (this was approximately 2 weeks back). I knew it was a series and my initial plan was to read a single book. 

As I started the first book, within a few chapters I fell in love with the characters, Robert Hunter and Carlos Garcia. So after completing the first book in a day or two (which is way faster than my usual speed, considering I work on week days), I decided to proceed with the series. Now here I am, I finished the whole series in 2 weeks and I'm craving for more books by Carter. After this I can easily say that Chris Carter will forever be my favourite author and Robert Hunter, my favourite protagonist. 

Every book in the series was intriguing and brutal. In my opinion, if gore outweighs the actual content, it might become a negative in itself but here it works the opposite way. Apart from how the killer is found, the mystery behind why the crime is committed in a certain way and the motive for such brutality, are points of great interest in every book. 

Leaving these aside, there's a book in this series called An Evil mind. I was completely blown away by it. I never imagined that Carter could create an antagonist who is as powerful as Hunter.  But Lucien Folter overshadowed Hunter and he's the best antagonist according to me ( including every book and movie I have ever watched). 

I'm now anticipating the release of the next book in the series. I know it might take a year for the next book release so I'm planning to re-read the available books once more. I was not in a great mental state when I just started this series and Carter offered me the much needed distraction. Currently I'm at least one step better because of him and I'm grateful for that.",Alternative-Bit-999,1h8lpzr,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8lpzr/the_best_thing_that_ever_happened_to_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8lpzr/the_best_thing_that_ever_happened_to_me/,2024-12-07 05:37:58,2,0.54,2,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8lpzr
books,Can’t get myself to like “Things We Never Got Over” by Lucy Score,"The writing style is too distracting for me to get into the story. 
The dialogue seems to have only one pace and all the characters have the same “voice” .. just with differing accents. 
Sometimes it doesn’t flow and just feels like she’s trying too hard.  Sometimes frantic. 
The characters are cliche. 
Neither character or dialogue feel ~real~ which makes it hard for me to connect.

books,Life among the aliterate (a small rant),"In terms of aliterate, I mean people who know how to read, but don't care to. A familiar quote, ""I had to read in college (or high school) but I don't need to anymore.""

I grew up in a household of readers and have family who are still voracious readers.

20 years ago, I moved from a major Northern U.S. metropolis to a major Southern U.S. metropolis.

In my former home everyone I knew read all the time - different stuff, but they read. Poor people, rich people - for most it had been a lifetime avocation. And they did love reading.

When I moved, my partner (who was a former publishing person like me) and me continued our reading adventure. 

But NO ONE is our social circle reads here. Not books, not anything. Our friends don't even have books in their homes. They come to our house and see the books crammed in the 6 big bookcases and usually the first comment is ""Did you read all of these?"" - like it's some aberrant thing, like it's an impossible thing to do.

And they seem suspicious - like, what kind of person would read those books? Definite suspicions about the science books...

I get the impression that if the books were replaced with sports memorabilia, everything would appear normal to them.

I have learned not to talk about my love of reading. I know they will never understand. It's kind of lonely except for the reddit connections - and then, that's just shorthand for any real discussion about anything substantial.

At least my partner still reads - much more than me.

I agree with this very rude plea from noted director and author, John Waters:  
**“**&gt;!If you go home with somebody, and they don't have books, don't fuck 'em!!&lt;**”** “It wasn't until I started reading and found books they wouldn't let us read in school that I discovered you could be insane and happy and have a good life without being like everybody else.”",BigJobsBigJobs,1h86yrm,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,2024-12-06 17:40:26,352,0.78,352,0,346,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h86yrm

books,"""One does not read a book: one can only reread it"" - V. Nabokov","I finished my first time through *The Brothers Karamazov* (the Katz translation; excellent, btw) on December 2. 

Noted weirdo Vladimir Nabokov said once that one doesn't read a book, one only *re*reads it. It's his fancy way of saying that the first time through a book doesn't really count, since the reader is mostly just trying to make sense of the scale and dimensions of the story. It's the reread where the book starts to really reveal itself to the reader. 

So, I picked up the McReynolds translation (from Norton*) and started the introduction tonight (December 6 -- this will be relevant in two shakes).

[* The McReynolds is worth it if only for the ""Names in *The Brothers Karamazov*,"" which goes into the etymological roots of the names.]

In the introduction she mentions two scenes that I have *absolutely* no memory of (both quotes come from p viii in the Norton Critical Edition):

1) ""But we also share Ivan's indignation as he recounts the tale of Richard, whose life was taken away twice -- once, symbolically, by the biological parents who gave him away as chapel to some shepherds, and then by his social family, his fellow citizens of geneva, who chop off his head in brotherly fashion.""

2) ""We real from the vision of the naked, terrified little boy ripped apart by hunting dogs before his mother's eyes.""

So, in conclusion: if you love a book once, it's probably worth reading twice, because what if you, too, don't remember two horrible deaths?

Do you reread ever? Is once enough? Is Nabokov full of beans?",Mike_Bevel,1h8e5y1,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8e5y1/one_does_not_read_a_book_one_can_only_reread_it_v/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8e5y1/one_does_not_read_a_book_one_can_only_reread_it_v/,2024-12-06 22:54:55,92,0.78,92,0,91,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8e5y1
books,"I went through a phase where I collected tons of books to keep on my shelves, and it had a negative impact on me. I want to talk about it in case anyone else has experienced the same thing. ","I love books. I always have. Not just reading them, but looking at them, holding them, feeling them, turning the pages, admiring the covers, seeing them displayed on my bookshelves so prettily, reorganizing my shelves. Books are art to me. Over the past few years one of my main hobbies was exploring used bookstores for fantasy, science fiction, lit fic, history, and poetry. I live in an area with many amazing ones and I would spend hours on my days off exploring them and learning about all the authors I wanted to read. The vast majority of my collection is used books and I often would only be spending a few dollars on one book even for very popular authors and that’s how I justified to myself that it was ok I was doing all this buying.

I told myself that I was ""collecting,"" which was a very different thing than hoarding in my mind. Books are my hobby, right? So it's okay that I collected so many.

I had this notion that I was building a little library for myself, a beautiful display that I could always go to and find my next read. However, this did not work out the way I thought it would. I enjoyed my time collecting these books very much but over the past week or so I've had to confront the negative impact this has had on me personally.

Problem 1: If a new release came out that I really wanted to read, one of two things would happen. One: I wouldn’t let myself read the new release because I knew I had so many books on my shelf. I needed to get to the ones I already owned. Two: I would read the new release and feel this creeping sense of guilt that I had just spent money or spent time on yet another book when I already owned hundreds at home.

Problem 2: My taste in genre had a rather drastic evolution this past year. I had been collecting mainly fantasy as that has been my lifelong literary interest. But this past year historical romance took over my reading and I began collecting that genre too. I adore my fantasy collection and I have good memories of exploring certain used bookstores that I love dearly, but the genre switch took my a bit by surprise.

Problem 3: I discovered my love of audiobooks this past year. I was a person who could never do audiobooks for some reason, my brain just would not focus on the story, and so I really thought I would be reading all these physical books. Well, not sure how it happened, but something changed in me and now I LOVE audiobooks. I find myself searching for a good audiobook more than a physical book now.

Problem 4: Looking at my shelves started to make me feel like a hoarder. I own enough books for the next five years and when I don't even know where I'll be living during that time and when libraries exist, there's no logical reason for me to own that many. The joy of going to a bookstore is gone for me now, and the only way to get that back is to simplify what I own so one day I will have an actual reason to go book shopping. The thing I once loved so much, I began to see as clutter, and that makes me sad. I don’t want to see books as clutter anymore, and the only way to prevent that is to literally de-clutter my bookshelf and therefore de-clutter my mind.

And so now as I write this there are four large bags of books by my shelves ready to be taken to a used bookstore or a thrift store over the weekend. Something snapped in me last week and I sat down in front of my shelves and just started pulling books down and putting them into the bags and it was as if my mind just knew which ones I didn’t need anymore.

I will no longer buy a book because “this looks really interesting and I’ll read it someday.” I will no longer buy a book because it has a gorgeous cover. I will no longer buy a book just because it's been on my TBR for a while and I found a cheap copy.

The reason I wanted to post this is that I know there are other people who struggle with this ""collector"" mindset the same way I do where you get that little thrill of buying books to add them to your shelves and you justify it to yourself because, in the moment, it really does make you happy and you really think you will read it soon or someday in the future.

This is just my personal experience. If you own a home with a personal library with hundreds of books and that brings you joy then that is AWESOME. We're all different, and I'm having to face the fact that who I am as a reader has changed drastically, and that's okay.",FusRoDaahh,1h85uop,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h85uop/i_went_through_a_phase_where_i_collected_tons_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h85uop/i_went_through_a_phase_where_i_collected_tons_of/,2024-12-06 16:53:13,269,0.81,269,0,139,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85uop

books,"Dark Evenings: ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" by Dean Koontz.","And now the fourth Dean Koontz book that I've been reading for the past few days is now complete tonight! ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" is that novel.

We meet Amy Redwing, a woman who has devoted her entire life to rescuing dogs. But there is a unique bond that she shares with a golden retriever named Nickie, a dog she had saved in a very dangerous encounter, one that is really deep.

But in one night, this loyalty will be put to the test, and they will prove to each other how far they can go--even when the stakes turn deadly.

This one's pretty similar to another Koontz novel ""Hideaway"", as it is a thriller mixed with the supernatural. It might not be as original as one would think, but I still found it pretty decent enough to find it enjoyable.

Koontz has written a lot, with some being either great or really decent, and ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" fits into the decent category. Most would say that his writing has become repetitive, but for me they're still enjoyable. Not really deep, but incredibly satisfying. And now that I've had my quota of Koontz for now, it's time to move on to another book by a different author, or authors in this case, as this one is written by two authors.",i-the-muso-1968,1h8je8d,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8je8d/dark_evenings_the_darkest_evening_of_the_year_by/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8je8d/dark_evenings_the_darkest_evening_of_the_year_by/,2024-12-07 03:20:23,4,0.7,4,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8je8d
