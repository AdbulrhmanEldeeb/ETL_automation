Python,Directory for AI Python libraries,"Hello all,

Using Unicorn Platform I made  my first directory : a comprehensive list of Python libraries used in AI based programming. You can find the directory here: 

https://www.aipythonlibraries.com/

  
I have already fed about 189 libraries into the directory, but the list is still growing.

Tell me what you think, any feedback is much appreciated.

Thank you,
Daniel",Danielopol,1h89nwg,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h89nwg/directory_for_ai_python_libraries/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h89nwg/directory_for_ai_python_libraries/,2024-12-06 19:34:32,0,0.5,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,self,t3_1h89nwg

Python,Python .gitignore,"I'm sure a lot of you have done this:

1. Start new project
2. Need that generic Python `.gitignore` file on GitHub
3. Google ""python gitignore"" (though you probably typed ""gitingore"")
4. Click link and click raw
5. Copy all and paste in your local `.gitignore`

And I'm sure a lot of you probably just use curl and have it memorized or have it in your shell history or something (`fzf` ftw). But I can't be bothered to learn curl properly, and I got tired of the manual steps, so I just created a function in my `.zshrc` file:

    function pgi {
        curl -JL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/refs/heads/main/Python.gitignore -o .gitignore
    }

So now I can just run `pgi` whenever I start a new project, and boom, precious seconds of my life saved.

That's it, that's all I have, thanks for reading.

Python,Flet vs Streamlit PWA and conceptual questions,"I'm new to flet, but I'm experienced Flutter developer plus I'm a Generative AI Engineer and worked with streamlit or Gradio. I have some conceptual questions.  
Q1. If flet uses Flutter, then why does the flet Flutter plugin require a URL? Why cannot the flet UI ""live"" all together in Flutter?  
Q2. Since there's a URL needed anyway, what's the advantage of using it vs for example having a Streamlit UI displayed in a PWA?  
Q3. Let's say I develop a personal assistant in flet. Can the assistant access my location, heart rate, my camera (for multi-modal Gen AI), microphone and speakers (for voice assistant functionalities)?",MrCsabaToth,1h8nzyy,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h8nzyy/flet_vs_streamlit_pwa_and_conceptual_questions/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h8nzyy/flet_vs_streamlit_pwa_and_conceptual_questions/,2024-12-07 08:15:44,8,0.83,8,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8nzyy

Python,VCAT: Video Transcriber and Translator,"



# Have you ever wanted to share videos to your non bilingual friends? üåé


Fear not because I (Claude) have made a script that does exactly that!


## **What My Project Does** ‚ö°


Type in a video URL along with the target language and the program will:

A) Download the media from the URL (Uses youtube-dlp so most websites are compatible)  
B) Transcribe it (srt file output)  
C) Translate it (srt file output)  
D) Add subtitles using ffmpeg  

All fully automated of course!

üîç [https://github.com/tikene/video-caption-and-translate](https://github.com/tikene/video-caption-and-translate) - You can see some sample translations on my repo to get an idea of how the output video looks


## **Target Audience** üë•


If you have any friends who, for example, aren't fluent with English, you may have ran into some frustration when trying to share movies, videos or shows that you like. That's what motivated me to make this script, making it so you can easily share your interests and build human connections regardless of the language barrier (It's all about making the world a better place üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)



## **Comparison** üîÑ

The projects I could find relating to this subject either:
- Don't accept URLs 
- Don't work with long videos
- Don't add the subtitles directly to the video
- Are outdated



## **Extra details** üí°

The process is fully automatic so I actually find myself using it often, it only takes 10 seconds to start the translation. 

Every language is supported because it uses OpenAI for translation, which means you do need an API key but it only costs around $0.01 for every minute of video. I spent $5 and have been using this script for months.



## **Conclusion** üéØ

This is my first time sharing a project, so feedback would be greatly appreciated, if this gets any traction whatsoever I'll continue updating it. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions",Tikene,1h85e6v,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h85e6v/vcat_video_transcriber_and_translator/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h85e6v/vcat_video_transcriber_and_translator/,2024-12-06 16:33:39,10,0.83,10,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1h85e6v
