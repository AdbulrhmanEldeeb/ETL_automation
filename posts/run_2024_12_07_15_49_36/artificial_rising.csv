[https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct)
The 70B model has been fine-tuned to the point where it occasionally outperforms the 405B model. There's a particularly significant improvement in math and coding tasks, where Llama has traditionally been weaker. This time, only the 70B model is being released—there are no other sizes or VLM versions.",Kakachia777,1h8624m,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1h8624m/llama_33_has_been_released/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1h8624m/llama_33_has_been_released/,2024-12-06 17:01:41,76,0.93,76,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h8624m

artificial,A sufficiently advanced AI is indistinguishable from God,"I just had this shower thought. I have been listening to Geoffrey Hinton yesterday on how he says that super intelligences would compete with each other to organise the maximum of resources for themselves. Historically the most effective way of doing that has been to create a religion. If people believe that you are an omnipotent being that has the perfect absolute answer to every question, you are god.

Would you agree? Do you see how Artificial intelligence could start a religion or better yet, take over a religion as a realistic scenario for the near future?",zehnfischer,1h8qekw,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1h8qekw/a_sufficiently_advanced_ai_is_indistinguishable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1h8qekw/a_sufficiently_advanced_ai_is_indistinguishable/,2024-12-07 11:17:13,0,0.24,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8qekw
