programming,My snake game got to 57 bytes by just messing around and basically refactoring most of the code,"This byte reduction was different than the others.

Usually, I have an idea in mind of how to reduce a byte and I try to manipulate the code to make it work.


This time I was bored so I looked at the code again just because I wanted to remove the usage of the BP register because I thought ""it had potential"", you can see the PR where I managed to do so without increasing the byte count [here](https://github.com/donno2048/snake/pull/68), then after quite some time I realized a way to abuse this in such a way that would use another register (DX) to store some values without adding any bytes and thought it has some potential too because the DX initialization takes 3 bytes and could maybe be reduced somehow...

I merged the PR as it made the game a little slower even though it didn't save any bytes because I couldn't think of a way to optimize the initialization of DX, but then I realized that the initialization of DX isn't the problem, it's the solution to another problem.

The way I initialized AX up until now was with a `MOV` which is quite a waste to just set AX to 0, but I had to use a `MOV` for the `LDS` initialization, because the first byte of the `MOV` was 0xB8, but if I initialized DX there I would solve the problem and I would be able to set AX in less than 3 bytes.


The problem is that `MOV DX,` won't have 0xB8 at the beginning so I have to use `MOV AX,`, but no problem, I can initialize AX to the value I want in DX and do a `XCHG`, but then I'm left with just one byte to set AX to 0 which is impossible (and that was the reason I didn't commit that into the original PR). 

But, then I realized, we can set `DX` to 0 with just 1 byte so that after the `XCHG` AX will already contain 0.

I planted a `CWD` right between the `MOV` and the `XCHG` so that DX will be set to the MSB of the wanted value in DX which is positive so the MSB is 0.

I reverted the changes made from the first PR and merged the [new one](https://github.com/donno2048/snake/pull/69).

BTW, this time I couldn't just use the 0x0 dummy byte as that would set DX wrongly, so I had to use `LDS DI, [BX+SI+0x0]` which apparently can't be parsed correctly by nasm even with `-O0` because it always drops the 0x0, so I had to hardcode it.",Perfect-Highlight964,1h89eyl,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h89eyl/my_snake_game_got_to_57_bytes_by_just_messing/,https://github.com/donno2048/snake,2024-12-06 19:23:50,639,0.94,639,0,65,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h89eyl
