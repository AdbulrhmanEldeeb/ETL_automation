movies,Losing your local movie theater,"When it opened in 1999 as a Carmike, my local movie theater was the premier high-tech theater of the future in the area. I saw Star Wars Episode 1 there 3 times. I saw the whole Lord of the Rings series &amp; probably something like 150 other movies there over the years. My roommate worked there for quite a while.

Except for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off. My girlfriend and I saw Endgame there at 8pm on opening night &amp; there were only about 8 other people.

The last movie I saw there was The Way Back, a drama with Ben Affleck as an alcoholic basketball coach. This was March 15, 2020. Two days later, it closed for COVID &amp; never reopened. At the point it closed, it still had the original carpet, which was badly stained &amp; full of holes &amp; the original seats, many of which were broken &amp; could not safely support a person. Weird projection problems were common. Half the toilets didn't work.

I haven't been inside, but word is the building was badly damaged a few months after closure by the a big storm. It just sold at auction for $750k and will probably be turned into another strip mall or condo development. According to the assessor, the land itself is worth twice what was paid, so somebody will probably make bank. The buyer is unknown, but I wonder if the contents will go up for auction at some point.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Spain,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Slovenia. In a way, we have a double winner: Because it was mentioned in two (and actually more) comments. both 1st and 2nd place are occupied by ***Moj ata, socialistični kulak*** (engl.: *My dad, the socialist kulak*),  As always, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it certainly sounds like an insightful and impressive tragicomedy about issues that are in part even more topical than in 1987, when the movie was released.

I wonder what the next movie will look like? In any case, it will also end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And in any case, let's move on to the next country with an S: In this thread, it's all about movies set in **Spain**. And as always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Shawshank Redemption 30 years later,"I hadn't seen Shawshank Redemption since the 90s.

But today it was on the telly and thought why not watch it again.

Firstly. I can see why Tim was in that role. His presence really sells that ""pure"" figure.

Also I had forgotten how much narration Morgan Freeman does. If anything the whole movie shows different shades to the characters. From the guards to the prisoners and all. 

The only ones who are one-sided are The Sisters. Otherwise everyone else shows some good and some not so good.

Also the cinematography is really beautiful considering the circumstances. A real ""natural"" use of light and I appreciated how well lit it was. Unlike some films today where it's so grey.

I could see directing similarities between this and The Mist. First time noticing that. Yes I know same director.

I had always wondered why this film was so highly regarded. But upon watching it there is so much heart and the themes really speak through universally of resilience, perseverance and this sense of inner purity.

It's inspired me to watch The Green Mile next. I do wish Frank made more movies but alas.

movies,Jingle All the Way,"Growing up is realizing you align more with Myron than Howard. 

Howard waits until the last minute to do anything for his kid and doesn’t really grow throughout the whole movie. It’s understandable to think that he’s just going to fall back into the same workaholic lifestyle after the movies conclusion. Meanwhile Myron’s plight, akin to an Amazon worker, is way more relatable.

I hope it's ok to ask on here, I searched quite a bit but it seems to be not such a popular topic.

I'm really getting into investigative journalism movies/documentaries (of true stories of course): are there someone's you'd recommend?

I mean movies like Spotlight, She said and so on.

Indiana must race to prevent the vampires from obtaining the Ark, which they plan to use as a weapon to amplify their power, while also uncovering a mysterious connection between the ancient artifact and the vampires' immortality.

**""Deadpool &amp; Amelie""** - Wade Wilson meets his match when he encounters Amelie, a quirky and imaginative French woman with the ability to manipulate those around her in whimsical ways. Wade's chaotic life as a fourth wall-breaking, crime-fighting, mutant vigilante is at odds with Amelie's more innocent, heartfelt, and compassionate approach to life, and their differences slowly transform both individuals in ways that will change them forever. 

**""Paddington vs. Predator""** - A loveable young anthropomorphic bear returns to the Peruvian jungle that was once his home, where a deadly alien Predator also happens to be hunting. Fortunately for Paddington, his kindness and resourcefulness allow him to befriend other animals that help him outwit the Predator’s traps. The Predator becomes increasingly frustrated, leading to even more dangerous encounters, but Paddington manages to turn the tables in a film full of adorable humor and action-packed tension.

The fish at the end seems to be ready to be raptured, but since he was an animal of the water he couldn't get to the sacred place to be raptured and then died on earth.

movies,Top 50 Favorite Films of 2023: #50-#26,"https://preview.redd.it/c7mpi03nbd5e1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f24c7b36ef3516a87d57eb4cbe3f10be6f616c4e

**#50. Polite Society** \- This year seems to be the year of over the top teen movies with Red White &amp; Royal Blue, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, and Totally Killer all going viral in spite of let’s say inconsistent quality. We'll talk about another one layer one, but I wanna start with a film that deserves a lot more attention that it got. What you’d get if Robert Rodriguez made a coming-of-age movie, it's a film that embraces its blend of martial arts flicks, over the top family melodrama, and 2000s comedy to a delightful degree. I will admit it's a bit of a case of style overcompensating for a lackluster story but what makes it work overall is the charming relationship of the sisters. Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya have great chemistry with each other, creating a sweet and charming bond throughout the film. At the same time, I also dug it doesn’t shy away from focusing on the immaturity and insecurity of a younger sister selfishly not wanting to lose a best friend to her sister. It does capture that betrayal when a family or friend you thought would be there forever for you has their own aspirations. If there is a nitpick, it's that I wish the actual fight scenes had stronger and more exhilarating choreography. Not that it’s bad per say and it does make sense that a film about an action film fan wouldn’t be as polished as the martial arts films it's paying tribute to. I still would’ve like more memorable fights is all. Still the charming presentation and the comedy more than makes up for it, and I can see this becoming a cult classic amongst teens down the line. 

**#49. Unrest** \- I normally advise people to go on as blind as possible knowing little about the premise. But for this film, I think it is important to know that the entire film revolves around community anarchists working in a watch factory who are secretly plotting a rebellion. It might sound exciting but there's very little drama within the film. There's barely what you could charitably call a story and not even a plot. It's very much a grounded and straight look at how revolution is formed, with no big setpieces and few twists outside of certain workers being arrested. And yet it remains an engaging watch throughout thanks to as the says, a feeling of unrest throughout. There's a sense of simmering anger that you can feel below each scene of workers conspiring in secrecy or even as they continue diligently working for the factory. Everything is below the surface and the power of this film is very much in what is not said, in every careful and deliberate word choice uttered through thin poker faces. The sound of ticking of clocks is a constant soundtrack through the film, almost as if counting down how long the workers have until they're caught. Maybe even how long it may be even viable to accomplish a proper revolution before the window shuts forever. Or perhaps, it's a sign of how time will go on regardless of what process is or isn't made. Maybe despite the stopwatch being built, we actually still have time. Its abstract nature means this isn't for everyone but if you're intrigued about the premise and are willingly to be challenged, can't recommend this enough. 

**#48. The Deepest Breath** \- A lot of people have compared this documentary to Free Solo which is unsurprising considering both are about extreme sports and the people who find meaning and purpose in life in accomplishing the awe inspiring. And even if this film isn't as good as that documentary, this one still stands on its own as a damn good watch. From the gorgeous cinematography to the literally breathtaking footage captured of various free divers, showcasing the determination and tenacity of the divers who do this regular serving and the backdrop of the story of two people who find each other at the right place but debatably the wrong time, it's a captivating watch as we see both the limits of human accomplishment in physical feats and the love that inspires us to keep moving forward. And it'll have you hooked and holding your own breath right up to the conclusion. 

**#47. Take Care of Maya** \- I tend to not care for a lot of Netflix-produced crime documentaries. A lot of them tend to be cheaply produced and overly dramatic, not to mention often with surface level commentary and analysis. It tends to put a damper on what could be interesting stories and neuters them in favor of sensationalization. Thankfully, this documentary is not only an engaging watch but one that does proper justice towards a wronged family and highlights a corrupt medicare system that harms rather than heals. Focusing on a young girl with a rare disease and the hospital that intentionally misunderstood her case to take advantage of her family, it is a tough and heartbreaking film. It highlights not just the cruelty in corporate healthcare on not just those who need it but the emotional toll on the families, but also one of inspiration. No matter how powerless their fight may be and how they acknowledge very real risk that even standing up will only result in more pain and trauma, it's moving see the love parents have for their children and an inspiring story of courage and tenacity of a family who fought together and never gave up in spite of everything being against them. It’s a quick but emotional watch that I hope more people do more than scroll past when they go on Netflix.

**#46. Infinity Pool** \- There are films that are depressing watches for their subject matter and tone, and then there are films that are out to make you uncomfortable. Not in the sense of making you feel danger is around any corner, more poking and prodding at the limits your desires will take you. Lust, sexual satisfaction, violence, all of these desires are ones we normally tempered. Infinity Pool asks: “what would happen if you didn't have to filter these sinful, carnal desires?” How far deep would these take you that you go numb from how disgusting you think of yourself and accept it as being blasé? I fully accept this may be me overthinking this movie and being off from its themes. Regardless of my interpretation of this film though, I can deny how. From being disgusted from being intrigued and fascinated, it's a pool I dove in feet first and will continue treading its waters for the next couple of years. 

**#45. The Sweet East** \- This is a movie most will probably hate after finishing and to be honest, as I was watching it for the first time, I did find it incredibly obnoxious. It's full of insufferable, pretentious, and frequently unlikable characters, the narrative makes little sense with Talia Ryder barely reacting to anything or having any change, and by the end you think what was actually accomplished? What did we gain and what was learned? And yet much like Infinity Pool, it's that absurdity that I kept on my mind over the next few days. I kept thinking about Talia-s blasé attitude to the whole adventure - encountering blatant racism, insecure men, and snobby artists and how in a way, it actually did speak to a certain zeitgeist. And as much as I was annoyed by the film, it also kept me engaged and by the end the bitter taste actually made sense. I can't say you will enjoy this film or get as much as I did but it is a film I doubt you'll forget once the credits roll. 

**#44. The Holdovers** \- Some films sneak up on you. At first I wasn't in love with this film as everyone else was. While I thought it was good, it felt a bit too slow and felt like I'd be better served watching any of the 80s classics like Dead Poets Society and Planes Trains and Automobiles that served as inspiration for this film. And yet like the train scene in PTA, I found myself thinking more and more about my experience and realizing how warm it was and how much I took for granted. The chemistry between all three leads, not just from the award winning performances from DaVine Joy Randolph and Paul Giamatti, but also from newcomer Dominic Sessa who I think has gone criminal underappreciated. He proves himself to be a young actor full of charisma, and it's wonderful seeing the relationships the trio has with each other grow without feeling too saccharine. The gradual acceptance all three have in their places as castaways and still finding solidarity in all that is quite moving. Even if it's a predictable formula of the classic grump learning to have a heart, Alexander Payne manages to make these characters feel human and real. It's already a Christmas classic and I could easily see a lot of families having this on as a new annual tradition. 

**#43. Sanctuary** \- Power is sexy and being sexy gives power. It’s an alluring power dynamic and this film manages to make simple discussions and dialogue of it not feel drawn out for 90 minutes. For a film of almost zero nudity and zero sex scenes, this has some of the tightest sexual tension in any romantic film in a while. Both Christopher Abbott and Margaret Qualley deliver fantastic, layered performances, showcasing why they're some of the most interesting young actors right now. The cat and mouse game they play going back and forth at each other is endlessly entertaining as you wonder who's in control and who's really being played. Which one submits first? Even with the play-like structure and the bottleneck setting, this had me captivated for its 90 minute runtime. I really hope more people check it out and I hope both Qualley and Abbott continue to get attention for their work, and I'm already eagerly anticipating Zachary Wigon’s next film, also starring Qualley. 

**#42. Killers of the Flower Moon** \- If this had been 30 minutes shorter and had Mollie given more development beyond simply being the symbol of Native purity and beauty literally poisoned by the white man, I imagine this would've been much higher. Because simply on a film level, it is one of the most impressive and epic in scale. From the pacing and editing that manages to keep the three and a half hour runtime engaging despite of lull points, to the grand production and setpieces that capture how big of a plot this is, to the tight cinematography capturing it all, to the roster of a cast that has even cameo roles shine to an ending that probably one of the more daring statements Scorsese has ever made about America and its dark history. It is a behemoth worth marveling at and even though it doesn't resonate as much as I would want to, I can't deny it's more than deserving of all the acclaim it's gotten. It is a great movie that I just wish I was able to connect emotionally more with as everyone else has. 

**#41. Earth Mama** \- Being a parent is a difficult task and even more tragic are the women desperate to be a mother despite society not allowing them to be or looking down upon them for doing so. But what about the women who, controversially, ‘aren’t fit’ to be a mother? Who is really deserving of that title? That’s the tough question that Savannah Leaf’s heartbreaking debut seeks to answer: what if a woman isn’t suitable to raise her own child. In less empathetic hands, this may have been too heavy or not a balanced portrait, but Leaf’s sensitive direction allows us to come to our own conclusions while not shying away from the dirty truth surrounding it all. But the power of the film lies in Tia Nomore’s lead performance as the imperfect woman wanting to be a mother. She's able to capture the motherly instincts and drive that would make her a good, maybe even great loving parent. Yet it doesn’t shy away from how naively blind she is to her selfishness and commitment issues that would complicate things for her and potentially traumatize her baby. And what’s most intelligent is how both sides are ones you understand the causes behind even if they seem counterproductive. You want her to achieve her goals of raising a family yet at the same time you want someone to step in to guide her away from a potentially toxic and self-destructive household. It's a film with an honest maturity, culminating in an ending that is tragic but at the same time earned. This went a bit under the radar but even with the heavy tone and subject matter, I hope more check it out.

**#40. Talk to Me** \- Another year, another A24 horror movie that’s gone viral and lives up to the hype. Although in contrast to some of their disturbing but challenging and difficult movies, Talk to Me is one of their most straightforward horror flicks. That's not to say Talk to Me is less than though, it still has that great suspense and atmosphere even with the localized Australian teen setting. Despite the stoner archetypes of the cast, what this film has to say about depression, trauma, suicidation and its effects on the family don't just hit home, but feel scarier than any possession or gore the film could’ve conjured up. Couple that with teen actors that have great chemistry with each other while acting like bratty, immature kids, and some of the best gore and makeup effects that'll have you squirming in your seat, and you've got not just another good addition to A24’ horror catalog but a promising breakthrough for the Philippou Brothers who I’ll no doubt be following for their future p projects.

**#39. How to Blow Up a Pipeline** \- This'll no doubt be one of the most controversial movies I praise on this list, especially if you are immediately against the premise and what the Andrew Malm Manifesto that inspired this movie advocates. But whatever your views are about the acts committed in this film, this is one of the best and most tense heist films in a while. It's not a film asking you to agree with the act nor is it necessarily concerned about changing your mind. Frankly it could care less if you would snitch on it. Whether you want to or not, you'll have to follow the shoes of those actually willing to do the extreme, how they pull it off, and the grit they have to stand by their acts. And yet it's also not a film loudly saying why this should be done, as it doesn't shy away not just from the consequences but the lackluster success rate in creating change that acts like this. At its core though, it's a tight and tense film with a fantastic editing and pacing as you get sucked into whether or not they'll accomplish their task, and by the end a film that dares you to wonder whether they should've gone farther or pulled back. 

**#38. Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie** \- Michael J. Fox has been one of the most inspiring figures for me. While it captures his struggles with Parkinsons and the humor he maintains despite his troubles, what I love however is the narration which was taken from his autobiography. It shows how self-aware and reflective he was about just upbringing, success, and shame regarding his addictions yet also how much wisdom he still has even as the disease continues to spread. Whether or not you're a fan of his work, just know him from his biggest movies, or just know him as the Back to the Future kid, I still highly recommend this film as a shining beacon of true human fearlessness. 

**#37. Scrapper** \- For as heavy, deep, and complex films are on this list, sometimes you just need a film that's just so charming and cute. I was actually hesitant to watch this film, writing it off as something I might find too twee and cutesy. But by the first 15 minutes I was hooked in. Much of that due to how damn charismatic the central girl is Lola Campbell, in one of the best child performances of 2023. I love the juxtaposition with both them being young people forced to grow up and act like adults, Lola, the scrappy child left to fend for herself and Harris the immature manchild realizing he actually needs to mature if he’s to salvage anything from his past relationship. And while there is an exaggerated tone, particularly in the editing, neither feel like simple characters; she is not simply a wise ass smart beyond her age and he's not simply a bumbling idiot trying to be a parent. They're both trying to figure out and realize they can't be alone in surviving anymore, and no matter how much they fight there is a familial chemistry between them that they need to keep hold off. It's short and sweet, a comfortable family comedy that shows even simple, played out concepts can be an emotional ride. 

**#36. No One Will Save You** \- It's easy for straight-to-streaming horror releases to get a bad wrap as cheaply made scare fodder. Which is why one of my favorite surprises of the year came from a quietly promoted release on Hulu that probably should've been released in theaters. The big talking point for this film is the decision to have virtually no dialogue throughout. In a lesser film. This could've been a cheap gimmick for a rote house invasion story through aliens. Instead, thanks to smart pacing, writing, and a committed performance from Kaitlin Dever, it turns the film into one of the more creative horror films of last year. The lack of dialogue alongside the great sound design manages to capture, it's an engaging character study in Grief, guilt, and self-alienation. Everything feels elevated with the lack of dialogue and trust you to understand what's going on. It's also a film that invites multiple viewings as there were background details about Dever's character and her story I didn't notice on first viewing. Sure the designs and the effects on the aliens might be a little cheap but that doesn’t take away from how engrossing an experience this was. I really hope this grows a cult following and escapes the trapping it got by being relegated to streaming, we could really use more innovation amongst mainstream horror. 

**#35. Skinamarink** \- This is a film that people either find terrifying or absolutely boring, with very little in between. There's no getting around how 97% of this film is still shorts of walls, hallways, ceilings, and other rooms with a hazy nocturnal filter and with the camera intentionally positioned away or obscuring…anything. If you aren't sucked into the first 2 minutes of this film, you are likely to feel miserable and irritated by the next hour and a half. And i'll admit I was skeptical I would fall for this filma spell, yet, I was enthralled throughout by the atmosphere. There is a film that for me captures a sense of helplessness and claustrophobia as a child in the dark, knowledgeable in little besides your own uncomfortability and fear. Your paranoia as you sit or lie down pondering the thought of monsters under your bed or in your closet may sound juvenile but this film shows that that fear may never go away, sometimes it's just hidden behind your view. Again, I can't guarantee you'll like this film and I also do understand people who think this could've been a short analog horror film. But I couldn't help but be drowned in this films atmosphere and few films had that experience with me. 

**#34. Trenque Lauquen** \- Sometimes, a film can escape a cheap, low budget look not through quick editing or quick banter, but through simple engaging writing and charismatic performance. This film can be daunting being a four hour watch split into two parts and truthfully not that many action or tension driven sequences, not to mention actually hard to find a copy of to watch. And yet I was just as drawn in by the central mystery that I couldn’t help but join along for the ride as you piece together clues behind a potentially large conspiracy. And central to the film's success is the lead performance by Laura Paredes, who not only captures Laura’s curiosity and desire for adventure, but possesses a subtle but magnetic charisma that would make you want to follow her. She doesn’t know where she’s going or what she’ll even do with the discovery once she arrives at it but you can also sense a determination to find what she’s looking for. Paredes doesn’t play it off as aimless soul-searching but as a woman on a mission perhaps only she can understand. Now I will say this is lower than I would want because the second half doesn't quite keep up the pacing of the first, and meanders a bit too much for me. Still the lead performance and the first act's tight writing still come with a recommendation for me. It might not be a satisfying destination by the end but it's the journey that's the more rewarding bit. 

**#33. Bottoms** \- It’d be so easy for me to call this the Superbad for Gen Alpha gays as it is a crass, crude and immature comedy and like with Superbad, it could’ve easily fallen into the trap of relying too much on vulgarity and innuendo. But in fact there's a lot more to Bottoms than just adopting modern slang to appeal to a younger audience. From the great supporting performances (particularly Kaia Gerber and Ruby Cruz) who are game for making this as fantastical and absurd as possible to the chemistry throughout that actually makes their relationships and interactions endearing and even blunts some of the more obnoxious characteristics of the main leads. The clever visual gags, to the quick pace and editing which means jokes don't overstay their welcome, even the slang doesn't feel too obnoxious as to instantly date this movie. It's just a really charming comedy that will no doubt become a cornerstone movie for teens this decade, every generation deserves a crass Crude comedy to rally behind and this one is smart enough to transcend that age barrier. 

**#32. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem** \- It's a real shame that the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies come out as the hype and interest for the brand fades and as Paramount is going through financial instability. But it’s a testament to the films quality that even with waning interest in the Turtles brand, word of mouth meant this was able to find an audience amongst old fans, critics, and even create a new generation of fans. There’s honestly so much to praise but more than the catchy synth score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Rosa of all people, more the gorgeous handrail animation bringing it back to the comic book roots, and more the colorful cast of villains that are really funny and well voiced (including an Ice Cube performance that doesn’t just feel like every Ice Cube performance), what makes this film are the Turtles themselves. It was a great decision to actually have them as teenagers for once and the writing and the voice cast makes them so lovable. Out of all the other adaptations I've seen, the turtles here don’t just feel like teenagers but actually feel like four brothers. They’re loose and fun, immature but not like every other quippy superhero team we’ve gotten since Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, they still throw in their signature personality traits so as to not make everyone feel interchangeable. Most of all they’re relatable and kids you root for - like with Bottoms, the Gen Z slang and social media humor doesn't feel like it dates this movie because of the smart writing and the chemistry between everyone. Paramount has said they'll continue with this direction for the Turtles and I really hope we do get a feature sequel for this crew because this is the type of imagination and creativity we need in children’s media.

**#31. The Killer** \- It takes a special kind of balls for a director to make a film that's a giant middle finger to an audience that latched onto his films for the wrong reasons. A darkly comedic deconstruction of the typically stoic, masculine killer as someone just as clunky, pathetic, and weak as the “normies” he looks down upon, it's an even more impressive thing this doesn’t feel like a self indulgent mess. Fortunately, David Fincher is one of the few directors who can pull it off and make an engaging thriller regardless of whether you see the subtext or not, because amazingly it still works as a straightforward action film. The action and choreography is tight and controlled but gritty - with the break-in fight being one of my favorite fight scenes of last year, the editing creates a sense of tension while also interjecting black humor so as to not get bogged down in self-serious parody, and Michael Fassbender captures the fake macho posturing of a man realizing he isn't the invincible or even intelligent Assassin he clearly wants to be. This film has been a bit divisive even for Fincher fans but I really hope there is a reinterpretation for this film later on as even if it's not subtle per say, it still is an engaging subversion of masculine tropes. 



**#30. A Thousand and One** \- Sometimes a film's power and emotions can overcome some story and presentation flaws. This is not a flawless film by any means as it does have issues in regards to narrative and presentation. But the sheer blunt emotions it holds overpowers any issues I might have to being one of the most gripping family dramas of last year. And that comes from the Trio of actors with William Catlet and Josiah Cross also wonderful. Both are great with Cross being the eldest version of Terrie, the confused child unsure of where to go in life and whether he's getting the support from the family he'd like, and Catlet as the reluctant father who still nonetheless gives it his all to be the father Terrie needs. But it’s Teyana Taylor who delivers one of the best and most powerful performances in all of 2023. She is an absolute star here and in a just world, she'd have been recognized for this film and given so many calls by directors looking to cast her. Like with Earth Mama, it doesn't shy away from the difficulty of being a mother - both society driven and by her own personal hang ups. Yet it is more than just the template of a hardworking mother struggling to keep her family together and above water that we’ve seen in other movies. Taylor disappears in her role of unwavering love, courage and ferocity shown to fight for her family that feels so raw and real. It's not the unique take on this story and it isn't an easy watch, but the performances alone make this an unforgettable experience and I really hope all three actors can get more exposure and bigger roles from this. 

**#29. 20,000 Species of Bees** \- Children have their own dignity that deserves to be acknowledged and most of all respected. It's a concept that seems absurd and a hard pill to swallow for most people and yet this movie shows why it’s important to respect it. Looking at the journey of a trans child no older than 10, from her own self acceptance to the reactions from her mother and the grandmother she's visiting, what really drew me in is that the film doesn't sugarcoat or infantilize the audience with how difficult it can be for her family to accept it. Her older relatives are more the well meaning types more prone to tolerance than accepting and even dismissing her at times. And yet they, and in particular her caring and loving grandmother, are still the ones giving her the support she needs to not just accept who she is but love herself. I also think it's clever how this struggle is reflected in the relationship between the mother and her parents. How the lack of reciprocity from her mother and especially her father, may have contributed to her failing marriage and lacking love she needs to give to her children. It all leads up to an ending that had me stunned on first watch and constantly thinking about it for the next few days. Couple that with Sofia Otero's fantastic performance which rightfully nabbed her a Best Leading Performance award at the Berlin International Film Festival - capturing both her confusion with her domestic situation but also the stubborness to accept her identity when others won't - and you have a small but powerful trans film that’s gone overlooked by far too many. Love is complicated and harder than it, even if its to yourself, but it's better to have love and hone than to have nothing.

**#28. The Eternal Memory** \- Nothing lasts forever and everything will fade in time, no matter how much we try to keep the memories of people and events in tact. It's a tough and scary reality we all have to face even when it seems unfair that goodness can go unrewarded. But choosing to remain loving and kind in the face of that is something that has to come from inside, no matter who remembers it. And the center of this documentary is the love between Augusto Góngora and Paulina Urrutia; a wife caring for her husband slowly losing himself to Alzheimers and yet never leaving his side, still living with him no matter his condition. But it's more than a touching story of marriage as there are three different memories being fought to be preserved. There’s also the memory of the family, who he’s been as a father and husband for many decades. There’s the memory of Góngora’s vital work and accomplishments as a journalist, documenting a Chile in unrest and the resistance that helped turn the tides. And there’s also memory of a Chile whose progress is on the cusp of being reversed amidst a new regime of power. It sounds like a tricky balancing act but this documentary manages not to feel overstuffed because as it reminds us, what keeps us united and focused is love. It’s a beautiful and touching documentary that even if it hits too close for some, I can’t recommend enough if only to keep this memory from dimming too early.

**#27. How to Save a Dead Friend** \- Media often portrays love between addicts as a tragic tale of people unable to save themselves or one of them. It's often easy to criticize them when you're on the outside looking in because logic laughs at the ridiculous stubbornness people show. Yet this documentary defies that by showing us why love is still just as strong and valid even when it seems like an irrational act. That even amidst the political and social unrest of Russia, amidst an uneven and crushing economic structure denying dreams to flourish, and amidst personal demons, genuine romantic love and comfort can still be bright and worth celebrating. This isn't a film that simply ignores from how destructive drugs and addiction can be, rather it shows that relationships and the emotions we shared with each other shouldn't be tossed away even if the situations weren't ideal. Even if it wasn't ever meant to last long, that he was doomed from the start, that the memories shared between them is worth savoring and cherishing. This is an admittedly hard film to track down but if you have the chance, do watch it. It’s an emotional love story and a creative documentary.

**#26. Smoke Sauna Sisterhood** \- And concluding the inadverdent trio of documentaries, we have a small film that packs a big punch, showing sometimes blunt honesty in a closed setting can be more impactful than any big imagery a camera can capture. Some might be uncomfortable at the idea of a documentary of mostly naked women opening up about their experience of trauma, abuse, and hurt, but it's not a film simply wallowing in misery and despair. It can be tough to hear such vulnerable stories, ones that admittedly feel uncomfortable for intruding upon. But the nudity and nakedness actually amplifies their experiences - showing how unafraid they are of opening up - and like the sauna they're in also makes the act of being there one of healing. It's a double cleanse on multiple levels in terms of letting go of pain but also having the support of those ready to listen. The stories will be triggering for some people so I can't easily recommend it to everyone. But for those willing to listen, I hope it can show inner peace can happen and that you don't have to stay hurt forever.",dremolus,1h8mbvs,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,2024-12-07 06:17:22,0,0.37,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Lv5K4bNzmRq5iVWsmVRjGb8tiX9SND_AhWiu1dV3DXs.jpg,t3_1h8mbvs
movies,Is there any website listing differences between theatrical releases and airplane cuts? And anyone know as to Silent Night (2023)?,"Hello, fine folks of Reddit. 

I am a digital immigrant, not a digital native (I am not quite a Baby Boomer; I’m Generation X, but I identify with the Boomers; that means I’m old). Something I appreciate about the internet, among the many benefits offered by the profound innovation, is that people who are more obsessive than I am perform a service for the world, generally for free, of analyzing subjects I take an interest in, reliably enough for my purposes. For many movies that have multiple versions, you can find a list of the differences between the original theatrical release, and the DVD, and a director’s cut. But I am unaware of any resource listing what has been taken out (or added in, but it likely is taken out rather than added in) to the airplane version of movies.
I appreciate that you usually have a title card about the editing, whether for aspect ratio or content. I write as I stream John Woo’s Silent Night. It warned me. I checked: what I have started is a full five minutes shorter than the unexpurgated runtime. I am wondering if someone has performed the service of examining the one against the other (which might be difficult, since I don’t know how you get the airplane edition other than on the airplane itself, so you’d have the put it on, then also stream it on a device; there would be no demand for a repository of airplane bowdlerizations, presumably; once on the ground, you’d want the full content). If anyone has a sense as to this specific title, please feel free to enlighten me. Presumably, it’s the violence that has been taken out.

movies,Femme (2023),"It’s been a good long while since I have seen a decent LGBT+ film. The last was probably Moonlight. 
I saw clips of George Mackay on a TikTok and the #femme so I had to look it up and found it available to watch. So I did. 
I had no idea what this film was about other than “a drag queen is attacked and is chased by his assailant” so I was intrigued. 
I’ve just finished watching it and I feel really sad. 
I was hoping for a reprieve for Preston. That his identity crisis being realised would bring him some sort of redemption and that Jules would learn that forgiveness is what he really needed. 
The film is still one of the best I have watched. It manages to do what it sets out to do in a very effective way and the performances from George and Nathan are pure class. I hope to see more of this calibre of filmmaking and I will try to keep an eye out for it.

movies,"""Goofs""","Various websites list film goofs but some of them baffle me, I have just watched The Guns of Navarone and as with any film i like to read the Trivia and Goofs on IMDb and the TV Tropes pages.  
  
 On the mild side there is the usual guff about the wrong tanks and guns being used but the fact that Gregory Peck is an American palying a British person isn't classed as a goof. If an American playing a British person isn't a goof then an American tank pretending to be German isn;t a goof either.  This is mild because yes it's technically a goof and so i'm not too bothered that people are complaining but it's still slightly irrational to complain about it. 

  
On a more irritating note though is bollocks like ""they reused shots"", so what? It's OK to re-use a shot especially if another filmed shot would be almost identical, it's absurd to call it out as a goof. 

For me a slip up/goof/blooper would be a missed or poorly enunciated line, a bumped camera, a crew member in shot, equipment in shot that shouldn't be and other such things. I don't see how a dressed up vehicle pretending to be a different vehicle is any different to an actor dressing up and pretending to be someone they are not.   
  
Should we call out Colin Firth playing King George in The King's Speech a goof? They really should've dug up the actual King George to play the part, it's clearly historically inaccurate to not have the actual King in the part. 

This is of course ridiculous, just as ridiculous as expecting films made many years after a period to have period accurate props, It's much easier to employ actors, whether human or otherwise, and use those instead. 

  
Anyway, what do you think, is using the ""wrong"" vehicles or guns as a ""goof""? Or do you see them playing a role and being something they are not just like the actors are?

The singers that played those characters (Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX and Lizzo) were billed in the end credits before Nick Jonas' name even showed up.

movies,The Bad Boys 1 soundtrack is weird.,"Rnb and industrial metal do not go well together. I enjoy the movie, I just think the musical choices are stupid. The movie came out when rock music fandom, in the form of alternative rock and heavy metal, were almost on an entirely different planet from from hip hop and rnb fans. Both sides may have listened to one or the other as a secondary genre, but that's about it. And it was mostly rock fans listening rap as a third tier preference after alt rock and metal. And industrial rock/metal and hardcore rap actually blend pretty well together when placed together in the same atmosphere. But contemporary rnb? Sounds odd and forced, especially at a time when rnb was at its most cheesiest, cleanest, commercial and manufactured sound. In what world did most casual music fans listen to both Nine Inch Nails and Jodeci? Those bands may as well have existed in alternate universes. Maybe 1996 would have made more sense, when the music industry was struggling to figure things out after grunge, but in 1995, what were they thinking?

His voice is just a bit too high-pitched to sound threatening for a lead male. I may be nitpicking here, but he's a tenor at best. I think most leading men have either a baritone or bass voice. He just kind of sounds childish to me and I can't shake that weak, whimpy voice from Kickass. Does anyone else feel the same?

Nothing against the guy, I wish him a long and fruitful career, but I don't understand why Hollywood is trying to make him the next Stalone, Keaunu or take your pick from any other action names.

movies,The Last Samurai: Beyond the Stereotype,"Where do I begin… well this should do it. I think.

To start things off, I’m basically a *newcomer* when it comes to the posting related thingamajigs and stuff. I’d really like to give it a try and share with *you guys* some thoughts concerning a movie which I just watched a week ago or so. 

First, let’s get something straight, I will be giving my personal point of view ‘bout it, so, to be clear, I’m no expert of such or about *‘nothin* in this topic. Just a guy who would like to see what do people think about something *I feel* is *worth* talking about. 

*Let’s cut to the point*, which is: The Last Samurai - released back in 2003. **This film is-a-masterpiece**, and oh man, there is *no room to doubt*, I can assure you that it is. It comes from a time when them films had to convey a meaning. When they were actually good. If they didn’t have that little something, people simply wouldn’t take the bait. Anyway, enough of this babbling, let’s get to the real deal.

***Honor.*** 

*The whole film* \- is about honor. On paper, honestly, if I hadn’t seen the film, and was presented with this as the backbone of the movie, I would have sold in without doubt. Itself, *it already encompasses various other values it wishes to transmit.* **Furthermore**, when people argue about it being the same old *“white-saviour”* type of Hollywood movie, I just laugh in disbelief because *it’s clearly not.* Unlike those based and outdated narratives, this film actually challenges stereotypes and places the focus on a white man named Nathan Algren, who is clearly, a troubled man. *The Samurai help him,* then he returns the favour *in some ways.*

The whole point of the movie being a story revolving around the white guy, is so that people identify with him, in a sense that he’s also another person who doesn’t know anything about *Samurai ways*. Throughout its entire course, the audience is positioned behind the screens to follow a character which they understand, relate to and seeing him empathize with *Katsumoto* and his people makes it easier for us to follow. It would have been much complicated to use of the foreigners as the main actors in the role - this is not racism, it’s just more logical, that’s all. All the better, join that with *Tom Cruise’s performance* on the film, whether you like him as actor or not, he’s great, and that’s just ‘cause he tends to believe he’s the main character in the world, and in this movie, *he is.* 

&gt;\[…\] *“And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds. Others, that he returned to his own country.""*

&gt;*""But I like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace, that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""*  \[…\]

I hope you liked it guys and if you’d like to ask any questions, feel free to reply down below. Also, down-votes and upvotes are accepted, as long as you spark interest in a discussion, it’s okay, don’t mind me, express your opinion and fuck what other people think!!

movies,"I'd never seen a single Quentin Tarantino movie before, so I decided to watch them all in release order","I've always been a big movie buff, but somehow I'd never seen a single Tarantino film. I decided to watch them in release order over the past couple weeks, and thought I would put together my thoughts here, ranked by personal favor.

**10.** **Inglourious Basterds:** I know I'm in the minority here ranking this one last. Its a good movie, and particularly poignant given the rise of fascism in current times. I thought it was cathartic to see the allied soldiers respond to the atrocities of the nazis with zealous, but appropriate, righteousness. And I found a particularly juicy fan theory about Col. Hanz Landa being gay which I thought provided a clever explanation for some of his unexplained motivations and actions throughout the film. However, it felt like the movie was so concerned with its plot and with killing nazis that it left its character work and atmosphere by the wayside. Without the fan theory, Hanz Landa's choices make no sense. And Brad Pitt's character felt so cartoony, in an entirely uninteresting way. Ultimately, a good movie that I have no desire to ever rewatch.

**9. Death Proof:** I thought for sure this would rank at the bottom of my list. I gave up 15 minutes in the first time I tried watching it, and ended up circling back to finish it after I was done with all of Tarantino's other films. This film suffers from having utterly mind numbing dialogue for the majority of its screen time, while also being possibly the sceeviest of Tarantino's movies, ultimately leaving me feeling listless and uncomfortable. But, once I gave it enough time to build momentum, this movie has undeniable charm and a very, very memorable ending. I rank it above Inglourious Basterds only for respect of the game, and because personally I could see myself rewatching this if the vibes were right.

**8.5. True Romance:** This is not part of Tarantino's official filmography (he wrote the script, but didn't direct it), but I saw people insist that it was worth watching because while the movie as a whole is not 100% Tarantino, some of the individual scenes in the movie *are* 100% Tarantino. I loved [the Sicilian scene](https://youtu.be/S3yon2GyoiM?si=MVmHA_SEM6rVYuqC), and I thought the film masterfully subverted the audience's expectations multiple times. However, it feels dated to 90's in a way that Tarantino's actual films from that decade don't.

**8. The Hateful Eight:** A Frankenstein mashup of The Thing (1982), Clue: The Movie, and any western, this movie was shaping up to be one of my favorites. However, this is the only Tarantino movie whose ending was a total let down. I expected everybody to be lying, &gt;!everybody was lying, and then they all killed each other. Pulling an extra character (Channing Tatum) out of nowhere felt cheep, and the flashback felt jarring.!&lt; Regardless of the mediocre ending, the rest of the movie was great and I wouldn't mind rewatching it.

**7. Pulp Fiction:** It was crazy watching this movie for the first time and recognizing so much of it because of its massive cultural impact. That being said, I've read several pulpy books this year alone and have seen several movies that, in hindsight, stood on the shoulders of this giant, and I have to say I've never been a particular fan of pulp as a genre. I recognize that of all the pulpy movies, this is an absolutely legendary movie, but the meandering, disconnected storylines and nihilistic provocativeness isn't really my thing.

**6. Kill Bill Vol. 1:** Funny, rambunctious, and memorable, this movie is good fun. I particularly loved the [Hattori Hanzo scene and the bald guy who was like 'you understaaaaand?'](https://youtu.be/hniuEXezlBI?si=QCH2OvQLXIpDkQ2x). The randomness of that moment when he says he isn't bald was hilarious to me but apparently that is only due to a mistake with the subs - Hanzo calls him bald in the previous line, and it isn't included in the subs, so he sounds like a crazy person when he suddenly starts talking about his baldness. anyways, yeah, good movie.

**5. Reservoir Dogs:** This is such a sharp, flawless movie. I loved that it all took place in one location, and I loved the depressing, cathartic ending. No notes.

**4. Kill Bill Vol. 2:** This movie isn't as action heavy as the first one, but it feels much more… legendary. Each beat is so dramatic and over the top and memorable, and the characters are so striking. A particular standout would be [Esteban Vihaio](https://youtu.be/IfeqSxDJpZw?si=XPG26yrDh5B8hoDd), who is played by the same actor who plays [the sheriff in the flashback at the chapel in part 1](https://youtu.be/4qyZQTjS6Ks?si=edQ6cDa4O7uPfjxC), which is crazy range. It feels like the whole movie just stops and sits in the scene with Esteban and really just lets the actor flex and impress us, like Tarantino saw that character and just really wanted to share it with the world. idk, feels special, like much of the movie.

**3. Jackie Brown:** We are now in my top 3, and these are all really close calls in my mind. I absolutely loved Jackie Brown. It felt like the most conventional of Tarantino's movies, but it's conventionality is what makes it really standout. Its a clever, gritty heist movie in which the whole heist is planned out meticulously in front of the audience, and then &gt;!the whole heist plays out exactly as planned. Despite having no last minute twist or debacle to make us clutch our pearls,!&lt; the movie is utterly engrossing for every second, and the characters feel so real they could walk through the screen. I especially appreciated having a badass black woman as the main character without engaging in derivative stereotype.

**2. Django Unchained:** Jamie Foxx is an absolute Ubermensch in this movie. His character's strength and grit just blew me away. The evil in this movie was deplorable, disgusting, and horrifyingly real. The topic of racism in America, and especially slavery in American history, is very heavy and very, very important, and this movie did a remarkable job with it. Beyond just being a good Tarantino movie, this was an important American western.

**1. Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood:** This felt like two separate movies. The first 2/3's being a wandering, character driven depiction of Hollywood in the 60's, and the last 1/3 being a historical fiction about the Charles Manson Murders. Rick Dalton's fear and sadness over his uncertain career was beautifully acted. The depiction of strong male friendship, 'closer than a brother, not quite a wife' was so heartwarming. Brad Pitt's sketchy wife-murdering, hippie-punching stuntman character was… shockingly likable. What really steals the show, though, is the ending. Much more so than how Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds played to audience fantasies by showing a vague reimagining of history, this movie takes a very specific, very real, very recent (relatively) historical event and calls out just how pathetic the monsters involved were, in a deeply satisfying way. It was a poignant and respectful commemoration of real people who should not have died so tragically young.",skill_myself,1h87fj4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h87fj4/id_never_seen_a_single_quentin_tarantino_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h87fj4/id_never_seen_a_single_quentin_tarantino_movie/,2024-12-06 17:59:54,0,0.42,0,0,65,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h87fj4
movies,Why Does Bollywood Keep Ignoring Young People?,"Bollywood just can’t find the middle ground, and it’s frustrating for the young generation. On one side, you’ve got over-the-top movies like Golmaal—bright, colorful, and so unrealistic that it feels like they’re made for 10-year-olds. On the other side, when Indian filmmakers try to make something grounded, they dive straight into the Indie hellhole. These films are so bleak and heavy that, as an Indian, watching them makes you want to curl up and quit life.

But here’s the real issue: Bollywood keeps targeting the family audience or older generations. Most movies are either made for families to watch together or for the older crowd who can afford to go out and buy tickets. But what about us? The 18-25 crowd? We’re left out. We’re the ones who want stories that feel real, not some absurd comedy or a depressing indie film that makes us question everything.

Bollywood has the talent and creativity to make something honest and balanced, but it feels like they’re playing it safe. Why aren’t they making movies for us? Why is every film either for kids or parents? It’s about time they woke up and started telling stories that connect with young Indians.",No-Indication9775,1h89kdg,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h89kdg/why_does_bollywood_keep_ignoring_young_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h89kdg/why_does_bollywood_keep_ignoring_young_people/,2024-12-06 19:30:19,0,0.3,0,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h89kdg

movies,The Mist ,"Why was this movie made? How was it really received at the time? 

I understand the 2000's Hollywood zeitgeist of leaning into overdramatic corniness, but this movie takes the cake. 

It seems like a B movie, but with decent at-the-time CGI, which implies a decent budget. Apparently a well-received film in terms of popularity. I'll admit, though, the ending is probably the movie's saving grave. 

Incredibly lazy, one-dimensional characters. The ridiculousness of it all kept me watching as I kept pondering how our standards have changed, at least for a blockbuster as we now understand it. 

Perhaps a key difference now is our expectation for a theme of irony - for characters to have a degree of self-awareness when indulging in shallow, easy to predict patterns of behavior. ""marvel-ization"" might be a word for it. 

I'm just at a loss of how shit this film is. I'm at a loss of how I'm supposed to have felt while watching it. 

Best scene, by far, was when Joe slipped on a self made puddle of flammable liquid with his live mop torch and proceeded to burn himself alive. 10/10",PhiloPhallus,1h8e04w,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8e04w/the_mist/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8e04w/the_mist/,2024-12-06 22:47:20,0,0.13,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8e04w
movies,Mulholland drive is trash,"I want to start off by saying I like David Lynch’s work. I’m a fan of both Eraserhead and Blue Velvet. However when I watched Mulholland Drive for the first time tonight it just left me puzzled and overall disappointed. I felt like I was being trolled, especially in the last hour where everything just starts going out of control. The weirdest part is how many good reviews it gets. I feel like it’s people looking at the movie through rose-colored glasses and completely disregarding the story because of how “different” it is. I understand a movie having no narrative, but having no story that *makes sense* is just pointless. It felt like a bunch of random scenes put together for a painfully long 2 hours and 20 minutes.
