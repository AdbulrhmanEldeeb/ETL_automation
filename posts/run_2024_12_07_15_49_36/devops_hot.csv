devops,'Getting into DevOps',"**What is DevOps?**

* [AWS has a great article](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) that outlines DevOps as a work environment where development and operations teams are no longer ""siloed"", but instead work together across the entire application lifecycle -- from development and test to deployment to operations -- and automate processes that historically have been manual and slow.

**Books to Read**

* [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/1942788290) - one of the original books to delve into DevOps culture, explained through the story of a fictional company on the brink of failure.
* [The DevOps Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1942788002) - a practical ""sequel"" to The Phoenix Project.
* [Google's Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) - Google engineers explain how they build, deploy, monitor, and maintain their systems.

* [The Unicorn Project](https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Project-Developers-Disruption-Thriving-ebook/dp/B07QT9QR41) - the ""sequel"" to The Phoenix Project.
* [DevOps for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Dummies-Computer-Tech-ebook/dp/B07VXMLK3J/) - don't let the name fool you.

**What Should I Learn?**

* [Emily Wood's essay](https://crate.io/a/infrastructure-as-code-part-one/) - why infrastructure as code is so important into today's world.
* [2019 DevOps Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#devops-roadmap) - one developer's ideas for which skills are needed in the DevOps world. This roadmap is controversial, as it may be too use-case specific, but serves as a good starting point for what tools are currently in use by companies.
* [This comment by /u/mdaffin](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/abcyl2/sorry_having_a_midlife_tech_crisis/eczhsu1/) - just remember, DevOps is a mindset to solving problems. It's less about the specific tools you know or the certificates you have, as it is the way you approach problem solving.
* [This comment by /u/jpswade](https://gist.github.com/jpswade/4135841363e72ece8086146bd7bb5d91) - what is DevOps and associated terminology.
* [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) - Step by step guide for DevOps or any other Operations Role

Remember: DevOps as a term and as a practice is still in flux, and is more about culture change than it is specific tooling. As such, specific skills and tool-sets are not universal, and recommendations for them should be taken only as suggestions.

devops,"How should this sub respond to reddit's api changes, part 2","We stand with the disabled users of reddit and in our community. Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy blind/visually impaired communities will be more dependent on sighted people for moderation. When Reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps for the disabled, they are not telling the full story.
TL;DR

    Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy will force blind/visually impaired communities to further depend on sighted people for moderation

    When reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps, they are not telling the full story, because Apollo, RIF, Boost, Sync, etc. are the apps r/Blind users have overwhelmingly listed as their apps of choice with better accessibility, and Reddit is not whitelisting them. Reddit has done a good job hiding this fact, by inventing the expression ""accessibility apps.""

    Forcing disabled people, especially profoundly disabled people, to stop using the app they depend on and have become accustomed to is cruel; for the most profoundly disabled people, June 30 may be the last day they will be able to access reddit communities that are important to them.

If you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks:

Reddit abruptly announced that they would be charging astronomically overpriced API fees to 3rd party apps, cutting off mod tools for NSFW subreddits (not just porn subreddits, but subreddits that deal with frank discussions about NSFW topics).

And worse, blind redditors &amp; blind mods [including mods of r/Blind and similar communities] will no longer have access to resources that are desperately needed in the disabled community.
Why does our community care about blind users?

As a mod from r/foodforthought testifies:

    I was raised by a 30-year special educator, I have a deaf mother-in-law, sister with MS, and a brother who was born disabled. None vision-impaired, but a range of other disabilities which makes it clear that corporations are all too happy to cut deals (and corners) with the cheapest/most profitable option, slap a ""handicap accessible"" label on it, and ignore the fact that their so-called ""accessible"" solution puts the onus on disabled individuals to struggle through poorly designed layouts, misleading marketing, and baffling management choices. To say it's exhausting and humiliating to struggle through a world that able-bodied people take for granted is putting it lightly.

Reddit apparently forgot that blind people exist, and forgot that Reddit's official app (which has had over 9 YEARS of development) and yet, when it comes to accessibility for vision-impaired users, Reddit’s own platforms are inconsistent and unreliable. ranging from poor but tolerable for the average user and mods doing basic maintenance tasks (Android) to almost unusable in general (iOS).
Didn't reddit whitelist some ""accessibility apps?""

The CEO of Reddit announced that they would be allowing some ""accessible"" apps free API usage: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna.

There's just one glaring problem: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna* apps have very basic functionality for vision-impaired users (text-to-voice, magnification, posting, and commenting) but none of them have full moderator functionality, which effectively means that subreddits built for vision-impaired users can't be managed entirely by vision-impaired moderators.

(If that doesn't sound so bad to you, imagine if your favorite hobby subreddit had a mod team that never engaged with that hobby, did not know the terminology for that hobby, and could not participate in that hobby -- because if they participated in that hobby, they could no longer be a moderator.)

Then Reddit tried to smooth things over with the moderators of r/blind. The results were... Messy and unsatisfying, to say the least.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/

*Special shoutout to Luna, which appears to be hustling to incorporate features that will make modding easier but will likely not have those features up and running by the July 1st deadline, when the very disability-friendly Apollo app, RIF, etc. will cease operations. We see what Luna is doing and we appreciate you, but a multimillion dollar company should not have have dumped all of their accessibility problems on what appears to be a one-man mobile app developer. RedReader and Dystopia have not made any apparent efforts to engage with the r/Blind community.

Thank you for your time &amp; your patience.

devops,The state of industry certs,"I’m curious of this sub’s opinion on industry certs. I used to be a big advocate of cloud certification, largely because they were a nice forcing factor to learn new things, test my knowledge, and have something tangible to add to my resume. At one point I held nine between AWS and Linux Foundation. 

Recently life has been busy and I allowed my AWS SA Pro cert to expire. My DevOps Pro is expiring in February, which I’m a little more concerned about because that’s more in line with what I do on a day-to-day. That said, I see people posting on Linkedin all the time about getting certified, and it seems it’s really becoming less of a hot commodity these days.

As someone with 10 years of experience at this point, I’m questioning the continued importance of certification in my career. I have always told people I’ve mentored that certification is one of the best ways to accelerate your career, but does it get to a point of diminishing returns? I could use some advice from people in a similar position or more senior than myself.

Recently, I came across a post where someone claimed to monitor developer productivity by counting commits and merges.

devops,Which field has the highest demand in freelancing,"Hello friends,

I am a Node.js backend developer with 2 years of experience. I want to start freelancing, but I have no idea how to begin. Based on a friend's suggestion, I created an account on Fiverr and made a simple gig.

My question is: which field has the highest demand in freelancing? I mean fields like frontend, backend development, WordPress, DevOps, data pipelines, data engineering, etc. I want to learn as many skills as possible so that I can set up my own business and avoid working as an employee for a company.

Over the past few months, I have met many people and attended several interviews, some of which were not even related to my field. For example, I gave a data engineering interview where I built an ETL data pipeline using Node.js, Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, and Postgres. I also interacted with companies that develop gambling websites, games, and even crack software to steal user data or bypass paid APIs for WhatsApp and Meta applications.

After working for 2 years, I have realized that most IT companies have middlemen who take a significant cut of the revenue, leaving employees with very little. I want to do something of my own.

I have a few friends who are frontend developers, full-stack developers, and UI/UX designers.

If you have any advice, please share it with me. I’d like to know what strategies I should use, which platforms I should focus on, etc.

I am not interested in frontend development, and I’m not good at designing UIs. I prefer backend development and want to explore more opportunities in server-side technologies. Should I explore fields like DevOps or data engineering?

Thank you.

devops,How are you doing serverless development?,"This is turning into a bigger issue. Trying to keep this short and concise but I want to describe the problem as completely as I can.

We're in AWS. Most of our app is serverless. While it is possible to run some stuff locally against deployed microservices we are starting to run into more scenarios where we need to deploy code and infrastructure to a serverless setting to be able to develop (test) anything.

We have the following setup:
1) 3 environments - production, staging, development
2) Theoretically development is _supposed_ to happen in the development environment. But of course to save time and money it doesn't happen that way. There are whole feaures unavilable in that environment so a lot of times we are developing in the staging environment.
3) PRs are required to get into staging and production but not for development. The idea of the develop environment/branch was that it was a shared feature branch since we also lack the ability to deploy feature branches to a serverless envirment. This is tough because we all have to share the environments.

The above setup ultimately leads to the following problems:
1) Rapid fire commits. Broken builds and failed deployments aren't as big of an issue here. We're having to push out small change after small change because we don't have the ability to test a lot of our work locally. (we lack local instances of dynamo, queues, topics, lambdas, etc). On some level locally we can run against deployed services. This only gets us so far.
2) I am constatly waiting around for PR approvals into staging when working on features that aren't available in production. Like completely wasting my time waiting. Actually I wrote this post up while waiting for a PR. This is one of those scenarios where we think we saved time by not setting up the proper infrastructure in the lower environment but now everyone is waiting half a day for their 2 line null reference PR approved to deploy to staging.
3) With the rapid fire commits we have single stories spread out of probably 20 commits on avergae. So it is literally impossible to have a 1-1 mapping of story -&gt; commit. This makes something like hotfixing much more difficult.
4) whole features aren't being reviewed like they should. With spreading the commits out because of the development experience whenever someone is presented with a PR they are only looking at a small piece of the story.

Using a current project as an example: we're building several state machines in AWS. These are super useful and they work well. But its impossible to work on these without having to push code to get it tested. The infrastructure is closely tied to the code too, so its not like I can build something to fake the invocation that is going to be sufficient.

I've heard about localstack and I would imagine that's the perfect solution but of course our management wont' consider it because of cost.

Any other ideas? Branching strategies? Am I missing something obvious? This has got to be a common problem with all of the serverless architecture these days.",UnC0mfortablyNum,1h85ju1,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h85ju1/how_are_you_doing_serverless_development/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h85ju1/how_are_you_doing_serverless_development/,2024-12-06 16:40:25,12,0.83,12,0,31,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85ju1

devops,Rant DevOps and SRE Part 2,"When my colleagues and I joined a multinational corp a few years ago, one of the first hurdles we faced was figuring out how to access their internal network to contribute to the codebase. Installing a VPN on our personal devices wasn’t an option, so we were given two choices: get corporate-issued laptops with a pre-installed VPN or use virtual machines inside their network that we could access remotely from our own devices.  
Since the issued laptops all ran Windows and none of us were exactly fans of it, we opted for the VM option. Personally, I wanted to stick with Linux and avoid the nightmare of juggling two work laptops, especially since I already needed one for other customers.

The company set us up with Citrix Workspace to access the VMs, and honestly, it worked like a dream. The connection was stable, latency was low, and we had great quality-of-life features like multi-monitor support, a bilateral clipboard between the VM and host OS, and even seamless keyboard shortcuts inside the VM.

For two years, it was smooth sailing.  
Then came the bombshell: the company announced they were shutting down the Citrix infrastructure and moving to Microsoft Remote Desktop. At first, we thought it wouldn’t be a big deal. But then we realized that while RDP has native clients for Windows and Mac, it offers nothing official for Linux.  
Then came the bombshell: the company announced they were shutting down the Citrix infrastructure and moving to RDP. At first, we thought it wouldn’t be a big deal. But then we learned that we actually had to use not just any RDP client (like the Ubuntu-native Remmina), but the Microsoft Remote Desktop app, which leverages the native RDP client on Windows and Mac that isn't present on Linux.  
This is where things started to fall apart. My colleague on Mac was able to install the RDP client and connect without much trouble. I decided to dual-boot Windows so I could keep using multi-monitor setups, even though it added an annoying layer of inefficiency to my workflow. But our third teammate, who stayed on Linux, was stuck with the RDP web client. That thing is a nightmare—slow, clunky, and missing basic features like multi-monitor support.

The overall experience has been a huge downgrade. RDP connections aren’t as stable as Citrix, and most of the little conveniences we’d taken for granted are gone.

For some of the developers on our team, there’s a workaround: they write code on their local machines, upload it to the VM, and commit from there. But as an SRE, I don’t have that luxury.

devops,How we handle Terraform downstream dependencies without additional frameworks,"Hi, founder of Anyshift here. We've build a solution for handling issues with Terraform downstream dependencies without additional frameworks (mono or multirepos), and wanted to explain how we've done it.

**1.First of all, the key problems we wanted to tackle:**

* Handling hardcoded values
* Handling remote state dependencies
* Handling intricate modules (public + private)
* we knew that it was possible to do it without adding additional frameworks, by going through the Terraform State Files.

**2.Key Assumptions:**

* Your infra is a graph. To model the infrastructure accurately, we used Neo4j to capture relationships between resources, states, and modules.
* All the information you need is within your cloud and code: By parsing both, we could recreate the chain of dependencies and insights without additional overhead.
* Our goal was to build a digital twin of the infrastructure. Encompassing code, state, and cloud information to surface and prevent issues early.

**3.Our solution:**

To handle downstream dependencies we are :

1. Creating a digital twin of the infra with all the dependencies between IaC code and cloud
2. For each PR, querying this graph with Cypher (Neo4J query language) to retrieve those dependencies

**-&gt; Build an up-to-date Cloud-to-Code graph**

i - Understanding Terraform Stat Files

Terraform state files are super rich in term of information, way more than the files. They hold the exact state of deployed resources, including:

* Resource types
* Unique identifiers
* Relationships between modules and their resources

By parsing these state files, we could unify insights across multiple repositories and environments. They acted as a bridge between code-defined intentions and cloud-deployed realities. By parsing these state files, we could unify insights across multiple repositories and environments. They acted as a bridge between code-defined intentions and cloud-deployed realities.

ii- Building this graph using Neo4J

Neo4j allowed us to model complex relationships natively. Unlike relational databases, graph databases are better suited for interconnected data like infrastructure resources.

We modeled infrastructure as nodes (e.g., EC2 instances, VPCs) and relationships (e.g., ""CONNECTED\_TO,"" ""IN\_REGION""). For example:

* Nodes: Represent resources like an EC2 instance or a Security Group.
* Relationships: Define how resources interact, such as an EC2 instance being attached to a Security Group.

iii- Extracting and Reconciling Data

We developed services to parse state files from multiple repositories, extracting relevant data like resource definitions, unique IDs, and relationships. Once extracted, we reconciled:

* Resources from code with resources in the cloud.
* Dependencies across repositories, resolving naming conflicts and overlaps.

We also labeled nodes to differentiate between sources (e.g., TF\_CODE, TF\_STATE) for a clear picture of infrastructure intent vs. reality.

**-&gt; Query this graph to retrieve the dependencies before a change**

Once the graph is built, we use Cypher, Neo4j's query language, to answer questions about the infrastructure downstream dependencies.

Step 1 : Make a change

We make a change on resource or a module. For instance expanding an IP range in a VPC CIDR.

Step 2 : Cypher query

We're going query the graph of dependencies through different cypher queries to see which downstream dependencies will be affected by this change, potentially in other IaC repositories. For instance this change can affect 2 ECS and 1 security group.

Step 3 : Give back the info in the PR

**4. Current limitations:**

* To handle all the use cases, we are limited by the Cypher queries we define. We want to make it as generic as possible.
* It only works with Terraform, and not other IaC frameworks (could work with Pulumi though)

We will focus on 2 of them today: [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](http://console.cloud.google.com/)  
They are quite different yet both posess all the necessary stuff we may need.

|[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)|[GCP](http://console.cloud.google.com/)|
|:-|:-|
|[1 year free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)|[3 months free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free) \+ 300$ for paid services|
|zone doesn’t matter|only some zones can be chosen in free tier|
|1 core machine on free tier (t2 micro or t3 micro)|0.25 core machine on free tier — shared core (e2-micro)|
|up to 30 GB disk size on free tier|10 GB disk size on free tier|
|5 GB storage|5 GB storage|
|1 million requests on Lambda (works with code), free after trial|2 million requests on Cloud Run (works with containers)|
|convenient user interface|can be hard to find what you want|
|needs your bank card verification, starts taking money after 1 year trial or if excess free tier limits|only email to start, after 3 months turns your services off and asks for upgrade to paid version|
|[Container registry — 500 MB / month in free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing/)|[Pay for storage](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/pricing), but can be covered by credits|
|[Free tier description](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)|[Free tier description](https://cloud.google.com/free)|

For me, these are the main differences that play a big role.

Both of them allow to register several accounts to continue using free version longer. Both of them have nearly the same pricing after the free version stops: some services are slightly cheaper in one, some in another.

Hi, I'm a senior software developper and with my team, like many others, we work with a pretty complex CI/CD, the scripts are clean and well maintained, we use Circle CI and Github and it does what we want. Recently one job that is atomic ruins circle CI timeouts policies pretty often. We literally cannot split this job.

My guess is that if it cannot be run in a circle CI container, you have to run it elsewhere. It is what I do, shamefully I run that part of our CI/CD process locally when it happens. What do you do or what do you think would be the best thing to do?

I have 3 things that come to mind:

\- setting up a job runner for the company like a jenkins server and setting up(or cheating a pluggin(orb in the case of circle) in the CI to integrate it there

\- setting up some IAC like EC2 + SNS and integrate that with our pipeline through apis and eventing which adds lots of complexity and is potentially extremly expensive

\- having the step be blocking on the prs but totally devoid of the usual CI/CD pipeline, something that needs to be run localy and people handle those up to 7h builds themselves

Lately I have been attracted to Devops more and more and was wondering if you could give me some pointers as to how to transition to Devops or at least a Platform Engineer for starters.

My background is a bit over 5 years working as an Atlassian Admin (Cloud only). I like to think that I am well skilled with REST API, Groovy scripting, AQL (I think not really relevant). I understand SQL but never really had the need to use it extensively.

I was reading a bit on what is needed in order to transition to Devops and found out that Devops covers many different aspects and that some people recommended starting as a Platform Engineer for people with similar backgrounds as me.

All in all, I would like to start developing the needed skills for Devops in 2025 and start making the transition slowly if possible. Maybe my 1st step would be to learn how Azure DevOps works as a tool as well and start slowly from there.

devops,Jenkins Workflow Question,"Hi, I am a solo software engineer for a microscopy company. I own a pretty significant number of services and applications, and so far have just been relying on Github Actions to run my unit tests, integration tests, and releases.

I am identifying the need to finally have some kind of CI/CD pipeline. I am familiar with the concept after working at Amazon, but now I need to develop a pipeline myself.

My question is about what kind of workflows are possible in Jenkins. For some context, I have the following:

- A Django API
- An auto-generated Python client  for the API
- A package of Domain Models which are sent to/from the Django API
- A repository package that abstracts the REST API client and makes it simpler to use

These constitute a set of ""core"" services and packages, which all rely on each other to work. It is possible to change one of these packages/services without needing to modify the others, however, sometimes a feature change in one project will require all of the other projects to change.

For example, if I add a ""Food"" table to the Django API, I also need to add a Food class to the domain models, and a FoodRepository, and there will need to be new tests added as well.

Is there a way to design my workflows as a directed acyclic graph where each of my services/packages has a list of repositories that are downstream of it, and so all of those services are tested when a change is made? Many of these programs feed into each other as well, so there is a need for the output of one test to be used as the fixtures of the next test in some cases. For example, if the ""core"" services pass their tests, a script would populate a local database for use with all of the desktop applications that rely on the ""core"" services. Then if I see one of the desktop applications breaks, I know that this feature change requires the desktop app to be updated as well. Let me know if what I am asking for even makes sense.",ShagohodEnjoyer,1h6wpgg,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6wpgg/jenkins_workflow_question/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6wpgg/jenkins_workflow_question/,2024-12-05 01:03:57,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6wpgg

devops,Curious About DevOps and SRE as a Backend Developer – Where Do I Start?,"Hey Reddit!

I transitioned from mobile development to backend development this year, where I shipped some relatively simple applications. Along the way, I discovered that what excites me most, aside from building the backend itself, is maintaining the infrastructure: spinning up VMs (with containerized apps) with Load Balancers using Terraform , monitoring the application to identify bottlenecks, ensuring infrastructure security, and so on. This is the project that I actually worked on recently: [https://github.com/diasmashikov/go-compressor](https://github.com/diasmashikov/go-compressor) You can even access it from the web (https://www.gofilecompress.com)

Currently, I am using GCP and Terraform for infrastructure tasks, and I’ve been learning as I go. However, I feel like I lack a solid foundation in DevOps and GCP concepts. So, here’s my question:

* Where can I learn the basics? Is there a single book that covers fundamental, applicable principles of DevOps or SRE? Or is learning tied to a particular cloud provider? Should I focus on certifications for a specific cloud provider like GCP or AWS, and would that help me learn more effectively? (Of course, I would supplement this with hands-on projects.)
* Regarding platforms, I’m currently using GCP, but I’ve noticed that AWS seems to be more widely adopted globally. Would it make more sense to invest time in learning AWS instead?

Our applications allow customers to sign up to our service, and when they do, they will have a database created in one of these databases - which stores all their information and schemas they can interact with.  
We have opted for multiple postgres databases because we believe this would ease the load of off just one point of failure.

However, as our databases grow in size, we just scale horitzontally by adding another database ( and hot standby). This is all done on a vps - each instance on its own server - and can take some engineering time.

We have considered instead to just have one very large Primary and one very large hot standby. Is there any benefit to keeping the multiple postgres instances instead?  
I've tried to get a breakdown of cost, and I don't believe it would cost much less to go just go to one instance.

Additionally, we can't do much with pooling because each customer goes to their respective database within their respective postgres cluster.  
Whenever we join a new primary/stand by we point our new customers to this database, so this is where newest customers will be created.

With previous customers their data can be stored on one of any four of the other postgres DBs, and we use application logic to findout their database instance before connecting them to it.",ReverendRou,1h6bu4m,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6bu4m/multiple_postgres_databases_vs_one_larger_database/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6bu4m/multiple_postgres_databases_vs_one_larger_database/,2024-12-04 09:01:04,5,0.78,5,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6bu4m

Hello all, as of the beginning of this year I have worked as a Junior Software Dev with Java in the financial sector.

But in the company the management is creating a toxic environment - working long hours is encouraged, stress is through the roof sometimes.

I was told the other day that i need time be faster, because i work on the most important thing (I don’t know why they gave it to me) for the sprint/release and they expect me to not make mistakes when things are so important.

The company is under 100 employees and the team consists of 3 seniors a mid dev and me. 

If you read me previous post you can see another struggle i had on the workplace. This drives me crazy because i really love the craft of programming and was very exited in the beginning, but as time passed this jobs seems to drain all the motivation and passion. And i REALLY HOPE not every job is like that. 

Also for almost a year as a Junior i had 0 pair programming and almost none mentoring by seniors. Only code reviews with passive aggressive chats with my manager. Other team members seem to not care a lot about my state, like they see I’m struggling but it feels like they are okay with me struggling

My question here for the people that have been in a similar place - is every place like this?

devops,"rant Devops and SRE part 1
","There’s an internal change management tool I’m required to use as a developer to track any code or infrastructure changes, whether in production or a testing environment. As an SRE, I frequently make small fixes across codebases, which means I need to create detailed records documenting every action taken to resolve issues.  
The tool itself wouldn’t be so frustrating if it were intuitive and efficient, but mostly it's the opposite.  
One major problem is the overly specific yet incomplete categorization system. While there are very granular options for some scenarios, they rarely apply to the situations I deal with, leaving me to default to vague categories like “Other” more often than I’d like.  
Assigning changes to other teams is another headache. Instead of clear team names, the system relies on team codes, which don’t mean much unless you’re already familiar with them. To assign a record, I usually have to identify an individual team member and then backtrack to figure out their team name, a tedious and unnecessary step.  
All of these issues make my experience worse than it was a few years ago when I wasn’t forced to rely on this tool. To make matters worse, the interface design is severely outdated. It looks like it belongs in the Windows 98 era, which doesn’t exactly help with usability or morale.

devops,Just another DevOps Rant,"Hey r/devops,

I wanted to share my recent experience as a DevOps professional navigating the job market, in hopes it resonates with some of you and maybe even sparks a conversation.

Currently, I’m employed as a DevOps Engineer and have been working in the field for about 1.5 years. Due to recent circumstances, I decided to explore new opportunities and aim higher. I even cleared an interview for a role that required 3 years of experience—a milestone that felt validating for my skills and growth.

I made it through multiple rounds of interviews for a promising role, only to get rejected at the final stage. What stings more is that I was honest about my unconventional background—pursuing a BSCS while already working in DevOps. My technical skills and experience were enough to pass every challenge they threw at me, but in the end, my degree (or lack thereof) became the deal-breaker.

Here’s a bit of my background: Before transitioning into tech, I was pursuing Chartered Accountancy (CA). Life took unexpected turns, and I had to pivot. The skills I gained from that journey—discipline, analytical thinking, and resilience—have shaped who I am today.

But for some companies, that time doesn’t count as ""relevant experience."" It’s frustrating because by the time I graduate, I’ll have around 3 years of solid hands-on DevOps experience, yet many organizations may still see me as a “fresher.”

Despite the setback, I’m not giving up but tbh it stings. Rejections like these remind me why I chose this field in the first place—continuous learning, problem-solving, and the thrill of building scalable systems but sincerely, rejection hurts. I know my worth, and I sincerley hope there’s a company out there that values skills and grit over paperwork.

To my fellow DevOps enthusiasts: Have any of you faced similar challenges? How do you navigate hiring processes when your path isn’t “traditional”? I’d love to hear your stories or any advice you have to share.

My question is: Is there a way that DORA metrics are still usable in a situation like this, or are there a different set of industry recommended metrics I haven't heard about to offer instead?

devops,Just another DevOps rant ,"I'm a DevOps engineer with 6 years of experience and +4 SysAdmin/Cloud background.

During the final round of a four-stage job interview, one of the interviewers looked at my resume and said:

***""Six years and this many technologies? It's impossible that you've been able to focus and specialize in anything.""***

And I thought to myself: *""Don't you know what a DevOps engineer is? 4 rounds and then this?""*

It doesn't matter what kind of technology or programming language you throw at me. If it's needed, I'll learn it, solve the problem you present, and maintain the solution.

If that technology becomes irrelevant, I'll move on to learning the next one and migrate the whole thing.

*That's what I love about this job, and I believe it's a key factor in our success as DevOps engineers.*

What exactly are all these ""old CS dinosaurs"" expecting about us?

For me, there's a gap between how the IT world was viewed in the past, how people are interviewed, and **what the actual job entails today.**

What's the point of asking me the difference between a tuple and a list?

What's the point of asking me the difference between a public and private method?

You have my resume, my GitHub, my references. I've described to you how I would build a complete API for a blue/green deployment, A/B testing, or whatever else you need, we talked about core concepts related to CICD, hexagonal architechture, Kubernetes, AWS, IaC, whatever.

Why do they feel the need to ask me dumb CS, leetcode and very specific yaml key questions like that?

God! It's frustrating,

**I build things; I’m not in college taking exams.**

**Well, just another rant, tech interviews are really broken imo,** I'm not going to specialize in tools that will become obsolete in a few years.

My answer was something like:

*""My value lies in understanding the problems presented and figuring out how to tackle them. The technology I use depends more on the consensus regarding the architecture, as long as I’m not the one responsible for designing the solution. For me, the technology itself is not as relevant as being able to adapt to whatever requirements are necessary.""*

I didn’t feel like he was very convinced.

**It's like they are trying to assess if you know how to add when what you're actually doing is building airplanes. I don't add with my fingers; I use a calculator.**

Edit:

One of my main tasks is building deployment APIs, Traefik plugins, and developing in Go, Java, Python, or whatever is needed. It just doesn’t make sense to me—this wasn’t a junior position, and those questions don’t truly reflect what I’m capable of.

To all those in the comments doubting my abilities simply because I’m not a walking textbook:

 You’re exactly the kind of people this post is directed at—you don’t understand where the role is going, I wish you good luck in the generative, agents and self-fixing code era! I hope, for everyones sake, you never sit at the interviewer’s table.

-----

I’ll have the final answer next week; I’ll update the post.

I’m hoping someone who’s implemented “zero trust” system architecture before can levy in on my idea here. Is it reasonable? Is it ideal for a small team?

I’m imagining that something like this:
- I set up an EC2 profile for every service I want to host on EC2 machines. Each profile has its own security group that strictly allows for communication only with the resources the service needs.
- I set up authc with SSO, using RBAC. Maybe Cognito. Have it issue JWT.
- I set up an API gateway in front of the network. The API gateway validates JWT before routing to any resources, or redirects to an authc portal.
- Every node hosting a service has a local reverse proxy sitting in front of the service—let’s say Traefik. Its job will be to validate all JWT before routing requests to the service process, or deny the request.

I also want to implement Open Policy Agent for “higher level authorization.” Rather than JWT validation, OPA would be responsible for enforcing RBAC and ABAC. This would either be set up as a service on the network, that all nodes can reach, or as a local library on each node with a centralized policy configuration.

 I don’t know what I’m asking really—as I’m still a bit new to some of this. Is my plan reasonable, is it overdoing things? What are the right questions?

devops,lost my job last year and I'm finding it quite difficult to find local job postings specifically looking for build/release engineers. am i pigeonholing myself in my career into something that's just an IT role? What exactly HAS my role become now? What skills am I missing?,"i graduated out of school 3 years ago, did software dev for 1 year and then i was lucky enough to pivot into another job where the shop was c++.

they had no CI/CD pipelines, so I spent two years there architecting the ci/cd pipelines, spending most of my time maintaining their on-premise linux build stations, CMake/python/bash scripting. I didn't code, but I would apply the same sofware engineering principles to YAML to build complex DAG pipelines, used Docker (didn't touch Kubernetes though).

i was lucky enough to have a manager teach me about Release processes, versioning, and I was managing complex git branches between various teams and merging them. during my time there I barely touched upon c++.

i lost my job for reasons and I'm looking for a new job and I'm struggling to find anything related to build/release engineering. 

When I look for DevOps roles, most of them involve cloud AWS/azure which I have no experience in which makes it very difficult to even score an interview. most ""devops"" job postings seems to cast an incredibly wide net that ranges from IT to mostly cloud architecture.

Typically I try to keep myself a generalist while specializing in something and my approach is that I would be a generalist software developer while specializing in DevOps. 

I have 3 years of experience under my belt, but because I am a generalist I think it's pretty tough to ever apply for senior jobs where they ask that an individual has **specifically 10 years in x/y/z programming language**, so many places I'm applying to are looking at me as a junior - for example, i applied for a C# 3D programmer job and the person who interviewed me for the role was Senior C# but he would maintain the CI/CD pipelines, so even if I tried to sell myself that I have extensive CI/CD experience it didn't seem to impress him much.


There's a part of me that wants to become an expert in C++ and be a software architect but i tend to get really anxious when dealing with data structures and algoritms, but I also find joy in being able to work as ""a developer for developers"", maintaining infrastructure and scaling automations (which I feel is absolutely crucial to setup before working on development).

Anyways, I guess I'm still new in my career and I'm trying to find myself.  I thought that being a DevOps engineer, I could also sell myself equally as a Software Engineer, but it seems that there's a splitting path and I might have to choose.

This make me look into alternatives such as Atmos, Terraspace, and Terramate; however, I really don't see any BIG differences to switching. Would like to have a discussion on this and thanks for reading.

  
And btw, we use to use TFC until they changed their rates on pricing which was CRAZY! We got quotes from TFC, Spacelift, and Env0 which was comparable.

I'm creating a system that should have about 1 billion requests per month.  
Since I've never created a system that even comes close to this, I need help in deciding on the architecture...

I was thinking about:   
  
1. ELB with 4 servers (horizontal scaling) and add if needs be. Using php and nginx on each server.  
2. SQS so offload DB work instead of DB call each impression. Still, this comes out at around 380 records per second on average, so I'm not sure this is best way to go, cost wise and function wise.  
3. DB - what's the best DB to handle such a load? My plan is to collect daily data and create an aggregation through a nightly script, and removing daily data afterwards. Not sure if MySQL is the best way to go here, or BigQuery.  
4. Since each request should perform a SELECT and an INSERT, I was thinking about saving the SELECT call by having a cache server caching the results (They will be mostly the same).

devops,Recommended Setup for a Data Project. ,"Hello All,

I’m currently working on a small data project and exploring the best AWS setup to meet my needs now and in the future. Currently I have the following setup working: 

* Large number of different CSV files stored in S3 (new files are added daily).
* I’ve used AWS Glue to map the files into tables.
* For querying, I’m using Athena.

So far, the setup has been straightforward (this is my first time using AWS), and it’s working as intended aside from a few minor bugs I managed to fix.  
  
I’m looking to build a **front-end service** where users can:

* Visually query the data without writing SQL.
* See results presented in graphs, tables, etc.

Right now, I’m querying Athena manually, but it’s not very user-friendly since you have to write SQL queries every time, and if I want to add more people to the project this can simply become unusable. Also, there are strange issues with Athena. For instance, when querying small numbers like `0.0005` or `0.00003`, Athena returns them in scientific notation, I have no idea why it does that.  

Some thoughts and considerations I have:

* As far as I understand, Athena may not be cost-effective at scale.
* I’m considering whether setting up a dedicated database to store the data (instead of querying directly from S3) might be better. 
   * New CSV files are added to S3 daily, so the database would need **daily updates**, ideally automated.
* **Speed is not a priority**, so some latency is acceptable.
* Since I’m still learning, I’d prefer tools and workflows that are **user-friendly** and straightforward to implement.

**Looking for Advice:**

* Should I move the data into a database? If so, which one would you recommend (e.g., Redshift, RDS, etc.) I've red about the different ones but I'm not sure I truly understand what's better. Not to mention this also means that I'll need to connect this to a server? Where is the 'compute power'? 
* What front-end solutions would work well for visual querying and displaying results? I've used QuickSight but I don't really think it's what I'm looking for. I've started experimenting with Next.JS and Vercel. 
* Any tips on automating daily updates from S3 to a database?

I’d appreciate any recommendations or insights, especially from those with similar experiences.

devops,The evolution of running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes ,"Hey there, we've been using CloudNativePG internally for a while now and really love how easy it makes managing PostgreSQL db clusters in k8s. I used to be associated with the Data on Kubernetes community and I remember around 3-4 years ago, pre-k8s v1.14, it was really hard to convince folks to run stateful workloads in cluster (and rightly so, statefulsets are simply not enough.) 

The thing is that things have come a long way thanks to the introduction of local persistent volumes becomeing GA in v1.14 and the general emergence of the operator/controller pattern. To cover how the conversation has shifted I've written a 2-part series first on the topic of[ running stateful workloads in k8s](https://glasskube.dev/blog/postgres-on-kubernetes/) in the first place, and then a CloudNativePG guide in [part 2.](https://glasskube.dev/guides/deploy-postgres-kubernetes/)

devops,Exploring Non-Containerized Alternatives for Faster Shell Script Testing,"Docker and Dockerfile offer fast builds because they cache each command from the Dockerfile. This caching allows the build process to skip previously successful steps when an error occurs, only re-running the steps from the point where the failure happened. This works by leveraging isolated environments. But what if I need to use the local host environment instead of containers?

Another challenge arises when writing one or more shell scripts, especially when certain steps take a long time to process. In this case, any change requires starting the entire process over from the beginning, which can be very time-consuming.

My idea is to leverage Git, .gitignore (or avoid using it entirely), a Virtual File System (other than containers), and File System Watchers. The goal would be to commit each shell script for every build step so that we don't have to re-run the successful steps. This would significantly reduce build time by skipping steps that have already succeeded.

However, there are several potential challenges with this approach. For one, managing the state of the build steps in Git could become complex, especially as the number of scripts and changes grows. Using file watchers and a virtual file system may introduce performance overhead or synchronization issues. There's also the potential for creating unnecessary complexity in handling changes that affect multiple steps, or dealing with edge cases where certain steps depend on dynamic conditions that are hard to track.

devops,Need advice on logging setup (EMR Spark on EKS),"Hi all,

I work in the data platform team and we manage the infra for EMR Spark on EKS. Currently, the logs are sent to S3 (using fluentd sidecar container) where the users can view them. We are thinking of a way to remove console access from the developers and find a way for developers to still view the logs.

Here are some of the requirements:

\- There should be access control so that the developer of one team cannot view the logs of the other team

\- The developer should be easily able to view the logs

Some context:

In EMR spark has the concept of virtual clusters (namespaces in Kubernetes) so whenever a job is submitted 3 different types of pods are spun up (job runner, driver, executor). There can be multiple executor pods. We want the logs for all of them. We initially thought of sending logs to a central location like Splunk or Elastic Search but we want all of the logs to show up together. By this I mean all the logs of the job runner pod should be continuous as it is easy for the developer to find bugs. Since there will be multiple executor pods if they get mixed, the developer would have to learn some kind of query language to see the logs from a particular executor pod.

What I am thinking of:

I am thinking of exporting the logs to S3 using fluentbit and then building a UI on top of it which can take care of access control and show logs of different pods. This might not be the best approach and I don't want to reinvent the wheel I would love to know if there are any existing solutions that I can use. One problem with this approach is that the logs won't be real-time as I am planning to set the fluentbit flush interval to 10 minutes.

devops,Unpaid oncall.. help,"I’ve been in my role as a DevOps Lead (middle management + hands-on) for almost 2 years, with close to 10 years of experience overall. During the interview process, there was no mention of on-call duties in the job spec or discussions. However, after I joined, I was told I’d need to be part of the on-call rota. It was framed as “just in case” since the infrastructure is stable, and we rarely get alerts.

To be fair, this turned out to be true—our scaling is solid, we don’t deploy to production after 3 PM, and alerts are infrequent. Occasionally, we get RDS or ECS alerts due to poorly optimized queries or APIs, but they’re not regular.

The issue is that we’re a small team, so I’m on call every other week (Monday to Monday). Even with minimal alerts, the expectation to be ready to respond ties me to my laptop and impacts my personal life. I feel I can’t fully relax during on-call weeks, even though incidents are rare.

I’m well-compensated and the role is fully remote, but the on-call rotation wasn’t mentioned during hiring, and my salary wasn’t presented as factoring in on-call duties every other week.

Has anyone faced something similar? How would you approach this with leadership?
I want to raise it professionally, but I’m not sure how to balance acknowledging the positives of my role with expressing the impact this has on my personal time. I’m also open to advice on how others have handled on-call rotations in small teams as I do now manage the oncall process so I can make changes to it.. I was thinking maybe to suggest only on call rotations on weeks we do feature releases to production or something along them lines.

If you are using such a tool, how does a typical Development workflow look like for your team? 

We use GIT SCM leveraging Azure Repos, and C# and Typescript are our primary languages for development.

Thes tools provide the following capabilities

\- Static Analysis of Source Code - SAST - Figure out coding vulnerabilities like SQL injection attack in code text.

\- Software Compisition Analysis - SCA - Figure out vulnerabilities in packages eg. nuget, npm etc

\- Secret scanning

\- Container and Docker file Vulnerability scanning

and many others

As part of the adoption into our development team, I do not want us to be blocked by a deluge of information.

I am thinking a practical way of introducing a product like this would be

\- Do a baseline scan of the main branch of the repo, and identity the top bugs/issues and create a backlog and a plan to fix them over the next few weeks/months.

\- Enable PR gating ensuring all the above checks are run and if any new vulnerabilities/code smells get added - we get notified/alerted. It will be \*hopefully\* easier to fix something newly introduced as part of a new PR than fix all the bugs introduced over the last 12 months or so!

\- PR check probably for container builds is time consuming so can make that part of nightly build checks.

I am struggling a bit with a task that is overlapping a few concepts I am not super well versed in and looking to get pointed in the right direction.

We are a mostly windows operation and manage deployments via multi stage yaml pipelines in azure. Many of our applications are web based with certificates in IIS etc., however our certificates are purchased through GoDaddy and previously have been manually managed and uploaded as needed. We are outgrowing this and looking to automate the solution.

We also have the certificates stored in azure key vaults per application/environment so deployments can pick them up there when needed, however this doesnt help if a cert expires between deployments and we are looking at ways to automate cert checking and deployment independently of code.

Right now we are going down the path of a ton of powershell and I feel like really over complicating the situation, ultimately we are trying to accomplish this workflow:

Automate pipeline run overnight to check web servers certificates for expired or soon to be expiring certificates ( &lt; 15 days for example). If a certificate gets flagged as expiring or expiring soon, check the associated key vault for a new version of the certificate and install it, update the binding in IIS and remove the old certificate from the server.

Basically the situation is we signed on more clients (DoD customers) and federal sales promised them 24/7 support for our product which was a requirement from the client. We discussed it with mgmt and we were ok with rotation on call if we get extra bump in salary to reflect the extra hours we will be working. Management said their will be no extra compensation as it will be expected duties as assigned. 

Well that didn't go well and 3 of our most senior architects who built the product quit the same day after we had a all hands call on about this. 4 more engineers put in their notice. Had an ""emergency"" meeting this morning and magically they have funds to give all of us a bump in our pay for working on call. Those 4 engineers decided to rescind their resignation. 

Only reason they can't get rid of us is because we all are Cloud, Infrastructure, SRE, Platform engineers with security clearances. They can't just off shore our jobs and can't really find qualified engineers with senior level knowledge and low-ball another candidate.

devops,Books for DevOps in R&amp;D,"  
Good day,

We are an R&amp;D team developing Python-based solutions, and we're gearing up to productize our first prototype. As we're relatively new to this, we want to design a scalable and maintainable system, and we're planning to leverage the Azure suite. Here's what we're aiming for:

1. **Model Training**: Ability to train machine learning models on a per-customer basis.
2. **Customer-Specific Data**: Securely store and manage customer-specific variables or parameters.
3. **Deployment**: Create a system that's easy to deploy and manage, ideally automated through CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure both horizontal (adding more nodes) and vertical (upgrading resources) scalability to meet performance demands.
5. **Standardization**: Define reusable, consistent practices for development, deployment, and scaling.
6. **DevOps Best Practices**: Establish strong DevOps workflows tailored to Python and Azure ecosystems.

We're looking for **resources** (books, online courses, blogs, etc.) to help us create this knowledge base and build a system that supports these goals. Ideally, something that focuses on:

* Azure-specific tooling (e.g., Azure ML, Azure DevOps, AKS).
* Python-based workflows.
* Best practices for CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and containerization (e.g., Docker/Kubernetes).

If you have experience with a similar setup or know of any great resources, we'd love to hear your recommendations!

* Self-service Internal Developer Platform
* CI / CD implementation &amp; management
* Observability lead: (alerting, instrumentation, best-practices, cost mgmt, oss, etc.)
* Internal best practices adoption (from linting to testing)
* Data platform management (for teams with heavy reliance on real-time data analytics needs, extensive kafka infrastructure, etc.)

devops,Experiences with Database DevOps,"So, I'm basically looking for some suggestions/experiences on managing databases from a DevOps perspective. 

We're a small company, do lots of software releases per week, and consider ourselves pretty mature from the perspective of CI/CD automation and control. 

But we're still kind of stuck with databases. We're not big enough to justify having a dedicated DBA, so most the devs have pretty free reign when it comes to DB architecture for their apps, as well as running queries when troubleshooting production. 

Deeper performance/optimisation stuff is still done by our SRE-esque people such as me.

We have a cobbled-together process for DB changes, but it's pretty manual and still error prone. Tickets have to be logged and assigned to someone with the correct access (i.e. me), etc. When devs want to run a query in production, we have insufficient guardrails to prevent them tanking app performance or even accidentally deleting data. From a compliance perspective, we don't have enough observability. 

We have a mixture of DB technologies; Mongo, MySQL, MSSQL. There is some usage of things like EntityFramework, but not for managing changes to DBs, so it's not really feasible to try and ressurect them. I'd like a standard process for all DBs.

So I'm interested to know what tools other people are using. I found [kviklet.dev](http://kviklet.dev) and as a free and simple tool it seems nice. I particularly like the ability to provide time-boxed access to run queries, along with PR-style approval for changes in production. Plus the fact that all queries against the DB are logged.

But I'm worried that it's still very Beta, the discussion on the next release has gone quiet since June, and there's been very little activity on it in general. So I don't want to bring this into our process only to find it abandoned in six months.

I've found the usuals like Liquibase and Flyway, but they don't seem to also have the functionality of ""general controlled access to run queries against databases"".

devops,Is there a catch here? Why choose DigitalOcean when Hosting*r offers so much more?,"I’ve been comparing hosting options for the early stages of a social network project. I came across two options that seem wildly different in terms of the resources they offer:

|**Specification**|**DigitalOcean Basic (2 vCPUs, 2GB)**|Hosting\*r KVM8 (8 vCPUs, 32GB)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**vCPUs**|2|8|
|**RAM**|2 GB|32 GB|
|**Disk Space**|60 GB SSD|400 GB NVMe SSD|
|**Bandwidth**|3 TB/month|32 TB/month|
|**Cost**|$18/month|$20/month|

The resources offered by Hosting&amp;r are so much higher that it seems too good to be true. I get that there’s likely a difference in quality. For example, even if Hosting&amp;r’s 32GB RAM doesn’t reach its full capacity and performs more like 10GB in real-world scenarios, it’s still 5x the RAM DigitalOcean provides. The bandwidth difference is also insane - 32TB vs. just 3TB.

Given that I’m building a social network in its early stages with about 100 users initially, is there a major reason to stick with DigitalOcean? Are there hidden trade-offs in Hosting&amp;r’s offering that I might be overlooking? Or does the sheer quantity of resources compensate for any quality differences?

devops,Why is it hard to hire good Devops Experts ? ,"
I’ve talked to so many people—team leads, managers( even from some of the top product companies who are willing to pay higher than industry average), and even startup/unicorn  founders—and there’s one complaint I hear over and over: it’s really hard to hire good DevOps people. They’re always saying things like, “It’s so tough to find someone with the right depth of skills.” What’s your take on this? Why do you think hiring DevOps experts is such a challenge? Have you faced the same issue in your own experience?

Edit 1: 
I agree while there are some who want to underpay and ask the sky, this cohort also includes a folks from some of the top product companies who  work with as part of my corporate workshops. 
The complaint is more of n the lines of depth of skills. Their say is people put 15 different skills in their resume, have certifications as well, but seem to have surface level knowledge. I have rephrased the original question accordingly. 

Edit 2 : 

I am not a recruiter. I am a corporate trainer, specialised in Devops , and ofcourse a self made Devops guy who started with his Linux/ops/tech ops career even before devops as a word was born. . The reason why I ask this is to provoke both sides, companies who want to hire but struggling ( not because of cost reasons, people who want to underpay for someone who is adding lot of value, let them suffer, and rot them in hell… ) and techies who want to make a career in devops and struggling to think about the root cause and the real problems, and come up with solutions, together.

* Operational day-to-day experience running a SaaS on k8s: About one year
* Do not possess CKA; Cannot afford to certify without quite literally starving myself and my family for a month
* I had AWS SA-A certification (though it expired in 2023)
* Craptons of experience with Terraform; most likely, several thousand hours worth at this point
* Hundreds to thousands of hours writing GitHub actions
* I can use git! (Apparently, this is a thing)
* Saved a data analytics organization $900k in annual spend by moving them to Snowflake
* I can code, yes: Python, Node, PHP, and some Go and C#
* OK, fine... I can code in ColdFusion too (choice of language for one solution was NOT my idea)

Notables:

* Am Canadian
* Do not possess a Bachelors degree
* I once discovered and reported a security vulnerability at 10 AM, and was told at 3 PM that half the management team had been terminated over it... oops.

A year ago, I was a senior earning six figures. Now I'd be happy with an internship making barely minimum wage.

devops,Question regarding prometheus mointoring and security measurement,"Hi Everyone, I made a post here before and I probably go with prometheus/alertmanager/grafana/several exporters for my small env (I noticed that it only have \~100 nodes which is way smaller than what I expected). Anyway.... probably life just gets easier. 

But I have several question regarding the security part. As far as I know, every target node will expose port 9100 if node\_exporter is installed and prometheus will use pull method to scrape the metrics from each target. Since the web UI for node exporter is accessible. We can set up basic auth and TLS for the communication.

For the TLS communication, prometheus will also require a cert and basic auth to communication with grafana. But for TLS  between prometheus and node\_exporter, how many cert do I need to use? Does it mean that for every target node, they need to have their own unique certificates singed by our internal CA, and how prometheus actually scrapes those metrics in an encrypted way with https. 



    for the prometheus.yml
    Do I just need to add the CA cert under the job_name?
    ```
    job_name: pls
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      ca_file: ""not sure what CA file here, is it the CA cert that signed the node_exporter cert?""
      insecure_skip_verify: true
    

Can I share the same node\_exporter TLS cert among all the target node?

  
Besides, for the resource planning, how do I determine how many samples/second or /day per nodes? is there any reference I can take for each exporters to plan the disk space to be assigned for a data retention policy of 1 year?

Currently the basic setup for the prometheus/grafana/alertmanager/node\_exporter are completed. But I need to make a security measurement on how the data flows and scrapes so that I could build a good observability in this environment. 

Hopefully I could get more recommendation from you folks!

devops,A small binary (2.2MB) to write portable scripts and replace Bash,"Hey fellow devops!

I am crossposting from the /r/golang sub because I think it might be relevant here as well. I wanted to share a solution I’ve started using that might help with scripting challenges. I repackaged [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) —a lightweight Ruby runtime for embedded systems—into a tool for writing cross-platform scripts and build pipelines.

As a developer, I often write scripts in Bash, but I’ve been burned more times than I care to admit by its limitations:

- Non-portable flags in coreutils between macOS and Linux.
- Missing data structures.
- Poor error handling and cleanup when things go wrong.
- Etc, ...

Dynamic languages like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript seemed like a better fit. However, these ecosystems are far from lightweight—they take up dozens (if not hundreds) of MB—and they aren’t self-contained. For example, if you need YAML support in Python, you have to manage, install, and source additional dependencies.

Frustrated, I started looking for an alternative. You can check out my journey in [this blog post](https://platipy.notion.site/The-quest-for-the-optimal-scripting-language-b013b3e35a5c4c6c8d5b4a7a31cb1508). Long story short, I discovered mruby and decided to repackage it into a single, self-contained binary (~2.2MB) with batteries included:

- CLI tools: Optparse for argument parsing, ANSI colors for better output.
- File system: Glob support across all platforms (including Windows).
- Data handling: Built-in YAML/JSON support.
- Networking: HTTP/HTTPS client/server capabilities.
- Task management: A simplified version of Rake.

You can even customize it to fit your specific requirements by adding or removing dependencies and repackaging the binary.

I like to think of it as the busybox for scripting—a lightweight, single binary that covers a wide range of use cases.
I now use this as a replacement for tasks where Bash or Make would have been my go-to tools. The repository includes [example scripts](https://github.com/IxDay/mruby/tree/main/examples) (e.g., using kubectl, vault, or openssl) to demonstrate its capabilities.

devops,"Switch jobs within same department, after only 5 month since starting?","I have recently been accepted at a University to work as a DevOps/Linux Applications Engineer, in the Application Operations Team. During the interviews, my now teammates (mostly older men) have warned me that the job might be not as exciting as I would expect. However the conditions of the job (salary and commute) were too good for me to pass on, and I thought I'd still be able to fill my workdays at least.  
  
I've been working here for about 5 months, but I noticed that I usually don't have enough work. I've been given one server to ""migrate"" to a newer OS, and been tasked with fixing some of the vulnerabilities that the vulnerability scanner found. However this is not nearly enough work to fill a day, as I'm usually just waiting on others (like the developer of that server) before I can continue working. Many days I reply to some emails, and then I have nothing to do for the rest of the day. I've already asked my project owner and my scrum master a couple times if there's something else that I can work at, but they fail to come up with things.  
  
Besides that, I'd love to work on more ""DevOpsy"" solutions/projects for the department, but since my team is the ""Application Operations"" team, there's only a limited amount of solutions that I can work on. The Applications are also usually quite easy to set up, static, and only need to be updated once or twice a year. So I don't see much need for my own role as DevOps Engineer.   
  
I tried to come up with some projects that would help the department as a whole, for example automating certificate management with ACME for myself and others. However, these projects progress very slowly due discussions about whether it's really my teams role to develop this, and whether I should be given access rights to the loadbalancers.  
  
Recently, I found out that another team in my department, that is more DevOps involved,  just opened a vacancy  for ""DevOps Engineer"". I also have had contact with this team and they seem more young and dynamic, contrasting with my current team. I am tempted to apply for this position, but I am worried about what management will think, since I'm only employed for 5 months so far.

devops,Jaws Deploy (Octopus alternative),"We are a group of developers that have been been using Octopus for a wide range of projects for many years. It has served us well, but the insane price hikes makes it impossible and totally unacceptable to continue using it.

So - a year ago we set out to build an alternative: Jaws Deploy (pun intended… sharks eat octopus).

We have had a closed trial since August 2024. There are currently one fairly large and a few medium sized organizations using it to manage deployment of \~25 C#/C++ projects to around 120 machines (Linux &amp; Windows) on all continents.

We are now ready to bring on board more trial users. We will assist all trial users with setting up deployments in Jaws, and we will build the product based on feedback. Pricewise we intend to keep it simple; Jaws will cost 50% of Octopus. We also have a free plan!

We support:

* Use Internal or External Nuget repository for builds. Or use FTP, Blob, Gitlab, Azure, TC, Jenkins etc). Push &amp; Pull supported.
* Transforming config files &amp; injecting secrets (Azure Keyvault, AWS or any other source)
* Running custom scripts (Powershell 7)
* Pre-made deployment step templates
* Streamlined installation of agents on machines (Run a script or use Octopus to deploy Jaws 🦈)
* Dashboard for keeping track of Releases, Deployments, Machines, Environments etc.

Future roadmap:

* Import projects directly from Octopus (Q1 2025)
* Bash &amp; Python Support (Q1 2025)
* More deployment step templates (Q4 2024)
* Support for Docker/Kubernetes (2025)

devops,Pushing Directly to TEST environment?,"For some context: i am a junior engineer who has been given the ‘reigns’ (not really but everything is coming through me for now) - We are in the process of moving our pipelines to AWS codepipeline for internal reasons. Now the request was brought up by our Development team that they would like the ability to push directly to test. 

Our Workflow is the following
Currently, they are pushing to MASTER, once a merge is detected to master, a build is then kicked off in the codepipeline, and builds the application and adds the application code to the docker image, which is then pushed to ECR and ECS, and ECS dev service is then running(assuming all is good). There are no other TEST/PROD pipelines at the moment. If they want to deploy an image to TEST/PROD and are happy with what they initially pushed, I would then manually promote the image to the TEST/PROD environments, by “promoting” the docker image to the new environment. This workflow essentially forces all stages, DEV, TEST, STAGE AND PROD to be the exact same and it prevents any drift.

Upon having the conversation, essentially , i was flat out told , there is no need for DEV(from their stand-point), as they only use TEST , as it closely resembles prod. Essentially, they would push directly to TEST if they could, DEV not as much, as they could - was the feeling I got.


Question I have is,

1. Are you guys allowing your development teams to push directly to TEST? If so how are you doing so without having any drift in your environments? It is something which should be allowed?

2. Open to any suggestions on how to allow that, assuming you are in favor for this.

devops,Git branching strategy,"We are pretty small ""team"" of 2 people + sysadmin/devops. We have prod, test and dev. Idea was dev -&gt; test -&gt; prod. We pretty quickly ran into issues like me needing to deploy something to prod but the commits from the other dev would be included as well, but his wasn't approved/tested yet. So cherry picking from there. Thing is that created multiple commits with the same changes. So at the end we landed on something else.

Again we have dev, test and prod. But dev is equal to prod. So you start branch from dev, do your stuff, merge into test. When it's tested merge into prod and dev and close the branch.

devops,Postgres RDS is too expensive - ,"\- I run engineering for an Indian company serving Indian customers.

\- We run a multi az rds postgres on a db.m6g.12xl instance with 10tb of storage in ap-south-1

\- This is costing us 12k USD per month

\- We are constantly spending time optimising application performance since IOPs is a challenge



Now my question is, is anyone running postgres on data centers - I feel like the SSD storage of 100 TB with replication in multiple data centers with similar hardware would still be less expensive to us than this while giving a lot more performance. There will be some upfront investment needed but over an year it should pay for itself.

  
The database is both read and write heavy.

  
\- I would like to hear stories (both good and bad) of being off the cloud and running things on your own.

\- Are there alternatives to RDS postgres while giving me cost and performance benefits.

devops,Looking for help/ advice please ,"Hi, I joined a bespoke devops agency offering microservices 3 months ago as an AE (SMB). I want to run by you everything that we have been doing since then and learn from you engineers if were on the right path.

1. We created an Upwork and also managed to gen 10K in the three months Ive been here. I believe we can easily do that monthly just from Upwork alone but as of now our team is small AND WE DECIDED TO focus heavily on delivery rather than just sourcing new business (so we can get 5 stars and grow organically)
2. We started a fiverr offering microservices and some basic tasks with the intention for fostering connections and upsells in the future (no orders till now but clicks are increasing)
3. We are working on a devops cost savings report to use as part of lead magnet when we start targeted outbound soon to send to tech managers looking for a new hire to show them how much they can save by hiring (any agency) for a cloud migration over lets say a full time employee (factoring in 401k, dental, vision, recruitment costs, etc). Ik its not the best strategy but I firmly believe that its much better than just cold emailing people asking them ""if"" they want something.
4. We will be launching cold email and Linkedin soon

devops,I love this profession,"Hello! First time posting here. This may off as a rant. I got started in DevOps mid-2022. Before that I self-taught and worked in junior dev/qa. I live in Canada. I work at a small (50 person) company, for 2 years I worked with a Senior DevOps. This year I am a one-man DevOps team.

Context aside, I feel like there is something special about this work. It’s always something new and interesting to work on. It’s broad, so I work with nearly every other dev team. But there is specialized work in things they otherwise don’t do well, like infra code, ci/cd, automation, cybersecurity controls. I get to incrementally make things a little more organized, or cleaner, or secure; it feels satisfying.

I like my work culture. A small group of smart people who are kind and relaxed and grant me autonomy. The pay seems low, starting at 60k and now 83k. I did try to get a job offer elsewhere this year (to find better pay), but gave that up. Hundreds of job applications over ~7 months, a couple interviews, no offers. I believe there seems to be an over-abundance of unemployed IT people in Canada (multiplied immigration rate the past few years?). That said, it feels more like a fluke that I could get where I am. I could so easily have been stuck unemployed, lacking experience, or intellectual purpose.

I am wondering, how do you feel about this profession? Your experience in the job market and at work? Your work culture?

devops,[HELP] Python Developer Struggling with JupyterLab Extension Setup - Can't Get Past Installation Stage,"Hi Devops community! I'm primarily a Python/data analysis developer trying to create my first JupyterLab extension. I'm stuck at a really frustrating stage and could use some guidance.

**What I'm Trying to Build:**
A JupyterLab extension that shows tooltips of Python function content when hovering over markdown links in Jupyter notebooks. For example, if I have a function:
```python
def my_function():
    """"""
    My docstring
    """"""
    return ""Hello""
```
And a markdown link `[Click here](#my_function)`, hovering over it should show the function content.

**My Current Setup:**
- JupyterLab 4.2.6
- Python 3.10
- Using virtual environment
- Project structured following JupyterLab extension template
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Warren8824/jupyter-hover-tooltip.git

**The Problem:**
Even though I'm just trying to get the basic extension recognized before implementing Python functionality:

1. The extension builds without errors:
```bash
   npm run build  # Succeeds
   pip install -e .  # Succeeds
   jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite  # Succeeds 
```

2. Server logs show it's loading:

```
   jupyter_hover_tooltip | extension was successfully loaded
```

3. But the extension is invisible in:
   - `jupyter labextension list` output
   - JupyterLab's Extension Manager UI

**Key Files in Place:**
- setup.py with proper Python packaging
- package.json with JupyterLab extension metadata
- __init__.py with proper extension registration
- webpack.config.js for building JavaScript components

**What's Confusing Me:**
1. I understand Python packaging but this hybrid Python/JavaScript setup is new to me
2. Everything seems to build correctly but JupyterLab won't recognize the extension
3. I had it working once before but can't reproduce that success
4. Can't even get to testing the actual Python functionality because I'm stuck at setup

**Questions:**
1. Is this a Python packaging issue or a JupyterLab configuration problem?
2. Are there specific Python-side debugging steps I should take?
3. How can I verify if my Python package is correctly registering with JupyterLab?

I've spent over a day just trying to get past this setup stage. As someone who usually works with pure Python, I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about how Python packages interact with JupyterLab's extension system.

All code is in the GitHub repo. Any help, especially from Python developers who have experience with JupyterLab extensions, would be greatly appreciated!

devops,Hybrid cloud - azure arc agent and IMDSv2 from AWS,"Hey guys! 👋🏻 I don’t know if I should put this question here but got no answer so far on azure forum.

I’m talking about an hybrid cloud environment. On my work, we have aws ec2 instances running which have azure arc agent installed on them. For now we have been using IMDSv1 which allows for calls to instance metadata service with or without token. I’m changing that, so I have updated all our scripts to use tokens to get the info they need from IMDS.

Now, here is my question. What about azure arc agent? It seems we are having some requests without tokens coming from the arc agent. What I was told was that azure arc agent would adapt once I enforced IMDSv2 and would start making requests with tokens for the authentication.

I tried to look into Microsoft documentation to try and get information to support this claim. But since I’m new I’m still not sure if I’m looking into the correct place. 

Can you help me guide to the correct piece of information or explain me better this scenario?

devops,Database Gateway for Controlled Query Access,"Hey DevOps,

I’ve built a [database gateway](https://github.com/kazhuravlev/database-gateway) to provide controlled access to production databases with fine-grained permissions and secure query execution. 

Key Features:

* **Role-Based ACLs**: Define access rules at the instance, table, and column levels.
* **OIDC Authentication**: Users log in through OpenID Connect.
* **Multi-Instance Support**: Query multiple PostgreSQL instances from a single interface.
* **Web Interface**: Execute approved queries and view results securely.
* **Query Storage**: Save query results for later access or export.

How It Works:

1. Users authenticate via OIDC.
2. ACLs enforce access to specific instances, tables, and columns.
3. Approved queries are executed, and results are stored securely.

Built For:

* **Developers** who debug production data.
* **Team Leads and Product Owners** who access production data for reporting.
* **DevOps** who run queries on behalf of other roles.
* **Security Engineers** who ensure sensitive production data remains protected.

devops,"Dumb question, a 2 credit undergrad research course shouldn't require me to build a Dockerized Microservice Infrastructure right?","So I'm(M22, Senior, Math Degree) doing this undergraduate research on stylometry of medieval authors. There's a ton of unknown medieval works which we hope we can attribute the text to a specific author. So going in I thought we'd just need to use a simple python notebook, process the files that way, we get an embedding space at the end which we can train from.

  
The weeks go by, and this text datasize is huge, and the GPU requirements forced me to use cloud architecture. So I'm realizing to accommodate the memory overflow, the crashes we have in-between each notebook cell the notebook approach wouldn't work. 



So I broke them up into python scripts and then attached each one to push and pull from a SQL database which has all the data. I know not the best approach but it works.

  
I bring this to the professor and show that the test sample dataset works. He says, great wrap it up into a streamlined process so we can drop .txt files into a folder and each of the scripts run and we get the embedding as the output.

  
So I start realizing, oh I have to wrap each script into a Docker microservice architecture, use rabbitmq to queue the messages. Create an S3 bucket to drop files in and then upload the processed into a database. So I'm about to finish the microservice infrastructure....then I was like. What the hell am I doing for a 2 credit undergraduate research class? 

  
So a part of me is like, 'damn professor, you're asking too much. I can do that, but I really shouldn't for a 2 credit class' but I don't know if I'm the insane one. I'm like new to the whole field, I have no relative sense of context here.

  
So yall are professionals in the devops sphere. My intuition is that this is clearly too much for an undergraduate student to do. I don't know if it is. 



I have a return offer lined up with a finance/tech company. I'm thinking, if this is as valuable as I think it is I really shouldn't be handing it over for free.  I should like, sell the IP to my company  get a fat juicy bonus -- pay off my student debt faster.  Thing is this whole thinking fails if making an NLP Docker Infrastructure isn't as impressive as I make it out to be.

If it is pretty meh, I'll worry less about IP and just give them to both.

devops,"Modern, open-source server management tools","Hi,

I would like to hear your professional experience and advices on how to manage servers as a solo dev/sysadmin in 2024.

I am a full-stack dev and solo business owner, and i manage my infrastracture alone. I am quite proficient in linux terminal, however soon the number of my servers will be unmanageable by doing manual sshing and adhoc housekeeping. I want to manage everything from single screen, and run same commands, install tools etc. on multiple servers.

As i know, Ansible is quite known for this but many years ago I checked and found it unintuitive (but was a long time ago). I want to find something with minimum learning curve and knowledge barrier, as my brain is already full.

The things i need, boil down to these 3 things:

1. do basic resource monitoring everything in one place. I have advanced monitoring with zabbix already, just need very basic charts or gauges, that shows cpu, memory, disk usage etc.
2. run commands or install packages in parallel, show the outputs in one place
3. easy configuration stuff via user interface, such as managing users, permissions, ssh keys, replacing an ssh key from all servers with a few clicks etc.

What do you recommend? Ansible is the way or any better/simpler software?

devops,Are better DevOps engineers former developers or sysadmins?,"I’m curious about the community’s perspective on this. In your experience, who makes better DevOps engineers:

1. **Former developers** who transition into managing infrastructure and CI/CD, bringing their software development expertise to the table,
2. **Former sysadmins** who previously focused on managing infrastructure by clicking through cloud provider UIs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), but now need to adapt to infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, Helm, or Kustomize?

In my current workplace, we have a former sysadmin-turned-DevOps engineer who often criticizes aspects like the structure of repositories where we keep Terraform configurations. Specifically, they push for simpler layouts and seem resistant to ideas like reusing shared configuration components or following DRY principles, which are common in programming.

I can’t help but feel this resistance might come from their lack of a development background, making concepts like modularization and reusability less intuitive for them. It seems more like an adjustment issue rather than a genuine flaw in the proposed solutions.

Have you encountered similar situations? What do you think - do the skills and mindset of one group make them better suited for DevOps roles than the other? Or is it just a matter of experience and willingness to learn?

devops,EROOR_DOCUMENT_REQUEST lors du setup de Lighthouse CI sur GitHub ,"Hi everyone,

I'm posting here because I'm completely stuck on an issue with Lighthouse in GitHub CI.

Here are the essential links:
- lighthouserc.js = https://gist.github.com/cuzureau/eee71c12958f2b4ada1952bc755972d8
- lighthouse.yml = https://gist.github.com/cuzureau/cd6f1981f5e7af201565b88df487143e
- github errors = https://gist.github.com/cuzureau/4850575cfb5c667761ebb0a45466fd14

Here's the situation:

I'm trying to integrate Lighthouse to analyze my project's performance directly in GitHub CI.

I've set up the necessary configuration files. Everything seems correct (at least at first glance).

When the CI runs, the server starts properly and makes the site accessible via localhost. However, Lighthouse can't access this site.

The errors encountered:

1. EROOR_DOCUMENT_REQUEST: it seems that Lighthouse is trying to access a site that isn't responding correctly, probably because it can't find anything at the localhost address.

2. 404 Error: when Lighthouse tries to run its tests, it can't retrieve the expected document, which blocks the entire process.

I'm pretty sure this is an issue related to the fact that GitHub Actions doesn't allow direct access to a local server (for example, if localhost:3000 is running in the environment). So Lighthouse logically fails.

What I've tried:

Verifying that the server launches correctly before Lighthouse is called.

Checking the Lighthouse documentation for GitHub CI, but I haven't seen anything that precisely matches my problem.

Adding delays (sleep) to ensure the server is ready, without success.

Has anyone encountered this kind of problem before? Maybe there's an issue with my configuration, or I'm missing something obvious? Any help or leads would be welcome!

devops,Support teams &amp; team topologies,"I'm in a management role and working on a big IT project. The project is failing horribly and I personally think that one of the key reasons is the way we organized our teams. I read the book team topologies and I would like to apply its methodologies. They talk about 4 teams (Stream aligned, platform, complicated subsystem &amp; enabling teams). In the book they make the case that Stream aligned teams should also handle customer support. As this is the best way to get feedback on the stuff the team is developing. However, this is our current situation and before reading the book I was lobbying heavily with higher management to change this and create a dedicate support team. We have many ""tasks"" that occupy our highly trained developers that are quite mindless like, creating new users or adding products to the product catalog. 

It wouldn't make sense to me to keep this work in our ""stream aligned team"". If it's mindless you could say ""then automate it"" but I think the cost of automation is higher then the cost of a few juniors just doing it as a support job. Doesn't it make sense in this case to have a separate support team?

Been working as backend dev. last 3 years but still playing with home lab etc. since I was in SRE/DevOps field before and my heart still belongs to ""old style sysadmin"". This isn't something that is aiming to replace nginx or something but since I fell in love with Go, I wanted to create something useful. The project is still in active development but I've been already using it for some small internal APIs at work and seems to be working great. I'm still working on documentation because not all features are documented right now but it should be enough to get you started.

**🔧 Project Highlights**:

* **Concurrency Handling:** Utilizes Go’s goroutines and channels to efficiently manage multiple connections.
* **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Implements Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hashing and some other, to distribute traffic effectively.
* **Support for TLS termination/offloading**
* **Health Monitoring:** Each service gets its own continuous health check to ensure traffic is only directed to healthy nodes.
* **Dynamic Configuration and status monitoring via API:** Ability to add or remove backend servers on-the-fly via admin API as well as monitoring status, health etc.
* **Metrics &amp; Logging - WIP:** Currently working on it. As for today, it logs to file and console asynchronous but I'm planning to implement prometheus integration.
* **Graceful Shutdown:** Ensures all active connections are properly handled during shutdowns or restarts.
* **Auto certificate manager -** if you define tls configuration globally or on each service, it will first try to use that but if not - it will try with lets encrypt.

Bugs are expected and I don't consider it as nginx/haproxy replacement. Just trying something new.

devops,A deep dive into the tar format,"Hey again 👋

You may have seen my recent posts on different container image compression formats such as [zstd](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb4e98/using_zstd_compression_with_buildkit_decompresses/) and [estargz](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1grfchd/lazy_pulling_docker_images_for_80_faster_startup/). I have spent a lot of time lately looking at the different compression utilities and algorithms we use on collections of files, but I noticed the one thing that never changes is the *tar*.

All docker layers are compressed tar archives, caches in CI are stored as tar archives, almost every collection of files is some form of tar.

Why is ""tar"" the de facto standard archival format? Where did it come from? Should we be using something better? Let's learn a little more about ""tar"" together.

This post is a preview of my [full blog post, available here.](https://depot.dev/blog/what-is-a-tar-file)

# Origin of tar

The \`tar\` utility was [created in 1979 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#History)to replace the now-ancient \`[tp](https://www.unix.com/man-page/bsd/1/tp/)\` command. Still, like \`tp\`, tar was a format and utility specifically designed for magnetic tape, and magnetic tape drives. You'll notice a lot of the interesting quirks of \`tar\` can be explained in the context of being used on a tape drive, which is of course no longer a concern today.

Officially, \`tar\` was replaced in 2001 by the \`pax\` command. But it (tar) became so ubiquitous that it is still the standard go-to utility for file archiving today.

# Inspecting a tar file

Let's perform a small experiment to see what we can learn about a tar file. Let's start by creating a file we can archive.

`echo ""level 1, type grass"" &gt; bulbasaur.txt`

\`tar\` accepts a \`-c\` flag to indicate we want to create an archive, and we can use the \`-f\` flag to specify the output file. We can pass in any number of files or directories to archive.

`tar -cf pokeball.tar bulbasaur.txt`

That should leave us with a \`pokeball.tar\` file. This is not compressed, you may have seen \`.tar.gz\` before, but we rarely see uncompressed \`tar\` files, for good reason. We'll get back to that.

The data that makes up the tar is simple ASCII text, we can actually see the majority of the data fairly cleanly by using \`cat\` to display the data.

    cat pokeball.tar
    bulbasaur.txt0000644000000000000000000000002414716660325012303 0ustar  rootrootlevel 1, type grass

# Tar File Structure

[\[ image - tar file structure \]](https://depot.dev/images/tar-file-structure.webp)

***\[ (header \[512B\]) + (data \[512B \* x\]) + (End-Of-Archive \[512B \* 2\]) \]***

Each file in a tar archive is converted into a ""tar file"". A tarfile is simply a header, of a specific size, followed the data in the file.

The header contains information like the name of the file, the creation time, owner id, and a few other metadata fields. Immediately after the header is the raw contents of the file.

The header, and the contents are all stored in blocks of 512 bytes. If the data doesn't require 512B, it will be padded with null bytes to fill the space. Similarly if the data is over 512B, it will be split into blocks of 512, with the last of which being padded to ensure there is a whole number of blocks.

After all tar files in the archive are inserted, sequentially, an additional two empty 512B blocks are added as an end-of-archive marker. \`tar\` will be looking for these two empty blocks as a sign to end the unarchiving process.

# The Tar File Header

Trying to inspect a tar file from the output of \`cat\` can be a bit challenging. Instead, since we know a tar file is just a header + the original data, let's take a closer look at the [structure of the tar header](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html).

|Field|Size (bytes)|Byte Offset|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|`name`|100|0|File name|
|`mode`|8|100|File permissions|
|`uid`|8|108|User ID|
|`gid`|8|116|Group ID|
|`size`|12|124|File size in bytes|
|`mtime`|12|136|Modification time (UNIX timestamp)|
|`chksum`|8|148|Header checksum|
|`typeflag`|1|156|File type (e.g., regular file, directory)|
|`linkname`|100|157|Name of linked file (if symbolic link)|
|`magic`|6|257|Format identifier (e.g., `ustar`)|
|`version`|2|263|Format version (`00`)|
|`uname`|32|265|User name|
|`gname`|32|297|Group name|
|`devmajor`|8|329|Major device number (if special file)|
|`devminor`|8|337|Minor device number (if special file)|
|`prefix`|155|345|Prefix for file name (for long file names)|
|**Padding**|12|500|Padding to make the header 512 bytes|

Armed with this, we can now use a tool like \`hexdump\` to get a more clear view of the data.

Let's say we wanted to know the file size of \`bublasaur.txt\`, we can use this table to know we should read 12 bytes starting at the 124th byte in the file.

    hexdump -s 124 -n 12 -C pokeball.tar
    
    0000007c  30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30  30 32 34 00              |00000000024.|

The 24 value here is actually still in octal form since we are looking at raw bytes, so a quick conversion back to decimal will help us see the true value.

    &gt; echo $((8#24))
    20

That shows us the original file was 20B!

# Why is our tar file so large?

From what we know about the structure of the tar archive so far, we should have a single header block, which is 512 bytes, one data block, and two end-of-archive markers.

*512B (header) + 512B (contents) + 512B (empty) + 512B (empty) = 2048B*

Somehow our 20B file got away from us and became 2 kilobytes. Let's double check to be sure.

    stat pokeball.tar
    
    File: pokeball.tar
      Size: 10240

Woah! 10KB? How the heck did that happen?

# Blocking factor

Another interesting feature of tar that stems from its magnetic tape origins. Magnetic tape takes time to spin up to speed and slow down. It was more efficient to store data in longer chunks at a time due to the mechnical and linear  design of magnetic tape. Today this is less relevant, but still tar implements what is called a ""blocking factor"".

Tape drives read data not in increments of blocks, but instead by ""record"". A record in tar by default is 20 blocks. That means there are 19 additional empty data blocks in our tar archive, filled with padding.

If you happen to be working with small files or a small amount of data, you can ajust your blocking factor.

    tar --blocking-factor=1 -cf pokeball_single_record.tar bulbasaur.txt
    
    stat pokeball_single_record.tar
    
    File: pokeball_single_record.tar
      Size: 2048

With the blocking factor set to 1, we get our original calculation. Still quite a bit larger than the original file, almost exclusively due to null bytes in padding again.

# Compressing a tar file

[\[ pokeball .tar.gz image \]](https://depot.dev/images/pokeball_targz.webp)

I got into this in more detail in [the full blog post](https://depot.dev/blog/what-is-a-tar-file) but tldr, this is why you often see not `.tar` files, but `.tar.gz`. All of that empty space in a tar archive isn't ideal but it is hardly anything to worry about once compression is applied.

**Gzip**

gzip is the long standing standard compression method and it works well enough and fast enough to offset the inefficiencies of the tar format. It is also worth mentioning the overhead of a tar archive shrinks proportionally with the size of the archive. Fewer large files will store more efficiently.

You can use multiple compression tools directly within the `tar` command. Use the `-z` flag with `-c` to create a `gzip` archive.

    tar -czf pokedex.tar.gz bulbasaur.txt squirtle.txt charmander.txt

**Zstandard**

Gzip, like tar, will likely be around for many more decades to come, but it would be difficult to ignore how quickly Facebook's `zstd` compression is gaining traction.

The `gzip` utility is antiquated, and still a single-threaded application. Though a multi-threaded implementation of `gzip` named `pigz` exists. Zstandard by comparison, being much newer, is multi-threaded by default.

We ran some of [our own tests](https://depot.dev/blog/building-images-gzip-vs-zstd#comparison-of-decompression-times) that agree with the claims made by `zstd`, that decompression speeds are about 60% faster compared to `gzip`.

You can use either the `--zstd` flag, or simply the `-a` flag, which will auto detect the crompression tool from the output file extension.

    tar -czf pokedex.tar.gz bulbasaur.txt squirtle.txt charmander.txt

You will need to ensure that `zstd` is installed on the system first.

Has anyone ever tried this or achieved this? Or is my direction completely wrong? On a different project I used ARG in Dockerfile with a default to a public registry and then injected the ECR URL in CI but as I said, I’d like the CI to use it automatically without Docker ever knowing about it.

devops,"New to DevOps and Observability – Need Advice for Setting Up Monitoring and Logging, and Tracing","Hi everyone,

I recently started a new role as a DevOps engineer at a startup. It’s my first time working in DevOps, and to add to the challenge, I’m the only DevOps person on the team. My first task is to set up monitoring and observability for our systems, but I’m pretty new to this domain.

Here’s the current situation:

• We have a PHP Slim Framework application deployed on ECR with multiple instances.

• There’s no proper logging in place—just some Monolog logs printed to the console.

• I’m aiming to use **OpenTelemetry** for instrumentation and data collection, sending data to an OpenTelemetry Collector.

• For visualization, I’m considering open-source tools like the **LGTM stack** or **SigNoz**. My plan is to try both and determine which works best for us.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1. **Startup Budget:** Cost is critical, so I want to stick to open-source tools wherever possible. I’m trying to avoid AWS services like CloudWatch unless absolutely necessary.
2. **Logs:** Should logs be written to files or directly sent to a central storage/visualization tool? For example, is it better to print logs to files for retention, and then move them to cold storage (like S3) after a month, or handle this differently?
3. **Best Practices:** I’m looking for guidance on the best way to structure logs, metrics, and traces for a startup environment with limited resources.

**What I’m Hoping to Learn:**

• What are the best practices for setting up observability and logging in a cost-efficient way?

• Are there specific pitfalls I should avoid when setting up OpenTelemetry and integrating it with tools like LGTM or SigNoz?

• Any advice on log storage and retention policies?

I’m open to any ideas, tips, or resources that can help me approach this task effectively.

But now the problem comes in when we want a new version of the base image we have to setup our docker files with to pull that tag (1.0.28). 

Which is very time consuming when you update it again and then the base image becomes php\_base\_image: 1.0.29. Meaning we must go to our docker files and update each file form (1.0.28) - (1.0.29).

Isn't there a way that you can have it just pull a tag called latest?

devops,New to DevOps - I feel like I'm starting in the middle and not the beginning,"Hi again. This is probably my 5th post on this subreddit trying to get some assurance, clarity, etc. I'm coming from a sys admin background in Linux/Windows server. I'm decent at setting up systems and trouble shooting them but creating IaC and the things that come with automation,  CI/CD is a bit daunting. I have done some studying and watched some videos and they help me understand the basics but the environment I work in has so much going on that it confuses me...A LOT. So many references to other files, scripts, functions. They are templating a whole bunch of jobs but I can't get proper footing. I'm not building anything from the ground up.

devops,PostgreSQL Cluster vs Kubernetes Operators,"[postgresql-cluster.org](https://postgresql-cluster.org) takes a fundamentally different approach—no Docker, no Kubernetes. Our solution goes far beyond what Kubernetes Operators can offer.

PostgreSQL Cluster integrates with five cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Hetzner Cloud), allowing you to deploy complete database infrastructure—including virtual machines, storage, backup buckets, load balancers, and more—with just a few clicks.

Additionally, we offer a user-friendly interface (UI) that significantly simplifies the deployment of PostgreSQL clusters. In the future, this interface will include advanced management features, such as user creation, database creation, extension installation, a built-in SQL editor, SSH access via a web console, and much more to support the entire database management lifecycle. This ensures intuitive and powerful control that goes far beyond the standard capabilities of Kubernetes Operators.

We believe hosting databases in Kubernetes adds unnecessary complexity by introducing additional layers of abstraction that require maintenance without offering clear benefits. PostgreSQL Cluster focuses on bare metal and virtual machines, eliminating these layers to provide a more efficient and direct solution.

If Kubernetes is a central part of your architecture, our solution might not be the best fit. However, if you’re looking for simplicity, flexibility, and advanced features that go beyond the capabilities of Kubernetes Operators, PostgreSQL Cluster is the solution for you.",vitabaks,1gv7bxc,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gv7bxc/postgresql_cluster_vs_kubernetes_operators/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gv7bxc/postgresql_cluster_vs_kubernetes_operators/,2024-11-19 20:39:44,8,0.69,8,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gv7bxc

devops,My Journey into OCI,"

A while ago, I needed a cloud provider that could handle massive NACLs/Security Groups (we’re talking 300+ rules) without charging an arm and a leg for data egress. I tried all the usual suspects—DigitalOcean, Hetzner Cloud, Linode, etc.—but my quest was looking grim. Either the networking options were lackluster, or  features like NACLs and load balancers were incomplete/non-existent.

In a final, desperate bid, I turned to the one provider I swore I’d never touch: Oracle.



# The Beginning: Oracle, Why Do You Make It So Hard?

Getting started was... an experience. After failing to register an account with eight different debit/credit cards (four U.S.-based, four European), I began to question whether I was cursed. Oracle support offered no clarity, and I suspect even divine intervention wouldn’t have helped. Then I remembered I’d created an account back when OCI first launched. Dusting that off, I finally got in.

The first thing that hit me? The UI. It’s a disaster. Honestly, it’s so bad it lends credibility to the theory that Oracle hired ex-AWS employees to sabotage it as a shadow IT project. But hey, I’ve been doing this for a decade—I can work around bad UX.

After some tinkering, numerous support tickets, and lowering my expectations, I got what I needed. It’s been smooth sailing since. Here are my key takeaways:



# Pros:

**1. Generous Free Tier**

You get a 4 vCPU, 24 GB RAM VM for free. The catch? It’s ARM-based, which limits some use cases, but it’s perfect as a proxy server.

You also get 10 TB of egress traffic per month (as opposed to the 100GB from the 3 hyperscalers)



**2. Strong VMs and Reliable Networking**

My app is a monolith that throws tantrums (and warnings) if single-thread performance isn’t on point. Every other provider failed this test, but Oracle hasn’t had any issues in 7 months.

Networking is solid, and my users are reporting great pings. The Fault Domain architecture seems promising too, though I haven’t needed it for anything mission-critical.



**3. AWS Clone**

OCI is basically AWS in disguise. The VPC architecture, VM setup, image handling, snapshots—they all feel familiar. If you’ve worked with AWS, you’ll adapt quickly.



# Cons:

**1. The Firewall Situation is weird**

OCI’s firewall setup is “allow-only.” Want to block a specific IP while allowing others? Nope—better shell out for their network firewall at $2,000/month.

Want subnet-wide rules but tighter instance-level controls? Tough luck. Security rules across NACLs and Network Security Groups (NSGs) are merged into one giant allowlist.



**2. Support Is… Interesting**

I’ve spoken to OCI’s live agents at least 20 times, and I don’t think I’ve ever gotten the same answer twice. Half the time, their response is irrelevant or flat-out wrong. Press them further, and it’s off to technical support, where you’ll wait a week for another wrong answer or hear, “That’s an enterprise feature.”



**3. FinOps? What FinOps?**

Granular cost breakdown? No idea. Transparent billing? Good luck. Tracking spend on OCI is an exercise in frustration.



**4. Oracle**

Oracle is its own worst enemy. Between impossible account signups, random terminations for “not spending enough” and its reputation for predatory enterprise sales tactics, it feels like they’re trying to scare off customers.



TL;DR

Oracle OCI offers great baseline services (generous VMs, quotas, and egress) but falls short on enterprise-grade functionality and polish. If you’re running personal projects or a small business, it’s absolutely worth a try. But if you’re building anything enterprise-level, tread carefully—this isn’t a “set it and forget it” cloud.

I have been using otel-collector for my org ( x Tbs/day ) observability in k8s setup for sometime. Following is my experience. **Did you have a similar experience or was it different and how did you overcome it?**

**Long Term ( 6 months + of using ) :**

1. Poor data-loss detecting capabilities. I have been loosing data but no good way to see that. Agent/collector pods prints error logs but since pipeline doesn't work so it doesn't reach the log-system
2. No UI to view/monitor my existing connections and pick and drop functionalities
3. No easy way to inject transformers, for example i need to change format of some data for SIEM/snowflake, drop some log data like cribl, i should be able to do it within otel itself.

**Short term ( while setup ) :**

1. No grpc-native load balancer in otel. Horizontal scaling became an issue, as the agent runs on grpc and owing to no native grpc-load balancer directly operating over otel, resulted in oversizing my clusters unnecessarily.
2. Distributed tracing needs more automation, i had to manually stitch at various places.

devops,Questions I can ask the lead DORA report investigator in an interview?,"Hey everyone, we are soon interviewing the lead investigator from DORA team at Google Cloud and are trying to pose hard questions: just get away from the typical yearly dora report discussion.

Wanted to see if you have anything to share around what we could ask? (I've got my list but thought it might be a good idea to take your questions/opinion on this too)

  
\[UPDATE\]

  
A few questions I have till now:

  
Platform Engineering &amp; AI

1. Is platform engineering truly transformative, or is it often overused as a catch-all solution?
2. Could PE sometimes contribute to inefficiencies?
3. How do elite teams leverage platform engineering differently compared to average teams?
4. Trust in AI code still lacks based on this year’s report, how does leveraging AI look like for elite teams? Is AI increasing the gap between elite and average performers even further?
5. AI in the workflow has a few issues, are we prematurely celebrating AI as a great solution for DevOps issues? (ignoring the operational debt that is)
6. 39% devs show little to no trust in AI code while about 75% do leverage AI. Are DORA metrics as they stand today sufficient to handle the complexities of AI integrated workflows?

Elite Teams vs. The Rest of Us

1. What specific practices set elite teams apart from the majority? Is it all about resources, or is there more to it?
2. With economic constraints, can smaller teams realistically adopt elite-level practices?

Misinterpretation of DORA Metrics in Organizations

1. What are the most common mistakes companies make when interpreting DORA metrics?
2. How can engineering leaders use DORA metrics without falling into the trap of “chasing numbers” rather than achieving real improvements?
3. Are there situations where DORA metrics might misrepresent actual team performance?

Developer Burnout – Can Metric Tracking Contribute to This?

1. Does constant metric tracking risk increasing developer burnout? Where’s the line between tracking for improvement and creating pressure?
2. How can teams strike a balance between using metrics to drive productivity and ensuring they’re not creating a high-stress environment?
3. Are there specific DORA metrics that seem to correlate more with increased stress levels in teams?

Transformational Leadership in DevOps

1. How does transformational leadership influence elite teams? Is it a driving factor in achieving high performance, or does it only play a supportive role?
2. In a metrics-driven environment, how can leaders maintain a focus on both quantitative goals and qualitative team well-being?

Balancing Leadership Styles

1. Does the push for high DORA performance metrics conflict with the principles of transformational leadership, especially regarding team autonomy and creative freedom?
2. How can engineering leaders foster an environment that encourages innovation while still meeting the stringent benchmarks set by elite teams?
3. What are the common leadership pitfalls when implementing DORA practices, and how can leaders avoid them?

Reddit Questions

1. Are DORA metrics too detached from the real world nature of work? How to extract actionable improvements out of these?
2. Which measurements have started to be gamed more?
3. How should DORA be used for DevOps modernization efforts in industries where DevOps and DORA are not critical success factors to the enterprise competing in its market?
4. Are there orgs that shouldn’t use DORA metrics?

I am currently diving into a Rabbit hole of pros/cons of using a Service Mesh for a 30 to 50 micro-services and noticed and came across an article by Tetrate [https://tetrate.io/blog/ebpf-and-sidecars-getting-the-most-performance-and-resiliency-out-of-the-service-mesh/](https://tetrate.io/blog/ebpf-and-sidecars-getting-the-most-performance-and-resiliency-out-of-the-service-mesh/) noting that you can run Envoy as a single/Ambient mode with only 1 Envoy proxy and the standard Sidecar proxy. But they noted that the resource usage of using one Envoy or several will be the same based on CPU cycles and memory usage/allocation:

&gt;**Program code.** The compiled program code itself (i.e., the Envoy binary on disk) must be loaded into RAM to run. However, this binary is the same for all running Envoy instances, and it’s only ever read, not written, so it won’t change over time. Thus, the OS optimizes this by only loading the binary into RAM once, after which all running Envoy processes share it.  
.........  
(Note that modern memory management is very complicated, and it’s important to read the metrics correctly. While virtual memory allocations may well be higher when using sidecars, the number of actual physical pages used will be similar; this figure will be some combination of RSS and shared memory.)

devops,Are Cloud Cost Management Tools Too Overwhelming?,"Managing cloud costs can feel like an uphill battle.

Here’s the reality:

* **AWS** has **at least 30 tools** for cost management, from Cost Explorer to Savings Plans.
* **Azure** provides **at least 15 tools**, like the Azure Pricing Calculator and Reservations.
* **GCP** offers **at least 10 tools**, including Committed Use Discounts and Intelligent Cost Recommendations.

📖 That’s a lot to learn, especially when each tool comes with detailed documentation—and someone has to be accountable for implementing and managing them.

But here’s the issue: many teams aren’t using these tools effectively. Whether it’s due to lack of expertise, poor implementation, or unclear accountability, businesses are often leaving money on the table.

In my latest blog, I cover:

* 🔢 How the sheer number of tools can lead to analysis paralysis.
* 🧩 The challenges of assigning ownership for cloud cost management.

devops,First interview assistance ,"
Hi everyone,

I hope you’re doing well!

I have a question.

I’ve never worked as a DevOps or been involved in DevOps in any field, but it’s always been a dream of mine. I really like the methodologies, the culture, and the role itself.

Anyway, three weeks ago I was let go from my job, where I worked as a Service Desk Analyst. That same week, I sent my resume to a company looking for a Junior Platform Engineer (I didn’t even know that was related to DevOps). They asked me to complete a Gorilla test. Although my results weren’t great, they still invited me for an interview.

Since then, I’ve been studying Linux, Kubernetes, AWS, Apache, Python, and Bash, which are some of the technologies used in the role, in order to prepare for the interview. However, I’m really nervous about it. It’s a remote interview, but I’m nervous because my experience in IT is limited to being a Service Desk Analyst for the past 2 years (I’m 20 years old).

Do you have any advice on what the interview process might be like for this kind of role? How’s the selection process typically structured?

I’m nervous af because I was not expecting they to contact me after the test.",Many_Travel_1294,1gt9rwq,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gt9rwq/first_interview_assistance/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gt9rwq/first_interview_assistance/,2024-11-17 09:13:05,16,0.8,16,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gt9rwq

devops,Zabbix or promethes/Grafana/AlertManager for on-prem VM monitoring?,"Hi, 

I am planning to replace the existing monitoring tools for our team. We are planning to use either Zabbix or proemtheus/grafana/alertmanager. We probably deploy in VM, not in a containerized environment. I believe a new monitoring system will be deployed in the k8s cluster for microservices in particular.

We have VM from couple of subnets and around 300 hosts. We just need the basic metrics from the hosts like CPU/Mem/Disk/NetworkInterface info. I found that Zabbix already has the rich features like an all-in-one monitoring tools. They looks like the right tools for us at the moment.   
Thinking of deploying 1/2 proxies in each subnet and 3 separate VM for webserver, zabbix server and postgres+timescaledb. It seems to fit my needs already. It can also integrate with Grafana.

However, I am also exploring the proemtheus/grafana/alertmanager. As my experience, we can use the node exporter to get the metric as well and use alertmanager to make the threshold notification. I did that in my homelab before in containers.

My condition is we can afford the down time for the monitoring system everything when It comes to  a patching cycle. We don't need 100% uptime like those software companies. 

But even so, I am thinking to deploy two prometheus server, basically they scrape the same metrics for both servers. I also heard of the prometheus agent but it looks like it just separate the some work from prometheus. They also have the thanos to make it HA. But I did not find any good tutorial that I can follow or setup in the on-prem environment. 

What do you think of the situation and what would you decide based on what condition?

I’m part of an 8-person DevOps team managing multiple clusters via a GitOps repo, which serves as the single source of truth. While the setup works great for versioning and automation, we’ve run into a recurring issue:

Changes pushed to manifests sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in parts of the cluster that weren’t meant to be affected. This results in us spending significant time investigating and debugging the root cause of these side effects.

We’ve considered stricter code reviews and better dependency mapping but haven’t found a consistent way to prevent these issues. How do you ensure predictable cluster behavior while using GitOps? Do you have tools, best practices, or workflows that help mitigate such side effects?

As a DevOps engineer, I’ve always felt that managing merge requests in GitLab can be a bit of a grind—especially when it comes to ensuring all the requirements are met before merging. To tackle this, I built [**merge-bot**](https://github.com/Gasoid/merge-bot), a tool that automates merge requests based on customizable rules.

Here’s what it can do:

* ✅ **Merge Requests Automation**: Automatically merges an MR if it meets the following rules:
   * Matches a specific title pattern (e.g., prefixes like POS-1234).
   * Has a required number of approvals.
   * Includes exact approvers you define.
   * Ensures the pipeline is passing.

* Are there any features or checks you’d like to see in a bot like this?
* Do you have pain points in your current GitLab merge request process that a tool could help with?

devops,Lazy pulling docker images for 80% faster startup.,"Hey all 👋

Not long ago I shared [my findings on zstd compression](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb4e98/using_zstd_compression_with_buildkit_decompresses/), which was able to decompress docker images up to 60% faster. I'm back again with another breakdown of alternative compression methods for Docker, this time ""eStargz"".

eStargz allows us to execute our container, before it has even finished downloading.

*Our analysis shows that pulling packages accounts for 76% of container start time, but only 6.4% of that data is read.* \- [Fast \`16](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast16/technical-sessions/presentation/harter)

**What is eStargz?**

What is [eStargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/estargz.md)? It's a snapshotter plugin for containerd. But really, that just means it's an alternative compression setting you can use when building container images, assuming you have the plugin setup (we'll get back to that).

Typically, when you pull a container, you will see right in the terminal output each of the layers that needs to be downloaded, followed by a visualization of each downloading and decompressing, or loading from cache if the layer is on the system already. We talked before about how we could pull the container faster by using zstd compression, making the image decompress faster, but this still leaves us with the issue of first needing to download the whole image first.

  
**What's wrong with Gzip?**

Tar + gzip compression is fine, it's reliable and battle tested. But it isn't particularly clever. When a layer is created in Docker typically, all of the filesystem changes in a layer are bundled up into a tarball and then compressed with gzip, giving us the tried and true \`&lt;layer\_id&gt;.tar.gz\` layer format we are used to.

The issue is, once the tar files are gzipped together, they are no longer indexable. There is no way to remove a single file from a gzip, you must download the entire blob, decompress it, and then you can read the contents to find the file you need.

So maybe, this isnt the best method to transfer files, if we potentially don't need everything in a layer. But, we still want to keep our files small for fast transfer and low bandwidth usage.

You could imagine, if you had an app for example that was a map. Maybe within the first layer of your Docker image is the application code, hypothetically your second layer is a small data subset containing the local geo data, and lets say there are one more layers after that which contain larger map data of the surrounding town, city, etc.

You don't need the full city's map to help you get to the nearest coffee shop. If this were a service in kubernetes, or a serverless function, the execution time would be painfully slow to get those directions, as it would first need to download multiple large datasets we do not need for this task.

**The eStargz format**

eStargz to the rescue. eStargz is fully compatible with tar.gz images, so it's entirely possible you have even used one before, but you may not have received the full benefit.

When creating a layer using eStargz, rather than tarballing all files together in a single gzip stream, multiple gzip streams are concatenated together.

[\[ image of format comparison \]](https://depot.dev/images/tar-archive-format.webp)

The gzip spec allows for two structures, both producing valid gzip files. You can tarball a collection of files and compress them, as is standard, or you can concatenate multiple gzip streams together. Concatenating multiple gzip streams is a bit less efficient as there will be more header information and the compression cant run against the full dataset at once, meaning there will be some duplicate information.

However, this slight bump in file size comes with one very large advantage...

  
**eStargz's index file**

eStargz is going to store one more file along with your file contents at the end of the tarball as well as a tiny amount of information in the footer of the final gzip which states the size and location of the inserted file.

By knowing the offset (location) of this extra file, and it's length, we can craft a a request to download only the bytes that contain that last file. That file is an \`index.json\` file, which in turn contains information on each tar.gz in the full archive. Similar to what was in the footer, the index states the names of the files, their offset, and length. With the index file in hand, its possible to download individual files from any layer.



**How to build an eStargz image**

Building the estargz image is very simple and you likely do not need to configure anything extra at all to start building your own. You just need to make sure you are using a buildkit based builder, like \`docker buildx build\` or \`depot build\`

`$ docker buildx build -t ""&lt;registry&gt;/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;:&lt;version&gt;"" \`

`-o type=registry,oci-mediatypes=true,compression=estargz,force-compression=true \`

`.`

""`force-compression=true`"" will re-compress the base image as well as what ever you add to it.

  
**How to USE an eStargz image**

Using the eStargz image is a bit more complicated. Because it is backwards compatible, you can pull and use this image anywhere, however, by default the image will simply operate like a normal tar.gz image, without lazy loading.

Like I mentioned at the start, a snapshotter plugin must be installed on the host machine pulling the image. Many platforms today do not yet support this. For instance, you can not lazily pull an image on the default GitHub actions runners. You *can* however use eStargz image on [Depot's GitHub runners](https://depot.dev/blog/booting-containers-faster-with-estargz#should-you-use-estargz).

If you are running your own Kubernetest cluster, you'll want to make sure your nodes have the stargz snapshotter installed, linked above.

  
**Summary**

tldr; If you have large images, especially with data that might not be required at the time of booting a container, it may be faster to defer downloading that data to later in the container's execution. That can be done with an alternative image format called eStargz, but it required a containerd plugin to gain the benefits. Most platforms do not yet support eStargz, but it is backwards compatible and will not cause any issues with any currently unsupported platform.

devops,Looking for some advice - DevOps transition.,"Hello everyone, I hope you are dong well. 

I'm gonna go to the point. Around a year and half I started in a company with a team of two working as in an operation team which included things like managing deployments via some tools, dealing with monitoring (creation of dashboards, alerts, etc), doing some changes in the infra using Azure (most of them by click-click mode).  
I interested in other tools that were/are managed by a different team, and started asking questions, slowly trying to troubleshoot issues with aks clusters that where not on my scope but I was curious to learn more.   
Couple of months ago, I was asked if I would like to join this other team and start picking up more cloud/infra stuff, to which I agreed and was excited about. 

From this new team (from two engineers), they seem to work pretty separate from each other, so I reached out to them several times to start getting more context and learn stuff basically ( I was on the side cracking kubernetes and terraform books and information to be up to speed).  
One of the two engineers left around two weeks ago, and the remaining one is really hard to get some information from him. I have literally offered my help into picking up some low hanging fruit from them (now only he) and I was every time not denied directly, but nothing really happened.   
I have been lately being exposed to more challenging stuff which is nice, but at the same time I have no guidance. Manager is cool, I can't complain but I feel kind of trapped, all the things that I see on the board even though is not Chinese to me, I can't really do much and I feel miserable and really considering if this was a good decision. 

I'm not the smartest guy in the block and I'm not technically as this person ( I made that very clear when they offered the position to me). But I have been really working hard until  late in getting up to speed with stuff (namely terraform, clusters configurations), doing my home labs (they are not even close to what is actually is at prd) but I feel like I'm not contributing enough and I'm lacking from guidance.

Anyone has been in similar situation in the past? What would be some recommendations to try to level up technically ?

devops,How to Migrate MySQL to Aurora Serverless v2 While Maintaining Data Consistency?,"I’m a developer with an app running on AWS, and I’m planning to migrate my MySQL database to Aurora Serverless v2. However, I’m concerned about ensuring data consistency during the migration, as my app handles a large user base, and many of them perform transactions throughout the day.

Here’s some context:

* My app is hosted on AWS and has multiple resources (like Lambda functions, Step Functions, and others) connected to the current MySQL database.
* The database contains critical financial records and other sensitive data, so consistency is non-negotiable.
* I need to minimize downtime and avoid scenarios where some parts of the system use the old database while others have switched to the new one, as this could lead to data integrity issues.

I’m looking for advice on:

1. Strategies or best practices for migrating to Aurora Serverless v2 with minimal disruption.
2. How to handle consistency across connected resources during the transition.
3. Any tools, patterns, or setups that can help with a seamless cutover.

If you’ve been through a similar migration or have expertise with AWS databases, I’d greatly appreciate your insights!

devops,Filelog receiver to move the offset if log entry exceeded maxSize,"I have a use case where I need to use [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver) inside opentelemtry collector agent. The requirement is to add a feature to skip log entries if their size increased unreasonably beyond a certain limit.

For instance, given:

(A) log file `myservice.log`

(B) Three timestamps t0, t1, and t2.

* T0: 6Kb of logs
* T1: 1GB of logs
* T2: 8Kb of logs

The filelog receiver due to entry at T1 will lag behind, as it needs to emit all the logs entries received at T1. I want to skip T1's data and move the reader offset to **EOF** so at T2 it emits directly T2 data.

This can be achieved by moving the offset of the stanza [fileconsumer reader](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/stanza/fileconsumer). I created this GitHub PR: [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/33806](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/33806). Which offers a mechanism to move the offset if the log entries exceeded the maxSurgeSize. Sadly and reasonably enough, the PR won't be accepted.

I saw that max\_log\_size is configurable but max\_log\_size will truncate entries for the scanner, the scanner will end up reading them nevertheless. And we will end up lagging behind in terms of logs being read.

Are there any workarounds you propose? I want to avoid a fork of stanza pkg at all costs.

What does your day to day look like &amp; how much does this differ from these ""Senior"" roles?

I'm not disagreeing that it is by and large a senior role, but my personal experience was interning in government for a year as a DevOps engineer after 2 years of CS at university. I worked on a team where everybody else had 10-20YOE in general, and a mix of ex software engineers/ sysadmins. It felt like a great mentoring experience, and with that experience my very first job was as a DevOps engineer at my company where I've been for \~3 years now.

I'm generally responsible for a lot of AWS, creating IaC &amp; Docker images, creating new pipelines, creating tooling to automate more and more stuff at the company, setting up monitoring and occasionally bits of programming, testing or DB stuff. I have a couple of mentors at the company to go to when I can't figure stuff out, but thats not all the time, and plenty of times they can't so we all learn together.

I use python, bash, AWS, IaC, docker, and branching now into kubernetes, pretty much daily. I don't feel like I'm a 10x engineer, so I'm wondering just how lucky I got in this role.

devops,Career advice. Solutions architect vs devops,"I have 7 years of experience in IT, having obtained my RHCE certification right after college. I began my career as an L1 storage engineer and was promoted to L2 within two years. In addition to regular storage administration tasks, I worked on bash and Python scripts for automation and monitoring. Our company was testing cloud storage solutions from AWS, which gave me the opportunity to work with S3, NetApp Cloud Volumes, and Storage Gateway. 

After moving to a new company, I was working on  containerizing a CIFS server and automating storage-related tasks on both the server and client side. This company was implementing a multi-cloud strategy for their application, and I worked with OpenShift, Helm, Azure Pipelines, Prometheus, Grafana, Python , bash, powershell, fluentd and AWS FSx with NetApp Ontap. While this role leaned more towards DevOps, I continued to focus on storage management.

In my current position, I'm responsible for implementing COTS solutions in AWS, which is more of a solutions architect/consultant role. I handle architecture design, compliance approvals, and the installation and configuration of applications, while the actual deployment of AWS resources is handled by a separate team. Even here, I continue to work with various NetApp storage products. My current company is an AWS partner and offers certification vouchers. I’ve completed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification and am currently studying for the Professional certificate.

I’m getting bored in my current role due to the slow decision-making process and corporate bureaucracy. I plan to switch roles once I earn my professional certificate. Given my background, I'm considering whether to stay in cloud consultant/architect roles or return to DevOps. What would you recommend based on my experience?

devops,How should I manage Docker services + databases on bare metal,"I'm only familiar with cloud + k8s, but for a side project I need a decent amount of (cheap) compute power to make it profitable. For that reason I'm looking into renting some bare-metal servers and deploying there. I know some Linux basics but that's it.

**What I want to deploy**

It's about a (dockerized Go) web-application that consumes some external APIs, writes a bunch of data into a Postgres database (\~200gb) + Clickhouse DB (\~6TB). Besides that I need some reverse proxy and want to deploy some observability tools (maybe Prometheus &amp; Grafana). Would most likely fit on a single beefy server, but at most two servers. I don't need HA. 

**My question**

I'm wondering how a decent (to manage), but not overkill setup would look like in that case so that I can do my research and eventually learn what's needed to manage this. 

Some of the questions I'm having:

1. I'm aware of tools like Ansible, but I don't know how beneficial it is because it's imperatively. I'm somewhat afraid of ending up with commands that fail because my system state is somewhat different than expected by a playbook. My understanding is that it's good when managing a bunch of servers, but I expect to have no more than 1-2 servers anyways.
2. My web application will likely be 1-3 docker containers that I'd need to deploy. What's a reasonable way to operate docker containers. I'm aware there's k3s but I think it's a bit overkill for what I need.
3. Would I install the databases using the linux package manager or rather go for binaries? How would upgrading work?
4. What kind of (OS) maintenance/updates do I need to do regularly myself?",leventus93,1gqoebl,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gqoebl/how_should_i_manage_docker_services_databases_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gqoebl/how_should_i_manage_docker_services_databases_on/,2024-11-13 21:40:54,0,0.5,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gqoebl
devops,best free tier apm/logging dashboard in 2024?,"logrocket, new relic, sentry js? others?

Requirements:

each of my vps runs an app which does tasks, each vps acts like a node and connects to a central monitoring system.

the central monitoring system displays list of connected nodes, their performance as well as a list of previous events.

I can login using an ios app or web interface to my dashboard and monitor at any time.

errors are instantly sent as a push notification to my iphone.

the ability to communicate with my app from the dashboard, what I mean is, lets say there is an error, I can login on my phone and choose an action like (skip that action, try again, capture screenshot, pause all operations) etc.

It would be cool to be able to also show a graph like 'previous successful actions' and see how the tasks were handled based on last month.

It must have a free tier because its just for a small side project and not some big corporation, I dont even care that much about real time performance as much as I care about the vps doing its tasks properly.

devops,Seeking Advice for capstone project: Local Raspberry Pi vs. Cloud-Based Solution for multi IOT system Using Deep Learning,"Our project focuses on developing a system that improves accessibility for people with mobility disabilities by adjusting the height of the paintings in the museum according to the height of the visitors' faces using sensors, motors, a camera, and most importantly: a microprocessor controller. We aim to upgrade the system so that you can manage several drawings at the same time. Each drawing will have its own components, in addition to a microprocessor controller that allows identification of which controller we are talking to in a certain communication protocol.

Our system needs deep learning software to recognize a person in a wheelchair

The deep learning software will be heavy and require strong resources, so we are debating which approach to choose, and ask for your professional advice.

The options are:

1. Running the software locally: each painting system will use a Raspberry Pi 5 ai kit, which costs up to alot, which is capable of running the deep learning software.

Advantage: simple to implement, especially if you are dealing with one painting.

Disadvantages: complicated when there is more than one drawing, need Re-installation in each controller, complicated maintenance and high cost.

2. Using a powerful cloud server: replace the Raspberry Pi with a cheaper controller (esp32), and establish communication between the controller and the cloud.

Advantage: easier to maintain, economical, scalable.

Disadvantage: more complex system.

Questions:

1. For example: when 4 people are in wheelchairs and each, for example, approaches a different painting in the museum and needs identification at the same time, will the cloud withstand the load of resources?
2. Follow-up question, is synchronous programming necessary so that each request to the cloud (request from different visitors for each drawing) waits for the completion of the previous one? Meaning host 1 cloud for ML program that each painting system communicate with?

devops,Security scanning IPs returns invalid cert! (TW: heavy sarcasm),"You're not going to believe this, everyone. When my organization's security team scans an IP address of my Kubernetes cluster's load balancer, they get back an invalid cert! I know, right? I run Kubernetes with AWS EKS, with a load balancer fronting the cluster. If you load any of the valid hostnames I have an ingress entry for, over HTTPS, you get back a valid certificate. But what the security team does is take the hostname I give them, resolve it to a set of load balancer IP addresses, and then individually scan each of those IP addresses. When they do that they get a cert for ""Kubernetes Ingress Controller Fake Certificate"", which is clearly an invalid cert, and therefore *clearly* a reason to fail my scan. (/end sarcasm)

Argh! I've told them repeatedly that if you connect to an IP address, with an IP address in the Host header, you're not conducting a valid test because you're getting a 404. You're not getting into the cluster. But furthermore!! Furthermore!! When connecting to *any* IP address – not just for this application -- there’s no possible certificate that *would* be valid. Certificates cannot be made to apply to connections directly to an IP. There’s no possible certificate I could provide that would secure a connection made to the IP addresses they're scanning, or to any IP address.

It's very frustrating because it delays deploying my application.",-lousyd,1gppmsa,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gppmsa/security_scanning_ips_returns_invalid_cert_tw/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gppmsa/security_scanning_ips_returns_invalid_cert_tw/,2024-11-12 17:06:45,72,0.97,72,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gppmsa

Hey DevOps community,

I’m transitioning to a new company where the tech stack is quite different from what I’ve been working with so far, and I’m looking for some advice to help bridge the gap.

In my current role, I’ve managed to fully automate Windows Server deployments using Terraform, Ansible, and pipelines, and I have a solid background in PowerShell scripting. However, this new company operates with Mac OS and focuses heavily on Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, and Bash. While I have some exposure to these technologies, I’d like to quickly get hands-on experience to level up my skills.

I’m planning to set up a DevOps homelab at home to familiarize myself with this stack and am specifically looking for recommendations on Docker containers that would help me replicate a similar environment. Here’s what I have in mind:

	1.	Containers for Linux &amp; Bash: Any good base images for Linux systems that are frequently used in DevOps?

	2.	Kubernetes: Should I set up Minikube, K3s, or another local Kubernetes solution in Docker for learning and testing?

	3.	CI/CD Pipelines: Any recommended containers for simulating CI/CD workflows?

	4.	Python &amp; Automation: Best way to structure Python environments in Docker? Any tools you’d suggest I incorporate into my Python setup for DevOps?

	5.	Networking &amp; Infrastructure as Code: Any networking-related tools or IaC components that would be beneficial to include?

Essentially, I’m aiming to build a homelab that simulates a production-like DevOps setup on a smaller scale so I can dive into this new tech stack effectively. Any advice or suggestions on Docker containers, tools, or resources to help build this homelab would be greatly appreciated!

devops,[GKE] Docker images built on M1 Macbook Pro cause pods to crash,"Hey all,

I'm at my wit's end here. I'm trying to deploy an nginx web server to GKE to serve some static files. After creating a deployment, the pods fail immediately. `kubectl logs &lt;pod&gt;` produces this error:

`exec /docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error`

This error is commonly caused by a Docker image being built on an arm64 architecture instead of an amd64 architecture. Since I am on an M1 Macbook, I defined the architecture explicitly in the Dockerfile:


    FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:18-alpine AS builder
    WORKDIR /client
    COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
    RUN yarn
    COPY . .
    RUN yarn build
    
    FROM --platform=linux/amd64 nginx:alpine 
    COPY --from=builder /client/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
    EXPOSE 80
    CMD [""nginx"", ""-g"", ""daemon off;""]

Verify GKE nodes uses the same platform architecture:

## Attempt 1: 

Passing a `--platform linux/amd64` does not seem to solve the problem.

Create the image:

    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t &lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt; . --load

Verify image uses `linux/amd64`:

## Solution

This problem was due to two problems:

1. Creating a docker image locally on an M1 Macbook Pro (ARM)

2. Kubernetes serving an old image instead of pulling a new one 

This command will instruct Docker to build an image using the linux/amd64 architecture and push it to the container registry you have configured

    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t &lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt; . --push

However, if you delete the image locally and rebuild it *using the same image and tag*, it will not bust Kubernetes cache if no `ImagePullPolicy` has been set. Kubernetes will see the same image and tag and pull from its local cache instead of pulling the updated image. The simplest solution was to use a new tag.",brodega,1gpq151,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gpq151/gke_docker_images_built_on_m1_macbook_pro_cause/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gpq151/gke_docker_images_built_on_m1_macbook_pro_cause/,2024-11-12 17:23:16,4,0.75,4,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gpq151

devops,How much AI do you use for your scripting?,"I am finding it impossible not to use AI. I know what I need to do, I break it down into steps for myself, and I just ask the AI to do that, and if it doesn't do what I want, I just prompt it in different ways (add this feature, remove this loop, add a logging feature, run this part of the code 10 times). A lot of times, I actually learn a lot from the way it does things - for example - I have some Python code that migrates some CIDR ranges from one place to another, but they need to be transformed along the way and I asked it to implement it once, and then again but using OOP -- and in the process, I learned a bit about OOP, and how it works. Maybe not the right place, but it doesn't matter, I feel like it's teaching me. I asked it to write a Bash script for some work I was doing, and it did an alright job - so I just kept prompting it to add more features, and I obviously read over it to make sure it is doing what I want it to, and it does! Eventually, I am able to add features myself, by sort of guessing what the structure would probably look like based on other code it's created. Sometimes I even take code output from one AI (e.g. ChatGPT) and feed it into another (e.g. Claude), asking it to critique the way the code is written, how it could be improved, etc.

I find it really hard to justify googling, reading 5 different forums, answers which are outdated, or modules that got deprecated etc. etc. trawling through garbage for a week, when the AI will show me the answer and why it's right, and I can learn from that instead. Learn by example, so to speak. I can ask it why that answer is right. If the script is really nice, I even keep it for myself so I can reference it in the feature. Now I spend maybe less than 10-20% of my time doing that searching, only occasionally looking for a few small features, mostly letting the AI do it, as I guide it.

devops,Selfhosted Keycloak sanity check: Can it handle OAuth account creation for an online consumer facing portal?,"I just got done setting up Keycloak on Fly. It works.

I have a website for my start-up and I plan to only offer sign up/sign in through Google OAuth. I have a 100% working Google Auth Platform client. It is ready to feed unique Google tokens.

I have linked the two together, but not in a way that works for me. I've done a lot of implementation and perhaps not enough solutionizing. To be frank, I have no idea what I'm doing.



I wish to use Keycloak as a JWT engine, account database and nothing more. I want users to sign in/up through Google's OAuth app. Google returns auth data which is routed to Keycloak. Keycloak creates and maintains accounts. Keycloak outputs the JWT used to associate a session to a user.

devops,Self-host GitHub Actions runners with Actions Runner Controller (ARC) on AWS,"# Terraform code for setting up Github ARC on EKS with Karpenter on AWS

I put together a detailed write-up on setting up self-hosted GitHub Actions Runners using ARC (Actions Runner Controller) on AWS using EKS.

This includes terraform code for provisioning the infrastructure, and helm configurations for Karpenter v1.0 setup. We also ran a couple of variants in configuration for cost and performance comparison using Karpenter for autoscaling and other best practices.

Using a couple of PostHog's OSS repo workflows as for testing, the variations of config were basically allowing Karpenter to pick runners of arbitrary sizes from the same instance family and figure out the scaling, vs forcing one node per job. The most interesting part from the post is added below.

# Performance and Scalability

All the jobs are run on the same underlying CPU family (m7a) and request the same amount of resources (vcpu and memory).

|**Test**|**ARC (Varied Node Sizes)**|**ARC (1 Job Per Node)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Code Quality Checks**|\~9 minutes 30 seconds|\~7 minutes|
|**Jest Test (FOSS)**|\~2 minutes 10 seconds|\~1 minute 30 seconds|
|**Jest Test (EE)**|\~1 minute 35 seconds|\~1 minute 25 seconds|

ARC runners with varied node sizes exhibited slower performance primarily because multiple runners shared disk and network resources on the same node, causing bottlenecks despite larger node sizes.

To address these bottlenecks, we tested a **1 Job Per Node** configuration with ARC, where each job ran on its own node. This approach significantly improved performance. However, it introduced higher job start delays due to the time required to provision new nodes.

&gt;Note: Job start delays are directly influenced by the time needed to provision a new node and pull the container image. Larger image sizes increase pull times, leading to longer delays. If the image size is reduced, additional tools would need to be installed during the action run, increasing the overall workflow run time.

# Cost Comparison

|**Category**|**ARC (Varied Node Sizes)**|**ARC (1 Job Per Node)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Total Jobs Ran**|960|960|
|Node Type|m7a (varied vCPUs)|m7a.2xlarge|
|Max K8s Nodes|8|27|
|Storage|300GiB per node|150GiB per node|
|IOPS|5000 per node|5000 per node|
|Throughput|500Mbps per node|500Mbps per node|
|Compute|$27.20|$22.98|
|EC2-Other|$18.45|$19.39|
|VPC|$0.23|$0.23|
|S3|$0.001|$0.001|
|**Total Cost**|**$45.88**|**$42.60**|

The cost comparison shows that ARC with 1 job per node is more cost effective than ARC with varied node sizes. This is also the more performant setup.

This has been the paradigm I’ve used in my cloud journey from the very beginning, so I don't have much hands-on experience with the ""provisioned"" approach.

Recently, I had an insightful conversation with a senior developer from another company after one of their meetups, where we discussed both paradigms, drawing on his experience in each. This gave me an opportunity to understand different perspectives.

We ultimately narrowed down the discussion to two conditions that were personally most relevant:

🔎 The team consists only of application developers with no expertise in cloud infrastructure management.
🔎 The project is greenfield, with no legacy constraints impacting the architecture choice.

Together, we discussed which paradigm might be the best fit under these conditions.

1. Do you think it’s worth putting effort into researching and trying to come with an infrastructure with industry standards now? Or should I be focusing on building my app first and figuring all this out later? 

2. Would it make sense to go with the big cloud providers from the get go? Or should I find some smaller compute provider for now(would appreciate any recs here). Obviously I would want to reduce the cost as much as I can especially at this stage but I would also want to avoid overhead when scaling up eventually.

\- We are on Azure

\- We have a fairly robust and up to date monitoring solution built using Datadog

\- We are all containerized and kubified with gitops CD solutions

\- We have a suite of CICD templates that allow us to keep pipeline definitions small in the repos the are used

\- We have a suite of IaC templates that allow us to break out and organize modules into individual repos/environments within

\- We have a pretty solid hold on our network security, all with VPN's for dev access, WAF in front of the network, Istio for the cluster, hub and spoke arch with security policies in between networks

\- We are all in legal compliance for processing online transaction and storing pii

\- We have a solid suite of DR plans in place, most of which have automatic rollovers/backs with multi-regional (as much as the org wants to spend $$ for)

\- We are fairly up to date with IaC versions/providers and are currently hunting for tech debt

\- We are currently focusing on cost management/idles to try and make the platform run as inexpensively as possible

\- We are sorta on a ""feature freeze"" where most of the dev work is being made on small, incremental frontend changes that require little changes from the existing release platform

This is working as expected, Now there are few challenges,

1. It uses sharp by default which has some basic functionality for image manipulation but I don't think it's possible to do Image manipulation like a GUI tool for example text or custom image on main image etc.

2. This is a simple solution with basic AWS Services being used behind the scene like

* AWS CloudFront
* AWS API Gateway
* AWS Lambda
* AWS S3
* AWS Rekognition
* AWS Secrets Manager

Currently it's a cheap solution based on serverless architecture with low usage, but if we go for high load/usage, is it a good solution or should we go for a server based deployment like ECS with EC2/Fargate Graviton for cheaper solution, Can it be able to handle big traffic like millions of requests and additionally computation load due to image processing on EC2 level, I think it will scale with Auto Scaling &amp; Load Balancing.

3. How can trace the usage cost, I was planning to deploy this individual for every users and then trace the cost on the basis of tags so I can get overall cost idea of complete stack on individual user, let me know if there is any other better option for this considering there are multiple components and based on that, cost analysis for Compute, No of requests and Bandwidth will different for different users.

Additionally, If we go for ECS with EC2/Fargate solution, can we trace the cost on individual level?

Please suggest how can we go live with this solution or go with other approach for kind of same logic to use it as SaaS?

2. You have a frontend system that stores events in Kafka outside of Google Cloud, but you also use Google Cloud to run some of your backend services, which need to receive the Kafka events.
3. You collect logs from an on-premises Kafka solution and send them to Google Cloud for data analytics.
4. You have a frontend system that uses Google Cloud, but you also store data on-premises using Kafka.

devops,Seeking advice for implementing a self-service provisioning system with Terraform &amp; Ansible,"Hello r/devops,

I'm currently working on enhancing our network provisioning workflow using Terraform and Ansible. My goal is to streamline the process and make it more efficient. Here’s the vision:

* An **IPAM** (IP Address Management system) to manage all IP addresses across various VRFs (Virtual Routing and Forwarding).
* A **Vault** for storing additional, necessary information securely.
* A **Self-Service Portal** for the operations team to autonomously manage network requirements.

The idea is that when the operations team needs to provision additional network resources in a private cloud, they can simply request it through the self-service portal. This request would automatically fetch the necessary IP from the IPAM. The operations member selects the client, which informs the system about the corresponding VRF. Then, Terraform and Ansible would kick off in the background to create and configure the networks, making them fully operational.

**Here’s where I need your help:**

* I’m looking for recommendations on self-service portal software or templates that could be adapted for such a setup. Any suggestions?

**Questions for the community:**

1. Are there any additional tools or integrations you think could enhance this setup?
2. Has anyone here implemented a similar solution? What were your experiences and pitfalls?

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated as I navigate through this setup.

Thanks in advance!",Si-mooon,1go0mqb,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1go0mqb/seeking_advice_for_implementing_a_selfservice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1go0mqb/seeking_advice_for_implementing_a_selfservice/,2024-11-10 13:26:27,16,0.95,16,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1go0mqb
devops,Deleting Vault secrets from the container after init,"Our services are running with Vault injector that creates a `.env` file under `/vault/secrets/.env`, which we then source in our entrypoint:

    if [ -f /vault/secrets/.env ]; then
       source /vault/secrets/.env
       rm -rf /vault/secrets/.env
    fi

These are the annotations we use in our deployment:

    podAnnotations:
      vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: ""true""
      vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-.env: ""secret/data/test""
      vault.hashicorp.com/role: ""app""
      vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-.env: |

        export {{ $k }}={{ $v }}
        {{- end }}
        {{- end }}

With this setup, Vault's agent runs in the Pod and watches that file continuously.

I want to avoid having Vault's agent running, so I added:
    
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate-only: ""true"" 

This annotation spawns a Vault job that creates that `.env` file and exits when it's done.


However this introduced a problem: when my app fails for whatever reason, the app's container restarts, not the entire pod. This results in my Vault's job not running again, so `/vault/secrets/.env` doesn't exist anymore.

I'm trying to decide what to do from here. I've set some goals in mind:

- Avoid running a Vault side container with my app
- Delete the secrets from the disk after init

I was looking into Vault's CSI driver to see if it could solve my issue but wanted to hear other opinions. Maybe I'm approaching this in the wrong way.

devops,I have launched an Open-Source Ingress Controller in Rust — flusso 🚀 Seeking Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement!,"Hi team

i was working this last months building a ingress controller from scratch built in Rust: **flusso**, I’m seeking feedback from the community to make it the most reliable, secure, and efficient ingress solution possible, and I’d be incredibly grateful if you could give it a try and let me know your thoughts.

**Why flusso?**  
I built flusso to address some of the limitations I’ve encountered in other popular ingress controllers:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Rust’s memory safety eliminates common vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows), making flusso a robust choice for security-focused deployments.
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Rust’s performance allows flusso to maintain high throughput without excessive CPU or memory consumption, especially under heavy loads.
3. **Improved TLS Management**: Automates certificate handling and provides easy setup for multi-domain configurations, minimizing downtime risks.
4. **Simplified Configuration**: flusso’s configuration is designed to be straightforward, with a GUI that displays backend services, status indicators, TLS info, host names, and ports at a glance.
5. **Flexible Observability**: Built-in support for detailed metrics and structured logs compatible with Prometheus and Grafana, making monitoring and debugging easier.

**What I’d love feedback on**:

* **Dashboard**: Is the GUI intuitive? Are the service details (status, TLS info, host, ports) helpful?
* **Performance**: How does flusso perform in your environment compared to other ingress controllers? Any bottlenecks?
* **Configuration &amp; Setup**: Was the setup process straightforward? Are there configurations that could be clearer or easier?
* **Suggestions for Features**: Are there additional features you’d like to see or any compatibility issues with your tech stack?

**How to Get Started**:  
flusso is available on GitHub https://github.com/DioCrafts/flusso. The current version is 0.0.1, so your feedback will help shape its roadmap and future improvements. I am just starting with the project, and i am working on it as hobbie in my free time.

If you’re interested in testing or have any thoughts on how to improve flusso, please leave a comment or DM me! All feedback, both positive and constructive, is welcome as it’ll help me refine flusso to meet real-world needs.

It consists of custom terraform module which replicates the behaviour of the aws\_lambda\_function terraform module but, when launched through the teleform CLI a proxy function is deployed instead which routes any lambda invocations back from AWS to your machine (using ngrok), running your local code.

This allows you test code changes your AWS terraformed environment without having to deploy every change, massively shrinking the development cycle.

devops,Software Engineer Starting My Journey as a Solo DevOps at a Startup – Seeking Advice and Support!,"Hey Reddit,

I’m a full-stack software engineer with 6 years of experience backend + support role as frontend (Fuck you CSS😂), and I’ve developed a real passion for DevOps and SRE. Even though my role is mainly software engineering, I often end up handling a lot of the automation work for my team, like:

• **Docker** for containerization

• **Jenkins** for CI

• **Jenkins + Ansible** for CD

• **Terraform** for managing Dev environments

• Basically, automating whatever I can when I have the time!  


Right now, I’m studying for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)** to strengthen my cloud skills  
  
I recently landed an offer for a DevOps position, starting this December. Super excited, but I’m also feeling the nerves kick in. It’s at a startup where I’ll be the only DevOps person working alongside some backend engineers. I know it’s a fantastic opportunity, but the idea of not having anyone experienced in DevOps/SRE on the team to bounce ideas off of or learn from makes me a bit apprehensive.  
  
do you think you can give me some pieces of advice or anything that can help me kick-start my way through?

Here’s the kicker: I’ve been aiming to transition from Software Engineering to DevOps for a while now, but I keep hitting roadblocks in applications to larger companies with dedicated DevOps teams. My background and CV still heavily lean towards software engineering, and I’ve often been rejected as a “misfit” in HR screenings. It’s like HR filters me out before I even get a chance to explain my interest in DevOps!

devops,The pendulum,"There's many posts out there re: the pendulum, meaning, an engineer will work at a firm for a few years, get promoted to management, then spend all their time learning management, then after things are well a few years later, leave to go work as an engineer again for someone else and start all over.

I've never swung the pendulum. I've enjoyed just being an engineer, but I've told myself, I am Not getting any younger, and ageism is a real threat when looking for work as an engineer, so I should level up in management. 

In the next several months, it appears that may be happening. I may move up. We are splitting the current devops team into data pipeline and devops teams, and I will actually lead the devops team.

devops,How are you graphing OpenTelemetry metrics?,"My team has done the work to capture custom service metrics using OpenTelemetry Unfortunately, I'm struggling to figure out how to graph and alert on this data and I'm wondering how you all are doing this.

This is a node.js microservices architecture running in k8s. Along with some business specific metrics we're also capturing the following metrics for each service call.

* `action.call.count`
* `action.call.error.count`
* `action.call.latency`

The count metrics are incrementing counters and the latency metric is a histogram.

We're pretty big users of Datadog but unfortunately the tags we need makes Datadog cost prohibitive because they charge by unique tag value and it's a cardinality.

We also use Honeycomb but their expertise is in distributed tracing and their graphing and alerting on the metrics leaves a lot to be desired. For example, I'm not able to accurately graphql the error rate because you can't run calculations on queried data.

devops,Changing jobs and leaving a project behind,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in the process of changing jobs, while excited about the new opportunity. I can’t help but feel guilty about leaving my current project.

The project is about 2 years old and has been in production for about 1 year. The usage is increasing rather quickly and we have re-architected to deploy on k8s but currently only running in development environment.

I am a single DevOps engineer who has been solely responsible for CICD and cloud topics. Over the last year the team for this project has been getting smaller from 6 people (4 devs, 2 DevOps), now down to 2 people (1 dev, 1 devop).

There are many reasons for me leaving but the main one is because of I feel stuck in an eco chamber. I have no one anyone to bounce ideas off of regarding work in my area of responsibility.  No one really able to review my work properly and mostly done by rubber stamping every PR without really reviewing it. 

This leaves me constantly double guessing myself and has had a negative effect on my ability to make decisions. The reason I feel guilty is because there will be no one left to take over my responsibilities and I feel like the project could fail without me. 

I try to tell myself that’s not really my fault or responsibility to make sure there is people for business continuity. I have also brought this problem up with my manager on multiple occasions but nothing has really changed.

I guess I am just looking for second opinion, and what other people think about this situation?

devops,Was asked this system design question during an interview. Was my approach acceptable?,"So I recently had a technical interview where the interviewer asked me how I’d design a scalable credit-based system. It was a pretty interesting challenge, so I thought I’d break down my approach here so that you guys can let me know if I did anything wrong or if this approach would fail in any way.

  
Here are the requirements given during the interview

* **Track user credits** (adding/subtracting credits based on transactions)
* **Handle high concurrency** (multiple users accessing/updating their balances simultaneously)
* **Be traceable and auditable** (every transaction should be recorded for accuracy)
* **Scale well** for high read and write demands
* **Allow users to purchase more credits**

  
**My Approach**

So first of all, I have 3 schemas for Users, Credits, and Transactions table. You can view the snippets here [https://pastebin.com/AuBBx517](https://pastebin.com/AuBBx517)

  
To make sure updates were atomic (especially with concurrent users), I proposed using PostgreSQL transactions with `FOR UPDATE` row-level locking. This ensures that only one update on a user’s balance can happen at a time. I've also proposed to use Redis for caching data to ensure that we can support high reads. As for cache invalidation, I ensure that the value in the cache is updated every time there's a new transaction being sent to the database. 

To support auditing and monitoring, I proposed to use either Prometheus or Grafana to track any metrics such as number of failed transactions, high frequency transactions, and for traceability. 

However, this seems too simple and was wondering if I should change my approach for this question? The interview did mentioned scalability, so should I have just introduced Kubernetes for database scalability and using kafka streams to approach this problem?

devops,SonarSource/SonarCloud pricing strategy - anyone running their open source alternative?,"tldr;   
SonarCloud becomes too expensive - does anyone have experience with SonarSource OpenSource version and with the limitations of that version?

Long Story: 

SonarSource/SonarCloud recently adjusted their pricing drastically (from \~3200 Euro/year for 1M LoC to 7200 Euro/year for 1M LoC). The price changed between July 2024 and October 2024 without any considerable change in features. Our contract was signed in July 2024 - so an actual renewal will be next year - but still I want to be prepared for when we either reach the 1M LoC limit or the contract renewal date.

At this point we scan projects on the following programing languages: Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, TypeScript, JavaScript, C++

We mainly watch out for keeping technical debt low (by monitoring and actively working on open issues) and keeping the code coverage at a certain level. We run the sonarsource analyzer on every build (for every pull request, branch,...).

We do have experience running SonarCloud on-premise (rather in the cloud), but recently moved to SonarCloud (July 2024) in order to not have to maintain the EC2 instance. We are open to using the open source version of SonarSource, but could not find a concrete list of differences?

I'm learning how TLS/DTLS works under the hood. I've found a lifesaver [site](https://dtls.xargs.org/) that describes every packet and every byte there. But I can't understand what `length(group of bytes in the end of some headers)` stands for.

So here's a `ClientHello` packet:

    16 fe fd 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9d 01 00 00 91 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 91 fe fd e0 e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7 e8 e9 ea eb ec ed ee ef f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 fa fb fc fd fe ff 00 00 00 06 13 01 13 02 13 03 01 00 00 61 00 33 00 26 00 24 00 1d 00 20 35 80 72 d6 36 58 80 d1 ae ea 32 9a df 91 21 38 38 51 ed 21 a2 8e 3b 75 e9 65 d0 d2 cd 16 62 54 00 2b 00 03 02 fe fc 00 0d 00 20 00 1e 06 03 05 03 04 03 02 03 08 06 08 0b 08 05 08 0a 08 04 08 09 06 01 05 01 04 01 03 01 02 01 00 16 00 00 00 0a 00 04 00 02 00 1d

Then you can find the DTLS Record hHeader explanation:

    16 fe fd 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9d

* ...other bytes, we don't need them in terms of this question
* 00 9d - length of following data in this record (0x9D (157) bytes)

So, the explanation says that the last 2 bytes represent length of following data. I can't figure out what length and what data. How it calculated and where that 157 bytes come from?

You can find other ""magic""(for me... sure that's not random numbers and hope I'll find out where they come from 🙂) lengths.

Here's TLS Handshake Header comes next:

    01 00 00 91

* 01 - handshake record type 1 (ClientHello)
* 00 00 91 - 0x91 (145) bytes of client hello data is in this handshake record.

What 145 bytes? Where they come from?

Could you describe what that lengths stand for?

Please share what your team structure, process and pipeline look like to support you releasing frequently on a monolith.

What CI/CD tools and strategies do you have locked down in your team?

Thanks 

EDIT: Apologies I missed out some details.

Here's an overview of our workflow;

1. Devs implement and commit code during the sprint. Release branch is cut and pushed to SIT environment at the end of the sprint. (2 weeks).

2. QAs test the cut branch. (2 weeks on the average for a team of three QAs. Most testing processes are manual. There are backlogs of completed sprints yet to be tested. We're in sprint 3 and QA have only just started testing work from sprint 1. I'd say this is a major bottleneck. 

With our current structure (monolith), we're unable to cherrypick what's to be cut into the branch or QAed as the branch/codebase has to move in one sweep. I suppose my question would be how do you manage code committments, testing, UAT and deployment and achieve getting smaller piece of work committed, tested and deployed in time?

3. Once QA is somewhat done, stories are sent to the business for UAT. (1 week). 

4. With UAT sign-off, we deploy.

devops,[ANNOUNCEMENT] cijoe: A New Workflow and Productivity Tool for Systems Development Nears v1.0 – Feedback Welcome!,"Hey r/devops community!

I'm excited to announce that **cijoe**, a workflow and productivity tool built with a focus on **systems development** and **ease of use**, is about to hit its **v1.0 release**! 🎉 Before we finalize, we're eager to get feedback and hear your view on its usefulness.

# What is cijoe?

cijoe is a lightweight, Python-based tool that’s been in the works for **six years**. It’s designed to make it easier to **reproduce build, testing, and benchmarking tasks** across diverse environments, including **cloud infrastructure**, **physical lab setups**, and **local development**. If you’ve used tools like **Just, Makefile, GitHub Actions, Fabric/Invoke, or Ansible**, cijoe will feel familiar—yet it’s unique with its **low learning curve** and **re-targetable scripts**, offering a flexible way to manage and automate workflows.

And, of course, cijoe is **open-source** with a **BSD-3-Clause license**—so it’s free to use and contribute to!

# Project Links

* **Documentation**: [cijoe.readthedocs.io](https://cijoe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/refenv/cijoe](https://github.com/refenv/cijoe)

# Key Features of cijoe

* **Agentless “Initiator/Target” Model**: cijoe operates in an agentless fashion, using general-purpose **SSH** and **SCP** for command execution and data transfer. This model doesn’t require Python on the target machine—just on the initiator—making it versatile for systems where installing additional software on the target is undesirable.
* **Simple Python Interface**: With just a few API calls (`cijoe.run`, `cijoe.get`, and `cijoe.put`), cijoe scripts make complex workflows reproducible and easy to follow.
* **Re-targetable Scripting**: The **target** for `cijoe.run()` command executions, as well as `cijoe.put()` and `cijoe.get()` transfers, can be easily re-targeted. This means that a single script can be adapted to run on different machines or environments (cloud, physical lab, local, etc.) with minimal adjustment.
* **Integrated HTML Reporting**: cijoe includes integrated HTML reporting, making it very convenient to share results with colleagues. The reports are structured for readability and allow for quick insights into task performance and outcomes.

# Why This Release Matters

Version 1.0 marks a major milestone, stabilizing features and API to ensure it’s production-ready and friendly for long-term support. With its streamlined interface and scripting flexibility, cijoe aims to make automated workflows and reproducible tasks more accessible to developers and DevOps engineers alike.

# Looking for Your Feedback!

As we polish this release, I’d love feedback from a wider audience. Are there features you’d like to see? Any pain points in similar tools you’d hope cijoe can solve? If you’ve had a chance to try it, what’s your experience been like so far?

Feel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions here, or if you’d like to explore the code directly, head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/refenv/cijoe).

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas!

Our monitoring alarms started going off left and right.

devops,Professional crossroads,"**Hello everyone,**

I'm writing this message because I need some advice.

I'll give a brief overview of my background to help you understand my journey.

I'm 41 years old with 16 years of experience in IT support, specializing in networks.

I worked for three years with France's second-largest internet service provider, handling advanced network troubleshooting for large accounts, primarily French multinationals.

Then, I moved to follow my partner at the time, left that job, and found a temporary position as an IT support technician at a university.

My supervisors encouraged me to take the civil service exam to become a permanent employee.

There were three positions available, with 400 applicants. I finished first by studying alone on weekends for several months before passing the three exams required for my permanent position (I’m not trying to brag, just to give you an idea of my ability to work independently).

I've been in this role since 2012, providing Level 2 and 3 network support across the entire campus and remote sites.

I've grown somewhat tired of this job, and despite the various responsibilities I’ve been given, I'm starting to feel worn out.

I also manage a few Linux servers used for relatively simple tasks like DHCP, NTP, etc.

I want to change careers for several reasons:

1. I'd like to work fully remote to join my new partner, who was transferred abroad.
2. I’d like to increase my salary.
3. I want to learn programming because it's always interested me, though I've never really invested time into it as I felt a bit lost.

Lately, I've been exploring what I could do with my skills and what interests me, and I've seen that DevOps might suit me well.

I don’t have the time or money to go back to school, but I do have a strong capacity for self-learning.

Which language should I learn?  
Is it realistic to change careers by learning on my own?

I would really like a quick transition to a field I’d enjoy. I've always loved networks and servers, but I'm also very interested in application development.

What would you advise?

devops,How do you sync variables between providers?,"Hi, 

  
There are a lot of providers that need to operate together when building a website. Let's take a random example: 

1. CI and CD on Github 

2. Frontend hosted on vercel 

3. Backend hosted on GCP 

  
All of them need their own environmental variables (for prod, staging, and dev) on top of additional variables to connect to each other (e.g. github needs vercel access token to push a new version). 

  
Both github and vercel can connect to gcp using Workload Identity Federation, and that's great. However, there are still variables that need to be coordinated (e.g. the url of the gcp backend created by the terraform-based CD pipeline on Github needs to be in sync with what vercel sends requests to). 



Any of these systems has ways to save environment variables, but maintaining them in sync (outside of any code but in some opaque internal systems) seems like a recipe for confusion.  

Is there a better way?

devops,Using code to write Github Actions instead of YAMLs?,"Hi, 

I have multiple Github Actions deployed. All written of course in YAML, and they give me a big head ache, I am looking for something like CDK/Pulumi for CloudFormation or cdk8s for k8s YAMLs.   
One of the issues I have with those YAMLs:

* Its hard to validate that everything is going to work as you expect 
* Syntax is not very clear - especially in cases of IFs 
* Imorting local actions is a nigtmare - what are the parameters of every action, what are optional/required, changing parameters on the origin and what it affect 
* Doing more advanced things like loops is becoming very weird very fast 

  
I do use act to test things locally [https://github.com/nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) but it misses many things. Many times my local act stup works, but the remote github job fails. 

I am considering using github action that just runs Pulumi and do everything and Pulumi like [https://www.pulumi.com/blog/docker-build/](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/docker-build/) but it seems wrong. 

Is writing custom Github actions [https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/tree/main](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/tree/main) \- isnt it too much of boiler plate? Is it the right approach? Is it even solves the issue? (for example, can I use it to better handle interfaces between separate jobs/actions?)

devops,Opinions on proposed Github Actions workflow step? ,"I have a Github Actions workflow which deploys Terraform infra to Oracle Cloud. I am using remote state stored in OCI Storage Buckets. I am trying to make the entire configuration and deployment process as automated as reasonably possible. Rather than configuring state bucket manually, I put together python scripts which check for a pre-existing state file in a bucket for my template - and if the bucket / state file does not already exist, another set of scripts creates them. The final output is a pre-authenticated URL which will be used by TF engine to access remote backend - this is a sensitive secret, of course.

I am working on logic which takes the pre-auth URL within the same bucket/state creation script at the end and then uses Github API to create an environment secret with the pre-auth URL. Any opinions on the security of this? The URL is never exposed AFAIK.

devops,Package managers to speed up build,"So I am considering to refactor our build setup to make builds faster and generally megs the life of the developers easier.

The thing is that we have an application which is dependent on 4 different libraries we also make.

3 of the libraries are written in C++ and one is written in rust. The frontend application is written in dart(flutter ) for windows.

So my plan is to try to use a package manager and an internal repo to publish the packages. The builds will then get dependencies from the local package repository.

Currently I’m looking at vcpkg as package manager and azure devops as an artifact storage of cached vcpkg build.

Does anybody have a setup like this? Are there other and better ways of doing this?

Could I also use cargo or NuGet?

devops,"What does ""Yes"" look like","“No” is an easy default response to big technical asks. It manages the risk and expense of large projects with unknown complexity and (let’s be honest) will often take less of your time than a “Yes”. Some times it’s also the correct answer. No, we can’t make a square with three sides.

“No” usually doesn’t help the business though. There’s a reason the PHB is asking for a square with three sides. It might also be tied to some fundamental misunderstanding, but underneath the request is a problem they’re trying to solve (maybe they just need a triangle). Your job as a skilled devops professional is to understand and help solve that problem.

As a matter of soft skills, you should generally address their question in some way before telling them it sounds like the wrong question. “Squares definitionally have four sides, but we do have the ability to make three-sided polygons. They’re called triangles, and they can only have one right angle unlike a square.”

By the time a technical request makes it from the business side over to the tech organization, “yes” is really the only answer they’ll accept. You might be tempted to say “no” and leave it at that, but instead you should just tell them what “yes” looks like.

Switching analogies, let’s say the PHB wants to build a racquetball court as an addition to the office building. Instead of saying “that’s way out of budget and we can’t even get a building permit for that addition” try explaining what it would take to make it work if you had unlimited resources. Explain the cost of labor and materials for the building, the legal process of getting the permits, the unsolved problem of where to fit such a building on the premises.

At the end if you can give a ballpark of the time and total cost and what other projects will be deprioritized to accomplish it, your “yes, and” will have a much stronger case than a “no”. If you frame your answer as “yes” and then let them discover that such a project isn’t feasible, now you can work together to figure out another solution.

If you had just flatly said “no” in the first place you’re making the interaction adversarial. With a “yes, and” it’s collaborative. Alright, that won’t work but let’s explore other solutions.

And now comes the best question you can ever ask a business person: “What problem are we trying to solve?”

Contrary to popular belief, business people are pretty terrible at communication so they generally don’t think to start with the problem at hand. But once you have that you can use your special engineer brain to find a solution. If the PHB wants a racquetball court because they want to be able to play racquetball, you can suggest they get a YMCA membership instead. Now you’ve solved their problem and saved them a big pile of money. If you do this a few times you will be every PHB’s favorite engineer.",kaen_,1ghy9rq,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1ghy9rq/what_does_yes_look_like/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1ghy9rq/what_does_yes_look_like/,2024-11-02 14:56:56,6,0.64,6,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1ghy9rq

devops,New Grad Seeking Advice on Pursuing a DevOps Career,"Hello, I’m a new grad with a deep interest in DevOps.

To give you a brief introduction, I started my journey during a co-op term with the Ontario government, where I was involved in a Kubernetes project. This experience sparked my fascination with Kubernetes, which was not the kind of thing taught in university, leading me to dive deeper into studying and eventually discovering DevOps. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to building a strong foundation, earning certifications like CKA, CKAD, LFCS, AWS Admin, Azure Admin, and CCNA, and doing projects to hone my skills. I’m continually working to advance my knowledge and skills and would appreciate any advice on pursuing a career in DevOps.

1. I know that DevOps is not typically an entry-level position. Therefore, even if it's not exactly DevOps, what entry-level positions are there that involve technologies like Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, and cloud platforms? I am very passionate about these tools and would like an opportunity to work with them.
2. I am aware that the job market is currently tough. I am open to part-time jobs or volunteering if it means gaining experience in my field. Are there opportunities available that would allow me to work with DevOps technologies in such capacities?

devops,My First ever DevOps interview,"This was my very first interview for a DevOps engineering role. Coming from a non-technical background, I took the initiative to learn everything on my own. I turned to YouTube and self-taught programming. After facing many challenges, I eventually joined a company as a junior software developer, where I worked for over two years. During this time, I realized that DevOps was more intriguing to me than programming alone. I started learning AWS on my own, building on some familiarity with Amazon from a prior non-technical role there. To further solidify my skills, I completed the Cloud Resume Challenge, which covers many foundational tasks expected of a DevOps or cloud engineer. I also earned the AWS Cloud Quest certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner. A few months later, I secured an internship in AWS Cloud Engineering, marking what I see as the true starting point of my DevOps career  

  
I didn’t expect to crack it on the first try, though I had a bit of hope. The interviewer began by introducing himself and then asked me to do the same. I handled this easily and confidently. The next question was, ‘Why DevOps and not programming?’ I explained that I’m more drawn to the later stages of the software lifecycle. He then skipped some of the technical questions on Linux and Docker, given my prior experience working with them. He asked about Kubernetes, and I shared that I’d worked with it while deploying a Django project of my own. He followed up with a few detailed questions, and although I couldn’t answer them technically, I described the role of different Kubernetes components and why they’re used.  
  
At the end of the interview, I asked about the experience they were looking for, as the job description hadn’t specified any required years of experience. He mentioned that they’re ideally looking for someone with more experience, but with plans to expand, they might open roles for less experienced candidates in the future. I shared that this was my first DevOps interview and asked for feedback on skills to focus on. He offered some helpful pointers, and it became clear that they need someone ready to handle tasks independently from day one.  
  
What’s less clear to me is what specific skills or projects would best prepare me to get into an entry-level DevOps role.

devops,"Deployments still suck, but maybe they don’t have to","Found this interesting blog post about why deployments are still painful in 2024. The author breaks down how deploying even a basic Rails app to AWS requires wrestling with Docker, ECR, ECS, load balancers, security groups, and more DevOps complexity. They contrast this with Heroku's revolutionary ""git push"" simplicity from 2007, and discuss newer PaaS alternatives like Fly.io and Railway.app. While these platforms work well for standard apps, they can become limiting for specialized needs. The post highlights some promising developments, like Cased's branch deployment system, and suggests that Vercel's success in frontend deployments points to a future where we might have more integrated, opinionated platforms that handle everything from CI/CD to monitoring without requiring developers to piece together multiple tools.

devops,I built a tool to track GitHub Actions costs - looking for early users &amp; feedback,"Hey folks! Over the past few months, I've been building BuildBudget - a tool to help teams understand and optimize their GitHub Actions spending. The problem hit close to home when our team's CI/CD costs started climbing and we couldn't easily figure out which workflows were the main contributors.

What it does right now:

* Shows your top 100 most time-consuming workflows and jobs
* Breaks down usage by repo, org, workflow, or job
* Calculates costs for GitHub-hosted runners
* Compares what you'd pay using AWS CodeBuild instead

It's pretty bare bones at the moment, but it works. I'm sharing it early because I want to shape its development based on real feedback from other engineers dealing with CI/CD costs. Check it out at [buildbudget.dev](https://buildbudget.dev) \- it's free during beta, and setup takes less than a minute if you're using GitHub.com. It's also available for teams using GitHub Enterprise Server, via webhook.

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on:

* What other cost insights would be useful?
* Which CI/CD cost problems are you struggling with?
* What would make this actually valuable for your team?

This time, it’s about creating IaC that actually supports developers without forcing them to wade through endless configs and ops-land details.   
  
In this 4-hour hands-on session, we’ll cover principles like convention over configuration and explore practical ways to cut the config chaos, so devs can stay focused on their core work, while ops keeps infrastructure sane.  
  
Expect practical patterns for building IaC with defaults, preset scenarios, and abstractions that align with how developers *actually* need to work - not tools that pile more work on them.

By cost effective I mean something that offers very good GPUs but if possible has a per-use cost model. So that we only pay when our deployed ML model is being used.

devops,"Alternatives or more reliable architectures to a self-hosted, K8s-based KeyCloak","Hey folks,

We have a self-hosted, k8s-based KeyCloak instance (also its postgres is in K8s), which handles authentication and in many cases part of the authorization process of a looot of services: VPNs, K8s, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, etc.

Accessing the KeyCloak resources, needs KeyCloak authentication (VPN and K8s). It is possible to access it without, but it isn't something we do usually and it's also not straightforward at all.

You probably see the problem here. So, my question is: What are the alternatives? The should be KeyCloak compatible, so that we can export/import our current configs, of course.

Here are a few options that come to mind:

- Move KeyCloak to a redundantly configured VM setup like ec2 machines, and its DB to some reliable managed service like RDS (still a self-hosted setup).
- Move the whole KeyCloak to a managed KeyCloak service with guarantees and SLAs. If so, what providers would you recommend?
- Other options and ideas, maybe?

The goal is to reduce the probability of KeyCloak failure and facilitate its repair in the case of failure.

Thank you in advance!

**Edit:**

Sorry, maybe I haven't articulated the problem clearly enough.

Authentication to the infra that allows you to connect to the backend of the KeyCloak server, relies on the KeyCloak server itself. With the KeyCloak server down, it becomes difficult to access the K8s cluster, where it is running (it isn't impossible, but needs jumping through loops...)

The idea is, to make the KeyCloak server more reliable and access to it easier without reliance on the KeyCloak server.

devops,Quick review of Pulumi ESC,"I have been playing with Pulumi ESC since they went GA last month. Here are my quick thoughts on it:

1. It's very practical for centralizing configuration or secrets in environments that can inherit from each other
2. I like how ESC can get secrets from other stores like Azure Key Vault or 1Password. This feature makes it more than just a vault. Unfortunately, some sources like Bitwarden are not yet supported
3. I found that configuring OpenID Connect was quite challenging but once it's set up, being able to easily retrieve short cloud access tokens from an environment opens up a whole range of possibilities
4. ESC has interesting integrations with other tools (like Direnv of Terraform). I've only used the Pulumi IaC integration which is very handy
5. ESC is not completely open source (it seems only some parts like the CLI are) so you can't self-host it unless you pay a license 😕

devops,Over-Engineering Your Site 101: And So Can You,"https://www.beatsinthe.cloud/blog/over-engineering-your-site-101-and-so-can-you/

I wanted to share my learning journey so here’s the TLDR for those that don’t want to read the full thing (However I included diagrams in the article for you to visualize what I did):

Started with a landing page to showcase my work. I added a blog, quickly pivoted from managed WordPress, and initially this meant my set up was:

• Ghost on AWS via Docker

• DigitalOcean K8s for landing page

• GitOps with ArgoCD

• Multi-cloud setup for Ghost, plus Nginx reverse-proxying into the managed cluster

Once I saw I was weeks away from costs soaring ($55 across both clouds compared to $17.20), I switched to Hetzner and K3s, consolidating everything. Eliminating docker and aws, adding falco, linkerd, grafana and Prometheus. Some takeaways:

1. Simple architecture is often best when the deployment calls for it. Multi-cloud isn’t always worth it when you don’t need it

2. Learning to work with PV and PVCs was rewarding, but it kicked my ass

3. Testing saves time, if a tool is popular doesn’t mean it’s for you. I almost went with Cilium over Linkerd for the production branch, and that would’ve been a mistake since I was looking for something light and fast. 

4. Enterprise-grade infrastructure can be budget-friendly (if you’ve taken the time to test, fail, break things and build again)

5. GitOps best practices will save you so much time when implemented correctly. Got creative with how to do this with Ghost

6. Build to scale.

Curious what others here might do in this situation.

devops,Need help with ansible and drone ci pipeline ,"This is probably a low level issue for a lot of you but im kinda stuck on this.

Im using Drone as my CI/CD to deploy a binary to a server, I have a ansible repo for deployment. The process is as follows for now (this is just temporary since im building a deployment and goes only to staging):

`push to development &gt; builds binary &gt; names it binary_git_short_sha &gt; deploy it to server with command`

`ansible-playbook -i .ansible/inventory -e ""binary_name=${BINARY} "" --limit staging .ansible/playbook.yml`

BINARY variable has the value of the binary name, but when i call it in drone pipeline in a step i get binary\_name=  in the -e variables. If i replaced the ${BINARY} with lets say `${DRONE_BRANCH`} that is an environment variable set by drone at the start of the pipeline the value is there it would be `binary_name=development` but any time i define a variable by hand it does not work. Ive tried even running a bash script that would define the variables and pass them to the ansible command and run it all inside the script but the source would be the same and the result would be the same as well.

I tested it in the docker container itself on my machine, the entire process and it does work but in drone ci it does not. Feel like im losing my mind a bit.

devops,GitLab CI/CD Pipeline with multiple ArgoCD clusters,"We're migrating our azure pipelines over to GitLab, and so far the build process is fairly straightforward.

The problem is we're using multiple instances of ArgoCD, so the same application is deployed to multiple clusters with ArgoCD set up on each cluster.

I can't find a good way to reflect the ArgoCD sync status in the pipeline, and have this 'gate' the subsequent stages of the pipeline.

The pipeline looks something like this:

* install dependencies
* build/ push the image to Azure ACR
* write the image tag to a git repo -&gt; webhook from the repo to ArgoCD to trigger sync
* ArgoCD picks up the change to the image tag and syncs

The problem is that in the final step we've effectively 'handed off' to ArgoCD, and the only way around this I can see is to have a stage that sleeps and periodically calls each ArgoCD endpoint to get the sync status, and once all apps have synced to mark the stage as successful/failed.

This seems quite a janky workaround, and the only 'good' alternative would be to move away from Argo and have GitLab update the kubernetes manifests - this is a big change that's not really feasible for us at this time.

Does anyone have any suggestions or a similar setup?

1. **Azure RHEL Subscription**: I created an Azure VM using the default RHEL image from the Azure Marketplace, which incurs some costs.

devops,Jenkins jobs logging solution needed,"Hi All,
I have around 200 Jenkins jobs running for a bunch of projects. Not all of them are deployment jobs only a very few &amp; this query is not regarding them. I have other 170+ jobs which are created to run certain functionalities within few applications. They're like cron jobs (or batch jobs) you can say.

So these batch jobs are like taking file input from various SFTP servers &amp; then executing them one by one.

Issue is that these jobs give success message even if one of the file from any SFTP server is not fetched. Let's say each job is fetching 10 files from different SFTP's and they miss out on 1 file but successfully execute 9 of those so it's still a success. Now it's not possible for me to go into console log of each job &amp; see which of these executed all 10 file; if I'd do that then it will be very time consuming.

Is there any solution for cases like this where I can have a dashboard or anything which collects the logs from all specified jobs &amp; I can check them all in as minimum time as possible? I was thinking something like ELK?

1. One issue we faced was, whenever we try to deploy the TF using Mac, we get some drift in the plan, but that is not the case in linux or windows machines, not sure of the file handling is different or some other issue, 
2. Second issue we faced was that sometimes when planning we see some drift on DB resources and for production it really scares us like why there is showing changes in DB resources even theo all i did is just changed the values for computer resources,

For first problem we moved to gitops and do all the deployment through our custom made aws CodePipeline only and we got features like Terraform Cloud or Atlantis, for second issue we decided to use terragrunt since it breaks the stacks and due to the structure, we can use singe repo to store multi region and multi environment deployment with less code and bette file structure, but in terragrunt we don't see change detection, for this we need to ise Terramate and tbh there's very less resources available for the same online, so I'm little worried if should we move out production IaaC to Terragrunt with Terramate and migrate from Terraform to OpenTofu?

I'm uncertain about how to set up and run Whisper V3 Turbo on Runpod’s serverless infrastructure. 



It seems we might need to wait until the upstream project https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/issues/1030 is updated with Turbo and published on https://pypi.org/project/faster-whisper/. 



Only then will this feature be available, and at that point, we could fork [https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-faster\_whisper](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-faster_whisper) to update it accordingly.

devops,Vulnerability Management for DevSecOps using OpenSource with prioritization functions,"Hello folks!

Some time ago, I shared with you my project MixewayFlow where I gather free and open-source tools for cybersecurity in DevSecOps. These tools easily integrate into an ultimate solution that, given a Git repository, is able to detect threats using SAST, SCA, Secret Leakage, and IaC scans.

That worked out pretty well and efficiently.

In newly released version I have introduced functionality that I have never seen in opensource project related with vulnerability proritization:)

Have you ever had a problem with the number of detected threats or struggled to convince development teams to look at a report containing 300 findings? Have you focused on findings based solely on severity taken from the scanner? There is a better way:

✅ Take into consideration EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System), which is quite useful for calculating possible exposure to threats.

✅ Consider if there is already an available end-user exploit for the detected threat (e.g., using KEV).

✅ Assess if the application where the threat is detected is processing sensitive data.

Maybe Mixeway Flow is not yet the best vulnerability management system, but point me to an open-source project that does vulnerability management, performs predefined full scans in full scope, and does prioritization. 😉

Any feedback appreciated.

devops,GitOps Setup: Security Concerns with Automated Deployments,"**Current Setup**:I have a straightforward but powerful GitOps workflow that consists of these steps:

1. Developer pushes code to source repository (GitLab.com)
2. CI/CD pipeline builds Docker image
3. Automated pipeline updates image tag in application repository
4. ArgoCD detects change and deploys new version



**Problem**: While this setup works well, there are security concerns. External developers with access to one repository can theoretically manipulate image tags of other repositories by triggering the pipeline with different values. There's a lack of granular access control for the deployment process.



**Planned Solution**: I'm planning to develop a open-source service to address this security gap. Here's the current design:

API Endpoint for New Image Tags: Route: /api/v1/new-image-tag Parameters needed:

* image\_tag (e.g., 1234567890)
* branch (e.g., main, develop, or feature/my-cool-feature-1)
* secret\_key (from GitLab CI variables)
* repository (e.g., gitlab.com/my-application/frontend)

The service will:

1. Validate permissions using secret key and repository
2. Determine environment from branch name
3. Create feature-branch specific values files automatically
4. Update image tag in values-$STAGE.yaml

API Endpoint for Closed Merge Requests: Route: /api/v1/closed-mr Parameters needed:

* mr\_id (e.g., 45)
* secret\_key (from GitLab CI variables)
* repository (e.g., gitlab.com/my-application/frontend)

The service will:

1. Get branch name from merge request
2. Check for open merge requests in other repos with same branch name
3. Clean up feature branch configuration if no other MRs exist
4. Allow ArgoCD to remove obsolete deployments



**Questions for the community**:

1. Are there existing tools that solve this security issue?
2. What are the best practices for securely handling image tag updates in a GitOps setup?
3. Would developing a new open source solution for this be valuable?

I'm particularly interested in solutions that maintain the simplicity of GitOps while adding proper security controls. Before starting development on a new tool, I want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel.

devops,Serverless vs Serverful,"Hi all,

Novice full-stack dev here. I need your opinion regarding the tech stack + deployment of a greenfield, multi-tenant web app for which I have 2 interested customers (payment plan pending) whose pain points are resolved, with hope to have many in the future but not more than 10k users globally.

My initial impulse is to have zero deployment costs, with a dockerized monolith backend (hosted on an always-free Oracle cloud VM), an Angular frontend hosted per Netlight / Cloudflare, and database hosted on Supabase. The reasoning is that “if” I’ll have an increased demand, I’ll simply scale these services vertically, and maybe even go cloud-native in the future. 

Competing with this thought are my AWS cloud skills from work, which push me to going completely serverless and using managed services to speed up development and not think about infra scaling and security down the line. However, if I do it right, with API GW, WAF, etc. I’ll incur costs from the get go (even with free tier) without having seen a single payment from the customer(s).

In your experience, which option would you recommend in such scenarios? Would you recommend I disregard the minimal costs from AWS and go cloud-first to prevent future headaches when I’m focusing on delivering features / adapting business logic, or should I experiment with all-free services to wait until I have enough customers that support putting in effort/costs to go cloud-native (given that all code needs to be refactored / changed anyway)?

The application needs a REST API to perform CRUD operations on multiple related tables in a PostgreSQL DB, and start many task queue operations per user.

devops,How do you like being sold to?,"Hi all,

I'm an SRE with about 10 years of experience. I'm taking a bit of a leap into a sales architecture role with a product that I'm pretty stoked about, but being on the other side, I know exactly how annoying it can be to be sold to. Our product has pretty clear value add for SREs, so I wanted to crowdsource a bit.

We're absolutely staying away from the outright obnoxious practices that would have had me never buying from a company (I'm thinking of a particular CI/CD company who called me daily, and y'all have probably had similar experiences).

We are growing, so some amount of prospecting is cold via email. We're trying to sell to people we think we can legitimately help, and we're regularly reaching out to people who have used our open source offerings to see if we can help further. Additionally, I'm trying to bring more of a consultative energy to this process rather than a sales energy. Additionally, I'm aware that even better solutions can not be the right work to pursue at any given moment as bureaucratic overhead can regularly be larger than technical cost of implementation.

Are there any other things I should be mindful of? Anything that you've been particularly grateful for when working with a vendor?

devops,Advice on Integrating DevOps Practices in a Traditional Ops Environment?,"
Hey all,

I’m working at a large energy utility company. It’s a pretty traditional environment with no real DevOps culture yet, and most workflows are manual and siloed, with few automation practices in place. It’s a challenge, but I’m really interested in finding ways to improve the workflow and bring in some DevOps ideas where I can.

About Me:
I’m in IT operations and mostly focused on monitoring systems—specifically Splunk—and doing a fair bit of scripting in Python and shell to streamline tasks where possible. My day-to-day includes managing monitoring for incidents, pushing updates, and handling deployment and maintenance across a Linux environment. At the moment, a lot of what I do is still manual, like deploying scripts to multiple search heads, and I’ve just started exploring Ansible to speed that up.

Why I’m Here:
Since DevOps isn’t something widely practiced here, I’d love to learn what daily tasks and routines you all typically handle in more DevOps-oriented roles. Any insights on tools or frameworks you’ve found useful for automating repetitive tasks in similar setups would be great. And if you have any advice on introducing DevOps principles gradually into a traditional ops environment, I’m all ears.

Thanks a lot for any tips or experiences you can share—hoping to pick up some ideas to bring back and try out here!",midiology,1gdriey,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gdriey/advice_on_integrating_devops_practices_in_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gdriey/advice_on_integrating_devops_practices_in_a/,2024-10-28 02:10:43,13,0.93,13,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gdriey
