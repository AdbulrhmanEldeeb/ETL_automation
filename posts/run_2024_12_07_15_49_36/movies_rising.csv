movies,NGL.. I miss Seth Rogan and James Franco in movies together. ,"Watching The Night Before  which I think is the last time they worked together unless it was the disaster artist, and it just reminded me how fucking great they where together. 

I'll dare to say there hasn't been an acting duo with better chemistry in the last 20 years. Doesn't matter what movie their friendship would always shine through the performance and they where also great picking characters that would bounce great off each other.. 

Franco did what he did and they have gone their separate ways it seems for good, at least they left me with a good selection of movies and TV shows.. But I'm not gonna lie, I do want them to work things out and start working togheter again.

movies,Uwe Boll's Assault on Wall Street,"Ever since the assassination of the United Health Care CEO this past week, I haven't been able to get this movie out of my mind and I saw it many years ago.  It's about a guy whose wife gets sick, their health insurance reaches their limit and he tries to cash in on his pension from the military, but most of it was put into stocks and this film's setting was the 2008-2009 Wall Street crash.  The wife feels guilty, commits suicide and the husband goes off the edge and starts going on a killing spree against stock brokers and CEOs.  

It's directed by Uwe Boll (Of course, yes, that Uwe Boll) but as far as his movies go, I don't remember this one being half bad.  I remember Dominic Purcell from Prison Break as the husband and John Heard as the main antagonist.  I see it's on Tubi, I might rewatch it this weekend.",jblanch3,1h8r31d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8r31d/uwe_bolls_assault_on_wall_street/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8r31d/uwe_bolls_assault_on_wall_street/,2024-12-07 12:04:52,201,0.82,201,0,121,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8r31d
