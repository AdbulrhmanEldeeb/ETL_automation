learnprogramming,Figuring out full stack coding?,"So I’ve been researching about web development, let me just get this right, so there’s three parts 

- Desginer (Figma)
- Front end dev (html,CSS,JavaScript)
- back end dev (PHP, JavaScript)

Let me know if I got this right, the designer just makes a glorified Canva template, the figma file doesn’t actually do anything but become a blueprint (headache) for the front end dev which will guide him on where to put containers and such, the front end dev then creates the physical webpages, places the forms, buttons, containers, etc. however these can link to each other but the they don’t actually perform any function.

The back end developer has to take the website from the front end dev and pretty much connect the dots? Get data collected from forms, tell it where to place that data, establish security measures, pretty much make the website function from page to page.

That’s my understanding of everything so far but now I’m learning with code.ai you can just turn images and screenshots into figma designs using ai, and with visual copilot you can now covert figma designs into front end code in React? So if these actually work all that is needed is backend and decent knowledge of front end. Idk if I’m missing something and maybe the ai tools aren’t all that great yet but I still feel as if front end feels like a lot of work and bit excessive and I also feel as if most people could replace designers by making there own design on figma or just screenshooting a design they like and editing from there. Lmk if my research is correct or not.

learnprogramming,HELP! Help me understand E-R diagram of these entities,"Hello everyone, I've been trying for more than a week to create the E-R diagram for these relationships that I'll explain below, but I still don't have a clear understanding. I don't know if it's because of a lack of foundation, or if the situation might be ambiguous. The thing is, I’ve created my first task management application, and it’s working, but the issue of cardinalities in the E-R diagram is still unclear to me.

Let me explain: there are 3 tables: **USERS**, **TASK**, and **TASK\_USERS**.

* **USERS** has Id(PK), Name, Email, and password.
* **TASK** has Id(PK), Title, date, and createdBy(userId FK).
* **TASK\_USERS** relates the user Id and task Id, and has userId(FK) and taskId(FK).
* **USERS** can create 1 or many **TASK**.
* A **TASK** can only be created by 1 **USERS**.
* **USERS** can assign 1 or many **USERS** to a**TASK**.
* Many **USERS** can be assigned to many **TASK**.

This is the schema I created: [https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT](https://imgur.com/a/gwRA1LT), but I think it’s wrong because I believe the relationships between **USERS-TASK\_USERS** and **TASK-TASK\_USERS**, depending on how you look at it, should both be N:M, right?

learnprogramming,Am I just not getting this?,"Hey guys!  


I have been learning C++ independently now for almost a month! Needless to say, I am working on a Rock, Paper, Scissors game right now and I was having an issue where I am using cin to gather a char for my  loops and functions, but I was testing it to see what kind of problems would arise if... say someone entered something greater than a single char. Problem happened obviously, and then I tried to fix the problem on my own, nothing I did would work. I then checked out a couple of stackoverflow questions and even posted one myself! (Which I'm not super happy about). The StackOverflow question I asked got me pushing in the right direction, introducing me to cin.ignore(). Plugged that into my code, still had the issue! Couldn't find the solution online anywhere... so I resorted to asking CoPilot (AI). Because of that I was able to figure out the missing parameter I needed in the cin.ignore() function. My question is... I feel like I cheated in a way because I had to ask around for help and even resorted to asking AI as well. My goal is to become a professional Software Engineer, and me having to google around and ask help from others including AI kind of gives me second thoughts as to if I can actually do something like this. Is it common for professionals to seek questions and help in this way?
