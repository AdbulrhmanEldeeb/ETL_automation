datascience,Classification threshold cost optimisation,"Say you’ve selected the best classifier for a particular problem, using threshold invariant metrics such as AUROC, Brier score, or log loss. 

It’s now time to choose the classification threshold. This will clearly depend on the use case and the cost/ benefits associated with true positives, false positives, etc. 

Often I see people advising to choose a threshold by looking at metrics such precision and recall. 

What I don’t see very often is people explicitly defining relative (or absolute, if possible) costs/ benefits of each cell in the confusion matrix (or more precisely the action that will be taken as a result). For example a true positive is worth $1000, a false positive -$500 and the other cells $0. 

You then optimise the threshold based on maximum benefit using a cost-threshold curve. The precision and recall can also be reported, but they are secondary to the benefit optimisation and not used directly in the choice. I find this much more intuitive and is my go-to.

Does anyone else regularly use this approach?

datascience,Deploying Niche R Bayesian Stats Packages into Production Software,"Hoping to see if I can find any recommendations or suggestions into deploying R alongside other code (probably JavaScript) for commercial software. 

Hard to give away specifics as it is an extremely niche industry and I will dox myself immediately, but we need to use a Bayesian package that has primary been developed in R.   
  
Issue is, from my perspective, the package is poorly developed. No unit tests. poor/non-existent documentation, plus practically impossible to understand unless you have a PhD in Statistics along with a deep understanding of the niche industry I am in. Also, the values provided have to be ""correct""... lawyers await us if not...  
  
While I am okay with statistics / maths, I am not at the level of the people that created this package, nor do I know anyone that would be in my immediate circle. The tested JAGS and untested STAN models are freely provided along with their papers.

It is either I refactor the R package myself to allow for easier documentation / unit testing / maintainability, or I recreate it in Python (I am more confident with Python), or just utilise the package as is and pray to Thomas Bays for (probable) luck.

Any feedback would be appreciated.
