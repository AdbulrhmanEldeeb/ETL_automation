I've broken my left hand (keyboard hand) and I'm looking for some game suggestions to keep me busy whilst I'm off work for a bit.

- This War of mine, I liked it and will probably keep playing it
- Civ 6, I will be playing this
- inscryption, already own it and have almost finished it prior to breaking my hand
- slay the spire, played it heaps and over it
- One Finger death punch, wasn't for me


I'm open to buying a mouse with a bunch of extra buttons if I find a game worth it.

gaming,Bring Back Good Co-Op Games,"Marvel Rivals came out. Was pretty cool for like 15 minutes and then I just felt kinda bored and a little sad. 

I’ve been playing games since the 80s and idk, I’m just tired of PvP stuff. Really missing the cooperative games of old.

I remember stuff like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or Left 4 Dead or Gauntlet Legends or Halo or even Destiny or the arcade beat em ups like X-men or the Simpsons or Turtles game when it first came out and these games were just so epic and fostered such great teamwork and camaraderie. Helluva dope feeling and rush having to work together to win. Especially back in the days of arcades, nothing cooler than actually assembling 4 people dedicated to pulling it off.

Idk. Everything just feels so competitive, battle royale, hero shootery, and it’s just beginning to feel unnecessary and kinda forced and stale.

Maybe I’m just feeling nostalgic and outta touch lol but I feel like bringing these kinds of great co-op games back in a modern sense in actual abundance would really inject some love and positive vibes back into the community while also, bringing in a whole new demographic of gamers looking for something less demanding and stressful than PvP gaming which I feel like is just low key bloating the market at this point.

P.S. this is no dig Marvel Rivals or to gamers that enjoy these games, I’m just getting this off my chest lol sorry it’s late, I’m high, rant over.

lol nope just a husband, father, business owner and student. I’ve been playing games since the 80s. I know major titles and indie games exist guys no offense lol. Mostly all the ones that have been named so far are not new names to me or games I haven’t tried at some point that just didn’t capture my interest.

Edit: Idk why I’m getting downvoted so much lmao are you taking offense to the fact that I just don’t like the games you’re suggesting as much as you or others do or haven’t played them? 

Idk I think I’ve been pretty respectful about the games I have talked about, even the ones I may not care for as well but idk. Either way, I’ve played Indie game guys. I’ve played games like stardew valley (well technically my wife played and I watched) or warhammer (specifically the vermintide one) and that was honestly years ago. Maybe I’m wrong but, those I don’t feel like are recent games (came out this year) and when I did watch/play them, they weren’t my cup of tea. I guess I should have been specific (like when I mentioned Destiny, I meant specifically the first one as I played 2 and did not care for it as much).

I’m almost 40 and a pretty avid gamer blessed to be able to play a PLETHORA of games over the last few years through different means (work, personal life, events), with 2 kids and a wife who are all also gamers either various taste whether that be in console (we have most past and present) or game type. I do not live under a rock, maybe a more a pineapple under the sea and my only burden is the business of life but, I’ve still found time to do my gaming and follow my hobbies (for business/pleasure) so I’m not completely out the loop.

I’ve had some great suggestion here to help solidify the push to try certain titles (maybe the art style has been putting me off or mechanics or story didn’t capture me) that I have been putting off or stayed away from. And I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and even opinions but let’s not trip on each other off of video games. The post was meant to just be light hearted and random, not this deep dive into my personal gaming preferences or an attack on others interest lol. 

From one gamer to another, let’s try to foster more positivity and cohesion so we gamers don’t always have to carry the title of toxic and negative and build a more appealing and inviting community.

But my initial thoughts are more so about how great of an initial “free to play, GaaS package” this game is starting out as.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs.

I personally played the game on release and when I got to the brain dance scene I had to cover my eyes because it was way too intense and almost painful to experience that and not too long after cases of legit seizures came up in the news concerning that scene. I’m not even epileptic!

I understand that there is an in game lore saying that brain dances work by triggering a mini seizure but what in the ever loving hell were they thinking creating an actual seizure scene??????

I also understand that there are warnings in the game saying that but those are meant as a precaution towards particularly epileptic people and the brain dance cutscene is a forced watch if you want to progress in the story.

It's plays great as well, but I can't get excited for it.  I feel like having to learn  another game that is just Overwatch on steroids isn't very exciting to me anymore.

gaming,Choices matter hell...,"I have a very big issue with this type of games.

It's not a rule, but more often than not it completely breaks the game for me.

My problem with those games, is that in most cases you get locked out of part of the content, based on the decisions you made.

In my opinion this is a very poor game design, artificially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs, if you want to see complete content.

As I never do more than one playthrough of any single player game, I feel somewhat robbed of a full experience.

Another complaint that I could log, is that at their launch many of these games are not balanced well enough, meaning if you pick a ""wrong"" side, you might be underpowered, compared to others.

This inherently leads me to not playing them until at least one or two major patches land, or I might skip them completely, if they fall off my radar.

If I am being completely honest, I would also have to blame my OCD, for wanting to see, and do, everything there is in every game I play, and wanting to min-max my character(s) each time.

Anyone else out there, with similar issues?   

Edit: based on early comments, I want to elaborate.  
For me it would be a much better game design if your choices dictate on which side of the situation/discussion, your character ends up, not completely lock you out of certain content.",OhforfsakeMJ,1h8qecr,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h8qecr/choices_matter_hell/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h8qecr/choices_matter_hell/,2024-12-07 11:16:50,0,0.26,0,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8qecr
gaming,Marvel Rivals unpopular opinion ,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, I've been waiting since the first play test for the game to release, but between godwaful matchmaking and low-key pretty unbalanced hero's, I think I'd rather play overwatch 

Sure, there's something to be said about running around as spider man punching dudes into the sky and webbing them up, or using Loki's decoys to escape and punish people, but overall the balance on character abilities feels extremely lacking. 

Like why is punishers ultimate so broken, but scarlet witch needs to be within slapping distance to get a kill with it, while having a huge red **SHOOT HERE SIGN** on top of you. Making it early impossible to use even if you get the drop on people.

That's not to me to mention the amount of times Hawkeye has one shot me across the map, or how groots stun ability lasts like 10x as long as Wanda's. 

Just feels like after that many play tests, the balancing should have been in a better spot at launch.
