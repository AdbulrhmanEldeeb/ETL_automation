movies,After rewatching Inception my opinion on the ending has now changed forever,"I always believed that Leo was actually awake at the end. Nolan just showed us the spinning top as it was about to topple over before cutting to black and ending the movie. 

After rewatching the movie for who knows how many times I fully believe now that Leo is still dreaming. 

1. Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but‚Ä¶

2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven‚Äôt aged at all. 

Anyway that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm leaning now - he‚Äôs still dreaming. 

Edit: I‚Äôm loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo‚Äôs kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. 

I‚Äôve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. 

I will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I‚Äôm even more curious! Is Leo dreaming because he still has not experienced his gravity drop in ‚Äúthe real world.‚Äù Hmmm ü§î ",onlyididntsayfudge,1h2lv4j,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2lv4j/after_rewatching_inception_my_opinion_on_the/,2024-11-29 13:32:59,5100,0.9,5100,0,721,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2lv4j

That‚Äôs the scene where he slowly describes to Leo‚Äôs character Amsterdam, basically, his life story. What he‚Äôs all about, how he‚Äôs managed to survive. 

Another scene like that is the famous Jaws scene with Robert Shaw where he talks about his encounter with sharks as a WW2 soldier after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk in shark-infested waters: 

https://youtu.be/u9S41Kplsbs

Another one of the most famous is Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, relaying his visions and experiences of horror in war - the disturbing aftermath after he and his group inoculate a village - and using that to justify and rationalize his own brutality:

movies,Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo',"Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic ""stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen"" narrative. 

This is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. 

The film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. 

What I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.

The story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.

This is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate. Highly recommend.",keepfighting90,1h34ecp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h34ecp/rebel_ridge_is_a_damn_good_thriller_reminiscent/,2024-11-30 04:20:44,250,0.86,250,0,60,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h34ecp

Which classic films would genuinely NOT benefit from a sequel, and WHY?   (Unless it‚Äôs obvious to all, might you tell us WHY you offer your answer?) 

These days, many (almost all) movies are made with a sequel or trilogy in mind. Even if the story ends with the destruction of the galaxy, there‚Äôs always room for that follow-up (and the potential for additional ca$h). 

In the past, movies were not created with this mindset.  Which movies are notably Not sequel ready?  In other words and in a roundabout way, how have sequels affected the quality of the movies being made today?

In my thinking, _Groundhog Day_ is a good example.  The story is completely wrapped up by the end.  No sequel necessary or wanted.

yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Poland - and I really would like to thank all the participants: We got around 50 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. Especially with this in mind, the final result is very close: ***Kr√≥tki film o zabijaniu*** (engl.: *A Short Film About Killing*) has won the race with just 12 upvotes (minus the given downvotes).

Today, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in Portugal. As always, the winner  will soon take its place in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And as always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

I've recently watched Django Unchained again and he was really briliant in it.

He was obviously also great in The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, Revolutionary Road, etc but those are his stand-out performances in my personal opinion

edit: not sure why some people want to argue with me and are downvoting this?

movies,My Fascination with Alfred Hitchcock and My Top 5 Hitchcock Films,"It was in the 1990s when I got my first VCR. I was beyond excited - just imagine, no more waiting for the cable guy to show you something good. Back then, there was no internet to help me figure out what to watch, so I headed to the local video store. I asked a friend who worked there that I wanted to watch an interesting mystery thriller and asked for suggestions. He told me to pick any Hitchcock movie - I couldnt go wrong. Thats when I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock.

Since that day, Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors. His mastery of suspense, mystery, and thriller genres is what makes him stand out. I think I‚Äôve watched almost every Hitchcock film (at least the ones released after 1940), and each one has been a joy to revisit. Whats even more impressive is how well his movies have aged - something I can't say about a lot of films from that era. Hitchcock‚Äôs films have been remade and adapted countless times. Directors and writers still draw inspiration from his work. Even today!

Here‚Äôs a list of my top 5 Hitchcock films. If you haven‚Äôt seen them, I highly recommend you do. It wasn‚Äôt an easy task narrowing it down because I love so many of his films, but these are my absolute favs.

1. Psycho Psycho was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It was the first movie I saw on my new VCR. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say I got goosebumps during the final reveal. I literally jumped out of my chair, wondering what just happened. A fun fact: Psycho was the first movie ever made in the US to show a toilet flushing. Yep, you read that right - something as simple as a toilet became a big deal back then.
2. Rebecca I‚Äôve always loved the book by Daphne du Maurier, so when I heard Hitchcock adapted it into a film, I was both excited and a little skeptical. Typically, I‚Äôm not a fan of book-to-movie adaptations, but Hitchcock did an amazing job. The movie brings the eerie atmosphere of the novel to life, with strong performances and a perfect blend of tension and mystery. Highly recommend it.
3. Rear Window Rear Window is an absolute masterpiece. Stewart and Kelly lead a stellar cast in this film, where Stewart plays a man stuck in a wheelchair, spying on his neighbors through the rear window. What he sees gets him tangled up in something far more sinister than he bargained for. The suspense is built slowly but steadily. What unfolds after is such a treat to watch. It‚Äôs been adapted and remade several times, with one of the most famous being Disturbia - not a bad film in itself but the original is much much better.
4. Strangers on a Train This one really kept me guessing. The premise was intriguing - two men meet on a train, and one proposes a strange idea: if they each commit a murder for the other, they‚Äôll be in the clear. It‚Äôs one of those thrillers that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering how it‚Äôll all unfold. The film does a great job of playing with psychological tension and moral dilemmas.
5. Dial M for Murder I saw Dial M for Murder a little later in my Hitchcock journey. Actually, I watched The Perfect Murder, a remake starring Michael Douglas, before I saw this. While I thought the remake had a decent plot, it didn‚Äôt quite measure up. Then, I read somewhere that it was copied from a Hitchcock movie - Dial M for Murder. I saw it and absolutely loved it. The plot was similar with some differences, but the execution was so much better. It was a fun, thrilling watch that had me hooked from start to finish.

It would be remiss of me not to mention some of my other favorite Hitchcock films, like Birds, Rope, Notorious, Spellbound, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. These could easily make a top-five list on another day.

If you haven‚Äôt seen his work and like watching movies, I suggest you watch his work. You won‚Äôt regret it.

movies,"Benji ""A Real Pain"" (2024) ","While seeing this film I noticed small bits of things I tend to do that correlated with Benji (Kieran Culkin's) behavior. Just like Benji I am very extroverted and a happy person in general, but there are moments when certain things or situations just get to me very deeply and I get very emotional. I'm hypersensitive which means I enjoy life to the fullest and is grateful for the little things in life but I can also get sad for the littlest things which makes me suffer unconditionally. I've never met or seen anyone like me until I saw this movie. I was evaluating every single person's reaction to Benji's way of being, non of them wanted to be near him since the risk of him having a tantrum or having an emotional burst...This made me realize why I don't have any close friends or people around me, seeing the movie made me realize that if I had a benji I wouldn't wanna be near him or myself with the fear that they could hurt me in emotional and mental ways; being there for those types of people is very draining. They tend to be very negative towards themselves and feel like they don't deserve certain things. These negative feelings toward themselves makes them jealous of everyone since they feel like they aren't capable of deserving true love and real happiness. I am writing this description based on the things I saw he does in the movie as well as what correlates with me. I've been reading reviews like crazy to find a diagnoses because he has the same issues as me. He was diagnosed with bipolar disease and took medications but I've been told I don't have bipolar and would never take meds to solve a mental or emotional issue. I've been in a personal journey to help myself since my mother told me she prefers to protect herself from me since it's very tiring to be near me. The good times are amazing but she says she senses evil and negativity just as if I wanted to ruin a good time and have everyone focus on myself. I struggle with self-destruction tendencies since I was a kid and a part of me  thinks I do this because I feel like I'm not good enough and all the overthinking gets together and makes me burst with emotions or doing something to hurt myself or others just so I could stay alone and suffer. I think benji and I just both struggle with self-destruction tendencies. My psychologist told me that my personal self-love journey is going to help a lot and I won't be able to let other people love me until I learn to love myself. Personally I'm very happy that I've become self aware of all the people i've hurt in my life but most importantly myself, I'm glad I finally made the choice to help myself and stop being the victim. I'm a bit nervous because I've never been to truly love myself even after 22 years, I've always been quite negative about my body and even if I fix something it's never good enough, I just need to love who I am and I'm sure I can get through it with the right professional help.",Intrepid_Computer_68,1h2tzux,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,2024-11-29 19:41:26,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h2tzux
movies,Cities as Side Characters: A Cinematic Love Letter to Urban Landscapes,"Ever noticed how some movies make a city more than just a backdrop? Some directors go beyond showing a skyline or a monument. They dive deep into the city‚Äôs culture, spirit, and unique character to weave it into the story.

Bollywood has some brilliant examples of cities playing side characters:

Wake Up Sid gives us a heartfelt glimpse into Mumbai‚Äôs monsoons and its never-ending life.

Kahaani celebrates Kolkata‚Äôs festive chaos and mysteries.

8 AM Metro dives into Hyderabad‚Äôs beauty while exploring human emotions.


Even Hollywood embraces this concept:

Before Sunrise romanticizes Vienna‚Äôs quiet charm.

Midnight in Paris takes us through the dreamy streets of the city of love.

La La Land reflects LA‚Äôs bittersweet relationship with dreams.


From the ghats of Varanasi in Masaan to the neon-lit streets of Tokyo in Lost in Translation, cities have so much to say without uttering a single word.

movies,Quotables,"Continuing a discussion from last night's Thanksgiving dinner, do you think movies have gone down in quality and quantity of Quotables?

I think the single most quotable film of all time is The Big Lebowski.  Pretty much every line in that film is God-Tier quotable.

Some films only have a few Quotables but they're just as epic. Aliens for example has ""they mostly come out at night"" and ""game over, man!"" which are both gold.

The great comedies are masterpieces of Quotables.  Airplane! and Hot Fuzz in particular (along with the already-mentioned Lebowski) are packed with incredibly awesome Quotables.

But what happened to cinema?  These days you barely even get a single great Quotable even in good movies.  I loved both the new Dune films, but I can't think of a single good quotable in either one.  ""I love you 3000"" is an ass-tier quotable.  ""On your left"" like that's not even fun, what else has Marvel even got?  ""I am Iron Man"" I guess but that movie is now 14 years old and the first one they made, and back when films still came with quotables.

I think we need to do something, write letters to the studios maybe or holler at James Gunn on twitterX.  Great one-liners are an important part of the moviegoing experience but nobody drops them anymore it seems.

Does this even make sense to anyone else?l or dod I just eat too much turkey yesterday and the tryptophan is still messing with my mind?

movies,Was Inception About Coping With Dementia and Grief? ,"Would love to get the community's perspective on a different angle on Inception. 

There was this recurring quote in the movie from both Cobb and Mal throughout the movie: 

""You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you when the train will take you, cuz you'll be together.""

What if the movie is really about a failed suicide pact and dementia? 

I think the whole sequence from 2:12:45 to 2:13:50 redefines the whole movie.  This is the final scene with Mal after the kick is underway where Cobb reminds Mal that they had already grown old together and we see older versions of them walking in a city holding hands (with wedding rings) and then seeing the hands clasped together and rumbling on what looks like train tracks (with wedding rings, but you have to zoom in).  We know from Nolan that any scenes with the wedding ring was real life.

Two big prevailing themes in the movie centers on ""an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone"" (2:16:03) and taking a leap of faith.   Perhaps old Mal had dementia (in the above sequence Cobb tells Mal that she doesn't remember) and perhaps they planned a suicide by train (old hands on the train tracks) and he couldn't take the leap of faith and left her on the tracks at the last second leaving Cobbs now an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone and the movie reflects his reconciliation and grief.   Perhaps the whole movie is a dream of old Cobb sedated while in hospice but that's just my speculation.  Mal kinda pokes at the fourth wall a bit in the sequence from 1:59:59 to 2:00:51 which highlights how everything in the plot had conveniently come together so nothing is real.

movies,Come and See (1985) is not anti-war,"I've just finished this masterpiece and I'm still at awe, one of the best movies ever made, a perfect film. About it being an anti-war film, I don't think it is, and this doesn't mean anything in terms of quality, it is also not a moral judgement, I don't see a problem with it AT ALL, it's simply an observation about the movie's themes/message.

So first, what does it mean to be ""anti-war"", in my opinion it should deromanticize AND not condone war in any way, the former is done, the latter I don't think it is. The movie shows the barbarity of the nazi regime, every single nazi in the movie is absolutely disgusting and inhumane, while practically every soviet is an everyday person doing what is necessary to survive. The movie at no point questions any soviet policy during the war, in the movie they are justified at every point, even the boy robbing the cow can be sympathized and understood easily.

And see, this is not a problem, we know the horrors of the nazi war machine, we know that 25million soviets died in WW2, they have every right to be pissed and to tell the story that way, which brings me to what I think is one of the main messages of the movie: **sometimes war can be justified.** The movie shows: ""the nazis are attacking us and it is either us or them"", what brought the end of the nazis? It was war, not pacifism or diplomacy, no, **war.** Particulary the USSR, we know they were the main protagonists in the defeat of the nazis, that's history, and the movie came out on the 40 year aniversary of the soviet victory. The movie ends with the soviets marching together towards nazi defeat. With the kid shooting Hitler's portrait. Even when they had the upper hand on the nazis they were pretty humane, considering the level of barbarity that was shown towards them throughout the movie, they quickly shot them and moved on, no sick games, no torture, etc. This is a very nationalistic and pro-soviet movie, and again this is not a moral judgement, this is not a flaw, it's just the story they chose to tell and it is a masterpiece.

I think a truly anti-war movie should portrait war as something pointless and unnecessary from the pov of the everyday man like in Grave of the Fireflies. The war reflects on the kids as something that only harms them, they have no reason to engage in it, they don't understand it, it happened for the political/economic interests of the japanese empire. We know from history that Japan was more in the wrong than not and they were the agressors most of the time, so the movie shows this nihilistic perspective in which the war serves only to cause suffering even to japanese citizens and the kids die for nothing, they are not remembered, what happened during the film is absolutely pointless, as was the war. Another alternative would be to make a pro-peace movie, I like a quote from Coppola about it:

&gt;*But an anti-war film, I always thought, should be like The Burmese Harp ‚Äì something filled with love and peace and tranquillity and happiness*

movies,"Ben Stiller could be thought of as more of a great director than as a comedic actor, in ten years' time","So Ben Stiller, damn he can pull some moves behind the camera.

He's known more as a comedic actor - but I think in ten years, he could be thought of as more of a great director. 

I'm currently watching 2018 mini-series Escape of Dannemora, and it is HBO level good. Based on a true story of a prison break. Really gritty. Starring top actors giving some incredible performances, Benicio del Toro, Patricia Arquette and Paul Dano. The scenes are all so captivating. Just a really well put together show all round. 

Then of course, there's Severance. Just stupendous, a real fine wine of a tv show. Gloriously quirky and compelling. Great to see Adam Scott beng given something more meaty to work with. He's such a great straight comic actor that it makes perfect sense he could play such a nuanced, thoughtful character. Plus, it's just such a great ensemble drama. 

Stiller's projects seem to all have a real subtext, and you see that in most scenes.

My points on these shows is that Stiller clearly can unlock special abilities in his actors to really explore a scene, a feeling or a premise and give it so much more depth

These are all really interesting performances and fascinating projects. 

I think as long as Severance doesn't continue to take hellishly long and wraps up after an appropriate amount of seasons, Stiller could go on to make a few more really renowned dramatic films or tv shows.

Plus, he has an impressive back catalogue of directing credits on more comedic movies, dating back to the 90s. Including The Cable Guy, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. You don't make these great comedy movies without having incredible directing chops.

movies,An Observation about the Sixth Sense 25 Years Later,"Yadda, yadda, spoilers.

When Sixth Sense was released it looked like a generic ghost story movie which I had no interest in until a friend, whose opinion I respected, told me I **had** to see it, but wouldn't tell me why. I would bet that a number of other people at that time had something like a similar experience; either they heard from a friend or read some reviews or just saw the box office numbers and realized this movie had something going for it. So I went with a few other friends and we were blown away by the ending, naturally. Recently, I remembered the conversation we had immediately following the movie and I recalled that all of us said the same thing: just before the ending, we thought it was a fine film, but didn't see what the big deal was ‚Äìand *then* we saw the twist and were just as thrilled as everyone else.

And that recollection made me realize something either truly ingenious about Shyamalan or that he just got incredibly lucky. Take your pick.

That is: up until the end, it's not really that great of a film at all. I mean, it's fine. A few good jump scares, definitely some creepy scenes, but without *that* ending, the film is a C+ or maybe a B. However, preceding that awesome twist with a just an okay film completely misdirects the audience into thinking this is, in fact, just a mediocre picture. But then when the twist happens and we're all blown away. It's the basically the ""Yeah, I'm not doing anything; don't worry about it, everything is just normal"" misdirection that magicians use all the time and, like in a good magic ~~trick~~ illusion, lulling or even boring the audience into thinking they know what's going to happen is makes what actually does happen all the more amazing.

So maybe Shyamalan made what he thought would have been a great ghost story all along, but just got really, really lucky that he thought of a really great ending. Or maybe he intentionally kept the first half fairly low-key/stakes to stun us at the end.

Most of the time it's just a cash grab. They shoot a film, cut few scenes off and they use those scene later in some extended version and present it as a good thing.

Why doesn't Jenny leave a message for Forrest when she leaves? Why is she cutting off all contact with Forrest?
Why does she didn't tell anything to Forrest?
Does she didn't like Forrest?

movies,Actor who u liked so much but he/she turned out to be a horrible person.,"What are the Actors who u liked so much whether Acting, personality, movies but later u got to know he is a horrible person in reality

My one:¬†Brad Pitt

He has done some of my fav movies like inglorious basterds, fight club, se7en. I enjoys watching him in general, got great screen presence nd a really good actor. Fantastic producer , does interesting projects And even industry people loved, respected him a lot so in general i used to think he must be a great person but in recent time seeing his real face got me on roll and i never imagined he is such a pathetic person.

movies,"American Beauty, Powder, Chinatown, and X-Men are all examples of tainted movies due to their Director or Actors private/public lives. What's your stance on ""Blacklisted"" movies?","I love movies for the movie not for the actor or director. It's my stance that the art is separate from the person. But all my life I've seen people be vilified for liking something just because a person involved in the project did something heinous.

For me this goes back to Paul Reubens and Pee-Wee Herman. I'm sure the list is as long as motion pictures are old. And everyone has liked someone's work that has since fallen from grace. From Mel Gibson to Jeffery Jones.

Do you stop loving a movie due to their directors, actors, and/or producers public image being tarnished? Do you feel pressured not to like a movie for that reason?",sergemeister,1h2rhj3,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2rhj3/american_beauty_powder_chinatown_and_xmen_are_all/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2rhj3/american_beauty_powder_chinatown_and_xmen_are_all/,2024-11-29 17:53:02,0,0.26,0,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2rhj3
movies,Get out was Jordan Peele‚Äôs one hit wonder. ,"upon seeing get out for the first time, I was struck. It was and still is one of my favorite movies I‚Äôve ever seen in both the execution, cinematography, acting, plot, and significance to the world. Every second was fascinating, and the music was incredible. I think it‚Äôs one of the most genius movies ever written. because of this, I was so excited to watch us and nope. After watching both of those, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed. Nope was painful to get through with no plot conclusions and nothing making any reasonable interest. I don‚Äôt mind Science Fiction and maybe I just don‚Äôt like the genre, but I feel like nope was the biggest waste of time I‚Äôve ever spent. It was not interesting, there were no a-ha moments and I was overall really disappointed. I watched us which I thought was better than nope, but still nowhere near the quality and genius of get out. I really hope this isn‚Äôt his one hit wonder, because I need more movies like get out.
