programming,The State of the Subreddit (May 2024),"Hello fellow programs! 

**tl;dr** some revisions to the rules to reduce low quality blogspam. The most notable are: banning **listicles** (""7 cool things I copy-pasted from somebody else!""), **extreme beginner articles** (""how to use a for loop""), and some **limitations on career posts** (they must be related to programming careers). Lastly, I want **feedback** on these changes and the subreddit in general and invite you to **vote** and **use the report button** when you see posts that violate the rules because they'll help us get to it faster.

r/programming's mission is to **be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day**. [Last time we spoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/173viwj/meta_the_future_of_rprogramming/) I introduced the rules that we've been moderating by to accomplish that. Subjectively, quality on the subreddit while not perfect is much improved since then. Since it's still mainly just me moderating it's hard to tell what's objectively bad vs what just annoys me personally, and to do that I've been keeping an eye on a few forms of content to see how they perform (using mostly votes and comment quantity &amp; health).

Based on that the notable changes are:

* üö´ **Listicles**. ""7 cool python functions"", ""14 ways to get promoted"". These are usually spammy content farms. If you found 15 amazing open source projects that will blow my mind, post those projects instead.
* üö´ **Extreme beginner content** (""how to write a for loop""). This is difficult to identify objectively (how can you tell it from good articles like ""how does kafka work?"" or ""getting started with linear algebra for ML""?) so there will be some back and forth on calibrating, but there has been a swath of very low quality [""tutorials""](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chogwb/first_program_of_java/) if you can even call them that, that I very much doubt anybody is actually learning anything from and they sit at 0 points. Since ""what is a variable?"" is probably not useful to anybody already reading r/programming this is a quick painless way to boost the average quality on the subreddit.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Career posts must be related to software engineering careers**. To be honest I'm personally not a fan of career posts on r/programming at all (but shout out to [cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)!) but during the last rules revision they were doing pretty well so I know there is an audience for it that I don't want to get in the way of. Since then there has been growth in this category [all across the quality spectrum](https://www.reddit.com/domain/eng-leadership.com/) (with an accompanying rise in product management methodology like ""agile vs waterfall"", also across the quality spectrum). Going forward these posts must be distinctly related to software engineering careers rather than just generic working. This isn't a huge problem yet but I predict that it will be as the percentage of career content is growing.

In all of these cases the category is more of a tell that the quality is probably low, so exceptions will be made where that's not the case. These are difficult categories to moderate by so I'll **probably make some mistakes** on the boundaries and that's okay, let me know and we'll figure it out.

Some other categories that I'm **keeping an eye on** but not ruling on today are:

* **Corporate blogs** simply describing their product in the guise of ""what is an authorisation framework?"" (I'm [looking at you Auth0](https://www.reddit.com/domain/a0.to/) and [others like it](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cgx739/what_is_ai_infrastructure_software/)). Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it. Companies use their blogs as marketing, branding, and recruiting tools and that's okay when it's ""writing a good article will make people think of us"" but it doesn't go here if it's just a literal advert. Usually they are titled in a way that I don't spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments.
* **Generic AI content** that [isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chll2o/ai_still_hasnt_figured_out_branding_yet_heres_why/) technical in content. ""Does Devin mean that programming is over?"", ""Will AI put farmers out of work?"", ""Is AI art?"". For a few weeks these were the titles of about 20 articles per day, some scoring high and some low. Fashions like this come and go but I'm keeping an eye on it.
* **Newsletters**: There are a [few people](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cho9ye/big_tech_digest_15_introducing_meta_llama_3_at/) that post every edition of their newsletter to reddit, where that newsletter is really just aggregating content from elsewhere. It's clear that they are trying to grow a monetised audience using reddit, but that's okay if it's providing valuable curation or if the content is good and people like it. So we'll see.
* **Career posts**. Personally I'd like r/programming to be a deeply technical place but as mentioned there's clearly an audience for career advice. That said, the posts that are scoring the highest in this category are mostly people upvoting to agree with a statement in the title, not something that anybody is learning from. (""Don't make your engineers context-switch."" ""Everybody should get private offices."" ""Micromanaging sucks."") The ones that one could actually learn from with an instructive lean mostly don't do well; people seem to not really be interested in how to have the best 1:1s with their managers or how you went from Junior to Senior in 18 hours (though [sometimes they are](https://www.reddit.com/domain/highgrowthengineer.com/)). That tells me that there's some subtlety to why these posts are scoring well and I'm keeping an eye on the category. What I don't want is for ""vote up if you want free snacks"" to push out the good stuff or to be a farm for the other 90% of content that's really just personal brand builders.

I'm sure you're as annoyed as I am about these but they're fuzzy lines and difficult to come up with objective criteria around. As always **I'm looking for feedback** on these and if I'm missing any and any other points regarding the subreddit and moderation so let me know what you think.

## The rules!

With all of that, here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place.

‚úÖ means that it's currently allowed, üö´ means that it's not currently allowed, ‚ö†Ô∏è means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early.

* ‚úÖ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.
* ‚úÖ Academic CS or programming papers
* ‚úÖ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.
* ‚úÖ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. These must be related or specific to programming/software engineering careers in some way
* ‚úÖ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.
* üö´ Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male.
* üö´ Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.
* ‚úÖ Demos with code. I wrote a game, here it is on GitHub
* üö´ Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.
* üö´ AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.
* üö´ Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.
* üö´ Surveys and üö´ Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.
* üö´ Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).
* üö´ Images, memes, anything low-effort or low-content. Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so there's not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because it's easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that we'd normally allow but that are obviously, unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copy-pasted onto a site with a bazillion ads. It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event. There's a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular: there are a lot of spammy security ""blogs"" that syndicate stories like this. Pretty much all listicles are disallowed under this rule. 7 cool python functions. 14 ways to get promoted. If you found 15 amazing open source projects that will blow my mind, post those projects instead.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Extreme beginner content. What is a variable. What is a `for` loop. Making an HTPT request using curl. Like listicles this is disallowed because of the quality typical to them, but high quality tutorials are still allowed and actively encouraged.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event. We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory.
* Comments are only very loosely moderated and it's mostly üö´ Bots of any kind (Beep boop you misspelled misspelled!) and üö´ Incivility (You idiot, everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy.)
However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.",ketralnis,1chs4ib,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/,2024-05-01 17:37:38,658,0.97,658,0,154,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1chs4ib

programming,New language: Universal Scripting Language (.usl) ," 

Hi there,

I‚Äôm custom rom-developing my watch. I‚Äôm at the point where the scripts are written and I‚Äôm learning vscode to implement the build. 

I‚Äôm a leading global researcher for multiple domains such as AI, science, biomedical development, blah de fucking blah. No one cares. 

I‚Äôve invented a new coding language called Universal Scripting Language. (.usl), that can utilize 400+ coding languages in one setup. It got its MIT license, so I don‚Äôt know if I need the Apache 2.0 as well but, whatever happy to have both if needed. I‚Äôm building the IDE currently with scheduling and automation built in. The first test was to see if it could run itself which it did. Very cool to see. I think I recorded that part. It‚Äôll be used within my watch build in some really cool ways. I hope you‚Äôll find it interesting. I‚Äôm including the interpreter and translation software into the watch so you can mod to your hearts content and help develop cool shit. 
I‚Äôve got the syntax ready and the beginnings of an O-Reilly-inspired book for it in the works. 

Anyway. Would anyone be interested in the progress of this? I‚Äôm a literal shutin who‚Äôs bedridden often with muscular dystrophy and schizoaffective disorder but I‚Äôm also happy to show how it‚Äôs coming along. It‚Äôs designed to help you live as long as possible. I have trouble with hallucinations and being unable to sleep (no rem anymore) and working is all I know how to do. I can‚Äôt seem to work normally anymore. 

If I could figure out a way to make a living creating cool shit I think I have the production gear to do a legit series on it, if you would like a video or podcast I‚Äôve done both. Streaming is doable but I can‚Äôt talk while working. It lets you listen to music or online stuff. I would just need to ask for some guidance on what you would like to see, what to look out for‚Äîcommunity stuff. 

After the watch is released, artificial kidneys are ready as are universal donor blood types from any stem cell. I‚Äôm just a bit stuck in my house at the moment. (Sorry if this is meandering‚Äîmental illness is hard to explain through.)

Thanks.

Hi everyone!üëã

I‚Äôm exiting to charge a project I‚Äôve been working on - TGV (French express trains), a lightweight C# library designed to simplify the process of building HTTP servers. Inspired by simplicity and flexibility of ExpressJS, I created this to be a cross-platform easy-to-use framework for building apps. 

üéØFeatures:

üåêHTTP(S) request handling with routings 

üîìMiddleware support

üñ•Ô∏èCross-platform (at least Linux and Windows)

üì¶Minimal dependencies and no boilerplates


üöÄGetting started

You can check out and try library on GitHub and NuGet today! The library is still in development stage so any feedback, suggestions or contributions are very welcome!

Feel free to ask any question, I‚Äôll be happy to answer them!

programming,Real-Time Video Processing - iPhone Continuity Camera - Active Graph Networks,"Hey r/Programming,

I‚Äôve been working on a project that processes raw iPhone camera data in real time, applying dynamic enhancements like stabilization, UV filtering, and even simulated AC130-style thermal effects. This all runs through a compact, custom-built pipeline using a relational neural network and a 4D programming framework I‚Äôve been experimenting with.

The framework models state changes in video data over time, mapping it into a ‚Äú4D‚Äù structure that includes spatial, temporal, and attribute dimensions. This allows for real-time effects that adapt dynamically as the camera moves or conditions change.

The cool part? It‚Äôs running off consumer-grade hardware‚Äîa MacBook paired with an iPhone using Continuity Camera as the feed. The framework‚Äôs focus is on lightweight, efficient processing that could be adapted for mobile devices or edge computing.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure how this compares to how cameras or computers traditionally work, but I think there‚Äôs something novel here.

Happy to be told I‚Äôm wrong‚Äîor that this is just reinventing something better done elsewhere!

programming,C web framework with ‚Äúkernel like‚Äù modules. ,"

I‚Äôve been working on my hobby project inspired by kernel modules. The idea is: write some raw C code, upload it to a server, and it compiles and runs it at runtime. No precompilation, no restarts. :D

C isn‚Äôt usually the go-to for web dev (for good reasons), but here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve tried to make it less painful:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Slow Build Cycles: Upload code, and the server handles the rest‚Äîlike ""hot reloading,"" but in C.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Speed vs. Practicality: Great for scenarios where performance actually matters, like data-heavy or real-time stuff.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Memory Management: Modules are isolated, so crashes don‚Äôt take everything down.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Built-In Libraries: Comes with SQLite3, OpenSSL, and Jansson support to save you from reinventing the wheel.

It‚Äôs just a proof of concept, not production-ready (please don‚Äôt deploy it), but it‚Äôs fun to work on! Would love any feedback on it.

programming,Miss Notion AI in Obsidian? Here‚Äôs My Plan to Bring It Back with a Plugin! üöÄ,"

As a university student who recently transitioned from Notion to Obsidian, one feature I sorely miss is the floating Notion AI chatbot that was always available for quick assistance. Inspired by that, I‚Äôve started developing a plugin for Obsidian that brings a similar experience, using the Gemini API for note summarization, content generation, and more‚Äîall directly within the Obsidian workspace!

The plugin, Obsi AI, is designed to seamlessly integrate into Obsidian‚Äôs powerful markdown environment, providing AI-powered help whenever you need it. Whether you're looking for quick note summaries, brainstorming ideas, or generating content, Obsi AI aims to streamline your workflow without leaving your notes.

üîπ Key Features:

- Instant content generation and note summarization
- Context-aware responses based on your notes
- Interactive assistant available within the Obsidian workspace

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE : I‚Äôm developing this plugin as a hobby, and while I‚Äôm a cybersec undergraduate rather than a pro developer, so code may be I‚Äôm passionate about making this tool useful for fellow Obsidian users. If you're interested in collaborating or have feature suggestions, I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

Feel free to check out the GitHub repository, and if you like what you see, please give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è to show your support!

https://github.com/tharushkadinujaya05/ObsiAI

By building further on the explanation of Russ Cox in [Zip Files All The Way Down](https://research.swtch.com/zip), I was able to include extra files inside the zip quines.

This is similar to the [droste.zip](https://alf.nu/ZipQuine) from Erling Ellingsen, who lost the methodology he used to create it. By using the generator, now everyone van create such files.

To take it even a step further, i looked into the possibility to create a zip file with following structure:

one.zip -&gt; two.zip -&gt; one.zip -&gt; ...

This type of zip file has an infinite loop of two zip's containing each other. As far as I could find, this was never done before. That's why i'm proud to say that i did succeed in creating such as file, which would be a world first. 

As a result, my professor and I decided to publish the used approach in a journal. Now that is done, i can finally share the program with everyone.

programming,Modern Java Book,"This is a book intended to teach someone the Java language, from scratch. 

You will find that the content makes heavy use of recently released and, for the moment,
preview features. This is intentional as much of the topic ordering doesn't work
without at least Java 21.

Right now I have several key areas where I could use some help:

* Writing Challenges. Most of the early sections have challenges students can do to test
their understanding of the topics covered and for practice. I've shifted my focus away from
these to make more progress on the main content of the book. Any assistance would be appreciated.
* Theming. A lot of the chapters are...bland. Purely technical. I find that when I have the imagination to ""theme"" the subjects they become higher quality and more engaging overall. See
an anime you liked recently and think you can make the math chapters use the characters from it?
Give it a shot!
* Fixing Mechanical Issues. I don't have an editor and I don't often proofread. If you find mechanical errors
in my grammar or find issues with the way topics are ordered I would welcome fixes.

Notably I do not want to open the floodgates for contributions on the main chapter content
just yet. This has the downside of slower progress but the upside of a more coherent result.

My primary goals with this are

* Get the ordering of topics right. By this I mean that every topic covered should have had its prerequisites covered in the topics previous. While ""lesson 1: Inheritance"" is clearly wrong
in this regard, some things are more subtle.
* Be a template for other people. This is a book. Not everyone likes books, some like youtube videos, some like over priced udemy courses, some attend College, etc. Everyone has different learning paths. I hope this to be of use to anyone looking to make a more up to date Java
curriculum and hope that the vague order of things (which I consider superior to the content
produced with the Java of years' past) is carried through.
* Write as if the newest Java wasn't new. It's obvious when a book was written before Java 8
because it always has newer additions with ""addendum: brand new stuff in Java 8."" But 
the order language features were introduced is hardly a good order to teach them. You have
to pretend that Java 23+  has always been *the* Java. Does it really make sense to show terrible
C-style switch statements way before switch expressions?
* Write as if the words Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, etc. didn't exist.
While I understand that these all have definitions and are useful concepts to know about, introducing them early seems to lead to either dogma, rejection of said dogma, or some
mix thereof. None of them are actually needed to understand the mechanics of and motivation
behind what we would call ""object oriented"" or ""functional"" techniques. They certainly don't
work as justification for adding getters and setters to every class.

My immediate short term goal is to get this ""ready to go"" for when anonymous main classes is in a stable Java release. Thats the point at which we could start to:

1. Have actual students go through it without also needing to explain the `--enable-preview` mechanism.
2. Use the topic order to build other sorts of non-book resources like videos, curriculums, projects, etc.
3. Convince actual teachers to change from ""objects first"" to something less insane.

If you check out the video and/or docs and share your feedback I would greatly appreciate it. You can also learn how to create Web Sockets, Topics/Subscribers, CRON Jobs, and much more in the docs.

programming,Is copilot a huge security vulnerability?,"It is my understanding that copilot sends all files from your codebase to the cloud in order to process them‚Ä¶

I checked docs and with copilot chat itself and there is no way to have a configuration file, local or global, to instruct copilot to not read files, like a .gitignore

So, in the case that you retain untracked files like a .env that populates environment variables, when opening it, copilot will send this file to the cloud exposing your development credentials.

The same issue can arise if you accidentally open ‚Äúad-hoc‚Äù a file to edit it with vsc, like say your ssh config‚Ä¶

Copilot offers exclusions via a configuration on the repository on github https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/setting-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization/excluding-content-from-github-copilot

That‚Äôs quite unwieldy and practically useless when it comes to opening ad-hoc, out of project files for editing.

Please don‚Äôt make this a debate about storing secrets on a project, it‚Äôs a beaten down topic and out of scope of this post.

The real question is how could such an omission exist and such a huge security vulnerability introduced by Microsoft?

I would expect some sort of ‚Äúexplicit opt-in‚Äù process for copilot to be allowed to roam on a file, folder or project‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt you?

programming,PR Review Tool - making code reviews way easier (free &amp; open source),"PR Review/description CLI

PR Review Tool - making code reviews way easier üíª‚ú®

Yo dev fam! Just built a CLI tool that does all the boring review stuff and writes up PR descriptions automatically. It uses AI to check out your Git diffs, breaks things down, and gives you a solid review or description. Basically, it‚Äôs saving me from endless code reviews and awkward explanations in team meetings 

It‚Äôs anything new, but is actually helping me in daily basis.

What it does:
- Auto Code Reviews ‚Äì Gives you a quick rundown on issues, best practices, and improvements
- Easy PR Descriptions ‚Äì No more struggling to explain changes; it even makes diagrams üôå
- Three Modes ‚Äì Full review, short summary, or just a quick ‚Äúthis is what‚Äôs up‚Äù option
- Clean Diff View ‚Äì Organizes changes by file so you don‚Äôt get lost in the details
- Logs Everything ‚Äì So if something goes wrong, you know exactly where to look

To run it, it‚Äôs as simple as:
- pr-reviewer -b feature/your-branch for a basic review
- Or pr-reviewer -b feature/your-branch -m description -t main if you want a detailed PR write-up

Bonus: you can totally customize this as much as you want. The only thing you need is an OpenAI API key, and you're good to go.

Check it out here: pr-reviewer on npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/pr-reviewer
