\- previously, if Plotly received non-pandas input, it would convert it to pandas and then continue

\- now, you can also pass in Polars DataFrame / PyArrow Table / cudf DataFrame and computation will happen natively on the input object without conversion to pandas. If you pass in a DuckDBPyRelation, then after some pruning, it'll convert it to PyArrow Table. This cross-dataframe support is achieved via [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals)

For plots which involve grouping by columns (e.g. \`color='symbol', size='market'\`) then performance is often 2-3x faster when starting with non-pandas inputs. For pandas inputs, performance is about the same as before (it should be backwards-compatible)

datascience,Math Question on logistic regression and boundary classification from Andrew Ngs Coursera course,"I'm following Andrew Ngs Machine Learning specialisation on Coursera, FYI.

If the value of the sigmoid function is greater than 0.5, the classification model would predict y\_hat = 1 or ""true"".

However, when using more complex functions inside of the sigmoid function, e.g. an ellipse:

1 / (1 + e^(-z)) where z = x1^(2)/a^(2)   \+   x2^(2)/b^(2)   \-1

in order to define the classification boundary, Andrew says that the model would predict y\_hat = 1 for points inside of the boundary. However, based on my understanding of the lecture, as long as the threshold is 0.5, and you're predicting y\_hat = 1 for any points where the sigmoid function evaluates to &gt;= 0.5 then it should be points **outside** the boundary.

More specifically, it's proven that g(z) &gt;= 0.5 when z &gt;= 0, therefore if z is an ellipse, g(z) &gt;= 0.5 would imply that x1^(2)/a^(2)   \+   x2^(2)/b^(2) \&gt;= 1, i.e. outside the boundary

  
... At least by my understanding. Can anyboydy shed some light on what I may have missed, or if this is just a mistake in the lecture?

datascience,Is Freelancing as a Data Scientist Even Possible for Beginners?,"Hi everyone,

I’m new to data science and considering freelancing. I’m fine working for as low as $15/hour, so earnings aren’t a big concern for me. I’ve gone through past Reddit posts, but they mostly discuss freelancing from the perspective of income. My main concern is whether freelancing in data science is practical for someone like me, given its unique challenges.

A bit about my background: I’ve completed 3-4 real-world data science projects, not on toy datasets, but actual data (involving data scraping, cleaning, visualization, modeling, deployment, and documentation). I’ve also worked as an intern in the NLP domain.

Some issues I’ve been thinking about:

1. Domain Knowledge and Context: How hard is it to deliver results without deep understanding of a client’s business?


2. Resource Limitations: Do freelancers struggle with accessing data, computing power, or other tools required for advanced projects?


3. Collaboration Needs: Data science often requires working with teams. Can freelancers integrate effectively with cross-functional groups?


4. Iterative and Long-Term Nature: Many projects require ongoing updates and monitoring. Is this feasible for freelancers?


5. Trust and Accountability: How do freelancers convince clients to trust them with sensitive or business-critical work?


6. Client Expectations: Do clients expect too much for too little, especially at low wages?



I’m also open to any tips, advice, or additional concerns beyond these points. Are these challenges solvable for a beginner? Have any of you faced and overcome similar issues? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

datascience,OGI - An Open Source Framework for General Intelligence ,"Dan and I often found ourselves deep in conversation about the future of artificial intelligence, particularly how we could create a system that mimics human cognition. Our discussions revolved around the limitations of current AI models, which often operate in silos and lack the flexibility of human thought. 

From these chats, we conceptualized the **Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework**, which aims to integrate various processing modules that can dynamically adjust based on the task at hand. We drew inspiration from how the human brain processes information—using interconnected modules that specialize in different functions while still working together seamlessly.

Our brainstorming sessions were filled with ideas about creating a more adaptable AI that could handle multiple data types and switch between cognitive processes effortlessly. This collaborative effort not only sparked innovative concepts but also solidified our vision for a more intelligent and reliable AI system.

datascience,Doubts on credit scorecard devlopment ,"So I had a few questions when I was learning about score cards and how how they are made etc, and I came accross a few questions that I would like to discuss on.


1). Why do we have Policy as a critical part of underwriting when Scorecard can technically address all aspects related to credit risk (e.g., if Ag&lt;18 is a decline as per lender policy, we can put a very low score for Age&lt;18 and it would automatically be declined. Hence, Scorecard can cover Policy parameters also.)? Do we really need to have Policy? What purpose does it serve?

2. One lender (a client of a credit bureau) uses Personal Loan scorecard with very high Gini. However, the client experienced very high default rate on low-income customers who had high custom score. Under what circumstance is it possible? Or it is not a possibility?

3. Should Fraud be checked as top of funnel in underwriting or should it be done at the end of the underwriting funnel?


My answers are as follows :-
Ans 1) even if I give a very low score to applicants under 18, it is still possible for that applicant to score high on other parameters and come accross as a good customer contradictory to my policy which states that I have to reject him.

Ans2)I think the answer to this is that the model is overfitting,Maybe the score card when being developed did not have enough data on low income customer so the model is not able to discriminate between the low income and other income levels of customer so it's overfitting when it is validated.

Ans3)fraud must be checked as early as possible so that , fraudulent customers are rejected outright to avoid wasting resourcess on those customers.

This is my take on the questions, I would love to hear yours.

Also if you guys know any resources (books,videos etc) that goes in the detail about scorecard devlopment etc.


Thanks In advance.


Thanks for your replies, I am still having a hard time understanding some of the answers , so I will elaborate a bit more as maybe I didn't frame my questions properly.

Q1) let's say I don't want to provide loans to people in certain regions..let's say a war torn country, but the individuals of the region have a good credit history and they seem to pay back their loans. But I have a policy that says I can't operate in this region , can I not price this risk accordingly in my scorecard?so does this undermine the need for policy.

Q2)For the second question, what I wanted to ask was is as follows  let's say I have built a model with a high gini , but let's say that for a lot of low income individuals for whom my scorecard gave a high custom score , turned out to be defaulters. Is this possible and if so, why does this happen? Was the income relationship too complex to capture? Is my model overfitting? 

Q3)what is the loan underwriting process ? What is fraud risk and credit risk ? As per my understanding fraud risk eventually becomes credit risk , hence checking fraud must be the first thing to do when underwriting.

datascience,Question about setting up training set,"I have a question how how to structure my training set for a churn model. Let’s say I have customers on a subscription based service and at any given time they could cancel their subscription. I want to predict the clients that may go lost in the next month and for that I will use a classification model. Now for my training set, I was thinking of using customer data from the past 12-months. In that twelve months, I will have customers that have churned in that time and customers that have not. Since I am looking to predict churns in the next month, should my training set consist of lost client and non-lost customers in each month for the past twelve month where if a customers has not churned at all in the past year, I would have 12 records for that same customer and the features about that customer as of the given month? Or would I only have one record for the customer that has not churned and remained active and the features for that client would be as of the last month in my twelve month window?

datascience,Help choosing between two job offers,"Hello everyone, I’m a recent graduate (September 2024) with a background in statistics, and I’ve been applying for jobs for the past three months. After countless applications and rejections, I’ve finally received two offers but seeing my luck they came two days apart, and I’m unsure which to choose.

1/ AI Engineer (Fully Remote): This role focuses on building large language models (LLMs). It's more of a technical role.

2/ Marketing Scientist (Office-based): This involves applying data analytics to marketing-related problems focusing on regression models. It's more of a client facing role.

While my background is in statistics, I’ve done several internships and projects in data science. I’m leaning toward the AI engineer role mainly because the title and experience seem to offer better future growth opportunities. However, I’m concerned about the fully remote aspect because i'm young and value in-person interactions, like building relationships with colleagues and being part of a workplace community.

Does anyone have experience in similar roles or faced a similar dilemma? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!


EDIT: I don’t understand the downvotes I’m getting when I’m just asking for advice from experienced people as I try to land my first job in a field I’m passionate about. 
For context, I’m not US-based, so I hope that clarifies some things.

datascience,"Does anyone function more as a ""applied scientist"" but have no research background?","**TLDR: DS profile is shifting to be more ML heavy, but lack research experience to compete with ML specialists.**

I've been a DS for several years, mostly in jack-of-all-trades functions: large-scale pipeline building, ad-hoc/bespoke statistical modeling for various stakeholders, ML applications, etc. More recently, I've started on a lot more GenAI/LLM work alongside applied scientists. Leaving aside the negativity on LLM hype, most of the AS folks have heavy research backgrounds: either PhDs or publications, attendance at conferences like ICLR, CVPR, NeurIPS, etc. I don't have any research experience except for a short stint in a lab during grad school but was never published. Luckily my AS peers have treated me as their own, which is good from credibility perspective.

That said, when I look at the market, DS jobs are either heavy on product analytics (hypothesis testing, experimentation, product sense, etc.) or DA/BI (dashboards, reporting, vis, etc.). The ones that are ML-heavier generally want much more research experience and involvement. I can explain the theory behind transformers, attention, decoders vs. encoders, etc. but I have zero publications and wouldn't stand a chance against people with much deeper ML research experience.

I guess what I'm looking for is an applied/ML scientist-adjacent role, but still gives opportunity to flex to occasionally support other functions, like TPM'ing, DE, MLOps, etc. Aside from startups, there doesn't seem to be much out there.

Its a one click tool to generate a PowerPoint/PDF presentation from a CSV file with no prompts or any other input required. Some AI is used alongside manually written logic and functions to create a presentation showing visualisations and insights with machine learning.

It can carry out data transformations, like converting from long to wide, resampling the data and dealing with missing values. The logic is fairly basic for now, but I plan on improving this over time.

My main target users are data scientists who want to quickly have a look at some data and get a feel for what it contains (a super version of pandas profiling), and quickly create some slides to present. Also non-technical users with datasets who want to better understand them and don't have access to a data scientist.

The tool is still under development, so may have some bugs and there lots of features I want to add. But I wanted to get some initial thoughts/feedback. Is it something you would use? What features would you like to see added? Would it be useful for others in your company?

datascience,How do you mange the full DS/ML lifecycle ?,"Hi guys! I’ve been pondering with a specific question/idea that I would like to pose as a discussion, it concerns the idea of more quickly going from idea to production with regards to ML/AI apps.

My experience in building ML apps and whilst talking to friends and colleagues has been something along the lines of you get data, that tends to be really crappy, so you spend about 80% of your time cleaning this, performing EDA, then some feature engineering including dimension reduction etc. All this mostly in notebooks using various packages depending on the goal. During this phase there are couple of tools that one tends to use to manage and version data e.g DVC etc

Thereafter one typically connects an experiment tracker such as MLFlow when conducting model building for various metric evaluations. Then once consensus has been reached on the optimal model, the Jupyter Notebook code usually has to be converted to pure python code and wrapped around some API or other means of serving the model. Then there is a whole operational component with various tools to ensure the model gets to production and amongst a couple of things it’s monitored for various data and model drift.

Now the ecosystem is full of tools for various stages of this lifecycle which is great but can prove challenging to **operationalize** and as we all know sometimes the results we get when adopting ML can be supar :(

I’ve been playing around with various platforms that have the ability for an end-to-end flow from cloud provider platforms such as AWS SageMaker, Vertex , Azure ML. Popular opensource frameworks like MetaFlow and even tried DagsHub. With the cloud providers it always feels like a jungle, clunky and sometimes overkill e.g maintenance. Furthermore when asking for platforms or tools that can really help one explore, test and investigate without too much setup it just feels lacking, as people tend to recommend tools that are great but only have one part of the puzzle. The best I have found so far is Lightning AI, although when it came to experiment tracking it was lacking.

So I’ve been playing with the idea of a truly out-of-the-box end-to-end platform, the idea is not to to re-invent the wheel but combine many of the good tools in an end-to-end flow powered by collaborative AI agents to help speed up the workflow across the ML lifecycle for faster prototyping and iterations.

datascience,What’s the correct nonnulls % threshold to “save the column”? Regression model.,"I have a dataset that has many columns with nans, some with 97% non nulls, all continuous. I am using a regression model to fill nans with data from all other columns (obviously have to only use rows that don’t contain nan). I am happy to do this where non nulls range from 90-99%.

However, some features have just above half as non nulls. It ranges ie 51.99% - 61.58%. 

Originally I was going to just delete these columns as the data is so sparse. But now I am questioning myself, as I’d like to make my process here perfect.

If one has only 15% non nulls, let’s say, using a regression model to predict the remaining 85% seems unreasonable. But at 80-20 it seems fine. So my question: at what level can one still impute missing values to a column that is sparse?

datascience, The Multi-Modal Revolution: Push The Envelope,"Fellow AI researchers - let's be real. We're stuck in a rut.

**Problems:**
- Single modality is dead. Real intelligence isn't just text/image/audio in isolation
- Another day, another LLM with 0.1% better benchmarks. Yawn
- Where's the novel architecture? All I see is parameter tuning
- Transfer learning still sucks
- Real-time adaptation? More like real-time hallucination

**The Challenge:**
1. Build systems that handle 3+ modalities in real-time. No more stitching modules together
2. Create models that learn from raw sensory input without massive pre-training
3. Push beyond transformers. What's the next paradigm shift?
4. Make models that can actually explain cross-modal reasoning
5. Solve spatial reasoning without brute force

**Bonus Points:**
- Few-shot learning that actually works
- Sublinear scaling with task complexity
- Physical world interaction that isn't a joke

Stop celebrating incremental gains. Start building revolutionary systems.

Share your projects below. Let's make AI development exciting again.

datascience,Question on going straight from undergrad -&gt; masters,"I am a undergraduate at ucla majoring in statistics and data science. In September, I began applying to jobs and internships, primarily for this summer after I graduate. 

However, I’m also considering applying to a handful of online masters programs (ranging from applied statistics, to data science, to analytics).

My reasoning is that:

a) I can keep my options open. Assuming I’m unable to land an internship or job, I would have a masters program for fall 2025 to attend. 

b) During an online masters I can continue applying to jobs and internships. I can decide whether I am a full time or part time student. If full time, most programs can be done in 12 months.

c) I feel like there’s no better time than now to get a masters. It’s hard to break into the field with a bachelors as is (or that’s how it seems to me) so an MS would make it easier. There’s also no job tying me down. 

d) I am not sure whether I wish to pursue a PhD. A masters would be good preparation for one if I do decide to do one. 

The main program I have been looking at is OMSA at Georgia Tech.

datascience,Non-Data Science Teams Going It Alone on DS Projects - what to do?,"My organization's DS shop is relatively small and lives entirely in the Analytics department. With myself, and my manager, being the only ones with the experience to take on DS oriented work.  Other teams have a growing appetite for DS solutions (running experiments, building predictive models, etc.) giving us some justification to grow our team. Overall, this is a positive development compared to a few years ago when much of this work was done through vendors/consultants.

However, we have noticed that some teams appear to be employing their own DS solution without any initial input from us. In some cases we have been pinged asking for guidance (like asking for a Power analysis or a more complicated Data pull), but in other cases we are brought on when something has gone wrong (like poorly randomized A/B testing or inability to conduct significance testing). My boss hasn't really pushed back on any of this opting to take a a wait and see approach as we ramp up our team; however, I am concerned this will lead to either a fractured DS culture or worse a shift of responsibility to another team. One thing I saw recently was one of these teams recruiting for a Sr. Data Scientist in all but title.

Personally, this is also a concern for me as it limits my ability to advance into a more Senior position. It also leaves our team leaving credit on the table. We are critical to these projects, but none of them have our ""label"" on it.

Is my boss right to take a reactive approach as we ramp up or is this a sign of a future inefficient Data Science culture at my org?

**Update**: My takeaway from this is to stick with my manager's plan to wait and see, try to push for a formalization of our team as the ""center of excellence"" team, and then flag/highlight DS's contribution/work vs the DS work adjacent teams are doing.

We are part of the business, and the data scientists have different expertises besides statistics etc., for example data engineering, DevOps, web development, but also more soft skills such as presenting and networking.
Not unimportantly: data is available, and there a opportunities to get more data available if needed (e.g. automated extract from systems for easy use in other work)

Currently many of the dashboarding requests were dropped om the DS plate, but i want to push that workload go the business analists to make room for more interesting (and valuable) DS projects.

datascience,I built a full stack ai app as a Data scientist - Is Future Data science going to just be Full stack engineering?,"I recently built a SaaS web app that combines several AI capabilities: story generation using LLMs, image generation for each scene, and voice-over creation - all combined into a final video with subtitles. 

While this is technically an AI/Data Science project, building it required significant full-stack engineering skills. The tech stack includes: 

\- Frontend: Nextjs with Tailwind, shadcn, redux toolkit 

\- Backend: Django (DRF) 

\- Database: Postgres

  
After years in the field, I'm seeing Data Science and Software Engineering increasingly overlap. Companies like AWS already expect their developers to own products end-to-end. For modern AI projects like this one, you simply need both skill sets to deliver value.

The reality is, Data Scientists need to expand beyond just models and notebooks. Understanding API development, UI/UX principles, and web development isn't optional anymore - it's becoming a core part of delivering AI solutions at scale.

Some on this subreddit have gone ahead and called Data Scientists 'Cheap Software Engineers' - but the truth is, we're evolving into specialized full-stack developers who can build end-to-end AI products, not just write models in notebooks. That's where the value is at for most companies.

This is not to say that this is true for all companies, but for a good number, yes.

datascience,Am I only one who is experiencing weird things in this job market?,"Is the job market currently such an ""employer's market"" that it justifies treating candidates this poorly? Could you provide some insights into why these situations might have occurred?

1. **Company A**: I made it to the final round, and the hiring manager explicitly said I was their top candidate, mentioning that my background fit their needs perfectly. My take-home assignment was positively reviewed, especially since I went above and beyond the requirements. The final interview also went well, and I was told to expect a decision within two weeks unless delays arose. However, after three weeks of no communication, I reached out to the hiring manager (my main contact), but received no reply. While I can understand if they chose another candidate, I didn’t anticipate being ghosted, particularly after what I thought was a strong rapport with the hiring manager. When I checked LinkedIn, I saw that the job posting was closed, but the position wasn’t filled. I wonder if the headcount was canceled.
2. **Company B**: I reached the final round for an internship with a full-time conversion potential. I met with the hiring manager in the first round and other team members in the second, both 30-minute conversations without technical questions, which surprised me. They mentioned I'd hear back within a week, but I only received a rejection two weeks later after reaching out myself. I later found a job post to hire an ""entry-level"" FTE with five years of experience instead. Initially, I applied for their senior data scientist role due to my doctoral background, so I’m left wondering if they were seeking someone with senior experience but at an entry-level salary.
3. **Company C**: I was contacted by a recruiter to complete a take-home assignment that felt more aligned with data analyst responsibilities. Despite my effort and confidence in the result, I was informed I wasn’t selected, with no feedback provided. I noticed the job posting was removed just after I received her email. I’m unsure if I was a late applicant or if the headcount for the role was cut.

He also summarizes bluntly in a footnote why the issue might not be exclusively on the stakeholder's side:
""If you are reading this and find yourself skeptical that your data scientist who spends his time dutifully responding to Jira tickets is capable of coming up with a good business idea, you are likely not wrong. Those comfortable taking tickets are probably not innovators or have been so inculcated to a support role that they have lost the will to innovate""

datascience,The coding issues data teams encounter are truly intriguing,"Hi, over the past 9 months, we have been working on Upsonic and have obtained some outputs from the discussions we've had. I would like to share these with you as well. If there are any points you disagree with, please feel free to write them down, I would be very happy about that🙏🏻

We conducted more than 300 interviews with data teams. During these conversations, we noticed that across different projects, around 30-40% of the code in their notebooks is repetitive and reusable.

The development-related problems of data teams are not clearly understood, and the problems also vary by location. It's like they are in a fog, and it's very hard to find a solution. We discovered these 3 main reasons for this problem in data teams:

1- The product for data teams is the output they get from the data, not the code. But in development, code is the product. There are best practices in the coding world, so if you are writing code, you need to adhere to these best practices as much as possible, regardless of your purpose. However, these practices and tools are developed for developers. That's why data teams struggle with using these tools in their development processes. Moreover, these tools are not compatible enough, and not everyone in the team is equally proficient with them.

2- While doing data exploration in Jupyter, they can't directly push the code to Git to share it. There is a diff issue between Git and Python/Jupyter. That's why they struggle with collaborative work.

3- Data scientists have many reusable components and things they can share, but the individual work culture affects the collaborative work culture. The same things are repeatedly done for the company.



After discovering these problems and their reasons, we built a function hub to facilitate collaborative work. We provide 3 key features that data teams need:

1- We allow teams to share their functions with teammates with a single command from within their notebooks. Other team members can pull the same function with a single command. 

2- We document everything that is pushed to the function hub, including the functions, commits, and release notes, so teams can understand each other's code. 

3- We use AI to read Jupyter files, find the reusable components, and send them to the platform. This way, even if the code quality is low, it can be refactored into a function and made available for the team to use.

Since there is no one with extensive DS experience in our team, we conducted 300 interviews. We are still continuing our research. I would love to hear your feedback.

Hi all,

I'll soon be joining a team of data scientists at our parent company. I've had lots of contact with my future team, so I know what they're going through. The company is not tech (insurance), but is building a portfolio of data scientists. Despite skill and the potential existing in the team, the company keeps hiring consultants to come in and build solutions while ignoring their employees' opinions and project proposals. Some of these contractors are good, some laughably bad.

External developers and DS are given lots of leeway and trust. They can build in whatever tech stack they propose while ignoring any and all process and our eng team then has to pick up the pieces.

Our teams are often criticized for not delivering quickly enough, while contractors are said to iterate rapidly. I work in an industry with *a lot* of red tape. These contractors are often allowed to circumvent this. In turn, the internal DS team cannot gather enough experience to compete.

Hey everyone,

I(F23), am a master's student who recently designed a makeup recommender system. I created the Luxxify Makeup Recommender to generate personalized product suggestions tailored to individual profiles based on skin tone, type, age, makeup coverage preference, and specific skin concerns. The recommendation system uses a RandomForest with Linear Programming, trained on a custom dataset I gathered using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4. The project is deployed on a scalable Streamlit app.

Custom Created Dataset via WebScraping: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zarasarkar/makeup-insights-customer-reviews/data)

Feel free to use the dataset I created for your own projects!

# Technical Details

* **Web Scraping:** Product and review data are scraped from [Ulta](https://www.ulta.com/), which is a popular e-commerce site for cosmetics. This raw data serves as the foundation for a robust recommendation engine, with a custom scraper built using requests, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup4. Selenium was used to perform button click and scroll interactions on the Ulta site to dynamically load data. I then used requests to access specific URLs from XHR GET requests. Finally, I used BeautifulSoup4 for scraping static text data.
* **Leveraging PostgreSQL UDFs For Feature Extraction**: For data management, I chose [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for its scalability and efficient storage capabilities. This allowed me to leverage Postgres querying to unroll complex JSON data. I also coded Python PostgreSQL UDFs to make feature engineering more scalable. I cached the computed word embedding vectors to speed up similarity calculations for repeated queries.
* **NLP and Feature Engineering:** I extracted Key features using Word2Vec word embeddings from Reddit makeup discussions (https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/). I did this to incorporate makeup domain knowledge directly into the model. Another reason I did this is to avoid using LLM models which are very expensive. I compared the text to pre-selected phrases using cosine distance. For example, I have one feature that compares reviews and products to the phrase ""glowy dewey skin"". This is a useful feature for makeup recommendation because it indicates that a customer may want products that have moisturizing properties. This allowed me to tap into consumer insights and user preferences across various demographics, focusing on features highly relevant to makeup selection.

These are my feature importances. To select this features, I performed a manual management along with stepwise selection. The features that contain the \_review suffix are all from consumer reviews. The remaining features are from the product details.

[Graph of Feature Importances](https://preview.redd.it/9zblqwmz8b0e1.png?width=2036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61ee1d186f9e53f209e010d107caa12b442d616f)

* **Cross Validation and Sampling:** I employed a Random Forest model because it's a good all-around model, though I might re-visit this. Any other model suggestions are welcome!! Due to the class imbalance with many reviews being five-stars, I utilized a mixed over-sampling and under-sampling strategy to balance class diversity. This allowed me to improve F1 scores across different product categories, especially those with lower initial representation. I also randomly sampled mutually exclusive product sets for train/test splits. This helped me avoid data leakage.
* **Linear Programming for Constraints:** I used linear programming (OrTools) to add budget and category level constraints. This allowed me to add a rule based layer on top of the RandomForest. I included domain knowledge based rules to help with product category selection.

# Future Improvements

* **Enhanced NLP Features:** I want to experiment with more advanced NLP models like BERT or other transformers to capture deeper insights from beauty reviews. I am currently using bag-of-words for everything.
* **User Feedback Integration:** I want to allow users to rate recommendations, creating a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.
* **Add Causal Discrete Choice Model:** I also want to add a causal discrete choice model to capture choices across the competitive landscape and causally determine why customers select certain products. I am thinking about using a nested logit model and ensemble it with our existing model. I think nested logit will help with products being in a hierarchy due to their categorization. It also lets me account for implied based a consumer choosing not to buy a specific product. I would love suggestions on this!!
* **Implement Computer Vision Based Features:** I want to extract CV based features from image and video review data. This will allow me to extract more fine grained demographic information.

datascience,Switching to better company as a working DS,"I have been working in a consultancy as a data scientist for over a year now. Working mostly with structured data and classical ML algorithms.

datascience,Is a Data Science or Stats Master's worth it with 2 YOE as a Data Scientist?,"Hello everyone! I am a 22 years old Data Scientist and recently graduated with my B.S in Data Science from a lesser-known state school. My job has been going pretty well, I find the work interesting although I am mostly doing data analysis tasks rather than ML/DS, and I make a comfortable salary in a HCOL city. I'm not sure if I want to be a Data Scientist forever, but recently I have been thinking more about my career path/future plans.

My parents also work in tech (program manager and software developer) and have been pressuring me about getting a Master's as soon as I got my first job. They claim that it is the new Bachelor's, it is necessary for career progression, and if I don't get one soon I will fall behind in my career. They also want me to start doing some DS certifications to be more competitive for my next job but I'm not sure if this would be a very valuable use of my time or make any meaningful impact.

I’m planning to look for a new job and move closer to my significant other in about two years (Chicago area). At that point, I’m considering starting a Master’s in Applied Stats or Data Science, but I’m not entirely sure if it’s the right move or if my experience will be enough to progress without it.

I’d love to hear from people in similar positions or with experience in the field:

* Is a Master’s truly essential to stay competitive, or can experience and on-the-job learning be enough?
* Have any certifications really helped you stand out or advance in your career?
* Any advice on timing or alternative paths for someone with 2 years of experience in data science?

But I'm getting overwhelmed and confused about what sorts of roles to look for.

A quick google search for ""types of roles in data science"" and you'll find dozens of pages filled with SEO-driven buzzwords (possibly AI-generated), but these only give the most surface-level and generic descriptions of common titles like data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, etc. This isn't really what I'm looking for though lol. I know what these are. Also, so many roles today seem to just be focused on shoving the latest LLM stack (RAG, langchain, etc) into the problem even if the use case for the company is slim or marginal at best. This isn't really what I'm interested in cause I like operations data science more.

What I'm looking for is a more specific, tailored advice relevant to specific types of industries/specializations. For example

* I really like building models that heavily rely on functional programming, and may make use of very niche or specific libraries depending on the use case. I enjoy Project Euler type problems for example
* I understand ML is a core part of data science, but I enjoy projects where ML isn't exclusive to the problem. A lot of other models can be solved by more functional programming and tailored computational science type work
* I guess my background right now is mostly focused on business/operations/economics, so I don't have a specific engineering or hard science background, but I'm open to any area that invovles applied mathematics.

------------

As the title alluded, are there methods and/or processes to do reverse-embedding that perhaps are currently being researched? From the admittedly preliminary internet-sleuthing I did yesterday, it seems to be essentially impossible because of how intractable the inverse-mapping is gonna play out. And on that vein, how it's practically impossible to carry out with the current hardware and setup that we have.

However, perhaps some of you might know some literature that might've gone into that direction, even if at theoretical or rudimentary level and it'd be greatly appreciated if you can point me to those resources. You're also welcome to share your thoughts and theories as well.

Expanding from reverse-embedding, is it possible to go beyond the range of the embedding vectors/tensors so as to reverse-embed said embedding vectors/tensors and then retrieve the resulting text, image, etc. from them?

I know statistics is the bread and butter of DS, but damn is this shit boring. It’s surprising because this professor manages to teach statistics without using real world examples. And on top of that we have to use R and R markdown which is annoying and useless af and when I asked my professor he was like “I can’t help you with that”.

datascience,Sharing my experience,"Hey all. I'm a bit stuck in my career because I made some bad assumptions early on, and also been quite lazy. I'd love to share my experience and get some advice on how to proceed further.

My background: I'm 27, from a small Eastern Europe country, 6 yoe, working in a local FAANG at the moment, been really good at math in school, won many local contests, and went to a place where many of my colleagues continued to MIT/Oxford/etc. abroad, but I chose to stay home because of family issues, lack of money, and lack of courage. My expectation was that if I self study a lot and get really really good in terms of skill, after working locally for some years, I would be able to find a good position abroad. That was an extremely bad assumption.

The first reason is that I did not even begin to fathom how bad the work environment would be around here. Well, across my yoe I mostly did my entire work in a few hours each week and focused a lot on studying and personal projects the rest of the time.

The second reason is that my experience here does not count at all when applying abroad. When entering the FAANG some time ago, they gave me an intern project, while I was a senior in my previous job... and they treated me like training a linear regression is completely outside of my skillset, while having experience with much more complex models and having implemented l.r. in C from scratch for fun in the past... When applying to thousands of jobs abroad I got zero callbacks (before the faang stamp).

I did come up with prototypes, presented at internal conferences within the FAANG, but they refuse to help me publish externally because I don't have a PhD and because papers don't come from eastern europe... And mostly because I don't keep my head down like the rest of my colleagues who behave as if US folks are superior.

When working with a German startup, I was invited to come there for a few weeks and work together. They kept saying that they don't have much money, and when I said that's fine, I just want to build something together and be treated as an equal, they looked at me like I was insane. They expected to pay me scrap and didn't even know that the economy in my country was quite similar to the German one on the programming side.

I got around 5 total research projects that can be turned into publications, done at various companies.

I really want to move west now, and into a research oriented role, as the engineering side does not appeal to me that much anymore (except as a tool for research), but I don't know how to do that, as I'm completely ghosted by all applications I make.

My options would be:

Write papers on all previous projects I did, then send them across the world to top journals and PhD programs

Message hundreds of professors/researchers in look of a mentor

Message people in my local FAANG and try looking for mentorship / publishing opportunity

datascience,Data Science vs. the Interruption Culture,"I really enjoy modeling and visualizations.   Hell, even data cleaning can be kind of satisfying.   I'm a little sad how little time I get to focus on what I do best.

I know everybody reading this probably gets a hundred emails a day, and spends more time in meetings than they'd like.   The last year dramatically accelerated for me for a several reasons.  First, my main project has attracted a lot of attention, all the way up to the CIO, and now five levels of management wants regular updates, and wants to tinker with things like variable importance.  Second, I'm having to work with the sales department, who have a pretty toxic culture, and, like management, think of time in small chunks.   DS requires good chunks of focused time, and has longer term goals, and it doesn't work well with people who expect immediate responses to short-term ""emergencies"".   Finally, Microsoft Teams has been widely adopted throughout the company, so I have to listen to that PING! from messages dozens of times an hour.

Her are some of my tricks in dealing with this, and hope others will share theirs:

\*) You don't have to go to every meeting you get invited to.  My calendar accelerated this year, and I sometimes have as many as three simultaneous meetings.  There's one guy who schedules these pointless meetings for as long as 9 hours.  Yes, I'm not kidding.  Now that it's literally impossible for me to go to every meeting.....people will think I'm at  different meetings, when I'm really getting actual work done.

\*) Schedule made-up meetings.  The worst offenders don't care whether I already have something down, but I'll regularly put two hour ""status update"" meetings for my team where we can get work done and Outlook will say we're unavailable.

\*) I just ignore demands for ""status reports"" and ""a few slides"" from people who aren't in my immediate chain of command.

\*) Divvy up the nonsense.   Most meetings invite my entire team.   Take a few minutes in the morning and decide, if anybody goes, who that one person is who has to waste their time.

\*) PowerPoint is a pox upon the working man, and has become the end product for some people.   When a deck gets to a certain point, nobody knows what's in it, so don't contribute.  The main deck for my project is now at 177 slides.

\*) Presenting any results with anything more complicated than a lift chart is asking for trouble.  Explaining variable importance is asking for trouble.    When describing data, use percentages or rough figures (\~1.1m instead of a specific) because there are people who literally add up numbers and want to know why the figures on slide 68 don't match the ones on slide 47.

\*) Finally, turn down the volume on your computer.   It's WAY less stressful if you don't get that ""ping"" dozens of times an hour.  I also sometimes ""attend"" meetings by putting the Zoom on the little monitor, and keeping the volume off until I see a slide that looks like it might related to what I'm working on.

datascience,Announcing Plotlars 0.7.1: We’re Back with Deep Refactoring and Exciting New Features! 🦀✨📊,"Hello Data Scientists!

After a long hiatus, I’m thrilled to announce that **Plotlars 0.7.1** is now released!

I’ve resumed the project with a deep refactoring. I believe Rust can be a great candidate for data science, but we have a long journey ahead to achieve it. This crate aims to reduce the complexity when making plots, making data visualization in Rust more accessible and straightforward.

🚀 New Features

1. **Heat Maps**: We’ve added support for heat maps, enabling you to create color-coded representations of data matrices. Heat maps are perfect for visualizing data density, correlations, and patterns across two dimensions, making it easier to identify trends and anomalies in your datasets.
2. **Scatter 3D Plots**: Introducing 3D scatter plots to Plotlars! Now you can visualize your data in three dimensions, providing a new perspective on relationships and clusters within your data. Rotate and zoom into your plots for an immersive data exploration experience.

A huge thank you to all of you for your continued support, contributions, and feedback. Your enthusiasm drives this project forward.

Explore the [updated documentation](https://docs.rs/plotlars/0.7.1) and head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alceal/plotlars) to see the new features in action. If you enjoy using Plotlars, **consider leaving a star ⭐️ on GitHub to help others discover the project** and support its ongoing development.

  
**This project is a breakthrough that’s set to transform the field – share it to be part of the change!**

datascience,Long-term Forecasting Bias in Prophet Model,"Hi everyone,

I’m using Prophet for a time series model to forecast sales. The model performs really well for short-term forecasts, but as the forecast horizon extends, it consistently underestimates. Essentially, the bias becomes increasingly negative as the forecast horizon grows, which means residuals get more negative over time.

What I’ve Tried:
I’ve already tuned the main Prophet parameters, and while this has slightly adjusted the degree of underestimation, the overall pattern persists.

My Perspective:
In theory, I feel the model should “learn” from these long-term errors and self-correct. I’ve thought about modeling the residuals and applying a regression adjustment to the forecasts, but it feels like a workaround rather than an elegant solution. Another thought was using an ensemble boosting approach, where a secondary model learns from the residuals of the first. However, I’m concerned this may impact interpretability, which is one of Prophet’s strong suits and a key requirement for this project.

Would anyone have insights on how to better handle this? Or any suggestions on best practices to approach long-term bias correction in Prophet without losing interpretability?

datascience,How do you handle version control at a high level?,"I do a lot of project-oriented work, and I've been thinking about how to make my repo structures work better for me. I'm curious what others do and in what contexts.

For me, it goes something like this:

1. Academic projects. These are the easiest. It's generally one repo per paper, and then I have some infrastructure projects (e.g., packages, persistent datasets) that have their own.
1. Consulting. This is probably the most challenging area, in part because it's a smaller side thing. In a typical engagement, I'll have datasets, prototypes (Python and R), exploratory work (notebooks), deliverables (notebooks or quarto docs; and then usually with a pile of supporting data and outputs), slides, and internal docs (meeting notes, timesheets, invoices). They can last years, and I would often have multiple devcontainer setups, sometimes Python and R but more often creating ones with newer package versions over time.

I've generally used smaller repos, but it becomes a hassle to manage all of them, and be sure I'm in the right one. I know that monorepos are popular in some settings, though I don't have experience with them.

In case it matters, I do very nearly everything in VS Code and in devcontainers, so I can have easy portability across computers.",jkiley,1gjh3w6,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gjh3w6/how_do_you_handle_version_control_at_a_high_level/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gjh3w6/how_do_you_handle_version_control_at_a_high_level/,2024-11-04 15:35:32,28,0.98,28,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gjh3w6

datascience,Rio: WebApps in pure Python – A fresh Layouting System,"Hey everyone!

We received a lot of encouraging feedback from you and used it to improve our framework. For all who are not familiar with our framework, Rio is an easy-to-use framework for creating websites and apps which is based entirely on Python.

From all the feedback the most common question we've encountered is, ""How does Rio actually work?"" Last time we shared our concept about components (what are components, how does observing attributes, diffing, and reconciliation work).

Now we want to share our concept of our own fresh layouting system for Rio. In our wiki we share our thoughts on:

* What Makes a Great Layout System
* Our system in Rio with a 2-step-approach
* Limitations of our approach

Feel free to check out our Wiki on our [Layouting System](https://github.com/rio-labs/rio/wiki/Layouting-System).

Take a look at our playground, where you can try out our layout concept firsthand with just a click and receive real-time feedback: [Rio - Layouting Quickstart](https://rio.dev/docs/howto/layout-guide)

datascience,NVIDIA launched cuGraph : Enabling GPU for Graph Analytics with zero code changes,"Extending the cuGraph RAPIDS library for GPU, NVIDIA has recently launched the cuGraph backend for NetworkX (nx-cugraph), enabling GPUs for NetworkX with zero code change and achieving acceleration ***up to 500x for NetworkX CPU implementation***. Talking about some salient features of the cuGraph backend for NetworkX:

* **GPU Acceleration**: From up to 50x to 500x faster graph analytics using NVIDIA GPUs vs. NetworkX on CPU, depending on the algorithm.
* **Zero code change**: NetworkX code does not need to change, simply enable the cuGraph backend for NetworkX to run with GPU acceleration.
* **Scalability**:  GPU acceleration allows NetworkX to scale to graphs much larger than 100k nodes and 1M edges without the performance degradation associated with NetworkX on CPU.
* **Rich Algorithm Library**: Includes community detection, shortest path, and centrality algorithms (about 60 graph algorithms supported)

You can try the cuGraph backend for NetworkX on Google Colab as well. Checkout this beginner-friendly notebook for more details and some examples:

datascience,Inference on Java - DL4J vs DJL,"Hello there!  
  
After a lot of discussions with the engineering team at my company, we have decided to use Java for inference. We have models trained with TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and MLX. The chosen Java framework candidates are [DeepLearning4J (DL4J)](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j) and [DeepJavaLibrary (DJL)](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl).

**DL4J:**

* Direct support for TensorFlow/Keras models.
* Support for PyTorch models when exporting to ONNX.
* Many forks and stars on GitHub.

**DJL:**

* Direct support for TensorFlow/Keras models.
* Direct support for TorchScript.
* Developed by the AWS team.
* Engine-agnostic, which could mean potential support for MLX in the future.
* Seems to be less commonly used in the industry.

Has anyone tested either of these frameworks (or both)? Any recommendations?

datascience,"Taking my first steps on recommender systems, would love some thoughts on the following","Hey guys,

Just for full disclosure, I know *very* little of recommender systems (RS) and I want to try my hands at them, and learn more from these technologies. The issue is that, from the little I have read so far, it seems that, more or less, all the approaches I've read about so far, they all rely on having *some* form of info on the interactions of users with the products to recommend. This is intuitive and I understand why, but I run into a problem quite quickly: how do I go about recommending items for *new* users based on what users similar to them like? I am not talking about ""similar"" in the sense of tastes for the product (which would mean the user is not new and I have already collected data on what these users have bought or read, for example), but similar in terms of other attributes (e.g. demographics, or shops at other stores).

My situation is as follows: 

- I have data for millions of users, and have access to demographic attributes (e.g. gender, age) and also to their shopping baskets at Store A. 

- I want to create a recommender system for new users walking into Store B, with products you have in store B (that I know for a fact that are not part of Store A, so item-item collaboration is out of the question for the moment), for which I have little to no info because that's their situation: they're new to Store B.

My first instinct is to create a clustering algorithm that creates some personas for members using the demographics and shopping behaviour for Store A, and then depending on where the new users fall into cluster-wise I can recommend products from Store B that popular within the cluster (from info from the older users).

The only issue with that approach is that I am not sure where it falls within the spectrum of algorithms from libraries such as `scikit-surprise`, and I am therefore not sure if it will behave as a ""recommender system"" so to speak.

Do you guys have any thoughts you could spare on this situation?

datascience,How does a random forest make predictions on “unseen” data ,"I think I have a fairly solid grasp now of what a random forest is and how it works in practice, but I am still unsure as to exactly how a random forest makes predictions on data it hasn’t seen before. Let me explain what I mean.

When you fit something like a logistic regression model, you train/fit it (I.e. find the model coefficients which minimise prediction error) on some data, and evaluate how that model performs *using* those coefficients on unseen data.

When you do this for a decision tree, a similar logic applies, except instead of finding coefficients, you’re finding “splits” which likewise minimise some error. You could then evaluate the performance of this tree “using” those splits on unseen data. 

Now, a random forest is a collection of decision trees, and each tree is trained on a bootstrapped sample of the data with a random set of predictors considered at the splits. Say you want to train 1000 trees for your forest. Sampling dictates a scenario where for a single datapoint (row of data), you could have it appear in 300/1000 trees. And for 297/300 of those trees, it predicts (1), and for the other 3/300 it predicts (0). So the overall prediction would be a 1. Same logic follows for a regression problem except it’d be taking the arithmetic mean.

But what I can’t grasp is how you’d then use this to predict on unseen data? What are the values I obtained from fitting the random forest model, I.e. what splits is the random forest using? Is it some sort of average split of all the trees trained during the model? 

Or, am I missing the point? I.e. is a new data point actually put through all 1000 trees of the forest?",JLane1996,1ghc7xh,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ghc7xh/how_does_a_random_forest_make_predictions_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ghc7xh/how_does_a_random_forest_make_predictions_on/,2024-11-01 18:24:08,62,0.9,62,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,ML,self,t3_1ghc7xh

The good part is that my manager wants to improve the DS workflow. The devops team also want to improve the implementations and they are quite collaborating. The issue are the product owners. 

I recently did a task for one of them. This was to update one of their models. The model lacked a proper technical document, half-ass code on git (just a model dump on s3), even the labels were partly incorrect, no performance monitoring, ... You just guess the rest. 

After working on it for a few weeks, I realized that the product owner only expects a document as my efforts outcome.

datascience,You do pricing using....,"Hi guys, recently I've been collaborating on automated pricing, we built a model based on demand elasticity for e-commerce products, all statistical methods, even the price elasticity of demand function is assuming a linear relationship between demand and margins.

So far, it's doing ""good"" but not ""good enough"".

The thing is here, the elasticity is considering the trendline of the product alone, which is not the case, what if that product was a complement to another product/s or if it was a substitute?

I managed to tackle that partially with cross-elasticity, it did give good estimations, but still..

There's too much room for improvement, my manager is planning on converting a lot of the structure of the model to RL, in the model, we're actually mimicing the behaviour of RL, where there's an achievement function that we're trying to optimize and it works with the estimated PED.
but I find RL really hard to make it practical, And I read in many articles and discussions that this problem many companies tackled with deep learning, because it can exhibit and absorb many complex patterns in the data so I decided to give it a shot and started learning deep learning from a hands-on deep learning book and a youtube course.

Input data: annual US macroeconomic features such as inflation, GDP, wage growth, M2, imports, exports, etc. Features have varying ranges of availability (some going back to 1900 and others starting in the 90s.  

Problem statement: Which method(s) is SOTA for this type of prediction? The recent papers I've read mention BNNs, MAGAN, and LightGBM for smaller data like this and TFT, Prophet, and NeuralProphet for big data. I'm mainly curious if others out there have done something similar and have special insights. My current method of extracting temporal features and using a Trend + Level blend with LightGBM works, but I don't want to be missing out on better ideas--especially ones that fit into a Monte Carlo framework and include something like labeling years into probabilistic 'regimes' of boom/recession.",SwitchFace,1ggi92w,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ggi92w/multistep_multivariate_timeseries_macroeconomic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ggi92w/multistep_multivariate_timeseries_macroeconomic/,2024-10-31 16:11:08,10,0.81,10,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,ML,self,t3_1ggi92w
datascience,Does Sequential Models actually work for Trading?,"Hey there! Does anyone here know if those sequential models like LSTMs and Transformers work for real trading? I know that stock price data usually has low autocorrelation, but I’ve seen DL courses that use that kind of data and get good results.

I am new to time series forecasting and trading, so please forgive my ignorance ",gomezalp,1gg8rh9,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gg8rh9/does_sequential_models_actually_work_for_trading/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gg8rh9/does_sequential_models_actually_work_for_trading/,2024-10-31 07:15:00,19,0.73,19,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,ML,self,t3_1gg8rh9
