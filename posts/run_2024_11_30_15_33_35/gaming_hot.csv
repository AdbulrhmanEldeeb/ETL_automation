The hardest difficulty was the way most games were meant to be played, forcing you to use strategy and actually think about the build of your character. It's also more immersive, adding the feeling of fear and suspense in tense situations. 

Grounded difficulty in The Last of Us Part 1 is the best example in my opinion. It was the most incredible/unforgiving experience I've ever had in a game and something I recommend to everybody who's played the game to give a shot",Bowiescorvat2,1h2iwrw,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h2iwrw/which_hardest_difficulty_was_the_most_fun_to_play/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h2iwrw/which_hardest_difficulty_was_the_most_fun_to_play/,2024-11-29 10:25:47,81,0.78,81,0,255,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h2iwrw

gaming,Buying games on PS5 Pro vs Series X?,"So, one of the main difference of this generation (PS5 Pro apart) was the PS5 controller, and a few games use the specificities of its controller.

A couple of Qs from that:
- Which games use the dual sense feature?
- Do you know any reviewer at least touching on that? Nowadays it’s never really mentioned when a game is available on both platforms for there’s anything specific for the PS controller
- For those of you having the luxury to have both consoles, where do you decide where to buy your games? I’m looking at The Plucky Squire for example, I want to buy it but no idea of the PS5 dualsense adds something to the experience or not, it’s kind of weird really developers don’t really take the time to mention it. Given Xbox tends to be better with back compat and allows for Play Anywhere (thus PC or handheld) it seems safer to buy on that platform, unless I’m missing something.

gaming,Horses no longer gallop in Red Dead Redemption 2,"
Just as the title says, my horses will no longer gallop or even stride at a decent pace.  My horses only trot at the slowest speed, just happened out of nowhere today while playing on my Xbox Series X.  Even horses I steal from NPCs will stop and just walk.  I only just got the game a couple weeks ago, too.  I have tried every possible solution I could come across:

* I fed the horse
* groomed it over and over
* patted the horse
* removed the saddle and put it back on
* rode without a saddle
* switched to different horses at stables
* reloaded the most previous save
* reloaded old saves
* changed controllers
* closed the game and removed it from Quick Resume, waited a minute to relaunch
* did a hard restart on the XSX console
* I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it

All those things and my horse(s) will not move any faster than a walking stride.  This has affected every single horse across all my saves.  I have already put plenty of progress into the game, but now I either have to go without a horse or play at a snail’s pace

gaming,When was the last time a game made your jaw drop in awe?,"I had been running an older PC that was using a 3070ti but unfortunately, the computer had actually been dropped a few feet from my desk during one of my seizures. Still worked fortunately but it had like a weird effect on the graphic card, tried everything from disconnecting it from mobo and reconnecting it making sure it was synchronized correctly. With luck it kept working but when I would try to run games, especially games with more intense graphics you could really notice it so I wouldn't buy new games. Latest game I was playing was deadlock beta but you really noticed it even at the lowest of settings and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

Finally decided it was time to get a new computer so I built myself a new one and gifted it to myself as an early Christmas present (Dec 11) and got it up last week after building it myself. Currently running an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU, 4080 Super GPU, 64gb of memory.

The first game I bought and tried playing was Warhammer 40k Spacemarine 2 and immediately upon loading the initial load video, I was just in awe and my jaw dropped as I couldn't believe it. It felt like I was actually there and even more in-depth than ever before. Reminded me why I loved gaming on a computer so much and what it felt like when it was working in sync perfectly.

 Also, just the progression of Glados as a character and some of the hilarious things she said. Stephen Merchant in the second game, just amazing - and of course, JK Simmons was just so weird and delightful.

For me the winter(holidays) is such a cozy gaming time.  
I always connect the christmas/new years time with a game, for example last year I played through   
The Witcher 3 inlcuding the dlc's for the first time in my life and what a journey it was.   
In 2022 I played Xenoblade Chronicles: DE for the first time, both of these games ended up in my personal top 5 best games of all time.  
Right now I'm finishing Hollow Knight and after that I'll start my 'winter game' and it will be either   
TLoZ: Wind Waker HD or Death Stranding.   
   
Im curious, do you also have such a habit and what will you play this year's christmas season?

gaming,I want to ramble about Vectorman,"Ahoy! One of my absolute favorite games, Vectorman, has just been added to Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about how amazing it is here and maybe convince somebody to give it a shot if they haven't already. 

For many Vectorman is seen as ""that really hard Genesis game with the DKC like graphics"", only known for it's visuals and for people not being able to get past the early stages. It is a very difficult title, one that requires practice to get far in, but it's arguably not as bad as some of the most notorious NES titles on that front. By playing cautiously and learning what makes each level tick you can slowly master it, a process that can be very satisfying.


 It helps that those visuals are such a spectacle. The 90s cgi pre rendered models are not only different from other games but genuinely impressive in their own right beyond comparison to DKC or Ballz 3D. The orb based and mechanical designs are totally distinct and every character moves with a fluidity rarely found on a 16 bit platform. Vectorman himself is possibly the most expressive character on the genesis with tons of unique movements. He comes off as effortlessly cool in much the same way as Master Chief but with even less dialogue. His different transformations happen seamlessly in gameplay. The lighting baked into every stage and how it ""reflects"" on the sprites is stunning to behold. I'd say there are 2d games on cd based consoles that are way less visually impressive. It truly is amazing what they were able to do with the hardware. The variety in locations is also great. A lot of them combine mechanical  and natural with more out there colors and background elements including different weather patterns. The only game that looks even remotely like Vectorman is it's own sequel. The electronic soundtrack is also incredible. 


The game feel, much like and partially dur to the animation, is very fluid. You run, shoot, and platform through stages with a lot of speed but the game rewards precision. You are a big target and most enemies require good aim or multiple shots to take down but you also have rapid fire even with the most basic weapon. You also have a double jump that also doubles as an attack to enemies below you which can sometimes be the key to beating certain bosses and is great for some of the very vertically focused stages. Vectorman may be a big robot but he moves with a lot of grace and momentum and the transformation power ups add variety while increasing the pace even further. There are also a few short gimmick levels where you fight the main boss Warhead in a shift of gameplay style which are confusing at first but quick if you know what you are doing. All of this gives the game a very kinetic flow and smoothness many similar titles lack.



I could continue writing this for probably hours going into a lot more detail about the story, contests (Yes multiple), cheat codes, promo material, speedrun strategies, sequel (multipleish), and more but I want to save that for a potential future project.

It quickly became my favorite controller, but after just two years, it suddenly stopped working. A little digging revealed the culprit: a tiny, hidden fuse that had blown, a clear case of **planned obsolescence**.

Instead of tossing it, I grabbed my soldering iron, bypassed the fuse in about 5 minutes, and gave it new life. Fast forward to today, and this controller is STILL alive!

It has survived thousands of gaming hours, multiple moves, a few accidental drops, and more game rage moments (Yes, it’s been thrown… more than once.) \^\^

So now I want more of that experience, but I'm worried that most CRPGs would bore me as I'm not a fan of D&amp;D and the thing about BG3 that makes me love it so much is the fact that characters are likable, combat is fun, graphics are great, you get those immersive closeups during conversations, and everything is voiced.

I saw some gameplay of a few CRPGs on YT and I noticed they're usually not fully voiced, the graphics are outdated, and there are no closeups on characters during conversations, which makes the game not feel immersive to me.

gaming,What are some of the better purposes for coins and collectables in modern platformers?,"Coins and 1-Ups were a precious commodity in games like the SNES Donkey Kong Country series, but these days many find the whole lives system antiquated, and more demoralizing than it's worth.

So, in a modern context where checkpoints are plentiful and there's no Game Over screen, do you think many games have figured out a strong alternative benefit to coins?

I don't think RPG elements work in something as simple as a platformer, so I tend not to consider them.

Games like Mario Galaxy wanted to keep 1-Ups, tho the game wasn't challenging and the checkpoints were forgiving enough that they made minimal difference.

Mario Odyssey has Skins purchasable with coins which is fine, but less interesting from a mechanics perspective.

Buying Power-Ups could still be fun.

gaming,Lets talk about damage modelling,"Persistent day dream so I'm going to write it down to get it out of my head.

In the genre of combat driving games and mech something that has never quite hit right is damage modelling.

Back on the atari ST I was playing an F1 game and tire wear was modelled and being ""back then"" your imagination filled in the blanks. For some reason that sticks with me.

F16 fighting falcon, again on the Atari ST - getting the bird back with all the warning lights flashing and a broken under carriage. Real sense of achievement.

Fast forward a bit, Mech Warrior 2. Heat management, per limb damage. Seeing mechs with arms missing etc. All good.

Wipe out! Ps1. Speed and weapons! Bounce off things and slow down or boom and respawn. Classic fun.

Rollcage, more of the same but wheels on the ground and you could knock buildings on top of people. That was extra fun.

split second, blur. All had weapons and stuff but the damage modelling was nill. Split second environmental stuff although scripted was cool.

Burnout? no weapons but good deformation

Special shout out to Soldier of fortune 2s ghoul engine and their damage model. Gory as you like with the easter egg that if you get a cross body shot just right intestines would fall out.

Another shout out to Frostbite engine and battlefield building damage.

Mech games, damage is basically red amber green done with soot.

With the crazy amount of cores we all have aren't we ready for deeper damage modelling.

There are physics voxel games (abriss?) that go to the extreme. Of course we cant build games in that engine yet with tiny voxels and individual physics but there is a half way house between full material simulation and red/amber/green.

My ""realistic"" expecation using a mech game as an example;

3 damage layers CC/CH/SK

Core function, chassis, skin.

In essence its just 2 layers of armour over a health bar.

* Core function can keep Red amber green
* Chassis - 4 states - pristine, battered, buckled &amp; failed
* Skin - this is where the visual effort needs to go.

3 types of damage (possibly 4)

Energy, kinetic, explosive (environmental)

Example base weapon damage value distribute across the 3 layer cc/ch/sk

* Energy - various sized soot marks and has to wear through skin first. 5%/10%/85%
* Kinetic - holes in skin, chassis and core. 5%/60%/35%
* Explosive - soot and holes. (possibly just scaled up from the above) 15%/60%/25%
* Environmental - basically same as kinetic but without holes. Crush damage from falling masonry or bumping into a tree. Imagine an urban setting where you get staggered in to a building and it collapses on you.

Seeing games like borderlands with crazy amounts of gun stats makes it seems straightforward to implement a damage table like the above and churn out relevant textures and model deformations.

(core damage distribution across multiple components is a complexity I haven't thought through)

Slap on the Frostbite building damage and you can create a visceral mech game. If anyone has played Pacific Drive - the car is the star. Now change that to a mech.

This approach could also be applied to combat driving games. Added bonus of damage effect on car handling. Trackside buildings and collateral damage.

Easy if lengthy to type out. AAA studios are churning out cookie cutter games and this doesn't feel to outlandish to expect and its more meaningful than just reflective puddles and shadows. Also can scale across console generations with PCs getting the largest asset stack and it gets scaled back from there.

A final thought, in death race film (remake) a driver had ""the tombstone"" as a bullet proof shield. There's a scene where its getting chewed away but autocannon fire. That experience of seeing your armour flaking away and crumbling. Having that rather that hit markers or little shield icons, thats what I'd like.

gaming,"If You Don’t Mind, I’d Like To Share a Story About Why Today is Special For Me","Hey all, if this sort of thing isn’t allowed then I apologise and please delete.

I’ve played games since the 90s. I remember my Dad playing RE1 and 2. They terrified me, to the point that even my younger sister would do a zombie impression which also terrified me.

a few years pass, I carry on playing games. I used to buy a gaming magazine religiously, Nintendo Official Magazine (lovingly referred to as NOM). One issue had a huge feature about how great and different this new Resident Evil 4 was. At that, before CEX and trading standards intervention, people of any age could trade in games. No age restriction, no ID needed.

for me, this felt like a conflict tailor made for me. I knew I was too scared to play a Resident Evil game on my own, but at the same time, if NOM said a game was a must play, then I did. I bought PN.03 and Geist as a 12/13 year having no idea what they were.

anyway, I buy RE4. I’m anxious at first, but quickly - and surprisingly - I’m pretty good. My Dad comes in asks me what I was playing. When I told him, he looked shocked, then proud in the way only parents can be. It was like a tiny passing of the torch. ”you’ll be a man, one day son” kinda thing.

so RE4 becomes one of my top 5 games and I play it every 5 years or so.

fast forward 20 years. I still game and whatnot. A close friends dies in a car crash which hits me hard. I turn to hard drugs, end up homeless, cut myself off from friends and family cos I didn’t want them seeing me like that.

long story short, I end up having to do a 6 month prison stint on drug-related charges.

whilst I was inside, I detoxed from drugs, became a tutor to teach people how to read and write. Since release, I found my own place to live, and got a job in a library.

I’ve been sober for 19 months, and I’ve finally saved up enough money to buy as PS4 and Resident Evil 4 Remake and I so fucking excited boys and girls.

I feel so fucking grateful that I could change my life around to get to this point.

Ive tried games like cyberpunk, which is pretty good, but feels like a chore to play, sequels to games ive played before like Horizon FD, Ragnarok and spiderman 2, don’t interest me, theyre all just a copy paste of each other.

gaming,Why do people think games should be balanced based around casual players?,"I've seen the argument that developers should ignore competitive players and instead focus on what casual players think, but it really doesn't make sense to me at all. I get that casual players make up the vast majority of the player base, but they still don't really know what they're talking about when it comes to what is good and bad in a video game.

For example, a casual Smash Bros Ultimate player might think Ganondorf is overpowered because his attacks all deal a ton of damage and have high knockback. In reality though, Ganondorf has been bottom tier in every game post-Melee, including Ultimate where he is the single worst character in the game. His atrocious mobility, frame data, neutral game, and recovery all make him one of the few characters that are borderline unusable against anyone that knows what they're doing.

The casual player in that circumstance may want Ganondorf nerfed even though he's already terrible, further crippling an already weak character. Their issues with Ganondorf can be solved if they just improve at the game, but they want him kneecapped instead. Why should the developers listen to them?",IndividualNo3351,1h1iz0e,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h1iz0e/why_do_people_think_games_should_be_balanced/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h1iz0e/why_do_people_think_games_should_be_balanced/,2024-11-28 00:08:32,0,0.11,0,0,63,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h1iz0e

gaming,Does the experience older gamers have serve as a  disadvantage in modern games?,"This might seem like a strange question but I feel like my gaming experience is a detriment in modern games. I grew up with titles where coming in contact with an enemy meant taking damage, and I’ve been playing Hades where they only hurt you if you get caught in the active frames of their attacks. I’m so used to avoiding contact that even though I know I can dash through them for backstab damage, I have a hard time turning off decades of experience. I’ve found that in other games, enemies are doing things that I’m not expecting, like leaving what appear to be clearly delineated zones to look for me, chasing me through changing screens, etc. Most of the games I used to play had enemy behavior limited by hardware restrictions, but as they fall away I’m finding modern gameplay mechanics are killing me until I adapt. Am I alone in this or do other gamers find they’re having the same issues. I’m Gen X, for what it’s worth.

gaming,Q: Is there any game award show you have some respect for?,"We all know The Game Awards featuring Geoff ""I host everything in gaming"" Keighley is considered, at least to the majority of gamers, as the be-all end-all of gaming award shows but that's mainly because he went to so much effort to make it like movie and television award shows which equally have been garnering disdain for being propped up ""buy your own award"" venues for companies.

TGA isn't the only one out there, and some of the others have a decent reputation because of their more rigorous voting processes or blind nomination selection. **With that in mind, do you have any kind of respect towards any on this list or do you just hate all award shows regardless of ethics or dignity?**

* **The Game Awards** \- votes made by games journalists (90%) and general audiences (10%), note that it's not confirmed if that means individual journalists or the publications themselves via a series of internal voting processes
* **D.I.C.E. Awards** \- votes made by members of the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, made up of studios and publishers (similar to the Academy Awards)
* **Famitsu Awards** \- votes made by magazine readers, primarily a Japanese audience
* **Game Developers Choice Awards** \- nominations are made via an invite-only 500 member committee called the International Choice Awards Network with additional nominations made by Gamasutra journalists, then votes are made by the entirety of ICAN at the start of the Game Developers Conference
* **The Golden Joystick Awards** \- the oldest continuously running award show (1983), originally voted on by the British public but now an international public vote
* **Japan Game Awards (formerly CESA Awards)** \- winners determined by a combination of a CESA panel of juries, public votes, and sales figures
* **SXSW Gaming Awards** \- nominations submitted by the general public then narrowed down to 5 per category by the 40 member SXSW Gaming Advisory Board, votes made by the general public

**Personally I'm not a fan of award shows** as I think they demean gaming as an art and don't recognise the work of the individuals behind them in a lot of cases. It's a similar issue with how the Oscars recognise the actors and directors, then every other category just credits the work but not the people or lead in charge of that team.

But out of the main gaming awards shows, **I at least give credit to the Golden Joysticks** for being the only one voted on exclusively by the general public (and not those who can buy their award) **and the GDCA** because it's developers voting for other developers' works so it's a recognition of technical achievement as well.

Edit:

Some more thoughts: Popular vote alone is not necessarily worse, industry vote only is not necessarily better; this is why I mentioned the Golden Joysticks and GDCA in particular.

The Golden Joysticks have always split the Game of the Year into its PC, console (sometimes separate consoles), and ultimate categories. And rarely has a game won all three, even if it exists on PC and console. For example, the 2024 winners were Satisfactory (PC), Helldivers 2 (console), and Black Myth Wukong (ultimate GotY). They're also more stringent with the votes when looking for fraud, bot votes, and false votes; if you're in the UK you can vote from your phone and it's unlikely anyone would pay for an extra phone just for this event, if you're outside the UK then votes are tied to your email address and additional checks are done to make sure it isn't a throwaway. So surprisingly, it doesn't always go the way of the public making weird or joke choices, but that's only because they're not given complete freedom to enter whichever game they want as their vote.

The Game Developers Choice Awards could be seen as a circle-jerk between devs, I admit. But it seems less likely than what goes on with DICE or TGA, as it's individual developers voting and not a company or journalist. Because of this it seems like it would be harder to buy off votes of so many people without word getting out, and even if they did it would be too high a price to pay. Even if they did, there's no guarantee those paid off would vote how they say they're going to as the votes are anonymous and developers can't vote for games they've worked on.

Basically the former seems more in-line with general user reviews from a gameplay while the latter seems more in line with how developers judge each others' works from a technical perspective.",Safebox,1h15bsk,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h15bsk/q_is_there_any_game_award_show_you_have_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h15bsk/q_is_there_any_game_award_show_you_have_some/,2024-11-27 14:17:37,0,0.32,0,0,73,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h15bsk
