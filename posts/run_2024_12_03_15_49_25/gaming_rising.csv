After a big battle you look around and see how many lives were lost, how terrible was the encounter, and it feels nice and realistic.

Games where enemies get Thanos snapped like in Elden Ring or turn into a puddle of blood and few random ribs Dragon Age: Origins style or turn into a lootable pouch like in Witcher 3 kind of lack that magical feeling of realism.
