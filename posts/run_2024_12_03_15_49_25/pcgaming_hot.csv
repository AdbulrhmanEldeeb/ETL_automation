pcgaming,"Star Wars Jedi Survivor &amp; Fallen Order are still broken on PC, do not let the dark side tempt you with sales","In light of the all the sales now til the end of the year, here's a little reminder or notice if you're unfamiliar:

Jedi Survivor and Fallen Order infamously suffer from shader and traversal stutters. These occur on *every* PC, regardless of hardware or whether you're able to notice them. There are other bugs too, like white flashing when turning corners/the camera, flickering lights, and even basic things like menu settings not engaging. Is DLSS on or is your PC just that bad? Who knows! 

To get you caught up, here's Digital Foundry's analysis of the most recent [Jedi Survivor Patch 9 - Improved but still very poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw) by Alex Battaglia, preeminent expert on PC game performance and leader in the #StutterStruggle. 

So, while Patch 9 improved shader comp and shader stutter, **both Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor *still* to this day suffer from shader compilation and travel stutter.** **Everyone** on PC will encounter several types of stuttering, *regardless of how good the hardware.* There's also **[animation stutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw&amp;t=573)**, which affects camera movement and character animations. A triple threat stutterer!

I can also vouch that the issues occur on the current fastest CPU for gaming, the 9800x3D, which I use OC'd to 5.7Ghz and run with 48gb DDR5-8000 CL40 EXPO, Crosshair X870 Hero, and RTX 4090; all stability tested &gt;24hrs, latest drivers, no issues like this with any other games that aren't also known and common.

Oh, and [even the PS5 Pro version of Survivor is having issues right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8?si=wYfe9swwp0dpR98K). EA is aware and investigating, patch is assumed/confirmed to come soon, but it's just another example of their poor standards.

I don't think it's appropriate to continue rewarding EA's and Respawn's repeated lack of respect for paying customers by spending more money or playtime on these lackluster products. Just means they will continue to reward you with the same or lower standards next time. If as many of us as possible opt not to purchase them, even at a steep discount, they might find our collective lack of faith disturbing enough to fix these issues in the next game, if not the previous.",FractaLTacticS,1h4gog6,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,2024-12-01 23:22:05,1050,0.76,1050,0,402,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4gog6

pcgaming,"BOWLOUT: A wacky first-person bowling shooter by 2 indie devs | Releases on Steam January 7th, 2025","Hi PCGaming! Next year a friend and I will release our first ever game on Steam, and we would like to share it with as many people as possible!

* Release date trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9\_\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9__U)

As you'll see in the attached trailer video, in BOWLOUT you'll throw lots of bowling balls or use pins as weapons to proceed through a pin-infested bowling centre and eliminate the source of the attack. It's a relatively short game with a simple gameplay loop - perfect to blow off some steam without getting attached to a long story. There's also achievements, unlockable ball colors and controller support!

Hopefully you'll enjoy this trailer and share/wishlist the game - it helps us with the algorithm, increasing the chances of the fabled 'front page' slot! If you have any questions about the game or would like to create content/articles on it, I would gladly help! Comment here or message me directly.

I wanted to introduce my solo-dev project, a sci-fi survival-crafter/base-builder, [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming).

**[Check out the trailer here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwB0r5f6T80)**

**AETHUS is a story-driven survival game, meaning there's always a narrative-driven reason to go on your next expedition into the underground open world!** 

You'll mine and gather resources in a physics-driven world rendered with Lumen and Nanite in UE5, while building up your mining outpost on the surface with easy to use yet extremely powerful building and decoration tools.

I've spent a lot of time making these tools as simple to use as possible and the whole game is **packed with quality-of-life features** like building/crafting/cooking from storage automatically, the ability to disable collisions when building so you can position things JUST right, and much more.

I left my AAA job after 7 years in the industry back in 2023 to go indie on my own and make this game, with **no AAA bullshit** - no AI, no microtransactions or cosmetics, no predatory development, no releasing a half-done bug-filled product in Early Access, just good old-fashioned gamedev.

[I'd love to get your thoughts on the game, so there's a demo you can try out right now on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming)

A [Wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming) would be super appreciated if you like the look of the game, single every one helps a solo indie dev like me!

As a Star Wars guy, the open world is pretty amazing, and REALY stunning to look at.

The faction system is great. The blaster combat is fine and the stealth kind of sucks.

I‚Äôm even starting to like the story; I think they‚Äôve nailed the ‚ÄúOutlaw‚Äù aspect of the characters and numerous interactions and choices the game presents.

pcgaming,Are classic games overrated?,"TLDR: are older games getting an advantage in rating because there were fewer games back then?

I‚Äôve been thinking about this from time to time. There are good and solid games now for sure but a common consensus is that old games were made with more passion, with more focus on it being fun instead of selling well, with simpler but more fun design, thus resulting in being just, better. However a good analogy would be being seated at a table with almost everything you can think of, then you get to be more picky about which food tastes good. The same food that you hate right now may be the best tasting thing if you‚Äôre stuck in a desert for several days. It may not be that extreme but the point is, our perception can sometimes be influenced by the context and become deceiving/subjective.

From another angle, almost everything in game developing is considerably complex and requires years of experience to master (things like level designs, quests, gameplay, character progression, story, sound, what have you). How can it get worse over time? If you put me 20 years back I definitely wouldn‚Äôt predict that the games are going to become worse in the future right? It is true that with the inflated economy, increasing competition, developer/publisher separation, things can get complicated and out of control, still I would have thought things will become better in general.

What are your thoughts on this?",sinnytear,1h29y5l,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h29y5l/are_classic_games_overrated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h29y5l/are_classic_games_overrated/,2024-11-29 00:49:32,0,0.07,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h29y5l

pcgaming,Has gaming gotten less social?,"Has gaming gotten less social?

I remember playing games like Halo, COD and other online games. There would always be people in game chat and you‚Äôd talk crap, make friends etc.

These days when playing multiplayer games, lobbies are dead quiet. Add to the fact that with things like SBMM lobbies pretty much always disbanded after every match so there‚Äôs less opportunity for online games to be social.

Though when I started to notice this, it was around the time that I moved over to PC from console. So does anyone else think games have gotten less social? Or is it possibly the difference in platform? As in could it be that most people on PC are just using discord and don‚Äôt use the in game chat?

Today, gaming has truly becoming a mainstream force with tons of marketing money, production money, and all the good and bad things that come with it.

DOTA 2 &amp; other competitive games had tens of millions of eSports prizes already. Studios are also focusing on amazing single player games and the titles back that up.

Overall we have amazing games and hardware today. Don't let the outrage farmers get to you. We already 'made it'.

Who needs CDs?  I just redownloaded my whole catalogue of games out of thin air with a few mouse clicks via steam.

Lacking innovation?  I don't know about you, I'm FEASTING here on:

* Dave the Diver - mixing management sim + adventure
* Elden Ring DLC in all its AAA glory, CP2077 too.
* I love roguelikes - Hades I and II are amazing.  I also play 2-3 clones which are amazing too.
* What the hell are all these Truck, farming, and life simulators?  I'm not into them, but wow!
* Path of Exile 2 etc etc..
* Street Fighter 6 and I get to play as Terry Bogard vs Ryu?  This would've been my 90's kids' dream!

pcgaming,"[Blackwell Update] Historical analysis of NVIDIA GPUs relative performance, core count and die sizes across product classes and generations","Hello there!

Some 9 months ago I posted here and in some other subs about some discoveries and overall analysis I did over NVIDIA GPUs and their performance and core count across their generations (from Maxwell 2.0 (9xx) up to Ada (4xxx)). You can check out the complete comprehensive original post [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1b0ln9d/historical_analysis_of_nvidia_gpus_relative/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). It gained a fair bit of traction back then.

&amp;#x200B;

With the new leaks and rumors (sources below, not unfounded), I just grabbed the rumored SM/CUDA core count for the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and 5070 cards and plotted them against the previous generations up until Maxwell 2.0.

If you haven't read the original post, here's what matters to understand this chart:

* The X-axis in the chart (named ""Generation Name"") plots all released, rumored to release (4090 Ti, back when Ada wasn't EOL) and the new leaked Blackwell (marked with two asterisks) GPU SKUs for each generation.
* The Y-axis in the chart plots each of these cards according to the maximum CUDA core amount possible for each generation. This maximum value is derived by the most powerful GPU die each generation. Quoting from the original post: in Pascal (GTX 10 series), the TITAN Xp is the fully enabled top die (GP102), with 3840 CUDA cores, so it is at 100% relative core count. In the other hand, the 1060 6GB (GP106) has 1280 CUDA cores, which is exactly 33.3% as many cores as the TITAN Xp, thus, it has 33% relative core count.

Effectively, this means that when buying a 1060GB you're getting 33% of the most powerful GPU compute technology available at the time for the gaming cards (considering how advanced the manufacturing, nodes and processes were available at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

The results speak for themselves. I'll leave you with the initial chart and I'll give some insight afterwards:

[(Can't post images directly in this subreddit, here's a link)](https://i.imgur.com/B4sqraS.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The results are... depressing? I've sourced the data from leaked, but not unfounded information from minimally reputable sources such as [VideoCardz](https://videocardz.com/newz/geforce-rtx-5090-5080-5070ti-and-5070-to-launch-in-q1-rtx-5070-expected-to-feature-6400-cores) and [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/?generation=GeForce+50&amp;sort=generation). Let's dive into some thoughts:

* For Ada, the fully unlocked AD102 die never released (I put a fake 4090 Ti in the charts in both posts to give some perspective), but yeah. The 4090 was cut down to \~89% of the full AD102, and the full leaks suggest that the 5090 might also be \~88.5% of the full GB202. Seems fair and leaves room for a TITAN BLACKWELL or 5090 Ti, which might or might not release. **I don't see competition from AMD so I find it difficult to believe in a 5090 Ti**. That die makes more money as an AI card.
* In my original post I highlighted the **MASSIVE** abyss between the 4090 core count and the 4080/4080S core count. Never did we get such a small fraction of the top die for so much money. The base 4080 had 52.8% of the cores of the full AD102 die, and the 4080S had 55.6%. For comparison, in Ampere (RTX 3xxx), the 3080 had 81% of the cores of the full die used in the 3090 Ti. In all honesty, that was an outlier, because the trend up until then (Maxwell 2.0, Pascal and Turing) all had their xx80 cards hovering at the 66.6% relative core count. Well... If you thought that the gap between 4080 and 4090 was massive, **then the rumored gap between 5080 and 5090 is EVEN LARGER. The 5080 is rumored to have 10752 cores, which is only 43.8% of the cores of the top die.** This puts the 5080 at the same ""cut down level"", or to say, it is as cut down as a 4070 Ti was when compared to its top die. **If we go back to Ampere, the 5080 is as cut down as a 3060 Ti was compared to the top Ampere die (!!!!!).**
* **The 5070 Ti has 36.5% of the cores of the top Blackwell die.** In past generations, getting roughly 33-36% of the top die was something that the 960 (33.3%), 1060 6GB (also 33.3%) and 3060 (also 33.3%) cards achieved. **This means that the 5070 Ti is almost as cut down as previous generations xx60 cards.**
* **The RTX 5070 is 26% of the full die**, putting it in the range of previous generations RTX 4060 Ti (which was already a big disappointment as per my original post, at 23.6% of its top die) and brace for it... **the 5070 seems to be almost as cut down as an RTX 3050 (23.8%).**

&amp;#x200B;

So, it seems despite the newer generations increasing the total amount of raw CUDA cores that are possible to manufacture and put on a chip, we're getting less and less of a fraction of these node/tech advancements.

Here's the chart with some guiding lines to try and show some trend. I've been liberal in placing xx80 Ti cards as replacement for xx90 cards in past generations because there never was a 990, 1090 or 2090 card, despite there being TITANs, they would be the modern equivalent of a xx90 Ti. In case there are base and SUPER versions of the same card, I tried putting the trendline in the middle between them.

Unless Blackwell proves to be a revolutionary architecture generation (difficult, it is on the same node as Ada), then I can see really meh performance gains for the lower end. Pricing will dictate everything, and also, consumer feedback. We actually do have SOME power (remember the unreleased 4080 12GB?) in regards to product segmentation!

I'll update these charts with the Relative Performance database once these cards are out as TechPowerUp provides raw data.

pcgaming,"Windows 11 - turn ""Automatic Colour Management"" off","!!!This only tip works if you have a screen that is able to display colours beyond the sRGB range - those are 10+ bit IPS/OLED panels.

Simply go to display -&gt; Color and you'll see it as the toggable setting. Switch it off and all colours will look a bit more vibrant.

You can test this by looking at an image of something bright and red - such as a fire hydrant. The image will be a bit more vivid with ACM off.

What ACM essentially does is, it analyses the display's native Color profile and tone-maps the image sent to the display in such a way as to ""emulate"" the sRBG colour space in an attempt to ""trick"" the display - that is by compressing the brightest and darkest colors, and by reducing Color vibrancy to fit the standard colour range for internet pages, etc. This would be great if the monitor itself weren't doing a double-conversion back into its native Color space unless it's specifically set to ""sRGB mode"" in its OSD menu - and as you'll quickly notice sRBG mode just looks bad. This double conversion results in dull colors, reduced contrast and crushed blacks.

pcgaming,I'm very impressed with how good remote play has become,"When Resident Evil 7 came out, I bought a Steam Link with the plans to stream it to a TV and despite the PC being 10ft line-of-sight from router, and then the router 6ft wired to the Steam Link, it was a nonstarter and I shelved the Steam Link. It could not maintain any smoothness at all, and it was a crashfest.

I revisited remote play with the Deck and I was surprised how consistent it could be. Pulling out my Steam Link again, I set it up in the living room and honestly? Not as good as a couple feet from my PC monitor, but 12ft back on a couch looks great besides some loss of dynamic range. And this is with a good 40ft, a floor, and a concrete wall between Link and router.

I beat a few games this year this way and I had a great time. No noise from fans, no worry about thermals, I can even use a lower resolution because I'm not so close to the display that it would matter = better performance. Besides sometimes a connection being lost and needing to manually reconnect to the session, I've had zero issues.

pcgaming,BACKROOMS 0 - Announcement Trailer - A psychological horror walking simulator set in an abandoned office complex. No monsters. No jumpscares.,"Hello everyone,

I've been working on creating a **psychological horror game that focuses purely on atmosphere** \- a vast abandoned office complex with repeating yellow corridors, humming fluorescent lights, and your camcorder. This is my take on the Backrooms.

The Backrooms represents one of the internet's most fascinating horror concepts - **a vast maze of empty office rooms** that exists just outside our reality, where people can accidentally 'noclip' into and find themselves trapped. Something about these empty spaces gets under everyone's skin.

**No monsters, no jumpscares** \- just pure environmental horror where the very absence of threat becomes unsettling. The game creates tension through architecture, sound design, and the feeling of being lost in a vast abandoned building.

**We are happy to announce that our game is now in early access!** 

Sprite's Honor is a cozy and cutesy, colony sim set in a fantasy Fairy world. In the game, you're shipwrecked on an island and have to farm and ranch (once they've hatched!) the seedling creatures to stop the no good gnomes and leave the Island. While managing scout mates, you can get to know them better and learn about their lives back home.

This is our first ever released game so we are super excited (and nervous!) and greatly appreciate you checking it out.

*(The game is currently in Early Access as we would like to be able to shape it based on player feedback, polish it, and add in controller support!)*

pcgaming,Thoughts on a completely new Game of Thrones game? ,"So I‚Äôm a massive fan of game of thrones series but overall dragons are so cool to me. Now there are many dragon games like Day of Dragons, ARK and so on. But I think we need a massive open world game where we have a detailed campaign as long as a coop/multiplayer.  Ability to find dragon eggs around the map and then waiting for them to hatch and train the dragon and so on. Have the ability to ride the dragon and just fly around in a detailed and nice open world üåç.  Now ik there is a game of thrones game but tbh I hate it and it‚Äôs not good.  Need a modern graphic game made üî•üî•

Would be cool to even have game of thrones dragons in the game as well, even house of dragons as well.

pcgaming,[Health?] I physically cannot play UE5 games,"Here's a weird one, and I hope someone else is out there with similar symptoms.

Every time I try to play a realistic-looking game, I get so... tired. I just forced/struggled myself to a few hours of Stalker 2, and confirmed it. It happens whenever I play games that are not stylised, pixelated and whatnot. If it looks realistic, I get fatigued: my eyes get teary and try to close, my brain turns off, heart rate lowers... 

It might sound weird, but it happens 100% of the time. It sucks, as I really want to play some of those games. It's not a performance thing either, as I have a 14th gen i7 with a 4080 and an expensive HDR monitor. It also happens with my PS5 on the TV.

first of all, if you like harry potter and wizardry/magic themed stuff, you will definitely like this game

you essentially get to create your own character and name them, this is your avatar that you play with throughout the game

then you find yourself enrolled as a student in hogwarts

yes, you are a wizard that is attending the school of hogwarts, to fine tune your skills in wizardry

part of the challenge of the game is that you SHOULD be a good student

if you want to be a reckless student that fucks off in the back of the class, doesn't learn anything, causes trouble, you can certainly play the game that way

but if you want to actually learn something, then you should be a good student

you should go to class, listen to the professors, etc

once you're no longer in class, you have the opportunity to do other quests. either within the castle of hogwarts or outside of the castle

that's another thing, hogwarts is very BIG, so just walking through the halls of the castle makes you feel like an important student of wizardry

you also get to see other students walking through the halls as well, talking and discussing about unimportant matters or what have you

you as a higher level student have more important matters to attend to so you go about your business accordingly

you also develop a bond with your professors and get to know them well

in particular, the herbology professor is very nice. she reminds me of some of my professors i had when i was in university in real life

she is a very nice lady that teaches you very good information on herbology

for you to cross these professors and make them disappointed in you would be very bad. it depends though, at least for me i find the herbology professor to be a very nice professor, so i wouldn't want her to be disappointed with me as a student

overall the point i'm trying to make is that the way i like to play the game is i take my magic studies seriously

the world is very whacky, all sorts of things can happen. it's the harry potter world, so people can make objects disappear, there are spells that set you on fire, cause you to fly, and cause objects to phase into and out of existence

this is a very incredible world that you are in and you have to be aware of the different things that can go wrong or go in your favor as you are exploring and doing quests

in short, there is really a lot to do in this game

hogwarts is huge, there's always new things you will run into as you are walking through the halls

i will say that this is a pretty good game

once i graduate from hogwarts i will feel very satisfied

another thing i like to do is dress for the occasion

so if i'm attending classes for the day i make sure my clothing is a proper school cloak and uniform

once class is over for the day and i am exploring outside of the castle or going to Hogsmeade, i change into more casual attire, maybe even put on a sorcerer's hat

it's all about dressing for the proper environment

you wouldn't go to class in real life wearing a trench coat and a top hat would you? probably not. so why would you do that in this game? exactly, that's how you should think about it

and one last thing i will say is that if this game were possible to play in a full dive virtual reality setting, it would be pretty epic

walking outside the castle really produces some cool sights that would pretty epic to see if you were physically standing there

it would be a scary situation though, given that in a world like that, someone could cause you to vanish into thin air or light you on fire with magic

just something to think about",nervomelbye,1gxkybx,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,2024-11-22 23:02:01,0,0.27,0,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gxkybx

pcgaming,Handheld gaming PC comparison table I made to compare Steam Deck and 35+ alternatives on their specs and features,"Hi, I did a deep dive into handheld gaming PC's, and created a pretty comprehensive comparison table that I hope some of you might find useful:

[https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/)

It's got every handheld gaming PC available right now (that I could find), and allows you to compare all of them on their specifications and features; from display specs, CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD, built in sensors, connectivity, ports, battery, available buttons and inputs, physical specs like size/weight/available colors, and more.

There's options to filter the table on specs or features, too. So you can for instance filter on screen size, resolution, refresh rate, whether it's got a trackpad, gyro controls, detachable controllers, or a built-in keyboard, etc.

You can also sort columns. So for instance, to easily find the cheapest handheld that has the specs you're filtering for, you can sort the table on the price (MSRP) column.

Also, if you want to compare aby two models side-by-side, there's a separate tool available for that. So for instance, if you want to compare the Zotac Zone vs the Asus ROG Ally X: [https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs) \- and you can use the checkbox for 'Differences only' to only show the specs/features with differences.

Other than that, I've made sure to apply conditional formatting to most specs, to make it visually clear what the pros and cons of each model are.

There's also a size comparison image of some of the most popular options if you scroll past the table.

Let me know if you have any feedback! It's totally possible I've made a mistake somewhere, or missed a product or spec that could be interesting to add. I'm considering adding benchmarks to the table as well, but am not sure which ones would be best to use in this case - and if there's data for all or most of these handhelds? If anyone has thoughts on that, let me know!",CookieDelivery,1gv5y1x,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,2024-11-19 19:41:27,126,0.91,126,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gv5y1x

pcgaming,8 Years on and 0 lessons learned. Another swing and a miss for Frontier with Planet Coaster 2 - and barely anyone is talking about the broken state of the game.,"Frontier has once again excelled at creating a pretty Sandbox. Unfortunately, there's supposed to be a Theme-Park management game behind this and it's hard to believe that they learned zero lessons from their failures with Planet Coaster back in 2016.  

With a meaty update coming in December that promises to fix only some of the most egregious concerns, I really can't see how this game will maintain any kind of longevity, but with that little preamble let's start tearing apart this carcass for the juicy, gossipy flesh.  

---  

**As a game, it is completely and utterly broken.** We all know these games, right? Put rides down, put shops down, connect them all together with paths and scenery to balance your guests needs and hire a roster of staff to keep everything running. A simple enough premise.  

Planet Coaster 2 falls completely flat on its face. Both the guest *and* staff systems are utterly broken, but scandalously, they work *just well enough* to pass the sniff test with the Play Testers &amp; reviewers before release.  

**How is it broken?** You might ask, shall we start with the staff? 

* Rides will degrade less than an hour after placing them.
* Janitors ignore overflowing bins
* Mechanics ignore broken down rides
* Mechanics ignore ride and facilities maintenance 
* Rides degrade *minutes* after placing them down and need maintenance, but the Mechanics are too busy wandering around ""looking for work"".
* Ride operators and shop vendors leave to go on break without waiting for the person who's supposed to relieve them to even show up, suddenly leaving gaps in operations.  

**What about the guests?** The logic for these guys is completely busted. 

* If a coaster has a capacity of 32 guests, when the queue has 31 guests in it, nobody else will queue up, thinking ""That queue is too long"". They will walk up to the queue and do a 180 and walk away.
* Guests will be dying to use a toilet, and walk to the opposite end of the park, even though there's a toilet next to them. 
* If you open the park and place one tiny teacups ride down, it will attract thousands of guests.
* If you have a mix of water park slides and rollercoasters in your park, every guest will flip-flop into all wanting to go on one, or the other. But they'll all buy pool-passes despite not needing them.  
* Guests will drop trash on the floor even if there's an available trash bin nearby.  
* If there's too many rides, guests just won't use pools and flumes at all.  
* Still no guest wandering mechanics. They just move in a straight beeline from A to B.
* Major guest congestion issues. It's not uncommon to see 300 guests all mashing against each other in a mosh-pit  
* They added weather but it appears to be cosmetic and doesn't affect guest riding decisions.  
* They added picnic benches but guests won't sit down and eat. In fact, I've not seen any guests sitting down and eating on anything.  

---  

So yes, you can build rides, spend an hour creating the perfect station, filling in all the scenery, adding shops and weaving paths around. *But the actual, core aspect of the game just doesn't work*. There's no management here, it is just a glorified sandbox with a piss-poor campaign and completely broken staff and guest system.  

Avoid, and even then think twice if/when they fix it, because releasing a game as broken as this should not be rewarded with sales.",Chaoslava,1gu48ts,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,2024-11-18 13:05:20,449,0.89,449,0,148,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gu48ts

pcgaming,So how did Quantic Dream create the amazing character models in Detroit?,"Probably the only game that has gotten closest to realism as far as character designs go.

Senua's Saga looked good but it still looked akward at times especially the expressions.

Tiny facial movements and emotions can actually be read in the game and I find it truly remarkable that the developers are able to render all of that in real time. 

Is it because of the linearity?

I was thinking why can't every dev go with the same design when it comes to rendering human characters.

Pretty amazing what they did with the game.

pcgaming,Detroit: Become Human on PC,"Just bought it at $11.99 and I have to say it's quite a steal.

The short episode format is perfect and it definitely promotes replayability.

The acting and character renders are one of the best I've seen in a video game.

Visuals are stunning at 4k with the image resolution doubled (so basically 8k?).

Performance is pretty steady keeping the framerates close to 60fps most of the time.

It's like playing an interactive dystopian scifi novel.

No wonder the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews.

I kind of find a sense of fulfillment when missing on these types of games and eventually finding it.

Just wanted to share and I wanted to get your thoughts on it.
