books,Dune: My Personal Journey,"Frank Herbert’s Dune series is one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written. It’s sprawling, philosophical, and deeply complex, full of political intrigue, ecological insights, and questions about power and destiny. What makes the series so remarkable, though, isn’t necessarily the strength of each individual book. None of them, for me, are among the best books I’ve ever read. But taken together, the *Dune* Frank Herbert’s *Dune* series is one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written. It’s sprawling, philosophical, and deeply complex, full of political intrigue, ecological insights, and questions about power and destiny. What makes the series so remarkable, though, isn’t necessarily the strength of each individual book. None of them, for me, are among the best books I’ve ever read. But taken together, the *Dune* series is absolutely one of the best series I’ve ever experienced. The sum is truly greater than its parts.

My journey with *Dune* has been a mix of awe, frustration, and moments of profound reflection. Add to that Denis Villeneuve’s stunning movie adaptations, and *Dune* has become more than just a series for me—it’s a world I’ve lived in, thought about, and will never forget.

# Dune: A Masterpiece of World-Building

The first book, *Dune*, is where it all begins, and it’s undeniably fantastic. Herbert’s ability to create a universe so layered, so alive, is unparalleled. Arrakis feels like a character in its own right, and the interplay between the Fremen, the spice, and the sandworms is unforgettable. Paul Atreides’ rise to power as the prophesied leader of the Fremen, Muad’Dib, is a fascinating and deeply human story set against a backdrop of galactic-scale politics and intrigue.

That said, while *Dune* is a towering achievement in science fiction, it doesn’t quite crack my personal “best books ever” list. It’s not perfect—it can be dense and slow in places—but it’s so unique, so rich, that it’s impossible not to be swept away by its vision.

Watching Denis Villeneuve’s *Dune: Part One* before reading the book brought that world vividly to life for me. I saw *Dune Part One* on a whim. I hadn’t heard of *Dune* before that as I was really just getting into reading at the time. The movie’s stunning cinematography, Hans Zimmer’s otherworldly score, and the pitch-perfect performances elevated the story. Seeing Arrakis, the spice fields, and the sandworms on the big screen made diving into the book much easier than it would have been otherwise.

# Dune Messiah: Smaller, But Powerful

The second book, *Dune Messiah*, takes the grandeur of *Dune* and turns it inward. It’s a quieter, more introspective story, following Paul Atreides as he grapples with the consequences of his rule and the prophecy that has shaped his life.

This book has a tragic quality that I really appreciated. Paul is no longer the bright young leader we met in *Dune*. He’s a man weighed down by the cost of his power, haunted by the violent acts committed in his name. It’s not as expansive or as immediately gripping as *Dune*, but it adds incredible depth to the series.

# Children of Dune: Uneven but Necessary

*Children of Dune* bridges the original trilogy and the dramatic shift that happens later in the series. It focuses on Paul’s children, Leto II and Ghanima, as they grapple with their father’s legacy and the path their lives must take.

This novel was a mixed bag for me. Some parts dragged, and the pacing felt off at times, but there were also flashes of brilliance—especially Leto II’s evolution into the figure who will dominate the series’ future. While I didn’t enjoy it as much as *Dune* or *Dune Messiah*, it contains important moments that make it a necessary part of the saga. One of the most powerful of these is Alia’s tragic conclusion. As the regent of the Imperium, she struggles to maintain control over her mind as the voices of her ancestors, particularly the malevolent influence of her grandfather, Baron Harkonnen, take over. Her internal battle becomes unbearable, and she descends into madness, growing paranoid and tyrannical. Ultimately, facing the loss of her power and the imminent threat of the Fremen turning against her, Alia chooses to end her life by jumping from the window of the Keep. This act is both a tragic surrender to her fate and a final attempt to free herself from the Baron’s control.

# God Emperor of Dune: A Bold Pivot

*God Emperor of Dune* is where the series takes a massive leap forward. Thousands of years have passed, and Leto II, now a human-sandworm hybrid, rules over humanity as a godlike figure.

This book is incredibly divisive, but I loved it. It’s philosophical, strange, and deeply introspective. Leto’s vision for humanity, his Golden Path, and his musings on power and sacrifice make for a fascinating, if slower, read. Herbert’s willingness to completely reimagine the series at this point is part of what makes *Dune* such an ambitious and singular work.

# Heretics of Dune: The Low Point

This is where the series stumbled for me. *Heretics of Dune* introduces new characters and factions, and the story feels disconnected from the earlier books. It was a slog to get through, and I found myself struggling to stay invested.

That said, it’s not skippable. It sets up the events of *Chapterhouse: Dune*, and without that connection, the final book wouldn’t have the same impact. Still, if it didn’t directly tie into the ending, I’d be tempted to tell readers to skip it.

# Chapterhouse: Dune: A Strong Finish

Thankfully, the series picks up again with *Chapterhouse: Dune*. This book focuses heavily on the Bene Gesserit, and their intricate scheming and power plays make for a compelling read. The story felt tighter and more engaging than *Heretics*, and it served as a satisfying conclusion to the series.

The final chapter, though, is what sticks with me the most. The mysterious old man and woman who appear at the end add an enigmatic layer to the story. It’s an open-ended, haunting conclusion that leaves you with more questions than answers—exactly the kind of ending that fits the sprawling, complex nature of *Dune*.

# The Movies: Dune: Part One and Part Two

Denis Villeneuve’s movies have been a revelation. *Dune: Part One* was a masterpiece, capturing the heart of the first half of the book with stunning visuals and a deep respect for Herbert’s world.

When I finally saw *Part Two*, it was everything I hoped it would be. The movie picks up seamlessly where the first left off, showing Paul’s transformation into Muad’Dib and the Fremen’s fight against the Harkonnens. The final confrontation with Feyd-Rautha was intense and satisfying, and the visuals were breathtaking.

Chani’s role was expanded beautifully, and her relationship with Paul felt authentic and poignant. The political tension, the weight of destiny, and the sheer spectacle of Arrakis came through so vividly. Zimmer’s score was once again extraordinary, and Villeneuve proved he could handle the more action-heavy second half of the story while keeping the depth intact. 

Although there were some major departures, I think Denis Villeneuve truly understands the spirit of Dune. His passion for the source material is clear to see when watching his films. These two adaptations were perfect in my opinion. I can't wait to see what he brings for Dune Messiah.

# Final Thoughts

The *Dune* series is an unforgettable journey. Each book has its strengths and weaknesses, but together, they form a singular, monumental work of science fiction. The individual novels may not rank among my all-time favourites, but as a series, *Dune* is one of the best I’ve ever read.

Villeneuve’s films have only enhanced that experience, bringing the world of Arrakis to life in ways I never imagined possible. Whether you’re reading the books, watching the movies, or doing both, *Dune* is an experience that stays with you long after it’s over—a testament to Herbert’s vision and the enduring power of science fiction. But this is a story for everyone, not just fans of science fiction. It’s a brilliant reflection of humanity and is a story worth investing your time in.",Sudden-Database6968,1h5c1lb,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5c1lb/dune_my_personal_journey/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5c1lb/dune_my_personal_journey/,2024-12-03 01:42:34,34,0.67,34,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5c1lb

books,"I just ""read"" The Third Policeman by Flann O'Brien","The quotes are because I skipped the footnotes, so i'm not sure if i can say I read it since there were so many footnotes. 

I'm not sure how I feel about the book. joe is a delight and should be a national treasure, but disappears in the last 20% of the book. i only read this book because Terry Eagleton made it sound like such a creepfest in his book ""On Evil."" But it's not really creepy. It's pretty funny at times, but not enough of the time for it to not feel like a slog sometimes. I might also have been coming down with a low key head cold in the last 20% of the book, and that might have affected my perception of it. 

My question is: was the narrator actually evil? who was the main motivator behind the robbery and killing, divney or narrator? or am i asking the wrong questions here and missing some major point (since i skipped all the footnotes...)?

books,"Dark Matter is one of the worst books I've read in a long time, if not ever, how do I avoid this happening next time? ","Dark Matter by Blake Crouch is genuinely I think one of the most poorly written books I might have ever read. There's a decent amount of people on here who hate it as well, so I wont go into that.

At the end of the day, it is a trashy,  easy read, colleen hoover, dan brown type book, if that's what some people like reading so be it.

My problem, is that if you hear it recommended somewhere, like I did, do a a quick glance through Goodreads, glance at some reddit posts, you would never get that impression. Good Reads raves about it, it won some award apparently, the tagline under the goodreads google link says its ""brilliantly plotted"".

It objectively, is not brilliantly plotted. A lot of whether you like a book or not, is taste, its subjective, but there are objective things too, people study literature and there are things that make good writing and bad writing. Dark Matter reads like poor fan fiction, its like if an Avengers movie was a book.

I don't mean to be pretentious, you can enjoy Dan Brown and Avengers movies, but lets not call it brilliant writing or masterpieces or works of art.

I guess my frustration and my point ultimately, is that I like to go into a book with very little information which makes it really hard to tell whether a book is actually worth reading or not.

With movies, you can get a pretty good idea on its quality by glancing at things like Rotten Tomatoes, with books though its a total shot in the dark it seems.

Maybe I rely too heavily on GoodReads, but there's also no other option to my knowledge, the second thing is I guess I have a hard time DNR'ing, once I'm a few pages in, I'm commited and I want to finish it, I trick myself, saying or hoping it will get better.

Iv had this happen to me a few times, though not to this scale and I'm just not really sure how to actually avoid it without giving too much info away ",fozz179,1h5e1ho,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5e1ho/dark_matter_is_one_of_the_worst_books_ive_read_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5e1ho/dark_matter_is_one_of_the_worst_books_ive_read_in/,2024-12-03 03:23:57,0,0.41,0,0,63,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5e1ho
