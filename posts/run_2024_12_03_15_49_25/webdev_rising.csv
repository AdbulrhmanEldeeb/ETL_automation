webdev,Does AI take the joy out of programming for anyone else?,"I’ve always enjoyed the process of building something and striving for a codebase that’s both maintainable and easy to understand. Solving the initial problem for someone is rewarding, but as the app matures, I find even more value in the **craftsmanship** of the code itself.

When I am reviewing their work, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m reviewing AI-generated code, not my colleagues creations. It makes me second guess whether I’ll continue to enjoy programming as it evolves. Right now it feels like I am pair programming with a junior dev(AI) to spit out the next feature.

webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,118,0.81,118,0,173,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

webdev,Monorepo architecture and scopes,"Monorepo architecture

Hi there! I’m using NX with Angular for a monorepo (but I don’t think this issue is specific to Angular nor NX) (4 projects, multiple libraries). As the repo is growing, the current library structure feels unsustainable, and responsibilities between modules are becoming unclear. Here's the current setup:

# Current Library Structure

1. `libs/features`
   * Each ""screen"" (micro-frontend) gets its own library.
   * **Problem:** Shared logic across screens creates overlapping responsibilities.
2. `libs/services`
   * Libraries aligned with backend microservices, split into subcategories:
      * **UI:** Frontend-specific logic/components for an ""entity"" such as order-card.
      * **Feature:** Core functionality (but sometimes imports across services, which feels wrong). Could be a smart search screen for orders, an oder dialog etc.
      * **Data-access:** Backend-specific data handling logic. Like order-rest/websockets
   * **Problem:** The ""feature"" sub-lib crosses boundaries and doesn’t align with service isolation. And it doesnt seem to make sense since its generally more defined by the wanted frontend functionality.
3. `libs/shared`
   * Shared functionality, including:
      * Config
      * Notifications handling
      * Shared UI components not tied to entities

# Questions

1. **UI Libraries**
   * Should all UI components be consolidated under `libs/shared/ui` and divided into sub-libraries/categories (e.g., `shared/ui/&lt;category&gt;`)?
2. **Backend vs. Frontend Domains**
   * Should backend-related libraries only include `data-access` and avoid mixing in UI or feature logic?
   * Should the frontend code be reorganized into ""frontend domains,"" where each domain encapsulates:
      * Shared business logic
      * Specific screens (which could eventually become micro-frontends)?

# Goals

* **Clear separation of concerns**
* **Sustainable structure as the repo grows**
* **Logical boundaries between backend services and frontend domains**

# How should I reorganize my libraries to achieve this?

  
Really grateful for any inputs or direction. Im feeling a bit lost at how to best structure this. I think the way to go is splitting things up more by front-end domains. But what sort of library types would be suitable, and which scopes and types should be limited from importing what?

webdev,Is This Login/Signup System Secure and Efficient? Looking for Feedback,"Hi, I’ve built a login/signup system for my website and would love your feedback. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sign-Up Flow**

* User fills out name, email, password (validated for strength) and completes hCaptcha.
* Frontend sends a POST request to /api/auth/register with user data and hCaptcha token.
* Server validates data, verifies hCaptcha, and creates a ""pending user"" with:
   * Hashed password, 6-digit OTP (valid 5 mins), and expiration (30 mins).
* OTP is emailed to the user for verification.
* On valid OTP, a user account is created, and the pending entry is removed.

**2. Sign-In Flow**

* User enters email/password.
* Server verifies credentials and creates a session via NextAuth.
* On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

**3. Additional Security**

* Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
* Failed logins tracked for account lockout.
* Background task clears expired pending users every 5 minutes.
* Password resets use the same OTP process as registration.

**4. Session Management**

* Handled by NextAuth with token storage in cookies.

**Questions:**

* Is this secure enough?
* Any improvements to the email verification or overall flow?
* Other tips for a better user experience or security?
