programming,This PR replaces is-number package with a one-liner with identical code. Author argues this tiny change saves 440GB weekly traffic. JavaScript micro-package debate ,"A debate occurred between the author of the is-number package (and is-odd, is-even, and 1500more) and a PR author over micro-libraries. https://github.com/micromatch/to-regex-range/pull/17


The PR proposed replacing the 'is-number' package with its inline code. While the code is &lt;1KB, the full package with README/license is ~10KB. With 70M weekly downloads, this simple change saves 440GB of npm bandwidth weekly.

The author of 'is-number' called the PR ""useless"" - despite it being his own code just moved inline. Some of his other packages include 'is-odd' which depends on 'is-even' which depends on... you guessed it, 'is-number'.

The debate:
Pro micro-packages: Well-tested, auto-updates, saves dev time
Against: Security risks, fragile dependencies (remember left-pad?), unnecessary bloat

TL;DR: JavaScript's micro-package ecosystem might be getting out of hand. Sometimes the simplest solution is just writing the code yourself. Or standards library when?
