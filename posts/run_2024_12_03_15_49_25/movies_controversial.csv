I fell into an existential depression for most of
the school. Contervisal films helped me with the
commentary in their filmmaking, which opened my eyes to how powerful films are, and they became the color of my world, full of grey.

movies,"It’s about time we talk about LA Story (1991) written and starring Steve Martin, is this his best comedy? ","I remember watching this with my parents when I was younger, prob around 95. I was born 88 so I didn’t have any ability to pick up any of the satire but I remember enjoying it.

I have a bad habit of not rewatching movies I’ve seen since there’s so much out there, no matter how young I was when I first saw it, but my wife showed me a clip from the film off Instagram and we laughed and decided to give it a try and let me tell you it blew us away. We were crying laughing while totally engaged. 

It’s a perfect LA satire and probably the only American Magical Realism film I’ve ever seen (I’m more familiar with the genre coming from Mexico).  Everything is pitch perfect. It’s a tight 91 minutes, edited beautifully, perfect writing from Steve Martin, directed as only I could imagine it and the casting is insane. Every side character and bit part is an amazing character actor from the 90s. 

And the leads are played beautifully by Richard Grant who I know from his performance in Withnail and I. Victoria tennent plays the love interest who is a beautiful actress who got stuck with bad roles most her career, but honestly Sarah Jessica Parker steals the show with her pre-emptive manic pixie dream girl. 

I think this is a movie that although critically acclaimed went over most peoples heads and was forgotten. But I sit here now thinking it’s just leapt to my favorite comedy of all time. It’s so sharp and witty and well executed and magical and of it’s time. I don’t think anyone can argue that Steve Martin is a comedic writing force and it shows in this movie. 

If you haven’t seen it watch it as soon as you can, if you have what do you think about my analysis and how it’s held up and its legacy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

My favorite joke so when Sarah Jessica Parker is trying to seduce Steve Martin and guides his hand down to cup her breast. He squeezes and makes a face and says “your breasts feel weird” and she says “oh, yeah, that’s cause they are real…”

La in a nutshell. That’s my Ted talk.

Every year though, there's at least 30-40 new Christmas movies, 80% of them made by the Hallmark and lifetime channel with the same plots.

What does it actually take to make a movie that revolves around Christmas and have it be a classic that you look forward to watching the next year?

What is the most recent Christmas movie that made it into your ""Must see"" Christmas movies each year?

movies,Krazy House (2024) is insane (for fans of Kevin Can F*** Himself),"Set in 1990, Krazy House starts as a typical late-80’s, early 90’s sitcom called The Christians that looks like an amalgamation of both Married with Children and King of Queens. Like those shows, it’s filmed in front of a live studio audience and starts out in a very light hearted, goofy way. Bernie Christian, the matriarch of the family, is juggling his faith and his family. He’s the stereotypical Kevin James kind of protagonist who means well, but continuously causes more problems than he’s solving. When he’s not falling down the stairs (much to the delight of the studio audience), he’s breaking everything that isn’t nailed down, much to the chagrin of his modern, breadwinning wife, Eva. His indifferent, gum smacking daughter Sarah and son Adam, a burgeoning scientist, are opportunities for life lessons about being good people and looking towards the lord. Sounds like the perfect setup for a religious TV show for those times; you know the type - a character walks through the front door and the crowd goes wild?

However, when a trio of Russian handymen show up at the door, things take a turn…and the studio audience doesn’t pop for them. See, Bernie has (as he usually does), caused a mess in the kitchen. His stew bubbles over and he messes up the sink, adding to the kitchen destruction he caused earlier when his arm caught on fire and he lit up the wall. After initially dismissing the Russians, he lets them in to fix the problem…but the problems at the Christian house have only just begun. Once the Russians are in, the show takes an insanely dark turn and it only gets more bonkers from there. While the film starts as a deconstruction of the nuclear family sitcom, it ends as a bloody mess where no one is safe.

This one is for fans of absurd horror/comedies or things skewering nostalgic TV (Late Night with the Devil, Kevin Can F\*\*\* Himself). The pacing isn't great in the second half, but it's still worth checking out.",forcefivepod,1h58ys0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,2024-12-02 23:19:34,4,0.56,4,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,self,t3_1h58ys0

movies,Fracture (2007) SPOILERS,"Just seen 2007 Fracture starring Anthony Hopkins for the first time. Great movie until the ending which in my eyes completely ruined the brilliance of the film.

I cannot make sense of the ending and wonder if I am missing something?

1. Firstly, surely all the bullet in his wife's head does is proves Nunally's gun was the murder weapon. There is still nothing linking Crawford to Nunally's gun as it is mentioned in the film that the hotel camera footage has no face. 

2. Also, they switched the shells in the evidence locker so would the gun even match anymore? 

3. The double jeopardy also is very questionable. As I understand it, the case is still substantially the same so Crawford would still not be able to be tried again. 

4. Would any evidence collected in Crawford's house at the end not be void due to the restraining order? Beachum should not be there in the first place and it is essentially breaking and entering as he goes through Crawford's belongings to get the gun.

Great shame as I would have given the film a 9 up to the end which seems to completely ruin the rest of the film.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: San Marino,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Russia. I'm not really sure, if I offended people here, but I did get quite a few downvotes for it. Fortunately, I also got some very good film suggestions (I would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants again) and we also have a winner: ***Сталкер*** (engl. Stalker), a movie by the legendary Andrei Tarkovsky, will receive the next entry in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Today, I know, that it will become much harder to just find a fitting movie, but following the alphabetical order, we move to the next letter - and this time, there are many countries waiting for us that start with an S - an S like **San Marino**, for example. And everytime there will be only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Everything Everywhere All At Once ending questions [SPOILERS],"I rewatched the movie again the other day and I was left with some questions about the ending that I don't know if there are implied answers, definitive answers, or ""idk it doesn't really matter"" answers.

1. Alpha Waymond said early on that you had to resist the temptation to have extended stays in other dimensions otherwise you introduce paradox. But doesn't the movie end with Evelyn in another dimension? Her original dimension is the one where she doesn't go home from the IRS, punches Deirdre, the IRS has been basically destroyed, there's a lot of murder, Waymond is aware of raccoon-Waymond and raccoon-Joy, and Eveyln pulls Alpha-Joy out of the bagel. As the movie ends, we transition to a dimension where she DID go home, she has the breakdown in the laundromat, Dierdre tells the police to let her go, they relate to each other because of the divorce papers, then she has that last emotional talk with Joy at the car. I can't tell if it is implying that Evelyn is staying in this alternative dimension, or if her original one is still ""active"" for her and she probably goes to jail after all the verse-jumpers (Alpha gong-gong, alpha-Joy, alpha diedre, etc) leave that dimension.

2. When Evelyn is having that talk reconcile with Joy at the car at the end of the movie, is it with HER Joy, or the Jobu Tupaki Alpha-Joy? It's clear in that universe that Alpha-Joy is taking over that universe's Joy quite often, and the speech carries references to other events in the movie and she's shown to be talking with Alpha-Joy in all of the other dimensions too. There's so much emotion flowing in that scene from Joy that I can't tell if Evelyn is reconciling with HER Joy, or Alpha-Joy.",turn_for_do,1h50eme,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h50eme/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ending/,2024-12-02 17:28:44,0,0.33,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Question,spoiler,t3_1h50eme

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

movies,"People, please stop theorizing that Creeper from Jeepers Creepers is a Mayan God, as an answer to the question of what the Creeper really is. ","It bothers me to this day that people repeatedly put forth the Mayan God theory as an origin story of the Creeper as if the idea of Mayans worshipping the creature informs us as to its true nature. Unless ancient Mayans had the power by worship to physically cause or manifest the thing itself that was to be worshipped, then it's not a helpful explanation of its origin. 

The Creeper must have existed before or independently of the Mayans and therefore is not elementally a Mayan God.  Them possibly worshipping it explains nothing, much like any pagan civilization worshipping the sun in the sky does nothing to explain its formation. 

 When most people ask, what is the Creeper, we are looking for theories on how and when and why it came into existence. Was it naturally birthed? Intelligently designed? Is it of earthly origins? Extraterrestrial? Obviously, we don't have any answer, only guesses. But just saying it's a Mayan God is uninformative.

movies,They Live (1988) and it's concept ,"It was in my watchlist for such a long time, finally decided to watch it and blew me away completely. John Carpenter is a visionary! Has anyone of you saw it in the theatres? Or were you there when it was released?

Have you seen Men In Black or The Matrix or Fight Club? This movie felt like it had all of that! And maybe somewhat an inspiration for the movie I mentioned.

They Live dir. By *John Carpenter* is a story of a man, played by Roddy Piper who has come to City in search of a job, but is shocked when he sees the _*reality of this world*_. There are aliens living among us, and they are controlling everything.

Advertisements, News Channels, Politics, everything... everything is a LIE. They are controlling us with different mediums, changing our Subconscious mind and bending our reality, turning us into servants, into Livestock. 

_""We are Sleeping, They are living.""_

If you're someone who is into Illuminati, Secret Society, you'll love this film.

Though some moments felt janky in acting, but that's because the lead is probably the first WWF Turned Actor. Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.

This movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.

The runtime is about 1hr 30mins, and even if you watch this type of films or not, you should watch it just for the concept.",apple15332,1h5d41h,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5d41h/they_live_1988_and_its_concept/,2024-12-03 02:35:57,80,0.86,80,0,36,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5d41h
movies,AI generated performances. The future of Hollywood?,"Watching Rogue One the other day got me thinking. 

CGI Leia breaks the uncanny valley at the end of Rogue One but it will improve. We need a new ""actor not acting"" definition for such roles. Cameo doesn't fit. Voice actor doesn't fit either. These will be AI/CGI fully generated requiring no input. Ash in Alien: Romulus comes to mind. But with exponential better tech.

Maybe someone has a SAG definition. The writers strike was over AI but I don't think we have any consensus of what the future will be for this type of content.

Contributing likeness?

_____ in an AI performance?

CGI provided by _______ ? (No speaking lines)

It's going to happen. I think nobody knows how it will play out. Maybe it will mark the end of a profession, automated at bottom budget like cartoons.

movies,Heat (1995)….Most beautiful movie line I’ve heard ,"In Heat… there’s 2 parts that stick out to me… many great scenes overall

But when Val Kilmer’s character tells DeNiro “for me the sun rises and sets with her” when talking about his wife and why he can’t leave her. Then at the end… they are both in a relationship where they fight a lot.. both have been unfaithful and she’s ready to turn him in. But when she sees his innocent genuine smile when he sees her, she can’t bring herself to go against him and realizes she still loves him despite all their issues and signals to him to run away. I loved that dynamic

Also the part where the Dennis Heybert’s character (the AllState commercial guy) is sitting with his gf and he feels like a failure. He tells her “why you rolling around with me for?” and starts crying. And she reassures him and tells him because she’s proud of him for trying. 

2 scenes/dynamics that are relatable and just hit deep. One is a relationship that has had many issues and in turmoil but deep down, the two still love eachother. The other is a man who feels like he can’t offer nothing and the woman is reassuring him that he is enough.",HeightsGringo180,1h4zhqt,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4zhqt/heat_1995most_beautiful_movie_line_ive_heard/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4zhqt/heat_1995most_beautiful_movie_line_ive_heard/,2024-12-02 16:51:32,281,0.9,281,0,179,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4zhqt

movies,"The original April O'Neil, Judith Hoag, got top billing in the very successful ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (1990), and was a co-lead. Yet, unlike the Turtles, the leading lady didn't come back for the sequels. What happened?","I grew up watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", it was among my favorite childhood films. It was entertaining, engrossing, funny, thrilling and even moving. 

As engaging and charismatic as the Turtles were, April O'Neil, their human friend, wasn't sidelined as the ""token chick"". April had her own agency, she was smart and spunky and funny while never taking the spotlight away from the Turtles. She also had a romantic subplot with Casey Jones, played by Elias Koteas, and their scenes together sizzle with humorous chemistry. 

I liked Judith Hoag a lot, she'll always be April O'Neil. Unfortunately, Judith Hoag didn't return, she got recast with Paige Turco for the sequels and unlike Hoag, Turco was more supporting instead of a co-lead. Turco wasn't bad, she did the best with what she got, yet Hoag had a charm which was lacking in Turco's April. 

I've never found a proper reason of why Hoag didn't return. The most I got was Hoag quit because she disapproved of the ""violence"" in the film, which I don't get. It's a martial arts film about antromorphic Turtles, she wasn't given the script for ""Teletubbies"".",Peter_Omun,1h52tli,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h52tli/the_original_april_oneil_judith_hoag_got_top/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h52tli/the_original_april_oneil_judith_hoag_got_top/,2024-12-02 19:05:38,628,0.91,628,0,214,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h52tli

This analysis of American Psycho reveals something profound about human nature that most viewers have missed. Why would someone so desperate to fit in also be driven to such extreme violence? The answer isn't what you think. Beyond the surface narrative of materialism and madness lies a hidden pattern. Once you see it, you'll never watch the film the same way again.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \- 83 (24 Reviews)

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):

&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director’s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):

&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):

&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.

[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):

&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):

&gt;Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):

&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.

[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):

&gt;It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):

&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.

The Independent (100):

&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.

Written and Directed by Robert Eggers:

&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.
