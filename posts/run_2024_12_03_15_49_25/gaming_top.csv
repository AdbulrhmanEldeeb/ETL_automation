gaming,"It might sound weird, but I really like when the corpses are done well and remain instead of magically disappearing","TES has probably my favorite approach to this. When you kill an NPC, their body and gore remain for a while before they disappear. You can not only loot their corpses but move them around. After a big battle you look around and see how many lives were lost, how terrible was the encounter, and it feels nice and realistic.

Games where enemies get Thanos snapped like in Elden Ring or turn into a puddle of blood and few random ribs Dragon Age: Origins style or turn into a lootable pouch like in Witcher 3 kind of lack that magical feeling of realism.

gaming,"Unreal Tournament 99 still has active multiplayer servers, while later versions don't?","Just the other day, I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h3qz7g/are_there_any_alternate_online_servers_for_unreal/) about how it's hard to find arena shooters with active online multiplayer servers. I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004).  Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.

The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I'll play that now for online multiplayer.  I'm curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?

Also, I think it's cool that the original Unreal Tournament (a game from 1999, which I originally played on Windows 98) still runs without a problem on modern PCs (I have it on my current PC, which has Windows 11 and an Intel i9-9900k and an Nvidia 3080 TI).  I have the Game Of The Year edition from Steam though, so I think it was pre-packaged to work on modern PCs.  It also seems to be the 3DFX version; and I remember seeing a 3DFX Glide wrapper DLL years ago, which this version of UT99 must be using in order to work with modern graphics cards.",RolandMT32,1h5899f,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5899f/unreal_tournament_99_still_has_active_multiplayer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5899f/unreal_tournament_99_still_has_active_multiplayer/,2024-12-02 22:48:49,116,0.87,116,0,73,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5899f

gaming,Is a PS5 or a higher refresh rate monitor worth it? (Maybe OLED),"Let’s say for example I have a 165hz 1440p monitor, but can push well over 200fps and then some as it is. Is it truly worth investing in a monitor that can handle that and then some? Potentially OLED too?

Or would it make more sense to invest in a PS5 to have as a system to play older games that are basically dead on PC, but very much alive on Series X/PS5. I know gamepass exists, but I’m not exactly interested in that. 

Kinda curious on feedback of what everyone thinks. I’ve only experienced an OLED TV, and it was incredible, and I don’t necessarily need a console but….i really only prefer the PC for things like MMOs where it really shines. Yes COD can shine too, but older games are usually hacked and not worth messing with, and there’s still PS5 exclusives that I can’t get (though many do come over for sure).

PoE 
The long dark
RdR2
Elden ring

Recent stuff I found meh:

Ghost of Tsushima
Kingdom come
Pillars of eternity 1/2

I’m probably going to try Sekiro, the curve sounds really well designed.
