movies,Robert Eggers' 'Nosferatu' - Review Thread,"'Nosferatu' - Review Thread

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nosferatu_2024) \- 93% (57 Reviews)
* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \- 83 (24 Reviews)

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):

&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director’s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):

&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):

&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.

[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):

&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):

&gt;Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):

&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.

[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):

&gt;It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):

&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.

The Independent (100):

&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.

Written and Directed by Robert Eggers:

&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.

Release Date: December 25

* Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok

Nor the ones with horrible accents like Michael Caine and Charlie Hunnam (no idea what accent he has, he's bad at every possible accent)

movies,Scenes that need to be freeze-framed because blink and you missed it.,"I don't mean movies that have freeze frames themselves, like Clark punching the air at the end of The Breakfast Club. More like you choosing to pause the movie at a particular scene because it's revealing in some way interesting or revelatory or funny. Basically scenes that contain details you may miss the first time viewing.

For example there is that famous head splitting scene from T2 that you need to freeze the frame to see. Guy's head splits before being shot at. [https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png](https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png)

But I prefer more focus on interesting details in scenes than ""mistakes.""

Like in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, there are several scenes that need to be freezed, such as one involving Tom reading the paper. Sort of easter egg hunt thing.

movies,"The original April O'Neil, Judith Hoag, got top billing in the very successful ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (1990), and was a co-lead. Yet, unlike the Turtles, the leading lady didn't come back for the sequels. What happened?","I grew up watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", it was among my favorite childhood films. It was entertaining, engrossing, funny, thrilling and even moving. 

As engaging and charismatic as the Turtles were, April O'Neil, their human friend, wasn't sidelined as the ""token chick"". April had her own agency, she was smart and spunky and funny while never taking the spotlight away from the Turtles. She also had a romantic subplot with Casey Jones, played by Elias Koteas, and their scenes together sizzle with humorous chemistry. 

I liked Judith Hoag a lot, she'll always be April O'Neil. Unfortunately, Judith Hoag didn't return, she got recast with Paige Turco for the sequels and unlike Hoag, Turco was more supporting instead of a co-lead. Turco wasn't bad, she did the best with what she got, yet Hoag had a charm which was lacking in Turco's April. 

I've never found a proper reason of why Hoag didn't return. The most I got was Hoag quit because she disapproved of the ""violence"" in the film, which I don't get. It's a martial arts film about antromorphic Turtles, she wasn't given the script for ""Teletubbies"".",Peter_Omun,1h52tli,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h52tli/the_original_april_oneil_judith_hoag_got_top/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h52tli/the_original_april_oneil_judith_hoag_got_top/,2024-12-02 19:05:38,625,0.91,625,0,214,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h52tli
