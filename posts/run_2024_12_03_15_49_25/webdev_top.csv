webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,121,0.81,121,0,173,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

webdev,Is it overkill to learn this tech stack for an MVP?,"I'm new to web dev, with a couple simple projects under my belt, but my next project is aiming to be more ambitious creating a social media / blogging platform.

I've done some research and the tech stack that seems to make most sense is:

Backend: Node.js (Express), Supabase (as includes auth)  
Frontend: React (+ React Query), Tailwind CSS  
Hosting: Railway (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), S3 (Images)

However I have no experience with React, Tailwind, Vercel or Supabase (just vanilla CSS + JS, HTML/EJS, PostrgreSQL, hosting on Railway)

So really I want some help understanding:

1. Over the next 3 months, am I likely to have saved more time by learning React + Tailwind + Supabase or is it better to stick with my vanilla stack if I'm aiming to maximise progress in 3 months?
2. If I were to create my MVP using my current ""vanilla"" stack and hire a software dev in 3 months, would there likely be lots of technical debt to overcome or would converting to the new stack be relatively easy?

React seems to be the really big one to learn, so I'm also considering just learning tailwind + supabase, and leaving React for later.

webdev,Is This Login/Signup System Secure and Efficient? Looking for Feedback,"Hi, I’ve built a login/signup system for my website and would love your feedback. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sign-Up Flow**

* User fills out name, email, password (validated for strength) and completes hCaptcha.
* Frontend sends a POST request to /api/auth/register with user data and hCaptcha token.
* Server validates data, verifies hCaptcha, and creates a ""pending user"" with:
   * Hashed password, 6-digit OTP (valid 5 mins), and expiration (30 mins).
* OTP is emailed to the user for verification.
* On valid OTP, a user account is created, and the pending entry is removed.

**2. Sign-In Flow**

* User enters email/password.
* Server verifies credentials and creates a session via NextAuth.
* On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

**3. Additional Security**

* Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
* Failed logins tracked for account lockout.
* Background task clears expired pending users every 5 minutes.
* Password resets use the same OTP process as registration.

**4. Session Management**

* Handled by NextAuth with token storage in cookies.

**Questions:**

* Is this secure enough?
* Any improvements to the email verification or overall flow?
* Other tips for a better user experience or security?

webdev,Monorepo architecture and scopes,"Monorepo architecture

Hi there! I’m using NX with Angular for a monorepo (but I don’t think this issue is specific to Angular nor NX) (4 projects, multiple libraries). As the repo is growing, the current library structure feels unsustainable, and responsibilities between modules are becoming unclear. Here's the current setup:

# Current Library Structure

1. `libs/features`
   * Each ""screen"" (micro-frontend) gets its own library.
   * **Problem:** Shared logic across screens creates overlapping responsibilities.
2. `libs/services`
   * Libraries aligned with backend microservices, split into subcategories:
      * **UI:** Frontend-specific logic/components for an ""entity"" such as order-card.
      * **Feature:** Core functionality (but sometimes imports across services, which feels wrong). Could be a smart search screen for orders, an oder dialog etc.
      * **Data-access:** Backend-specific data handling logic. Like order-rest/websockets
   * **Problem:** The ""feature"" sub-lib crosses boundaries and doesn’t align with service isolation. And it doesnt seem to make sense since its generally more defined by the wanted frontend functionality.
3. `libs/shared`
   * Shared functionality, including:
      * Config
      * Notifications handling
      * Shared UI components not tied to entities

# Questions

1. **UI Libraries**
   * Should all UI components be consolidated under `libs/shared/ui` and divided into sub-libraries/categories (e.g., `shared/ui/&lt;category&gt;`)?
2. **Backend vs. Frontend Domains**
   * Should backend-related libraries only include `data-access` and avoid mixing in UI or feature logic?
   * Should the frontend code be reorganized into ""frontend domains,"" where each domain encapsulates:
      * Shared business logic
      * Specific screens (which could eventually become micro-frontends)?

# Goals

* **Clear separation of concerns**
* **Sustainable structure as the repo grows**
* **Logical boundaries between backend services and frontend domains**

# How should I reorganize my libraries to achieve this?

  
Really grateful for any inputs or direction. Im feeling a bit lost at how to best structure this. I think the way to go is splitting things up more by front-end domains. But what sort of library types would be suitable, and which scopes and types should be limited from importing what?

webdev,Best WYSIWYG website editor with full website control? (Leaving Squarespace),"I’m migrating my photography website away from Squarespace because it’s too limiting. I can’t manage my web pages and other media files directly (no FTP or local mounting), making it impossible for me to automate webpage creation amongst other things. 

This makes managing the many photo galleries I have, and something as simple as linking full-res images to every photo a huge pain. The latter is not even possible on Squarespace—when you upload a 12 MP photo to a gallery, it gets downsampled to 1-2 MP and there's no way to view the original-resolution file. Nor can I link the original resolution file to that gallery preview. 

I need a platform where I can control the entire website structure (individual HTML pages and media), ideally with local file system access via FTP or similar. My goal is to use Python scripts to automate tasks like generating new galleries/web pages, uploading images, and linking previews inside a gallery to full-resolution files (Squarespace forcibly downsamples images and the full-res versions are inaccessible to the end user).

What platforms would you recommend for this level of customization? Note that I do prefer a WYSIWYG editor so that I'm not spending hours setting stuff up from scratch, but when I need to do more powerful things like change sections across all my photo galleries, I want the option for stuff like multi-file regex replacements across all my galleries' HTML files.

webdev,I've created a sports competitions draw simulator,"Hey guys!

I'd like to introduce you to **DICEDRAW**, a web project that I've been developing with great pleasure recently. It's a website dedicated to **simulating draws for sports competitions**, currently focused on soccer. It already has draws for the Champions League, Europa League and, more recently, the new Club World Cup. The latter deserves a special mention because we're only a few days away from the official draw, and we can see how things might end up lining up.

The idea is that each draw respects the specific rules of each competition. In other words, nothing will be seen that goes against the rules of the entities. I've also included the new league stages of UEFA competitions, such as the Champions League, which has replaced the group stage.

If you have any suggestions or even ideas for other competitions you'd like to see there, let me know! I'm also accepting contributions to the project's repository, in case you want to get your hands on the code. And if you find it useful, leave a star there, it always gives you a boost of motivation.

I intend to continue evolving the project, and it would be great to have your feedback to make it even better!

webdev,"Trying to send file and data to a Django backend, and I'm just getting errors I shouldn't be getting","We've got a Django backend, and a VueJS + Ionic frontend. I need to send a document and a UUID (that'll link said document to an entity) to the backend, so I'm using MultiPartParser for this, and formData in the frontend.

Here's what my code looks like frontend wise:

      const sendFileAsSearchedJob = async (
        file: PickedFile,
        fileType: string,
        searchedJob: string,
        callback?: () =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;,
      ) =&gt; {
        const { openSuccessToast, openErrorToast } = useToast();
    
        const formData = new FormData();
        const fileBlob = createBlob(file.data, fileType);
        formData.append('file', fileBlob as Blob, file.name);
        formData.append('searchedJob', searchedJob);
    
        try {
          const response = await window.axios.post(
            '/api/searched-job-document/',
            formData,
            {
              headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
              },
            },
          );
          return response.data;
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
          throw error;
        }
      };

So it's all pretty standard, I'm getting a file, creating Blob from it, and sending it to the api

Now backend wise:

    class SearchedJobDocumentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        searched_job = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=SearchedJob.objects.all())
    
        class Meta:
            model = SearchedJobDocument
            fields = (
                'searched_job',
                'name',
                'file',
            )
    
    

    class SearchedJobDocumentViewSet(
        mixins.CreateModelMixin,
        mixins.DestroyModelMixin,
        mixins.RetrieveModelMixin,
        viewsets.GenericViewSet,
    ):
        queryset = SearchedJobDocument.objects.all()
        permission_classes = [IsOwnedByCandidate]
        serializer_class = SearchedJobDocumentSerializer
        parser_classes = (MultiPartParser,)
    
        def get_serializer_class(self):
            if self.request.user:
                return SearchedJobDocumentSerializer
    
        def get_queryset(self):
            user = self.request.user
            return SearchedJobDocument.objects.filter(searched_job__candidate__pk=user.pk)
    
        def perform_create(self, serializer):
            searched_job_uuid = self.request.data.get('searched_job')
            searched_job = get_object_or_404(SearchedJob, uuid=searched_job_uuid, candidate=self.request.user.candidate)
            serializer.save(searched_job=searched_job)

  
Again, nothing that reinvents the wheel. I've changed the code here and there so many times because I either got a 500, or a 400 with no error message, I tried printing the request in the perform\_create but it never worked. Anyway now I finally got a better error in Xcode:

    {""data"":{""file"":[""No file submitted.""],""searchedJob"":[""This field is required""],""statusCode"":400},""headers"":{""vary"":""Cookie, origin"",""date"":""Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:51:10 GMT"",""content-type"":""application\/json"",""x-frame-options"":""SAMEORIGIN"",""x-c

I'm really confused because I'm pretty sure that my frontend should be creating a proper formData. And yet when I try to console.log() the formData or Object.entries(formData), it shows up as an empty object for some reason. I've been stuck on this for 24h.. 

Could anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong please ?

webdev,Looking for Contributers : SOYO a local streaming website ,"Hey, Everyone,

So I recently built this little project called Soyo (Stream Own Your Own), and I thought it might be fun to share it with you all. It's basically a self-hosted streaming service that lets you stream your personal media (anime, movies, etc.) over Wi-Fi. Imagine Plex but simpler, and everything stays on your local network.

Right now, it's a Next.js project styled with Tailwind CSS. I've got the basic functionality up and running, but there's definitely room for improvement.

If this sounds interesting, it’d be super cool if you could:

+ Drop your suggestions
+ Edit some stuff and drop a pr
+ Find out and raise any issues

webdev,Does it really matter if you use * (asterisk) selector for resets?,"I've been studying the basics for a few months and my teacher stresses that using \* ever is very bad for load times and has instead taught me to make a snippet for a meyer's import to use as an alternative, though its annoying that it also resets some things that i want to keep default more often than not, such as the &lt;code&gt; styling. 

meanwhile i see websites, like [twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv) which do use the global selector for margin, padding, and boxsizing properties. 

and while im making a post i might as well ask, why isnt borderbox the default? it's extremely rare that i ever want contentbox set on my elements, and seeing that other websites also use a universal selector for changing this, why hasnt it become a default browser styling?",Smexy_Zarow,1h53zw9,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h53zw9/does_it_really_matter_if_you_use_asterisk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h53zw9/does_it_really_matter_if_you_use_asterisk/,2024-12-02 19:53:26,0,0.38,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h53zw9

webdev,Sanity check: kiwico checkout page doesn't load for any Firefox user?,"I'm in the middle of reporting an issue to KiwiCo's support team but they keep insisting my wifi is slow or I try incognito mode.

The problem is their checkout page hangs while loading and Firefox users cannot enter data into any field or continue.

I've tested across different ISPs, locations, and machines and am certain this is not an end user problem.

Issue only affects the Firefox browser, chrome and edge are working.

I'm unsure if the issue only affects Australian users, it's possible the AU store loads a different checkout than global store.

Would r/webdev be kind enough to test if this behavior is observed universally?

Steps to reproduce:

(Firefox)
1. Go to https://www.kiwico.com/
2. Add any item to cart and go to checkout
3. Enter a random email address to begin checkout
4. Observe no input field can be clicked, Firefox may detect the page crashed

I'd like to know for certain if other users are experiencing this issue so I can relay that to KiwiCo. If you want to go the extra mile and report the issue to them, maybe they'll finally start listening.",Iriskane,1h5foo6,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5foo6/sanity_check_kiwico_checkout_page_doesnt_load_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5foo6/sanity_check_kiwico_checkout_page_doesnt_load_for/,2024-12-03 04:55:17,0,0.25,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5foo6

webdev,How/why is chatgpt free?,"Well, I know it has a paid tier which is far better than the free version, but to me it feels insane to make something such power intensive globally free. Shouldn't they be hemorrhaging money by making it free for everyone?

Couple months ago I tried downloading a much inferior version of an LLM to run on my machine (don't remember the name atm) and my mid-tier PC took over 10 minutes to generate a single response, which was still far, far inferior compared to gpt.

I remember the saying ""if something is free, you're the product"". I'm wondering if that's the case here.

Same goes for Microsoft copilot as well, and that one can generate unlimited images while chatgpt has a limit on free tier. And it's much better at image generation from what I've experienced so far. Response -wise, free tier chatgpt can still kick copilots ass though.

If it's for advertisement, aren't there much better and cheaper ways they could spend their ad budget on? Even so, how on earth does Microsoft need any more advertisement?",mekmookbro,1h5f7y1,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5f7y1/howwhy_is_chatgpt_free/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5f7y1/howwhy_is_chatgpt_free/,2024-12-03 04:27:47,0,0.44,0,0,31,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5f7y1

webdev,why indie developers tend to prefer game startup rather than web startup?,"or at least seem to be...

I think there are still many problems that intermediate computer science undergraduate students can provide solutions to. The public still can't develop web services on their own even if the problems are very easy to solve. And top level engineers spend the same amount of time doing much more value-added activities. In other words, this efficiency keeps some solvable problems unsolved.

Is it because these niches aren't being exploited because they lack marketability and viability?
