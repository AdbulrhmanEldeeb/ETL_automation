devops,Just another DevOps Rant,"Hey r/devops,

I wanted to share my recent experience as a DevOps professional navigating the job market, in hopes it resonates with some of you and maybe even sparks a conversation.

Currently, I’m employed as a DevOps Engineer and have been working in the field for about 1.5 years. Due to recent circumstances, I decided to explore new opportunities and aim higher. I even cleared an interview for a role that required 3 years of experience—a milestone that felt validating for my skills and growth.

I made it through multiple rounds of interviews for a promising role, only to get rejected at the final stage. What stings more is that I was honest about my unconventional background—pursuing a BSCS while already working in DevOps. My technical skills and experience were enough to pass every challenge they threw at me, but in the end, my degree (or lack thereof) became the deal-breaker.

Here’s a bit of my background: Before transitioning into tech, I was pursuing Chartered Accountancy (CA). Life took unexpected turns, and I had to pivot. The skills I gained from that journey—discipline, analytical thinking, and resilience—have shaped who I am today.

But for some companies, that time doesn’t count as ""relevant experience."" It’s frustrating because by the time I graduate, I’ll have around 3 years of solid hands-on DevOps experience, yet many organizations may still see me as a “fresher.”

Despite the setback, I’m not giving up but tbh it stings. Rejections like these remind me why I chose this field in the first place—continuous learning, problem-solving, and the thrill of building scalable systems but sincerely, rejection hurts. I know my worth, and I sincerley hope there’s a company out there that values skills and grit over paperwork.

To my fellow DevOps enthusiasts: Have any of you faced similar challenges? How do you navigate hiring processes when your path isn’t “traditional”? I’d love to hear your stories or any advice you have to share.

Thanks for reading. Here’s to bouncing back stronger and finding the right fit!",xheavenx1,1h5m20r,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h5m20r/just_another_devops_rant/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h5m20r/just_another_devops_rant/,2024-12-03 12:14:46,13,0.7,13,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5m20r
devops,Just another DevOps rant ,"I'm a DevOps engineer with 6 years of experience and +4 SysAdmin/Cloud background.

During the final round of a four-stage job interview, one of the interviewers looked at my resume and said:

***""Six years and this many technologies? It's impossible that you've been able to focus and specialize in anything.""***

And I thought to myself: *""Don't you know what a DevOps engineer is? 4 rounds and then this?""*

It doesn't matter what kind of technology or programming language you throw at me. If it's needed, I'll learn it, solve the problem you present, and maintain the solution.

If that technology becomes irrelevant, I'll move on to learning the next one and migrate the whole thing.

*That's what I love about this job, and I believe it's a key factor in our success as DevOps engineers.*

What exactly are all these ""old CS dinosaurs"" expecting about us?

For me, there's a gap between how the IT world was viewed in the past, how people are interviewed, and **what the actual job entails today.**

What's the point of asking me the difference between a tuple and a list?

What's the point of asking me the difference between a public and private method?

You have my resume, my GitHub, my references. I've described to you how I would build a complete API for a blue/green deployment, A/B testing, or whatever else you need, we talked about core concepts related to CICD, hexagonal architechture, Kubernetes, AWS, IaC, whatever.

Why do they feel the need to ask me dumb CS, leetcode and very specific yaml key questions like that?

God! It's frustrating,

**I build things; I’m not in college taking exams.**

**Well, just another rant, tech interviews are really broken imo,** I'm not going to specialize in tools that will become obsolete in a few years.

My answer was something like:

*""My value lies in understanding the problems presented and figuring out how to tackle them. The technology I use depends more on the consensus regarding the architecture, as long as I’m not the one responsible for designing the solution. For me, the technology itself is not as relevant as being able to adapt to whatever requirements are necessary.""*

I didn’t feel like he was very convinced.

**It's like they are trying to assess if you know how to add when what you're actually doing is building airplanes. I don't add with my fingers; I use a calculator.**

Edit:

One of my main tasks is building deployment APIs, Traefik plugins, and developing in Go, Java, Python, or whatever is needed. It just doesn’t make sense to me—this wasn’t a junior position, and those questions don’t truly reflect what I’m capable of.

To all those in the comments doubting my abilities simply because I’m not a walking textbook:

 You’re exactly the kind of people this post is directed at—you don’t understand where the role is going, I wish you good luck in the generative, agents and self-fixing code era! I hope, for everyones sake, you never sit at the interviewer’s table.

-----

I’ll have the final answer next week; I’ll update the post.

devops,"Does it make sense to set up a docker image to be used as a sidecar for all applications, in order to set up continuous validation for zero-trust architecture with JWT?","I’m looking to set up a “zero trust” cloud system for managing and working with data on AWS. I’m hoping someone who’s implemented “zero trust” system architecture before can levy in on my idea here. Is it reasonable? Is it ideal for a small team?

I’m imagining that something like this:
- I set up an EC2 profile for every service I want to host on EC2 machines. Each profile has its own security group that strictly allows for communication only with the resources the service needs.
- I set up authc with SSO, using RBAC. Maybe Cognito. Have it issue JWT.
- I set up an API gateway in front of the network. The API gateway validates JWT before routing to any resources, or redirects to an authc portal.
- Every node hosting a service has a local reverse proxy sitting in front of the service—let’s say Traefik. Its job will be to validate all JWT before routing requests to the service process, or deny the request.

I also want to implement Open Policy Agent for “higher level authorization.” Rather than JWT validation, OPA would be responsible for enforcing RBAC and ABAC. This would either be set up as a service on the network, that all nodes can reach, or as a local library on each node with a centralized policy configuration.

 I don’t know what I’m asking really—as I’m still a bit new to some of this. Is my plan reasonable, is it overdoing things? What are the right questions?

devops,lost my job last year and I'm finding it quite difficult to find local job postings specifically looking for build/release engineers. am i pigeonholing myself in my career into something that's just an IT role? What exactly HAS my role become now? What skills am I missing?,"i graduated out of school 3 years ago, did software dev for 1 year and then i was lucky enough to pivot into another job where the shop was c++.

they had no CI/CD pipelines, so I spent two years there architecting the ci/cd pipelines, spending most of my time maintaining their on-premise linux build stations, CMake/python/bash scripting. I didn't code, but I would apply the same sofware engineering principles to YAML to build complex DAG pipelines, used Docker (didn't touch Kubernetes though).

i was lucky enough to have a manager teach me about Release processes, versioning, and I was managing complex git branches between various teams and merging them. during my time there I barely touched upon c++.

i lost my job for reasons and I'm looking for a new job and I'm struggling to find anything related to build/release engineering. 

When I look for DevOps roles, most of them involve cloud AWS/azure which I have no experience in which makes it very difficult to even score an interview. most ""devops"" job postings seems to cast an incredibly wide net that ranges from IT to mostly cloud architecture.

Typically I try to keep myself a generalist while specializing in something and my approach is that I would be a generalist software developer while specializing in DevOps. 

I have 3 years of experience under my belt, but because I am a generalist I think it's pretty tough to ever apply for senior jobs where they ask that an individual has **specifically 10 years in x/y/z programming language**, so many places I'm applying to are looking at me as a junior - for example, i applied for a C# 3D programmer job and the person who interviewed me for the role was Senior C# but he would maintain the CI/CD pipelines, so even if I tried to sell myself that I have extensive CI/CD experience it didn't seem to impress him much.


There's a part of me that wants to become an expert in C++ and be a software architect but i tend to get really anxious when dealing with data structures and algoritms, but I also find joy in being able to work as ""a developer for developers"", maintaining infrastructure and scaling automations (which I feel is absolutely crucial to setup before working on development).

Anyways, I guess I'm still new in my career and I'm trying to find myself.  I thought that being a DevOps engineer, I could also sell myself equally as a Software Engineer, but it seems that there's a splitting path and I might have to choose.

Just wondering if anyone has gone through this and what would you suggest for me to pick up in terms of skills to ensure that I am employable?",V3Qn117x0UFQ,1h544to,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h544to/lost_my_job_last_year_and_im_finding_it_quite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h544to/lost_my_job_last_year_and_im_finding_it_quite/,2024-12-02 19:59:01,2,0.58,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h544to
