learnprogramming,Is freelancing dead ? Feeling Nervous about starting as a web developer,"
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently learning web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and planning to dive into React soon). My ultimate goal is to become a freelance front-end developer. However, as I scroll through discussions online, I keep coming across people saying that freelancing is dead or too saturated to succeed in anymore.

This has left me feeling nervous about my decision. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just overthinking or if the market really is as bad as people make it seem. I know freelancing isn‚Äôt easy, especially for beginners, but I really want to make this work.

For those of you with experience:
	‚Ä¢	Is freelancing still a viable option in 2024?
	‚Ä¢	How can a beginner like me stand out in such a competitive field?
	‚Ä¢	Are there any strategies or niches I should focus on as a web developer to improve my chances of success?

Any advice, experiences, or even just a reality check would be appreciated.

learnprogramming,From Tutorial Hell to Subscription Hell to AI Hell: My Journey of Learning Nothing,"They said: ""Leave YouTube tutorials and learn from well-structured paid courses."" So, I left tutorial hell and felt relieved‚Äîfinally, some direction! However, I soon found myself in a new trap: subscription hell. These courses were indeed well-structured but offered no practical or real-life projects. Tic-Tac-Toe, calculators, hangman games‚Äîbasic syntax and logic, but nothing that felt like genuine progress.

Frustrated, I sought out more serious and professional paid subscriptions, believing they would provide profound and comprehensive knowledge. Yet, I was met with courses spanning 80 hours of videos (seriously?) and still no meaningful success. Desperate for progress, I turned to platforms like DataCamp, only to find their content too shallow and overly simplistic. Real-life problems are vastly different from what these resources cover.

Seeing no progress and feeling increasingly unmotivated, I found myself drowning in an endless sea of YouTube tutorials, paid subscriptions, and shallow content. Then came ChatGPT. At first, it felt like a breakthrough‚Äîit solved my problems on demand. But even then, I found myself struggling to truly understand the code or grasp the deeper concepts. It felt like I was forgetting what programming was even supposed to be.

Now, I‚Äôm still determined to learn programming but plagued by confusion. Should I start with Java and then move to Python? Or begin with Python because it's supposedly easy and ubiquitous? And yet, Python's syntax feels clunky and unbearable to me. Why am I stuck in this endless cycle of `if`, `else`, and first-class syntax?

learnprogramming,PRNG in X: Getting used to a new language's essential syntax.,"Hi there! I'm mostly a C and x86\_64 assembly dev who's been dabbling in Rust, but I had a random idea - write a very small project which I'm very familiar with, an LCG PRNG, once in a bunch of different languages.

A PRNG, if you don't know already, is a pseudo-random number generator, and is essentially a group of algorithms which define how computers generate ""random"" numbers. Note the quotes and the word *pseudo* because they aren't really random - they start with a seed value, which is often the time, then generate the next random number based on that, the next one based on that previous one, and so on. LCG, or linear congruential generator, is a very very simple algorithm for PRNGs (see the wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_congruential\_generator).

My concept is this: A very very simple program, a PRNG, implemented in various different languages (so far: x86\_64 NASM assembly, C, C++, Rust, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Python), which makes for a very easy way to learn the syntax. No heavy commenting besides one at the start of the file and at the start of each function, no huge explanation, no complicated concepts of the language. Just the essential syntax.

Hopefully this is useful to at least one person. **Please note** that I am not an expert at all these languages, and as I've said near the start, most of my knowledge is in C and Assembly, meaning that some of the implementations in other languages may not be perfect. If you see something wrong, feel free to leave a comment or open a pull request.

learnprogramming,is it possible to create DATA STRUCTURE CONCEPTS from scratch without prior knowledge?,"# conclusion

Edit2: I've worded many parts of this post in a bad way, so now this is basically my conclusion/decision to hopefully clear up my question.  
\--How should I go about creating my own implementations of ""data structures, methods, and algorithms""  
before learning them?--  
the main purpose of my post was to figure what I wanted. I thought I wanted to learn basic functions in C to try recreate data structures.  
I've now come to realize that I only want to create my own implementations of existing data structs, algorithms, and methods.  
I've decided to roughly to follow idea 2, and along with some suggestions/guides from others.

**Yapp** (this is just me yapping)  
honestly the rest of my post from here has become a mess and confusion to anyone trying to read and know what I'm asking. I'm considering restructuring the whole thing to clean it up but that will probably make it worse.  
I have my answer now and my post is \[**SOLVED**\] so I will just leave it alone.  
thanks to everyone for the help, and suggestions. my wishes have been fulfilled and my gratitude shall be.., for as long as I remember.  
\---

Edit1: After reading some of the replies I have a better idea of my question  
\-what fundamentals (in C or other lang) like **pointers, memory allocation, etc..**  
do I need to know to try create my own implementations of common **data structures.**

I will be learning them in my own time I would just like a rough list of which functions and concepts are used to make the data structures without learning the data structures themselves.

# original question:

I know what I want but I don't know the right question but basically..

I want to try and create data structures (in C),  
Without learning them or following a tutorial.

so no prior knowledge on how to make them but I know generally what they are (lists, arrays, dicts, ...) and the basic methods (append, insert, delete, etc..).

Sort of like re-inventing the wheel,, maybe?(idk).

If anyone (that's learnt data structures and such) thinks this is a fools errand and has an alternative suggestion they think is better please write. I'm open to suggestions and not absolutely set on this path.

# Disclaimer

I will be searching for materials and thinking of ways to do this. I'm just posting in here because it will be a lot easier for someone who already knows the structure and insights of data structures to tell me what is needed **before** I learn the data structures.

# Idea 1

My first idea of navigating this is to learn the things you need to know to make/write data structures..  
(pointers, the stack, and functions that work with those)  
*I don't know much of the things (functions, structures, etc) needed to write them,*  
*because learning about those would probably include learning a data structure which I want to try*  
*create myself without prior knowledge.*

*I will do some searching for those after this post.*  
\- then choose a data structure and see what it does on the surface, basic input and output  
and try to recreate the 'inner' code for the data struct and then the methods for that struct

# Idea 2

edit1()  
learn 1 or two of the basic data structures then look at a 3rd one and how it works but not how to implement it.  
and create my own implementation  
~~and what it does from a surface level perspective and try to recreate the inner workings~~ .

# --

\-some may think it's 'better' (more efficient) to just learn them and focus on how to utilise them. But this is just something I think will be fun..

If anyone would be so kind to humor me. I would be much obliged. ;)

**side notes**

programming is a hobby for me. I've briefly learned the basics of python3, and have done a handful of scripting projects(AHKv2). So I'm not really worried about trouble learning the fundamentals of C but more-so focused on knowing what I need to learn.
