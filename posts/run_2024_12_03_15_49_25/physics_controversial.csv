Physics,Is it possible to change from experimental to theoretical physics for the PhD?,"**Concisely:** My main 'background' is theoretical. I chose *solid-state theory* and *theoretical particle physics* as my Masters modules (Germany) and finished them with very good grades but decided to go to our experimental physics department specializing in STMs and superconductance (i.e. exp. solid state physics). My Masters thesis is rather theoretical for an exp. phys. thesis. Is it usually still possible to find PhD positions for solid state *theory* (or if I decide to loose my mind TPP) after I graduate or is the switch really hard?

**More details:** I didn't want to do particle physics for personal/philosophical reasons and not because I don't like the subject. After basically 5 years of pure theory I was just a bit frustrated and wanted to do something with actual atoms but I noticed that it's mainly the theory I am interested in and not so much how the STM works.",Hellstorme,1h5nifb,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h5nifb/is_it_possible_to_change_from_experimental_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h5nifb/is_it_possible_to_change_from_experimental_to/,2024-12-03 13:34:54,3,0.61,3,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h5nifb
Physics,Best Programming Language to Learn as a High School Junior,"Hi everyone! I'm I junior in high school, and I am very interesting in majoring in astrophysics in college. I was wondering what the best coding language to learn right now. I am sort of familiar with python, and I took some coding classes in 8th grade with python, but it has obviously been a while. Also, do you recommend any free online courses that I can take to learn the language? Sorry if someone has already asked this, I just was not able to find a post specifically asking for high schoolers. Thank you!",Formal_Ebb3537,1h5nwf4,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h5nwf4/best_programming_language_to_learn_as_a_high/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h5nwf4/best_programming_language_to_learn_as_a_high/,2024-12-03 13:54:29,1,0.55,1,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5nwf4
