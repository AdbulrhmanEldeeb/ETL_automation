learnprogramming,From Tutorial Hell to Subscription Hell to AI Hell: My Journey of Learning Nothing,"They said: ""Leave YouTube tutorials and learn from well-structured paid courses."" So, I left tutorial hell and felt relieved—finally, some direction! However, I soon found myself in a new trap: subscription hell. These courses were indeed well-structured but offered no practical or real-life projects. Tic-Tac-Toe, calculators, hangman games—basic syntax and logic, but nothing that felt like genuine progress.

Frustrated, I sought out more serious and professional paid subscriptions, believing they would provide profound and comprehensive knowledge. Yet, I was met with courses spanning 80 hours of videos (seriously?) and still no meaningful success. Desperate for progress, I turned to platforms like DataCamp, only to find their content too shallow and overly simplistic. Real-life problems are vastly different from what these resources cover.

Seeing no progress and feeling increasingly unmotivated, I found myself drowning in an endless sea of YouTube tutorials, paid subscriptions, and shallow content. Then came ChatGPT. At first, it felt like a breakthrough—it solved my problems on demand. But even then, I found myself struggling to truly understand the code or grasp the deeper concepts. It felt like I was forgetting what programming was even supposed to be.

Now, I’m still determined to learn programming but plagued by confusion. Should I start with Java and then move to Python? Or begin with Python because it's supposedly easy and ubiquitous? And yet, Python's syntax feels clunky and unbearable to me. Why am I stuck in this endless cycle of `if`, `else`, and first-class syntax?

Am I missing something? Why can’t I break out of this loop?",Prestigious_Flow_465,1h51yoc,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h51yoc/from_tutorial_hell_to_subscription_hell_to_ai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h51yoc/from_tutorial_hell_to_subscription_hell_to_ai/,2024-12-02 18:30:45,110,0.9,110,0,22,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1h51yoc
learnprogramming,Just wanna be a great programmer,"I know this question might seem a bit silly and ordinary, but I really want to ask it. I'm genuinely passionate about software, programming, and especially game development. I believe I have a good understanding of these areas and that I'm quite detail-oriented. Before starting to learn programming, it makes sense to evaluate career opportunities first. Which programming language would you recommend starting with to become a game developer? (Some people say Rust will be very promising in the future. Do you think I should start with Rust?) If breaking into the gaming industry is too challenging, which other language or sector in programming should I focus on?

I'd appreciate it if you could also recommend some resources to help me get started learn effectively.

learnprogramming,Where are these weird numbers coming from? (simple C adding program),"Hi all

So I'm just beginning to dip my toes into C here, and after my obligatory Hello World program I decided to try something a little more ambitious using `scanf` and a simple function. Well, after a frustrating couple of hours of weeding the syntax errors out of an ostensibly stupid simple add-two-numbers program (that I came up with *without* referring to a tutorial) I got something that successfully compiled. I'm sure I did everything wrong anyway, but the results are particularly peculiar. Here's the program:

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int sum (int a, int b, int answer);
    int main ()
    {
        int a;
        int b;
        int answer;
        printf (""Enter two numbers dammit: "");
        scanf (""%d, %d"", &amp;a, &amp;b);
        printf (""The two numbers are: %d, %d"", a, b);
        printf (""The answer is: %d"", answer);
        printf (""\n"");
        return 0;
    }
    int sum (int a, int b, int answer)
    {
        answer = a + b;
        return answer;
    }

And here is what I get:

    Enter two numbers dammit: 3 5
    The two numbers are: 3, 708928112The answer is: 32766

Wtf?

I'm guessing it has to do with either a poorly written function or something having to do with `scanf` . Specifically something about the variables and the `&amp;a / &amp;b` variables vs `a / b` as I understand that the &amp; signifies that they're pointers to the actual variable values. I still don't understand a lot of that stuff, so please feel free to pick this piece of crud apart and tell me where I screwed up, I'd be most appreciative.

learnprogramming,is it possible to create DATA STRUCTURE CONCEPTS from scratch without prior knowledge?,"# conclusion

Edit2: I've worded many parts of this post in a bad way, so now this is basically my conclusion/decision to hopefully clear up my question.  
\--How should I go about creating my own implementations of ""data structures, methods, and algorithms""  
before learning them?--  
the main purpose of my post was to figure what I wanted. I thought I wanted to learn basic functions in C to try recreate data structures.  
I've now come to realize that I only want to create my own implementations of existing data structs, algorithms, and methods.  
I've decided to roughly to follow idea 2, and along with some suggestions/guides from others.

**Yapp** (this is just me yapping)  
honestly the rest of my post from here has become a mess and confusion to anyone trying to read and know what I'm asking. I'm considering restructuring the whole thing to clean it up but that will probably make it worse.  
I have my answer now and my post is \[**SOLVED**\] so I will just leave it alone.  
thanks to everyone for the help, and suggestions. my wishes have been fulfilled and my gratitude shall be.., for as long as I remember.  
\---

Edit1: After reading some of the replies I have a better idea of my question  
\-what fundamentals (in C or other lang) like **pointers, memory allocation, etc..**  
do I need to know to try create my own implementations of common **data structures.**

I will be learning them in my own time I would just like a rough list of which functions and concepts are used to make the data structures without learning the data structures themselves.

# original question:

I know what I want but I don't know the right question but basically..

I want to try and create data structures (in C),  
Without learning them or following a tutorial.

so no prior knowledge on how to make them but I know generally what they are (lists, arrays, dicts, ...) and the basic methods (append, insert, delete, etc..).

Sort of like re-inventing the wheel,, maybe?(idk).

If anyone (that's learnt data structures and such) thinks this is a fools errand and has an alternative suggestion they think is better please write. I'm open to suggestions and not absolutely set on this path.

# Disclaimer

I will be searching for materials and thinking of ways to do this. I'm just posting in here because it will be a lot easier for someone who already knows the structure and insights of data structures to tell me what is needed **before** I learn the data structures.

# Idea 1

My first idea of navigating this is to learn the things you need to know to make/write data structures..  
(pointers, the stack, and functions that work with those)  
*I don't know much of the things (functions, structures, etc) needed to write them,*  
*because learning about those would probably include learning a data structure which I want to try*  
*create myself without prior knowledge.*

*I will do some searching for those after this post.*  
\- then choose a data structure and see what it does on the surface, basic input and output  
and try to recreate the 'inner' code for the data struct and then the methods for that struct

# Idea 2

edit1()  
learn 1 or two of the basic data structures then look at a 3rd one and how it works but not how to implement it.  
and create my own implementation  
~~and what it does from a surface level perspective and try to recreate the inner workings~~ .

# --

\-some may think it's 'better' (more efficient) to just learn them and focus on how to utilise them. But this is just something I think will be fun..

If anyone would be so kind to humor me. I would be much obliged. ;)

**side notes**

programming is a hobby for me. I've briefly learned the basics of python3, and have done a handful of scripting projects(AHKv2). So I'm not really worried about trouble learning the fundamentals of C but more-so focused on knowing what I need to learn.

I am considering to do the same with sorting-algorithms and the like. if anyone has any comment on that but I think I'll save that for another time/post.",xtyzii,1h5jpot,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h5jpot/is_it_possible_to_create_data_structure_concepts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h5jpot/is_it_possible_to_create_data_structure_concepts/,2024-12-03 09:32:53,3,1.0,3,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h5jpot

learnprogramming,PRNG in X: Getting used to a new language's essential syntax.,"Hi there! I'm mostly a C and x86\_64 assembly dev who's been dabbling in Rust, but I had a random idea - write a very small project which I'm very familiar with, an LCG PRNG, once in a bunch of different languages.

A PRNG, if you don't know already, is a pseudo-random number generator, and is essentially a group of algorithms which define how computers generate ""random"" numbers. Note the quotes and the word *pseudo* because they aren't really random - they start with a seed value, which is often the time, then generate the next random number based on that, the next one based on that previous one, and so on. LCG, or linear congruential generator, is a very very simple algorithm for PRNGs (see the wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_congruential\_generator).

My concept is this: A very very simple program, a PRNG, implemented in various different languages (so far: x86\_64 NASM assembly, C, C++, Rust, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Python), which makes for a very easy way to learn the syntax. No heavy commenting besides one at the start of the file and at the start of each function, no huge explanation, no complicated concepts of the language. Just the essential syntax.

Hopefully this is useful to at least one person. **Please note** that I am not an expert at all these languages, and as I've said near the start, most of my knowledge is in C and Assembly, meaning that some of the implementations in other languages may not be perfect. If you see something wrong, feel free to leave a comment or open a pull request.

I'm a student and I have a project about QR code but I’ve encountered some technical questions that I hope you might help me clarify.

2)If my message is short, the QR code won't need a lot of space for the correction code, so what will be on the remaining space?  


3)In what cases the reader fail to scan the QR code?

learnprogramming,Are these string formats in scanf function in C language same or different [EXCERSISE],"There is an excersise in the book ""C programming A modern approach"" second edition by K.N King in chapter 3.

For each of the following pairs of **scanf** format strings,indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent.If they're not,show how they can be distinguished.

a) ""**%d**""               versus          "" **%d**""

b)""**%d-%d-%d**""   versus     ""**%d -%d -%d**""

c)""**%f**""                 versus     ""**%f** ""

d)""**%f,%f**""           versus      ""**%f, %f**""

Ok,I am sure that first two are equal,because scanf will ignore spaces in format string.

I am sure that in c) they are not the same,because scanf will not terminate unless you input non spaces charachters when you leave white space at the end of string formating.

I think that in b) they are not the same.Yes the format string ignore spaces but if the input string is for example ""3 -2 -1"" scanf will read 3 in %d then it will try to match - charachter with white space and scanf will terminate where scanf(""%d -%d -%d"") will read it successfully.

I think d) format strings are the same ,because or charachters match and white space is ignored.

However, I don't know anything about code, not even visual scripting. Function, syntax, etc are all alien languages to me. So I guess **my question is - How much programming knowledge do I need, and if anyone would have some good recommendation/suggestion for me to start?**

Here are some resources I've gathered so far

1. [Python for Beginners](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8?si=twRUu5kiJXmU6w4L)
2. [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev)

I am thinking of starting small, with a snake or tetris project, follow by some Slay the Spire like card games which I think might be a reasonable scale.

learnprogramming,🏎✏ Dotrace game in Js,"After 4 months of development, I'm delighted to present my DotRace game!

This strategic racing game is inspired by the classic game of racing with a pencil on a small sheet of paper (moving points with inertia)... yes, I drew trajectories for a good part of my childhood!

It can be played online at this address: [http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/](http://svaret.free.fr/DotRace/)

Some technical information:

* Choice of game mode :
   * Time Attack: Beat the AI
   * Race: Single race
   * Championship: Several races in a row
* Choice of tracks :
   * Pre-integrated tracks (well-known F1 circuits, spirals, bizarre shapes, etc.)
   * Random track generator with choice (min, max) of total track length, width and length of road sections, angles...
* Player configuration :
   * Up to 4 human players (on the same screen)
   * Opponents with configurable AI level
   * 8 players in tracks
   * Button assistance options (best choice)
* Screen configuration :
   * Quick glance to see the entire track
   * Full screen mode
   * Camera follows player
   * Speed-dependent widening of the view (to “see further”)
* Sound configuration :
   * Choice of 3 sound themes:
      * Sound of marker pen on a sheet of paper
      * Sound of my car (A-Class 250, yes, I'm a 50-year-old)
      * The sound of a spaceship
   * Choice of sound volume for opponents
   * Speed of movement...
* Main path-finding algorithm
   * The main principle of my algorithm is that it doesn't know the arrival points, it just tries to go as far as possible in as few moves as possible. A nice recursive function calculates all possible paths and determines the best one.
   * The “AI level” (variable from 2 to 8 for each player) corresponds to the depth of this recursive search for the best path.
   * The position of opponents is not taken into account when calculating the path, which can lead to accidents and run-offs when the width of the track is reduced and several players covet the same point.
* About 4,000 lines of javascript typed with my old fingers...

My question concerns the possibility of simply running the same code in an android apk? for free?

I am also interested in your suggestions for improving my game.

Thank you.

learnprogramming,Actually centering a plot using Matplotlib,"I've been starting to learn Python and working on some data science, and the problem (more like a nice thing to have) is that when I create plots using `matplotlib.pyplot` they are actually not centered.

What I mean by that is that the box that contains does not have the same number of pixels/same space around all the 4 edges of the picture.

A MWE of that is this:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    x = list(range(10))
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, x)
    ax.set_xlabel(""X axis"")
    ax.set_ylabel(""Y axis"")
    fig.savefig(""test.png"")

If you check the number of pixels between any of the edges and the black box containing the data you can see that by default is not the same.

learnprogramming,Issues with MelonLoader Mod: Non-nullable fields and lambda expressions causing errors,"Hello everyone, I'm working on a mod using MelonLoader and Unity, and I'm encountering a few issues that I can't seem to resolve. I’m creating a simple menu with a button, but I keep running into the following errors:

1. **Non-nullable field 'myButton' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider adding the 'required' modifier or declaring the field as nullable.**
2. **Non-nullable field 'menuCanvas' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider adding the 'required' modifier or declaring the field as nullable.**
3. **Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'UnityAction' because it is not a delegate type.**

Here is the code I’m working with:

using MelonLoader;

using UnityEngine;

using UnityEngine.UI;

namespace Menu

{

public class Class1 : MelonMod

{

private GameObject menuCanvas;

private Button myButton;

private bool menuVisible = false;

public override void OnInitializeMelon()

{

MelonLogger.Msg(""Mod Initialized!"");



CreateMenu();

}

public override void OnUpdate()

{

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.F1)) 

{

menuVisible = !menuVisible;

menuCanvas.SetActive(menuVisible);

}

}

private void CreateMenu()

{



menuCanvas = new GameObject(""ModMenuCanvas"");

Canvas canvas = menuCanvas.AddComponent&lt;Canvas&gt;();

canvas.renderMode = RenderMode.WorldSpace;

RectTransform rectTransform = menuCanvas.GetComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();

rectTransform.sizeDelta = new Vector2(300, 200);

menuCanvas.transform.position = new Vector3(0, 2, 5);



GameObject buttonObject = new GameObject(""MyButton"");

buttonObject.transform.SetParent(menuCanvas.transform);

RectTransform buttonRect = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();

buttonRect.sizeDelta = new Vector2(100, 50);

buttonRect.localPosition = [Vector3.zero](http://Vector3.zero);

myButton = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;Button&gt;();

Text buttonText = buttonObject.AddComponent&lt;Text&gt;();

buttonText.text = ""Click Me!"";

buttonText.font = Resources.GetBuiltinResource&lt;Font&gt;(""Arial.ttf"");

buttonText.color = [Color.black](http://Color.black);



myButton.onClick.AddListener(() =&gt; OnButtonClick());

}

private void OnButtonClick()

{

MelonLogger.Msg(""Button Clicked!"");

}

}

}

**The errors I am encountering:**

1. **Non-nullable field 'myButton' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor.** This seems to be related to the fact that I'm declaring `myButton` as non-nullable, but it's not getting assigned before the constructor ends. I thought that adding it in `CreateMenu()` would fix this, but it still throws the error.
2. **Non-nullable field 'menuCanvas' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor.** Similar issue with `menuCanvas`. It is declared non-nullable, but the assignment happens later in the `CreateMenu()` method.
3. **Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'UnityAction' because it is not a delegate type.** I am using a lambda expression to handle the button click (`myButton.onClick.AddListener(() =&gt; OnButtonClick());`). This causes an error, and I can't figure out how to fix it.

Any ideas or suggestions on how to fix these issues?

learnprogramming,How to approach learning programming from books,"How to approach learning programming from books?

Pick any classic programming book (say, a book from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)). Chances are the book has many pages and many exercises.

If you decide to read through the book and solve all the exercises, that's easily hundreds of hours of work.

Now lets say you lead a normal life with private and professional obligations, but you manage to block 16 h per week for reading and working through exercises of a book.

Lets be optimistic and say that it takes you just 200 h to read the book and do all the exercises. 200 / 16 = 12.5 weeks = 87.5 days \~ almost 3 months.

Is this the best time invested to learn the techniques in the book?

Suppose you're looking for a (new) programming job. Will you put solutions to those exercises in you portfolio? Would that be valuable to your potential employer?

Ideally, you would do all the exercises, than make a project using all the techniques from the book.

learnprogramming,"I have 2 years to teach myself SE, how can I start? ","I would like to become a software engineer and I have two years to kick start this learning journey. 

How would you recommend I start? 

I currently don't have a specific path in mind as to what I want to build. My intention is to be able to make apps, websites, ML, AI etc. 

I know I can't learn that in 2 years but how and where should I start? All I mentioned requires more then 1 language and I heard that it's already difficult to become proficient in 1 language let alone 2.

I just want to forces on the right language and the right skills to develop for the next 2 years in order to hopefully land a job and keep progreseing my career or if the journey is frutfull I continue to learn further. 

So based on your knowledge over the field and what the future will demand in terms of skills, how and where should I start?",Shammar-Yahrish,1h52s4k,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h52s4k/i_have_2_years_to_teach_myself_se_how_can_i_start/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h52s4k/i_have_2_years_to_teach_myself_se_how_can_i_start/,2024-12-02 19:03:58,0,0.4,0,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h52s4k
learnprogramming,AM I cooked?,"Hello, im a beginner programmer and I have been learning python for about 3 months. This semester has been extremely hard for me adjusting to college, and I still can’t code by myself :/ I missed a lot of class due to sickness and mental health. I really want to major in computer science but I need a C to do so, and right now I have a 60 and I’m feeling extremely hopeless. I have approximately 2 weeks left to get my grade up, I missed 6 quizzes and I can make up the quizzes which will boast my grade. But there’s a final exam December 13th and it’s worth 20% of my grade. Is it possible for me to learn all the material, he has all the lectures recorded and I can rewatch them. I have some basic foundations of understanding some concepts.

learnprogramming,I kinda need to learn programming ASAP....,"(Warning, a lot of yapping in the beginnng, but I promise I actually get on track about program-related topic in the end! Just takes some time since there is a LOT of side information that is pretty important to note!)

Hi! I don't know how else to formulate this, but the title kind of sums it up. I'm a 16 year old girl (turning 17) in 2nd year of videregående (Norwegian high school). A little bit irrelevant, but I switched schools to one in a bigger city and I am now living alone, trying to figure out the stress between finding a job, living with other people in a shared house and all the frustrating things that come with that (which there obviously is a lot of surprisingly from college students that live in the same house and the fact that we're 6 people), the stress with having a lot of tests at the same time, struggling with taking physics and the fact that I'm pretty much on my way to failing math. 😅 so there is a lot of baggage.

That's just a small ""backstory"", per se, not that it's way too relevant. Earlier this year I had chemistry, which wasn't for me at all. I couldn't understand anything, a lot because I couldn't really pay attention due to how boring it was and also problem with sleep due to noisy roommates and such, and just frequently waking up at night and never being quite comfortable. This was a new thing for me, always having slept pretty good at other people's houses for sleepovers and of course at home. This lead to me failing the first chemistry test in the end of October with a nice ""1"", which is the failing grade in Norway, 2 being barely passing. Not even a plus or anything, just a simple 1. To try to save my grade, I had to take a test in-person with the two teachers, face to face with what i could only explain as almost as an interrogation to force some information out of it. I tried my best, studied a lot although it wouldn't sit and it was still not enough, and I still failed.

Now here comes the programming part. School in Norway start in August, and we were now in the beginning or middle of November, which nearing the end of the semester, really. Chemistry was a chosen subject, but it was almost way too far in for me to switch. But I knew I kind of had to, so I asked if I could. Between the choices of geoscience and biology, neither of them really interested me, but those were kind of my options. Chosen subjects are sorted into these ""blocks"" in Norway, where you can choose subjects from each block, and you have 4 blocks to fill out. In the block I had Chemistry in, I saw there was also IT 1, or ""Informasjonsteknologi"". Simply, it's just a subject that learns you web design and coding. The school advisor was kind of like ""Straight out, I would tell people just no"", which wasn't a good sign at all. There was a lot almost straight up begging and convincing because of the fact ""at least let me fail in something I would find slightly interesting at least"". My boyfriend was also with me kind of trying to convince, due to the fact he is in the last year (grade 3), and has IT 2, and actually is a grade 6 (highest grade) student in the subject. I got sent to advisor for my grade level, and through there again to the teacher that has IT.

Miraculously I actually managed to get into the class. But now, close to the end of the semester I kind of have to learn coding pretty quickly. I can feel that I can understand coding if I learn it properly and that I have the skills to actually get good at it if I get far enough, but everyone is so far behind me and it's a lot trying to keep track of schoolwork and final tests of this semester that is the same time, learning the same coding my peers are learning while also not even truly even knowing the most standard of standard of coding. I've gotten this ""Arbeidskrav"" that everyone else got where we were going to make a simple website that honestly looked like straight from the 2000s or something, and I got quite frustrated because I felt like it was my boyfriend doing all the work for me instead of me because I had so much trouble with it and couldn't even make a simple website. I also had the same test that the other students had for for 4 classes at the same time as them, but I won't get a grade on it since I started not long ago, just to test my skills, and I could see people actually managing to make a website, while I couldn't even get anything to show on the website, even cheating a lot by asking my boyfriend for help and seeing I made such a stupid mistake of changing where ""Document"" was on one of the side things (&lt;&gt; those things) by accident and not even seeing it myself. The website turned absolute ass, of course (excuse my language), but this is all so frustrating.

I want to learn programming, and I don't want to leech of my boyfriend, at all. I want to learn it by myself and I just get angry at both myself and him when I have to ask for help all the time, although he is happy to help. It won't help in tests, and I'm ashamed I cheated on the last one even if it wasn't graded for me (although it was graded for everyone else). I just have difficulties on how to learn coding quickly? There was one problem, which was, how will I get a grade without no assignments? Well, that I got answered today. We are going to make websites for companies in the local community for free (real companies this is), and everyone is doing it individually, except for me and another guy that is also new. We will be collaborating with someone else that has been in the class since day one, or in other words, leeching off of the work of someone else. Although I'm grateful that my grade won't be ruined, I still want to contribute and not just leech of others, as I am expected to also work on the website of course. But how can I contribute not knowing anything? This is why I want to learn it quickly, so that I can truly actually be a helping hand instead of a burden for the team. This is a lot of text, and I'm sorry for that, but is there any help with starting?

Edit: Forgot to add one last thing: fyi we just learned some basic php (which i don't understand a lot of), and my class have learned a lot of basic css and html, from my knowledge at least... but everything is kind of a whirlwind in my brain for me and just a mess.",fromis_apink,1h520ri,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h520ri/i_kinda_need_to_learn_programming_asap/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h520ri/i_kinda_need_to_learn_programming_asap/,2024-12-02 18:33:05,0,0.29,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h520ri
