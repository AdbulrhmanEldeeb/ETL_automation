Physics,Please help me understand this unit.,"So I'm a medical student, and reading paediatrics. The treatment for neonatal jaundice involves using phototherapy in which the irradiance needed is 30 microwatts/cm²/nm. I can understand the power per unit area, but why is manometer also mentioned in the unit. What does it mean in a sentence? Like I can figure out the unit is trying to tell me 30 microwatts per 1 cm² area, but where does the nm fall into place? 

I think it's about the wavelength, but can someone explain it to me in a sentence?(Like acceleration unit is changing m/s every second= m/s²).",According_Tourist_69,1h37b7f,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h37b7f/please_help_me_understand_this_unit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h37b7f/please_help_me_understand_this_unit/,2024-11-30 07:22:54,17,0.85,17,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h37b7f

Physics,I Wrote a Guide to Simulation in Python with SimPy,"Hi folks,

I wrote a guide on discrete-event simulation with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to help you learn how to build simulations using Python. Kind of like the official documentation but on steroids.

I have used SimPy personally in my own career for over a decade, it was central in helping me build a [pretty successful engineering career](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1gh8at0/my_13_year_nontraditional_meche_career_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling real world industrial systems such as factories, mines, railways, etc.

My latest venture is teaching others all about this.

If you do get the guide, I’d really appreciate any feedback you have. Feel free to drop your thoughts here in the thread or DM me directly!

Here’s the link to get the guide: [https://simulation.teachem.digital/free-simulation-in-python-guide](https://simulation.teachem.digital/free-simulation-in-python-guide)

For full transparency, why do I ask for your email?

Well I’m working on a full course following on from my previous [Udemy course on Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-engineers-scientists-and-analysts/?referralCode=8E30A5C432085F42D090). This new course will be all about real-world modelling and simulation with SimPy, and I’d love to keep you in the loop via email. If you found the guide helpful you would might be interested in the course. That said, you’re completely free to hit “unsubscribe” after the guide arrives if you prefer.",bobo-the-merciful,1h3d1c1,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h3d1c1/i_wrote_a_guide_to_simulation_in_python_with_simpy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h3d1c1/i_wrote_a_guide_to_simulation_in_python_with_simpy/,2024-11-30 13:53:47,3,1.0,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3d1c1
Physics,Time Estimation ,"If time perception is understood to be based on the number of changes in an event than does that simply mean the busier you are the faster time passes? (intuitively that makes sense). But how does that acually relate back to the physical passing of time. Also is time a constant or can it really change. I know about the concept that if you start at atomic clock on earth and one in a spaceship and send it to space when it comes back that clock will be at an early time than the earth clock. Does that mean you would actually physically age less? Like if I went to space and came back I would die later than a version of myself that stayed on earth? 

I know I do not understand this fully and it doesn't quite compute in my brain.

Normal matter as percent over dark matter, then use this number to work put the amount of bending caused by the gravity on light, then the percent of the mass there could be the density?
