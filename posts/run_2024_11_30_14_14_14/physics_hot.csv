Physics,I Wrote a Guide to Simulation in Python with SimPy,"Hi folks,

I wrote a guide on discrete-event simulation with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to help you learn how to build simulations using Python. Kind of like the official documentation but on steroids.

I have used SimPy personally in my own career for over a decade, it was central in helping me build a [pretty successful engineering career](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1gh8at0/my_13_year_nontraditional_meche_career_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling real world industrial systems such as factories, mines, railways, etc.

My latest venture is teaching others all about this.

If you do get the guide, I’d really appreciate any feedback you have. Feel free to drop your thoughts here in the thread or DM me directly!

Here’s the link to get the guide: [https://simulation.teachem.digital/free-simulation-in-python-guide](https://simulation.teachem.digital/free-simulation-in-python-guide)

For full transparency, why do I ask for your email?

Well I’m working on a full course following on from my previous [Udemy course on Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-engineers-scientists-and-analysts/?referralCode=8E30A5C432085F42D090). This new course will be all about real-world modelling and simulation with SimPy, and I’d love to keep you in the loop via email.

Physics,Time Estimation ,"If time perception is understood to be based on the number of changes in an event than does that simply mean the busier you are the faster time passes? (intuitively that makes sense). But how does that acually relate back to the physical passing of time. Also is time a constant or can it really change. I know about the concept that if you start at atomic clock on earth and one in a spaceship and send it to space when it comes back that clock will be at an early time than the earth clock. Does that mean you would actually physically age less? Like if I went to space and came back I would die later than a version of myself that stayed on earth?

Physics,How do we fix people giving technical talks in physics?,"After a couple of years of attending theoretical physics talks by PhD students and postdocs and professors alike, I have been very disappointed at the average level of presentations. I don't want it to be an *expectation* that I will come out of our department's weekly seminar not understanding a single thing. I do science communication on the side and it frustrates me seeing the most basic rules being broken all the time. People don't seem to realize that they will be highly judged by the way they speak and communicate. Has anyone here thought more deeply about this and how we can improve things? Running workshops for communication is a disaster since no one thinks that it's important to come to these.

For me, I have one tip: I think that the worst possible thing I can hear you say as a talk attendee is (and I hear this often) ""**We're behind on time, so let's speed up to cover the rest of what I wanted to say**"". Here's why:

* It shows that you didn't plan your talk out properly. If you had planned it out, rehearsed, and left plenty of time for questions *during* the talk (this shouldn't be a surprise), then you wouldn't be saying this.

* It shows that you don't care about your audience's understanding of what you presented. One of the main reasons a talk can be going more slowly than expected is if the audience's background knowledge of what you're presenting is lower than you expected and they ask questions during your talk. If they can't keep up at the expected pace, what makes you think that they'll keep up at the even faster pace that you're now going to go at?

* It shows that you don't care about your audience's time. Even if they understood what you've said until now, the remaining time they will spend in your talk will likely be wasted because they can't understand what you are to say. Furthermore, if you're saying this, you're probably saying this near the end of your time already and will go overtime anyways.",Raikhyt,1h1rv2i,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h1rv2i/how_do_we_fix_people_giving_technical_talks_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h1rv2i/how_do_we_fix_people_giving_technical_talks_in/,2024-11-28 08:56:48,237,0.9,237,0,59,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h1rv2i

Physics,How does the classical understanding of molecules work with the quantum understanding?,"I have heard many times that quantum does not replace or argue against classical explanations, but instead augments them. Specifically, I am having trouble understanding how this works with vibrational spectroscopy.

Classically, I understand that light is an oscillating dipole that, when applied across a molecule with polarity, applies different forces to each atom, increasing the energy of the molecule and inducing vibrations in the molecule. Just as with springs, there should be a resonant frequency of the molecule due to the restoring force of the electrostatic interactions between atoms, when the light is at the same frequency the amplitude of the oscillations are maximized.

How does this mesh with quantum mechanics? As I understand it, transitions are only possible between set vibrational states, and when the lights energy matches the energy of the transition, it is said to be resonant. Is this the same type of resonant that occurs in classical models? Is it even possible to quantify the vibrational frequency of a quantum oscillating dipole?",jdaprile18,1h14esl,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h14esl/how_does_the_classical_understanding_of_molecules/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h14esl/how_does_the_classical_understanding_of_molecules/,2024-11-27 13:33:56,6,0.66,6,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h14esl

Physics,Luminiferous Ether?,"
Total newb here. I’m in my 30s and recently decided to dive into learning about space and physics on my own. I’ll spare you the sad backstory (let’s just say life and a not-so-supportive upbringing got in the way of pursuing science), but now I’m finally making time to explore this passion.

There’s so much information out there, and I’ve been trying to navigate it in my free time. I’ve started piecing together some of the history and concepts, but I’m getting stuck and would really appreciate recommendations for books, lectures, videos, or even online courses to help me.

Here’s where I’m at:
	•	I’m starting to grasp the timeline of discoveries and some of the key theories.
	•	I got stuck trying to understand the concept of the “luminiferous ether.” I’ve read about early experiments—like mercury-based ones—and the realization that space is a vacuum. It’s fascinating but also confusing. For example, I get that sound doesn’t travel in a vacuum, but light does, and I’m not sure how to reconcile all that.

I’ve read about Newton, Einstein, Hubble, and stumbled into names like Rutherford and Dirac. Somewhere along the way, I also ended up in Industrial Revolution history. Somehow I got lost about luminiferous ether and strayed away from the very interesting topic of light travel in vacuum space. I think I need a more organized approach—maybe a textbook or an online class to give me structure—but I’m not sure where to start.

If you know of any beginner-friendly resources (especially on vacuums, light, or related experiments) or have tips on how to approach learning this stuff, I’d be super grateful! Right now, I’m just out here getting lost and having fun, but I’d like to go deeper without getting overwhelmed.

Or in short- I would really just love a better understanding of luminiferous ether and where to go from there with learning. One thing I will say is that it’s very entertaining learning a theory, and then seeing who either grows off of it or completely debunks it in history. 

Also, I’m more interested in applied physics than quantum physics but if anyone has anything they want me to check out- lmk! 

TLDR- I think space is cool and want to learn about how it all works and I’m getting lost navigating all there is to learn. Please recommend resources like lectures, books, etc.

Physics,Vint Cerf on LLMs in Physics Today,"""(LLMs) don’t have enough context. I tested this by asking a large language model to write an obituary for me, and it generated a 700-word bio. It gave a date, which I thought was way too soon. It talked about my career. It gave me credit for stuff I didn’t do. It gave other people credit for stuff I did. It made up family members I don’t have.

""This illustrates how large language models produce the verisimilitude of human discourse. They respond as if we had asked, “If you were a human being, what would you say to this prompt?” That’s all.

Physics,How to find out if someone is (or isn't) a crank?,"I would like to invite a physicist on a podcast who claims to have invented a new form of quantum computing. He published on peer-reviewed journals such as on Springer, and has been advertised on Forbes as a leading scientist in the field. Yet, when I read his papers they don't seem to me serious stuff, rather pseudo-scientific woo. Since I'm not an expert in the field, that confuses me. Before inviting someone who might turn out to be a crank, I would like to know more whether his theories are sound and the person has scientific credibility.

Physics,Atomic energy and quantum physics questions.,"# To Start:

So basically, I have to make an animation following a flame lab we did in my science class, and I have so many questions. The animation consists of a simple Bohr model of a strontium atom going into a flame, however by the time I got to the point where I would animate the actual energy shift, I realized I didn't know how. I am on fall break right now so I cannot ask my teacher, and we didn't learn this yet. I understand there is likely a simpler route that doesn't necessitate this deep level of understanding, however now I'm just curious. 

  
As some background info, we used the chloride molecule of each element.



# Questions:

1.  What actually is the mechanism by which the atom absorbs the energy from the flame? I know it's heat energy, but how? If it's Infared light/heat, how does that produce some of the higher energy purple lines seen on a spectrometer. I'm not trying to imply I believe that strontium chloride produces a purple flame when burned, just that spectral lines around 400nm are visible when burning strontium.
2.  If energy levels are quantized, how is it that there are enough particles/photons with the PERFECT wavelength/frequency to have the EXACT energy needed to jump a whole number of shell(s) within millions if not many more atoms? e.g. say an atom were to only absorb light with a λ of 300nm, would light with a λ of 300.01nm be absorbed? how about light with a wavelength of lim n---&gt;∞ (300 + (1/n) nanometers? If it is true that it only absorbs that singular wavelength with zero margin of error, how is it possible that there are enough particles that possess 4.132806433333333eV of energy to produce the significant amount of light seen in flame labs? Otherwise, wouldn't a photon with a wavelength of 300.0000000000001nm carry 4.132806433333332eV (save yourself the trouble of comparing the two energies, they are different by the last digit) of energy and not be able to push the electron to the quantized level?
3. Since electrons are so small, how can energy be transferred to it so easily. Does the energy carrying particle not have to hit the electron precisely? If that is true, how is the energy transferred within this approximation of the electron's position?
4. How is a particular electron within an atom 'chosen' to move up energy levels?
5. For my animation, how do I know the precise number of eV's required to move an electron from one subshell to another. In addition, since I have to represent two different wavelengths of light being produced by the atom, if I know a wavelength that strontium produces, say 650nm. how can I know which electrons to move where?

Physics,Question about magnetism,"I have a question about magnetism that I feel probably has a really complicated answer.

If you have a piece of iron and you expose it to a strong magnetic field for some time it will become magnetic.

From what I understand, this happens because the iron atoms are already magnetic, but in non magnetic iron their poles are all pointing in different directions so the combined magnetic field cancels out. When the iron atoms are exposed to a magnetic field, their poles align with the field and the whole piece of iron becomes magnetic. 

My questions are: does this mean the iron atoms are physically rotating? Does making a piece of iron magnetic affect it crystalline structure? When a piece of iron is turned into a magnet is it being ""bent"" at an atomic level?

I feel like the truth is more abstract then this and I'm really curious about how it actually works.

Physics,Now it turns out light can cast a shadow too. ,"Latest study of Raphael A. Abrahao, Henri P. N. Morin, Jordan T. R. Pagé, Akbar Safari, Robert W. Boyd, and Jeff S. Lundeen brings ""light"" to a very shadowy aspect of lasers. 

[https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-11-11-1549&amp;id=563468](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-11-11-1549&amp;id=563468)

Light, being massless, casts no shadow; under ordinary circumstances, photons pass right through each other unimpeded. Here, we demonstrate a laser beam acting like an object — the beam casts a shadow upon a surface when the beam is illuminated by another light source. We observe a regular shadow in the sense it can be seen by the naked eye, it follows the contours of the surface it falls on, and it follows the position and shape of the object (the laser beam). Specifically, we use a nonlinear optical process involving four atomic levels of ruby. We are able to control the intensity of a transmitted laser beam by applying another perpendicular laser beam. We experimentally measure the dependence of the contrast of the shadow on the power of the laser beam, finding a maximum of approximately 22%, similar to that of a shadow of a tree on a sunny day. We provide a theoretical model that predicts the contrast of the shadow. This work opens new possibilities for fabrication, imaging, and illumination.

Now correct me if I'm wrong: If the shadow effect is linked to the manipulation of photon absorption or scattering at the atomic level within the ruby crystal, it could lead to the development of novel types of quantum gates that leverage this phenomenon. Such gates could utilize controlled photon ""shadows"" to either allow or block the presence of quantum information carriers, effectively acting as a switch in a quantum circuit.

How do you think what other thing we can use that effect for?

Physics,Did You Know? The Law of Refraction Was Discovered by a Persian Scholar,"Most of us know the law of refraction as ""Snell's Law,"" named after the Dutch physicist Willebrord Snell. However, few are aware that this law was discovered 637 years earlier by Abu Sa’d al-Ala Ibn Sahl, a Persian mathematician and physicist, in his book *On Burning Mirrors and Lenses*.

Ibn Sahl (940–1000) applied the law of refraction to design lenses and mirrors, significantly influencing later scientists, including Ibn al-Haytham, the ""father of optics."" His work has led modern researchers to refer to this fundamental principle as the ""Ibn Sahl Law.""

Why isn't this widely known? Perhaps it's time to revisit our science textbooks and celebrate the remarkable contributions of scholars like Ibn Sahl. Let's discuss: How can we better honor historical scientific achievements?

Physics,Magnetic Field Evolution of Jupiter and Neptune class Exoplanets,"Summary of article:
As per study, for Jupiter and Neptune class planets, Magnetic field decay occurs because as planets age, they cool down and their luminosities and their convective flux become gradually weaker. Higher atmospheric envelope fractions cause more material available for convection, which yields stronger magnetic fields.

The field strength reduces for extremely irradiated planets because they have lower average density. The surface magnetic field decreases past the threshold value as orbital separation (distance between the exoplanet and its host star) further increases.

The magnetic fields could be observable in the radio wavelengths via auroral emission using ground based observations.

Jupiter-class planets have magnetic fields large enough to generate radiation whose peak frequency exceeds the Earth’s ionospheric cutoff. The same occurs for the Neptune-class planets  if they have  𝑀 &gt; 15 𝑀⊕ and 𝑓env&gt; 4%.

For hot jupiter class planets, atmospheric evaporation does not affect magnetic field generation. For hot Neptunes, atmospheric evaporation leads to greater mass loss and causes less material for convection, so they produce weaker magnetic fields.

Physics,Some thoughts on Burton Richter,"I'm going to break cover. My name is Matthew Richter. I'm the son of Burton Richter. Today, SLAC had a one day 50th anniversary of the Psi/J discovery and the November Revolution.

For some disclosure: I too am a physicist. BA from UCSD, PhD from Stanford. I did STM and photon sciences. Went off to industry, mostly optical measurement and process control in semi, but those are stories for a different day. This isn't about me. I'd like to share something I wrote to a dear friend who's not a scientist about my impressions of today's symposium.

Now, my dad was cremated after his death and I poured most, but not of his ashes, into the SF Bay. This is because Dick Taylor had signed up with the Neptune Society, and my dad saw how easy they made it for the survivors. Small bits more of his ashes were cast into paperweights for me, my sister and my mom as well as his sister Phoebe. It would be nice to say that today his remaining ashes were spread on a hillside overlooking SPEAR, but deposition human remains out side of cemeteries is illegal, and as SLAC is a Federal National Lab, it's probably be a Federal felony to leave his ashes there. Let's just say it's a nice thought and I'm out of ashes. And to be explicit: this is in no way an admissions that I spread any of my father on the hills of SLAC above his baby.

The tribute speech given by JoAnne Hewett and some of the other stuff today  got me more than I expected. I added some comments after the tribute speech and after the thing finished, several people came up to me with comments and stories.

When one of the physicists kids was diagnosed with cancer pops used all his pull to get him into Stanford cancer center. The past deputy director called him a father figure. Pretty much everyone commented on his drive and vision. Also how he was always accessible, and would offer help and his insight to anyone, from the lowest of grad student to the top of the physics food chain. If one took a tenth of his career, that was more than most did in a lifetime .  Hearing it all in a 40 min presentation was mind-blowing.

From approval of funds for SPEAR to first physics took 21 months. That is unheard of now. From big result to acceptance of the paper was 3 days. Published less than 30 days after measurements. Normally peer review takes months. 34 significant papers came out in about two years. It was a field day for High Energy Physics. It changed our understanding of how the universe is assembled to a view that still stands 50 years later. One speaker talked about how exciting a time it was to be in high energy physics, and in the mid seventies, the center of the high energy physics universe was SLAC. 

The woman who gave an overview of my father's career (JoAnne Hewett) said she didn't really understand the depth and length of his vision. He was always thinking about what is next for SLAC and for physics. Everything the lab did from when he built his ring till basically now has his fingerprints all over it, even though he ""retired"" 20 years ago. She's now the director of Brookhaven on Long Island. She said that only when she put together this talk did she understand how powerful a force he was as well as how visionary and how hard he fought for the future and the ongoing success of the laboratory as well as the field (actually several fields) while most were clueless about these efforts, being occupied with their small slice of the pie.

Honestly, in the history of science there are very few people who have ever had that type of reach, drive and impact.

Every high energy physics detector in the world shares the same basic design as the very first one his team built. The rings as CERN are the size they are because of a paper he wrote while on sabbatical. Most of what is known as photon sciences matured at SPEAR. There are probably about ten photon sciences laboratories around the world that can trace their roots to Dad's work.

While he was building this experimental world, he learned to do his own theoretical calculations on the side, what would be a career in itself in Theoretical Physics for most men. And he chaired the American Physical Society, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, Served our nation as a member of JASON for 24 years (he had every security clearance under the sun). He chaired National Academy of Science studies, was the nations leading expert on the nuclear fuel cycle, spent ten years working on how to deal with nuclear waste, and for the heck of it, became an expert in energy policy and climate science.

He used the very same bound laboratory notebook for his notes his entire career from the late 50s till his death (thank God the publisher of these lab books stayed in business) there were between 100 and 200 of them. Each one had the start date and the end date written on the spine and front cover in White Out. That's a record of his work that spans 50 years.

I'm very smart. I did some things. He was a mountain, I'm but a pebble.

Honestly, if this stuff weren't so esoteric to the average person, he'd be held up as on of the level of very best of the field with the likes of Feynman, Einstein and Newton. Almost no one has ever had his reach.or impact.   

The team at SLAC was amazing. Some of the originals are still there, many are not, or like my father, have passed away. While the quality of the talks varied, they all have information that will surprise and astound. The symposium was recorded. If it's not up on the slack site, it will be soon. 

On a side note, a name often mentioned is BJ Bjorken. He's the man that taught my dad how to do theory. He passed recently and on Saturday there's a memorial for him at SLAC. Another of the Dream Team at SLAC has passed.

One thing that shown through all the talks: what an amazing time. What an amazing group of people. Yes, my father lead the SPEAR group. But it was a team effort. And the team was larger than his group. It spanned the entire world. In both collaboration and competition, this was the birth of the Standard Model. Explosive growth in machine physics, detector design and photon sciences. And so much more.

I miss him more than anyone can know.

As part of a class I'll be teaching I coded up a interactive simulations of a few standard statistical physics models --- so far I've made a page for [Ising-like models](https://www.dmsussman.org/resources/isingmodelsimulator/) and for a [model of flocking](https://www.dmsussman.org/resources/vicsekmodelsimulator/), and I'll be adding new ones to [this page](https://www.dmsussman.org/resources/) as the course progresses. 

While I primarily made these to complement my lectures, I thought I would share them in case anyone finds the ability to explore how these different models behave in different parts of parameter space helpful! They are (of course)  hardly the first such web simulators to be made publicly available.

Physics,[New Tool] Open Source ICBM Trajectory Simulator for Science Enthusiasts,"Hey r/Physics,

I’ve recently developed a basic tool called ICBM Simulator, and I wanted to share it with the community. This open-source simulator lets you explore the trajectories of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) from a scientific perspective.

**About the Tool:**

The simulator is straightforward—it allows you to input some basic launch parameters and see how an ICBM might travel through the atmosphere and along its trajectory. While it’s not highly advanced, it’s a solid starting point for anyone interested in the basic science behind missile trajectories.

**What You Can Do:**

* **Basic Trajectory Simulation:** Visualize the missile’s flight path based on simple input parameters.
* **Impact Estimation:** Get a rough idea of where the missile might land based on the trajectory.
* **Educational Purpose:** This tool is purely for scientific curiosity and learning about missile trajectories.

**Why I Made It:**

I created this simulator to help people understand the fundamentals of missile trajectories without getting too technical. Whether you’re a student, educator, or just curious about how these things work, I hope you find it interesting.

**Open Source &amp; Feedback Welcome:**

The project is fully open source, so anyone interested in contributing, exploring, or modifying it is welcome to do so. Check out the source code on GitHub: [ICBM Simulator on GitHub](https://github.com/dimitarbez/ICBMSimulator). I’m still working on improvements, so I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions! If you have ideas for making it more useful or educational, please let me know.

Physics,Games that will enhance my knowledge of physics?,"I have a classmate at the university who has played over several thousands hours of Hearts of Iron (i don't know which one). It seems like his HoI experience alone had a huge impact on his knowledge of history and geography. I'm under the impression that he knows literally *anything* about the governments, small and big, that existed at a time period of WWII - their rulers, various minor representatives of the government, goals, ideologies, possible alternative fates of these countries, had they made certain decisions at that time period. 

He also played a lot of God of War and is quite well versed in Scandinavian mythology. Of course his sources of knowledge are not limited to just games. But it makes me wonder, are there any games that would have similair impact on my understanding of physics? That would have been lovely. Just imagine the amount of stuff one can learn through HoI alone. 

If you had any such experience, please share with me. And not just games, any other entertaining way of boosting my knowledge by doing something besides educating myself directly via books, videos and the university itself (i study theoretical physics). 

However, I would ask you to exclude shallow or popular science from your suggestions, like big bang theory or something.

Physics,Aptitude and Imposter Syndrome,"Hi r/Physics,

  
I wasn't sure if I should use the weekly post for this, so I'm going to try and make a post.

I'm currently in my 3rd year of a PhD, and I just can't get over the feeling that I just don't have the aptitude for physics as a career. Sure, I can do the classes, and I can pass the exams, but doing research seems like a completely different task. I have an advisor who's pretty nice and supportive, and the field I'm working in is interesting enough, but despite this, I feel that I am unable to climb the mountain of literature I need to read, and even if I was able, I wouldn't have the insight I need to make any kind of meaningful contribution to my field.

I suppose that my feelings are pretty well summarized by imposter syndrome, which I know pretty much every graduate student struggles with. But I can't shake the feeling that what I'm feeling is unique, and a symptom of something bigger.

For those of you who are father along the academic path, does this feeling ever go away? Is the solution to keep reading and keep working until you truly feel like you're the expert you're supposed to be, or do I need to learn to make my peace with how I'm feeling?",Quantumechanic42,1ggr115,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1ggr115/aptitude_and_imposter_syndrome/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1ggr115/aptitude_and_imposter_syndrome/,2024-10-31 22:36:39,34,0.85,34,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1ggr115

Physics,"Hopfield's 1983 talk ""Collective Properties of Neuronal Networks"" ","Hopfield shared the 2024 physics Nobel prize. This is a talk he gave right in the middle of his time doing the work for which he won the prize. I lived through that time (I'm the age of his kids, so a generation younger than him.) For people who weren't there, it is easy to miss how transformative his ideas were. We just take them for granted now. It's also easy to miss how much his ideas came from his (condensed matter) physics training and research. These days AI is mathematical and mapped to computer hardware. So abstract. But back then Hopfield was one of the first to probe ""how does the physical world make possible the physical phenomena of memory?"". His paradigms changed how all of us thought of memory and intelligence.

Here's the link to the talk, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib6futs-fss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib6futs-fss)

I highly recommend a watch. Among other things, it's an opportunity to watch a great physics mind present.

(FWIW, AI professor Rod Brooks' paper ""Elephants don't play chess"", [https://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf](https://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf) , 6 years later, riffs on the paradigms that Hopfield introduced. I don't know that Brooks or Hopfield ever connected, but the Hopfield connection between physical phenomena and apparent intelligence is clear. And since the Roomba is a child of Brooks,  perhaps in sense Roomba is a grandchild of Hopfield. Physics is everywhere!!!)

Physics,Is Ben Recht right about HEP?,"In a post last week about statistical testing, I asked, ""What are the grand discoveries that we wouldn’t have made without an understanding of null hypothesis testing?""

Nico Formanek replied, “Ok, I'll take the bait. Why wouldn't the discovery of the Higgs Boson count?”

Ah, now this is a fun example! I briefly replied to him in a comment and thought I’d write a quick follow up post last Friday. But in trying, I ended up down a deep rabbit hole trying to figure out what exactly the null hypothesis was.

It’s shocking that to properly explain the Higgs experiment, I’d have to write an entire book. The basic idea is that if you take two streams of subatomic particles, in this case Hydrogen ions, and accelerate them to near the speed of light, they cause explosions when they collide. Since E=mc^2, these explosions emit a lot of energy. If you look at the patterns in the explosions, you’ll see characteristics of exotic matter that exist for the tiniest fraction of time. If you generate trillions of these sorts of explosions, you’ll eventually see everything that could possibly exist in the energy range of your collider.

Since each event is an explosion, we can’t expect to see exactly the same explosion every time we bang the ions together. Explosions are inherently stochastic, and physicists have ornate ways of calculating the probability of seeing various proposed fireworks displays. This makes the sub-subatomic particles inherently statistical objects. The only way that we know how to make them is to build billion-dollar statistical casinos and check whether the statistical numerology of the Standard Model predicts an appropriate run of events. Physicists calculate the theoretical odds of their particle roulette wheel, and then they run a bunch of spins to make sure the odds match their expectations.

Except it’s a bit more complicated than that. In a well-functioning roulette wheel, the probability of every number is equal, and hence computing the probabilities can be done by only knowing the number of possibilities. In particle physics, the model is much more complex. I can’t explain it to you in a blog post, and neither can physicists. Particle physics is so annoyingly complex that I can’t even explain it to you unless you’re willing to finish a PhD. Physicists love to proclaim that no one understands quantum mechanics. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge fields and flavor changing neutral currents of particle physics are a whole other business of weird.

The mathematics of Quantum Field Theory is a bizarre amalgamation of variational calculus, representation theory, and a bunch of wacky statistical tricks that turn infinities into zeros. Michel Talagrand tried to simplify the theory for mathematicians and ended up writing an 800-page book. Quantum chromodynamics adds extra complexity on top of this. If you are willing to toil through learning all of this ornate mathematics, you can calculate what you might expect to see when two protons are smashed together at near the speed of light. 

Well, almost. It turns out that this very ornate and complex theory has a lot of unspecified parameters that are unknown in advance. Notably, the masses of all of the fancy subatomic particles, with jokey names inspired by James Joyce, have to be fit to data. The couplings between the various particles must also be estimated from data. All in all, there are 30-ish “free parameters” that have to be fit experimentally. On top of these fundamental parameters, there are apparatus specific parameters as well. These parameters concerning the vagaries of supercolliders also have to be incorporated to account for various noise processes that arise when bashing Hydrogen ions against each other at four teraelectronvolts. 

Even without the elaborate mathematical theory, a probabilistic model with free parameters is challenging to validate from data. Imagine a roulette wheel where I tell you now that black and red have different probabilities. But those probabilities change depending on the day of the week. And you have to adjust the probabilities if the TGV goes by. 

If only it were just about calibrating a roulette wheel! Instead, it’s a ten billion-dollar apparatus with thousands of scientific staff members. No single staff member knows how the whole apparatus works, of course. Instead, there is a shared community of trust. I recently attended a talk by Peter Gallison, who described the complex governance structures involved in experiments like the Large Hadron Collider. The CERN collaboration establishes parliamentary rules to decide upon scientific truth. Reality is validated by majority vote. Physicists love to talk a lot about how they are probing the very nature of the universe, but they do this by a lot of boring committee meetings.

One of the many CERN committees is a statistical committee. It is the one that argues about the best frequentist statistics to be used. The CERN statistics committee tells us that the p-value of seeing what they saw if the Higgs wasn't there is less than 0.0000006. But, as you might expect from anything decided by committee, it’s not that simple. Here’s what Science Magazine included in their glossary about the Higgs Discovery:

“Significance and the look-elsewhere effect: The probability for a background fluctuation to be at least as large as the observed maximum excess is termed the local P value, and the probability for an excess anywhere in a specified mass range is the global P value. This probability can be evaluated by generating sets of simulated data incorporating all correlations among analyses optimized for different Higgs boson masses. The global P value (for the specified region) is greater than the local P value, and this fact is often referred to as the look-elsewhere effect. Both the local and global P values can be expressed as a corresponding number of standard deviations using the one-sided Gaussian tail convention. For example, a 5σ significance tells us that the probability of the background alone fluctuating up locally by the amount observed or more is about 1 in 3 million. In particle physics, this criterion has become a convention to claim discovery but should not be interpreted literally.”

Should not be interpreted literally? Are you serious? “Trust us. We’re the smartest people on the planet. There’s no way we’d miscalculate 5σ events.” Where have we heard that before? Oh, right.

Despite accepting what the open science community would deride as Highly Questionable Research Practices (lots of p-hacking, HARKing, and multiple hypothesis testing), by adopting the 5σ convention, the Higgs statistics community tells us it shouldn’t matter. When they say “5σ,” they mean five standard deviations from the estimated mean background at exactly one mass location in their complex model. They check all of the possible bins and compute a background model for each bin. This results in the following figure:


See the bump that goes outside of their green error bars? That’s the Higgs Boson. (insert shrug emoji)

This brings me back to my original reply to Nico: we have an ""object"" that has been ""observed"" at a single location on Earth. This observation was done in an experiment where no single person understood the entirety of the procedure. It requires well over 6 years of graduate study to fully understand what was supposed to be seen in the most ideal experimental situation. Under these idealized conditions, which no one fully understands, the CERN folks tell us that the p-value of seeing what they saw if the Higgs wasn't there is less than 0.0000006. But this p-value is corrupted by all sorts of standard complaints about questionable research practices, and we are told not to take it literally.

OK, so what’s the point of all this? Am I just trying to be a science denier who casts uncertainty at all fundamental discoveries? I’ll confess: a little. But I also think we can learn something about modern science and engineering by digging into a few follow-up questions. What does it mean that the Higgs Boson was discovered? And why would we be in a different situation without that p-value?

The answers fit nicely in the argmin oeuvre. 

First, it was certainly not the case that digging into the Higgs made me feel better about the utility of statistical testing. Whether or not the Higgs exists has no bearing outside the insular world of particle physics. If you don’t have a four teraelectronvolt supercollider, you can’t make a Higgs. The Higgs field has no bearing on any physics at any scale anyone would ever care about. So I don’t care either way if physicists think they found a Higgs. It has zero bearing on my existence. 

Nico thought this view too pragmatic. But pragmatism too often gets short shrift in the history and philosophy of science. The philosophy of engineering remains underexplored! There has to be something we can do with substantive causal theories for them to be real.

Now to the second question. When we ask, “Does the Higgs Boson exist?” we are not asking about the material reality of an object. We're asking about our belief in a system. Do we believe that a collection of determined, over-credentialed scientists can organize themselves, through their democratic, participatory decision-making schemes, to decide upon the connection of data and theory? Do we believe that such institutions produce trustworthy procedures and rituals so that if they say they did something, then no one else has to check? Do we believe that their presented statistical counts represent a close enough facsimile of experimental conditions to corroborate an ornate, impossible to understand theory? Do we believe their committees properly adjudicate statistical practice and preregistration plans? 

All of these questions are substantially less romantic than those popularized on YouTube or in Quanta magazine. They are questions about people, their budgets, and their committees. This is why statistics is so vital to the Higgs discovery. Just like how we need RCTs as a regulatory mechanism for drugs, big science needs 5σ as a way to set standards for pushing papers through their mass of review boards. Statistics is most useful in regulatory standards, providing compressed, crisp rules for stochastic approval. “5σ,” it turns out, is not different than “p&lt;0.05.” It is another mindless convention needed for a well-functioning collaboration. 

And well-functioning CERN was! With 10 billion dollars, they confirmed a model of particles that connects the crowning achievements of 20th-century physics. Through a massive collaborative government, they achieved a democratic consensus about the fundamental building blocks of physical theory, a united nations of physics.

But just before the intermission, he explained how chromosomes age three separate times, each instance using the same example, as though it was the first time he was introducing it.

After the break, he resumed the presentation with new topics, but soon, he circled back to the same topic of decaying chromosomes for a fourth and fifth time, again repeating the exact example. He also repeated, and I quote, ""Your cells can become immortal, but the ironic thing is, they might become cancerous""

There’s no public information on his situation yet but these seem like clear, concerning signs. While I understand he's getting older, it's disheartening to think that even a brilliant mind like his could be affected by age and illness.

Physics,"Is There an Equation for Physically Simulating Sound, Similar to the Rendering Equation in Optics?","Hi,

I'm curious about the topic of physically simulated sound generation. I'm wondering if there's an established equation or framework similar to the rendering equation in optics, but for sound. By ""physically simulated,"" I mean generating realistic sounds based on the physical interactions and properties of materials, rather than using recorded samples or synthesized approximations.



For example, simulating the sound of:

- A metal rod being struck

- Ice being compressed or broken

- Leather being rubbed or stretched



I know that some models exist for simulating musical instruments (like guitars, pianos, etc.), where things like string vibration and resonance are taken into account. However, I'm curious if there’s a more general approach or theoretical framework that covers a wider range of physical interactions for sound generation. 



Is there an equation or set of principles that can be applied to these scenarios in a similar way that the rendering equation helps with light in optics? Or is it more about case-specific models for different types of materials and interactions?



Just curious and would love to learn more about this topic!

Physics,Peoples thoughts on physics research and its links to military/weapon development,"Note: this is a little bit of a ramble as I just wanted to get things of my chest, so apologies if this is a little long winded!

So for a bit of context: I'm a fresh first year PhD student (23M) in the field of laser/plasma physics, and in general my project is working on developing ICF as a possible way to produce fusion energy (yet to properly start the project so details are vague atm). I'm more on the side of theory and computation/simulation. I've always wanted to persue a physics PhD, and while I find the prospect of fusion energy really really exciting and the physics of ICF very cool, my mind has recently been plagued by thoughts of how ICF physics is very much related to the development of weapons, in particular nuclear weapons (NIF comes to mind as the primary example of this).

Now I knew this before going into the PhD, but recently (and I'm not sure why tbh), it's been much more on my mind. I've spoken to a lot of people about it; fellow PhD students, staff, my supervisor etc, and no body seems very phased by it. When my supervisor suggested working with NIF I told him I'm not too keen on the idea due to their link with weapons, and he said something along the lines of  'well the link to weapons will always exist' and kinda just brushed it off. While I don't disagree with this, I just can't help worry about it :/.  My worries are probably quite irrational, but I don't like the idea of my potential work being used to develop a new and more dangerous nuke (not at all likely or even possible ik, but you get the idea).

So I just wanted to ask, how do physics researchers in fields closely linked to weapons sleep peacefully at night? I'm honestly starting to doubt I'm cut out for a field like this, which I'm happy to accept other than the fact that I really love physics/maths and really want to to a PhD. I feel like I'd be throwing away a really good opportunity, because every other aspect of the PhD (supervisor, fellow students, the uni, city etc) are pretty perfect.

Physics,Misconceptions about this year's Nobel Prize,"Disclosure: JJ Hopfield is a pioneer in my field, i.e., the field of statistical physics and disordered systems, so I have some bias (but also expertise).

I wanted to make this post because there are some very basic misconceptions that are circulating about this year's Nobel Prize. I do not want to debate whether or not it was a good choice (I personally don't think it is, but for different reasons than the typical discourse), I just want to debunk some common arguments relating to the prize choice which are simply wrong.

**Myth 1. ""These are not physicists.""** Geoffrey Hinton is not a physicist. JJ Hopfield is definitely a physicist. He is an emeritus professor of physics at Princeton and served as President of the American Physical Society. His students include notable condensed matter theorists like Bertrand Halperin, former chair of physics at Harvard.

**Myth 2. ""This work is not physics.""** This work is from the statistical physics of disordered systems. It is physics, and is filed under condensed matter in the arxiv (https://arxiv.org/list/cond-mat.dis-nn/recent)

**Myth 3. ""This work is just developing a tool (AI) for doing physics.""** The neural network architectures that are used in practice are not related to the one's Hopfield and Hinton worked on. This is because Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines cannot be trained with backprop. If the prize was for developing ML tools, it should go to people like Rosenblatt, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio (all cited in https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2024/09/advanced-physicsprize2024.pdf) because they developed feedforward neural networks and backpropagation.

**Myth 4. ""Physics of disordered systems/spin glasses is not Nobel-worthy.""** Giorgio Parisi already won a Nobel prize in 2021 for his solutions to the archetypical spin glass model, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (page 7 of https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/10/sciback_fy_en_21.pdf). But it's self-consistent to consider both this year's prize and the 2021 prize to be bad.

If I may, I will point out some truths which are related to the above myths but are not the same thing:

**Truth 1: ""Hinton is not a physicist.""**

**Truth 2: ""This work is purely theoretical physics.""**

**Truth 3: ""This work is potentially not even that foundational in the field of deep learning.""** 

**Truth 4: ""For some reason, the physics of disordered systems gets Nobel prizes without experimental verification whereas other fields do not.""**",Dawnofdusk,1fzisf9,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fzisf9/misconceptions_about_this_years_nobel_prize/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fzisf9/misconceptions_about_this_years_nobel_prize/,2024-10-09 03:53:20,1025,0.91,1025,0,113,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1fzisf9

I have been applying to PhDs the past year, and I am mainly interested in cosmology. It feels like the AI/ML craze has especially taken over this field. In the past year, so many of the cosmology related positions involve deep learning and neural networks.

I understand to some extent, as computational powers limit simulations with baryons, and neural networks provide an alternative way to avoid these heavy simulations. But still, sometimes it feels like people are just going with the craze and adding Al to their research portfolios (and to get more funding as well).

I am not saying we should not use these new tools, but I guess the applications sometimes feel very on the surface.

I could keep going but these are some of the most awe-inspiring things I've seen that come to mind when I think of NNs and Physics. It's changed the way I conceptualize a problem and I think the power is in that anything that can be formulated as a combination of an encoding and an objective can be modeled with a recipe that generalizes incredibly well. It's a new paradigm of problem solving and has and will continue to have impact similar to say something like calculus.

I feel like a lot of the outcry has to do with the computation being outsourced from blackboard to silicon, or because it's less ""elegant"" or ""noble"" than having a bespoke, mathematically and physically derived solution to a problem and that any codebro can do it, but that is the beauty of it. It's a new framework of thinking about problems. It's incredibly powerful and fast. To think that I can do on my RGB mountain dew desktop what only some professor with access to a supercomputer could do as recently as 10 years ago? The impact on physics is undeniable. Their work made it a free-for-all and that's the way it should be.

Our setup uses eight TEC1-12706 Peltier modules in a 2x2x2 configuration. The cold plate measures approximately 12 cm x 12 cm. The top Peltier modules, which are in contact with the cold plate, operate at 5V, while the bottom ones run at 12V. An aluminum water block removes heat from the hot side of the 12V Peltier modules, and it is connected to a radiator and an aquarium pump. The Peltier modules draw about 180W of power, which can be dissipated by the radiator with only a 4-5 degree Celsius difference between the ambient temperature and the water temperature. The cold plate is grounded, and there is a coarse mesh wire on the top of the chamber that is connected to a high-voltage source to create an electric field, which helps enhance visibility. There is also a narrow container with a heating wire where we can pump isopropyl alcohol without needing to open the glass cover. Custom-made LED lights with focusing elements surround the chamber to create a strong beam that is more or less parallel to the cold plate.

When the conditions are right, you can observe a lot of activity from the natural radioactivity around us (cosmic rays, etc.). The result is pretty mesmerizing to watch. Here is a quick video:

Physics,High energy physics results with precise mathematical descriptions,"I’m looking to create a list of results (i.e. theorems, definitions or calculations) or papers from high energy physics which can be broken down into precise mathematical definitions and lemmas. 

Two example such papers are:
- [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0605184](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0605184) : Related to the two Higgs doublet model 
- [https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/guts.pdf](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/guts.pdf) : Related to unified theories.

Does anyone have suggestions of such results or papers? 

**Motivation**

I’m working on a project, [HepLean](https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean), which aims to digitalise results from high energy physics into the interactive theorem prover Lean 4 (I've posted about this project on Reddit before). 
The definitions and lemmas making up the results of the type wanted above, can be written into HepLean as `informal_lemma`s and `informal_definition`s. 
As an example, [this dependency graph](https://heplean.github.io/HepLean/InformalGraph) contains the current  informal lemmas and informal definitions in HepLean. Cliking on the nodes of the graph will display the informal result. Once written in this way, experts in Lean (or maybe even an AI) can formalize (or digitalise) these results . Any help writing these informal definitions and lemmas would also be greatly appreciated.

Physics,"Long time ago at CERN - PhD ""helper"" experience ","So I'm in a US university, finished my MSc in the first year ,  succeeded in the PhD quals exam and starting a PhD in HEP-EXP. Part of this was some work at CERN on site. Hence they flew me there along with another US citizen. I'm a European one. 

We were picked up at the airport in Geneva by a postdoc, already working at CERN, who was getting the best and most spacious room in the apartment, I couldn't care less actually. 

The freaking moment he picked us up, he got really polite and cool with the US guy and he looked at me only once completely unsympathetic. I have never experienced that again, not before. Instant freaking dislike. He was US citizen as well, I have no idea if this was part of the story though, just mentioning. 

During the trip from the airport to the place we will be living for the next month or so, he constantly talked to the co-dricer with me at the back seat. My age at the time was 31, postdoc 28 , fellow PhD candidate 25 or something.

He never helped me with work. He ""forgot"" to pick me up from CERN one night, 1 am. I let some people know of his behavior, got help from others. I complained to my supervisor professor, he didn't do much. For some reason I didn't pursue it also. I let it happen. 

Long story short, that was a very decisively put of a nail in my PhD coffin. I left it 3 months after, largely because of this. Did data science, super rewarding on the monetary side of things, less demanding, with the luxury of leaving my job anytime I want to find another, better (I never did, I was lucky). And continue doing physics on the side, I actually published in January in a peer reviewed journal. For free.

Physics,How do you measure the criticality of the phase state of a dynamical system?,"Does anyone know how to measure the 'critical-ness' of a dynamical system in which it's configured to allow 2nd order phase transitions? For context, I'm an undergrad ML researcher that is doing research on Reservoir Computing. I'm looking into ways to modulate dynamical systems and treat them as artificial neural networks by maintaining their critical state (I dub this process as 'Homeostasis', no one really has a term for this officially yet I think). The dynamical system's architecture is an n-dimensional hyperlattice of nodes that evolves over time (input or no input).

The most apt comparison I can give for the system are Ising models. Ising models are modeled within a grid, with spin up or spin down states. The global state of Ising models evolves over time, and produces patterns.

The most viable candidate metrics I have are Shannon Entropy and Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy for measuring the 'temperature' of these systems, and I'm doing measures on the correlation length, structure factor, finite size scaling, fractal dimensions of subgrid states, and dynamical scaling.

I haven't found a way to tie this all together as one coherent metric though.

Physics,TDSE Simulation,"For my research, over the last year I've been developing my own code for conducting TISE and TDSE simulations. Specifically, I'm interested in analyzing both the energy and special distributions of electrons ejected while atoms are interacting with strong, ultrashort laser pulses.

The simulation is done broadly in three steps:

1. Solve the TISE to get the bound states/initial state.
2. Propagate initial state using Crank-Nicholson Scheme to arrive at final state.
3. Project the final wavefunction onto energy eigenstates to find population of ejected electrons.

If anyone is interested, I do plan on posting a link to the code, but there are a few more things l'd like to implement before I share it with others.

For now, however I'd just like to showcase some of the results I've gotten.

Laser Parameters:

Polarization: Linear in Z direction

Frequency: 0.085 au

Duration: 20 Optical Cycles

Intensity: 2E13 W/cm\^2

[Angle Integrated Spectrum](https://imgur.com/a/ENGynHs)

[Angle Resolved Spectrum](https://imgur.com/a/Z3dMYhL)

In the first image you can see peaks in the energy spectrum. This corresponds to above-threshold ionization where the electrons absorb more photons that necessary to ionize, resulting in peaks separated by the photon energy to appear in the spectrum.

In the second image you can see in space where the photoelectrons are being ejected. In principle the angular distribution is sampled over a sphere, however for visualization this angular distribution is sampled over the XZ plane.

Laser Parameters:

Polarization: Circular in the XY plane

Frequency: 0.114 au

Duration: 2 Optical Cycles

Intensity: 2E14 W/cm\^2

[Angle Integrated Spectrum](https://imgur.com/a/r4gR4B6)

[Angle Resolved Spectrum](https://imgur.com/a/irvDUNL)

In this case the entire distribution looks different. This is mostly due to the duration of the pulse being much shorter. We see that the energy distribution no longer contains ATI peaks but has one distinct peak. The angular distribution is sampled over the XY plane, and we see that instead of there being multiple peaks and photoelectrons being emitted in many directions equally, we see that most photoelectrons are emitted to the ""bottom right"" direction.

Laser Parameters:

Polarization: Linear in Z direction

Frequency: 0.057 au

Duration: 6 Optical Cycles

Intensity: 3.51E14 W/cm\^2

[High Harmonic Generation](https://imgur.com/a/56EpLj8)

Finally, this is the high harmonic spectra produced. From classical physics we know that when a charge accelerates/oscillates it should emit radiation. By computing the expectation value of the dipole acceleration matrix at each time step and taking a fourier transform you can gain insight into the energy spectrum of radiation emitted.",WorldlinessTasty7886,1fp7gp5,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fp7gp5/tdse_simulation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fp7gp5/tdse_simulation/,2024-09-25 15:37:27,6,0.7,6,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1fp7gp5

Physics,"Advice on how to close-in on possible research project topics (CMT, Topological Matter)? ","  
Hey everyone! 

I'm a third year undergraduate Engineering Physics + Math student, and recently I've been reading through reviews and textbooks on Topological Phases of Matter + other topology/geometry related condensed matter theory (CMT) topics, and I'm trying to join a research group studying Topological Matter.

I spoke with a postdoc in the group doing very cool stuff, and he essentially told me that if I could find something specific I wanted to work on, he'd be down to advise me. 

He suggested three main subfields to look at, based on their popularity and potential, and told me to try and come up with a possible project, even if I may not currently have all the math + physics background necessary    
  
(For context: I've done graduate differential geometry and algebraic topology but I'm just learning the basics of K-theory and I need to learn much more category theory. I have some QFT and SFT background, but I'm still learning and am not proficient)  
  
The topics he suggested were: 

1. Classification of Fermionic SPT phases
2. Categorical, non-invertible, higher symmetries in relation to Topological Phases
3. Quantum Information, Open Quantum Systems (this one's kinda vague, but still)

I'm trying to get an idea as to what the main questions are that researchers are concerned with in 2024, and which topics seem to be the most important.

  
Questions/Requests:

1. Does any one have any advice on how to narrow down my search without having to read (or at least, skim through) a crapload of papers?   
  
2. If there are any standard resources/references used by the community to keep track of open questions and direct progress, I'd love to hear about it!

3. If anyone on this sub familiar with the current research situation could provide an overview of the major subfields in Topological Quantum Matter, and important questions in the subfields being investigated in 2024, that would be greatly appreciated! 

I'd also just love to chat in general and learn about peoples' own research interests.

Physics,Thoughts on accuracy of a simulation ,"Im a physics (with focus on astronomy) undergrad first year student and I’ve had an increasing interest in the concept of entropy so I made a sim based around it


So basically it’s a 70x70 pixel grid with each pixel being able to have a range of values red being 100 and 0 being purple I made them only be able to retain integer values (for simplicity) and they can vary at random from -3 to 3 
 
Some things I noticed- 

There are 100^(4900) possible states

The probability of it being solid red again is 1/100^4900

By increasing the amount of states that count as   “red” I can effectively increase the probability of it being red (ex if red counts as 100 +/- some value) or increasing the numerator 

By limiting the amount of available colors (states)  I can see increase the chance of it becoming red (I also scaled this down and graph it) 

_____________________________________


Questions- 

As the amount of states increases to infinity does the probability of it being all red essentially becomes 0 like with limits?

It’s this at all a basic demonstration of entropy? (And if not is it analogous to any other natural process)

If the numeric value of the color represented some unique combination on a x/y graph would it represent the unlikelyhood of every pixel being within the same region on said graph?

Physics,Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity,"\[reposted from AskPhysics since it was not a question\]

I received my PhD in Cosmology and Modified Gravity research and I am here to answer some common questions about Modified Gravity. I want to give a fair overview of the evidence for and against both positions for the benifit of everyone interested in this topic. I am also going to make my case for Modified Gravity.  As I am not am active Dark Matter researcher, please inform me if I am in any way michareterizing the Dark Matter model or strawmaning it. I would apreciate the same respect given to me as an active Modified Gravity researcher.

The Missing Mass Problem \[skip if you know it\]:

Einstein’s field Equations of General Relativity (GR) are the presently best tested theory of gravity which work within our solar system but appear to fail at the scale of galaxies. If you plug the mass of an object into the GR equations you get out what type of gravitational field (space-time bending) the mass produces and from this you can find the orbits of smaller objects around that mass within its gravitational field. We have a good, simulation tested, understanding of how stars work and how their brightness/color/composition can be used to infer their mass. Take the mass of the sun, put it into the equations of GR, and you get out a prediction for the orbits of the planets which matches what we observe (within our observational precision). We can meassure the *vissible* mass of a galaxy from its brightness (its stars) + any amount of gas/dust content that it has. If we plug the vissible mass of a galaxy into the GR equations we find a major missmatch between the predicted rotational velocity of a galaxy and its observed rotational velocity, for nearly every studied galaxy. Galaxies are rotatating faster than is predicted which implies they have more gravity than is predicted. The 2 major proposals for explaining this ""extra gravity"" is comming from are ""Dark Matter"" (DM) and Modified Gravity (MG).

Dark Matter (DM):

A simple way to explain the extra gravity is to propose that galaxies contain aditional mass which we can't see, Daark Matter (DM), though the name ""invisible matter"" would probably have been better. Whatever DM is it has mass and produces gravity but has so far evaded our attempts to detect it by any direct methods. This implies that it interacts with the other fundmental forces either extreamly weakly or not at all. We have ruled out that it could be any type of known matter, meaning that it must be some new particle we have never detected yet. The only information we have gained about DM comes from what can be infered from its gravity (the extra gravity which we are atributing to this DM stuff). DM does not clump up in the same way that vissible matter clumps up to form galactic disks and stars, if it did then we would observe the gravitational effects of small dense clumps of DM but so far no such clumps have been observed. The present model of DM is that it exists in large gas/fluid clouds (called DM Halos) which suround nearly every galaxy, with the vissible galactic disk sitting at the center of a much larger, much more massive, and much rounder DM Halo. The gravity produced by the spread out DM Halo is signficant in effecting the rotation of the entire galaxy but has no signficant effect on the smaller scales when it comes to planets orbiting stars.

Modified Gravity (MG):

The Modified Gravity proposal is to replace the Einstien field equations of General Relativity with a different set of equations such that we get a different prediction for the strength of the gravitatioanl field produced by an object with mass. Since we already know that GR works at teh scale of the solar system, the MG equations must match the predictions of GR close to a massive object but then diverge at further distances. The strength of gravity (as a function of the distance from a massive object generating the gravity) in GR dies off to zero as you move away from the massive object, while in MG the strength of gravity decreases at first but then either platues or starts increasing again at further distances. This stronger gravity at further out distances is what is meant to explain the ""extra gravity"" which causes faster than expected rotation rates of galaxies, and it does so without the need to add in Dark Matter.

Modified Gravity (MG), Questions and Answers:

Q: Does MG break relativity?

A: No, not necesarily. MG is not one theory it is a collection of many theories which only share in common the idea of explaining the ""extra gravity"" problem by changing the equation for gravity rather than adding in Dark Matter. An individual Modified Gravity theory may or may not choose to stick with or violate the princples of relativity. For an MG theory within the framework of relativity, gravity is still the bending of space-time, all that has changed is that the ""slope"" of the bending of space-time is different (at large distances) than what it is in the Einstien Equations.

Q: I thought MOND was discredited because it can't predict gravitational lensing, cluster dynamics, or the CMB?

A: ""MOND"" is just one particular modified gravity theory. It was the first to gain prominance and is often falsely conflated with the entire diverse research area of modfied gravity theoreis. It acurately models a vast number of galactic rotation velocity profiles, and thats it. Most researchers consider MOND to just be a first order proof of concept and not something that is meant to be a stand alone theory. Active work on modified gravity research concerncs full relatitivistic field theories, MOND is just a simple aceleration equation. The goal of modified gravity research is to find a relativistic field theory of gravity which reproduces MOND in the apropriate limit and also explains everything else. MOND is to modified gravity what Newton's Law of Gravity is to Einstien's General Relativity. Saying that modfied gravity is discredited because MOND does not explain gravitaitonal lensing is like saying that GR is discredited because Newtonian Gravity doesn't explain gravitational lensing.

The selling poitns of the DM model:

By looking at the rotation rate of a galaxy we can fill in the amount of DM that would have to be present to expalin its rotatioanl velocity profile. This is not a prediction from the DM model, this fitting the model to the observations. What needs to be done to scientifically validate the DM model is to take the amount of DM we need to fill in in order to explain a galaxy's rotation rate and then use that to make some other indpendent prediction which can be verified. Lets look at a few other ways to infer how much extra gravity there is around a galaxy (which in the DM model tranlates to how much DM it has)

1.) Gravity distorts the path of beams of light, known as gravitational lensing, so we can look at how much lensing there is around a galaxy or galaxy cluster.

2.) The velocities of galaxies within a cluster are influenced by their gravitational pulls on each other.

3.) The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the earliest and most distant light we can see, it is the thermal radiation (remnant heat glow) of the plasma which once filled the universe everywhere before cooling down. We see this light today because light takes time to travel through space and we see that it contains a distinctive splotchy patern of hot/cold spots. The size of these spots has to do with the dynamics of matter, radiation, and gravity in the early universe. The amount of DM present in the early universe would play a large role in this procses.

These 3 examples represent indpendent observations which also depend on the ""extra gravity"" and thus by implication the DM quantity in galaxies or across the universe as a whole. It is claimed that the DM model agrees with all of these indpendent observations. However, I have also heard complaints about the model having too many free parameters so it is not clear to me on which of these points it can be said that the model is making acurate predictions vs just being fit to the observations. I am not a DM model expert myself and this is a general overview.

There is one other topic which comes up often in support of DM's existence which I feel should be adressed seperately.

4.) In high velocity collisions of galaxy clusters (like the Bullet Cluster) the bulk of the vissible mass rapidly decelerates in the collsion but the DM is predicted to pass through the collision mostly unafected and is therefore thrown out in front of the vissible matter. This appears to be what we observe from the gravitational lensing around high velocity galactic cluster collisions which seems to sugest a large invisible source of mass was ejected from the collsioin out ahead of the vissible matter.

The selling point of MG (and the crisis for DM):

The modified gravity equations (MOND and its relativistic generalizations) work for galactic rotations. Take the *vissible matter* of a galaxy and plug it into the modified gravity equations and you get out the observed rotation velocity profile of that galaxy, for nearly every galaxy from the smallest to the largest across many orders of magnittude of vissible mass. There are some outliers but they represent less then 1% of all galaxies studeied. It is very important to understand the difference between MG and DM on the crucial topic of galactic rotation velocity profiles. The DM model does not predict galactic rotation rates, it uses galactic rotation rates to model the amount of DM in and around the galaxy and then that can be possibly used to make testable predictions, with every galaxy having a unieque DM Halo. MG predicts the glactic rotation rate. MG gives a universal aceleration law for gravitational orbits, it takes in the vissible matter distribution of a galaxy as its indpendent variable and makes the testable prediction of what the galactic rotation rate should be, and its overwhelmingly acurate down to fine details.

The succses of MG theoreis at predicting galactic rotation rates is a crisis for the DM model. Why? Because in the DM model the bulk of the gravity in and around a galaxy is coming from its DM, not its vissible matter. The DM model doesnt make any strait forward prediction about there being any relationship between the vissible matter distribution of a galaxy and its rotation rate. The existence of any corelation between the vissible matter distribution and the rotation rate of a galaxy implies for the DM model that nearly every galaxy has a tight corelation between the mass density distribution of the DM Halo around the mass density distribution of the vissible matter in the galacitc disk. This is major problem because we already know from both observations and simulations that galactic formation is a chaotic procses which involves compelx dynamics of mergers and collisions between galaxies and dwarf galaxies of a wide range of sizes and masses, with some amount of mass being ejected from the galaxies in the collisions.

The DM model has an incredibly severe apparent paradox on its hands: on the one hand DM is supposed to be able to seperate out from vissible matter during galactic/galactic-cluster collsions because of how differently the DM and vissible matter interact with the other forces (hence the explanation of the gravitational lensing around the Bullet Cluster) yet on the other hand somehow nearly all galaxies (having expericied all manner of chaotic histories in their past) retain this very precise highly corelated density distribution between their vissible matter and their Dark Matter. I would love to know how the DM models resolves this aparent paradox.

The supposed issues with Modfied Gravity:

Most of the supposed issues with Modfied Gravity theories are the claim that MOND does not adress our observations of galactic cluster dynamics, collisions, gravitational lensing, and the CMB. This is a nonsensical argument against Modified Gravity and all it reveals is just how behind the times most physicists are with the current progress in Modified Gravity research. There are multiple \*fully developed relativistic feild theories of modified gravity\* and progress is ongiong to calculate what predictions these theoreis make. Here are some results:

1,) A modified gravity theory called SVT Gravity succeeded at moddeling the CMB temperature spectrum.

2.) Another modified gravity theory called Conformal Gravity succeeded at predicting the type 1A supernova brightness-redshift curve.

What is significant about these cases is that these theories already accurately predict galactic rotation curves, without dark matter, by emulating MOND in the non-relativistic limit.

A final speculative remark on the Bullet Cluster:

The Bullet Cluster and other similar galactic cluster collisions appear to present the greatest issue for any Modified Gravity theory because it is assumed that gravitational lensing necesarily implies a local source of mass. However, we already know of a counter-example: gravitational waves. When massive objects acelerate they radiate gravitational waves which propogate out away form the massive objects and which will lense the paths of light beams which cut across the gravitational waves. Furthermore, gravitational disturbances are poorly understood outside the linearized limit. As a quick bit of background on this: electromagnetism is a linear theory meaning that two overlapping electromagnetic fields add together in a simple way (vector addition). But gravity is not linear, two gravitiaonl fields which overlap in space do not simply add up, the resulting total field is not simply just the sum of the two, its much more complicated. This is already true in GR but it becomes even more severe in many MG theoreis in which there are aditional fields or higher order derivatives in the gravitiaonal equations. In my opinion, it is extreamly poor reasoning to assert that gravitational leansing necesarily implies a local source of mass, especially if we are considering modfied equations of gravity which may contain behaviors not seen in GR.

Here are the two candidate MG field theories I mentioned:

Physics,Is it a good idea to pursue phd while being more leaned towards working in the industry?,"As the title suggests, i want to ask experience peopled about a very confusing time that I'm going through

Before anyone says I should have taken engineering if I was interested in working industry, I would have if I had any remote attraction towards engineering.

Being from a third world country that makes millions of engineering graduates yearly, the admission and process of becoming a engineer isn't something I find myself going through. Neither do I have any specific interest in any of those fields, only thing i know is that my interests lie within physics and natural sciences in general. I love understanding aspects of life and how they work from molecular to sub-atomic level.

Which brings me to my main question, being from a country with weak currency, I just want to pursue a phd abroad and then jump into industry if possible to gain enough financial stability (personal reasons, i choose physics because it had 1/3 of fees in comparison to any engineering still i had to take student loan to study.)

I love research, the institute i current study in is a research focused institute too although everything comes with it's own bad sides(only way to gain industrial experience is through internship.)


I know how tough it is to study through your phd, but i know i can work as long as it's physics that I'm doing. I don't mind academia i just don't like the competitive aspect of it. I don't think i want to go through such phases again. Industry gives me a chance to change trajectory of my family and myself.

Physics,"Gamma ray beam ""disappointment""","I don't know if this is the right place, but I feel ""disappointment"" with the lack of technological progress on gamma ray beams. Even the production of electron-positron pairs by colliding two real photons (""Breit Wheeler pair production"") is almost impossible to access experimentally, and it seems like it ought to be simple. The reverse process - two photon annihilation - is the main thing that happens when positrons enter matter. Certainly when it comes to higher energy things like meson photoproduction and the like, it seems no one is even trying. The entire scientific community seems like it just wants to ""cheat"" by doing all the experiments with virtual photons - by shooting high energy charged particles at the target in order to simulate photons. Where are the proposals to actually generate a 1 GeV photon beam and use it to test these things?

It seems a little strange, given that when high energy electrons are incident on matter, they actually lose most of their energy by emitting the photons. At higher energies, and higher atomic numbers for the target - bremsstrahlung losses actually exceeds ionization by inelastic scattering from atoms. So you can't claim that it's harder to generate a photon beam than an electron beam at such high energies!

Clearly, there are severe struggles with phase-space densities and the like - but why is so little attention going toward resolving it? I've read a few particle physics papers about photonuclear reactions and pair production - and most of them simply take for granted that ""We don't do that, we don't even talk about it, and we don't even ask if we could do so in a future experiment"".

Given that many physics teams are exploring very exotic and hard-to-reach tests such as dark matter detection and such, it seems strange that this relatively mundane topic just never even gets talked about.",ScienceGuy1006,1fo82wm,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fo82wm/gamma_ray_beam_disappointment/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fo82wm/gamma_ray_beam_disappointment/,2024-09-24 09:05:02,0,0.31,0,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1fo82wm

Physics,Too dumb for physics?,"I'm a healthcare worker preparing to take the MCATs, but there is one subject that makes me overwhelmed with anxiety: physics. I've avoided the exam for quite some time due to this section.

I have a BSc, but I am *much* stronger in the arts and the humanities. In fact, my specialty is in interdisciplinary studies and I enjoy topics that tread in the middle, such as anthropology, architecture, and medicine. (I double majored in a branch of biology and a branch in history, but was awarded a BSc).

This is not to say that I don't respect or enjoy physics—it's actually the opposite. I think physics and math are fascinating and I respect physicists *so much*, probably because it's my biggest weakness (it's my 'wow, I could never!' field). The little I do understand in videos or old lectures, I find really interesting and I always wanted to learn more.

However, despite enjoying these fields, I know I don't have an aptitude for it. I was ranked at the bottom of my class for math in high school, but at the top 1 or 2 in my grade for the humanities. It just never 'clicked,' so I found myself being afraid of it and not wanting to put much effort into it ('I'll get a bad mark anyways').

On one hand, I know that the physics section of the MCATs is shallow/short and I could probably get by with studying a bit. But I've always wanted to know **how physicists think** and how they approach physics.

I think so many students struggle with physics more than any other discipline in the sciences because it has the least amount of material you can get by with pure memorization. Without genuine understanding of the material, I don't think it's possible to solve most of the questions.

My personal issue is that I read something, I think that I understand it, I solve some questions, get them wrong, and then don't understand... why or what I don't understand, if that makes sense.

I used to be terrible at chemistry, but I was at least able to go backwards: I would do a million practice problems, find patterns, then understand the theory. I don't feel that I've been able to do this as effectively in physics, and it's probably not the way to approach this, anyways.

In all honesty, it's probably not that I don't have a natural aptitude for physics/math specifically, but that I don't have a natural aptitude/have a fear of taking the time to understand something in-depth. And physics is the discipline that exposes this weakness of mine the most harshly.

My questions are:

* **What are some good textbooks for** ***actual*** **beginners (with good explanations)?** (e.g. I found Organic Chemistry as a Second Language amazing for orgo)
* **What is the best way to approach physics and physics questions, in your opinion?**
* **Any profs/teachers: how do you think your worst students (who succeeded), did this? Was it enough for them to just put all their time and energy into physics, or do you think there's a limit to how far someone can go in this field if their natural strengths lie elsewhere?**

I hope this doesn't make me sound too lazy, like I just didn't put enough effort into it. Because I enjoy learning (at least surface-level) physics and math, I have been more than happy to try and improve. But between not understanding the material well + not knowing how to answer a question if they're not exactly as it's explained in the textbook, I do feel discouraged often.",pupuddingg,1flw8yt,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1flw8yt/too_dumb_for_physics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1flw8yt/too_dumb_for_physics/,2024-09-21 05:51:53,55,0.83,55,0,45,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1flw8yt

Physics,"Does anyone know if an experiment like this has ever been performed? I know that the convention is that Temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy per particle, but after thinking about this a lot I'm not so sure it is. ","The experiment: 

In this experiment, two identical rigid containers, A and B, are filled with helium gas at the same initial temperature, but Container B contains twice the number of gas particles as Container A. Both containers are perfectly insulated to prevent heat exchange with the environment. A fixed amount of energy Q is added to each container using a calibrated heat source. After the energy is added, the temperature increase (ΔT) of each container is measured. If temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy per particle, Container A will exhibit a larger temperature increase than Container B because the same amount of energy is distributed among fewer particles. Conversely, if temperature depends on energy density, both containers should show the same temperature increase since the added energy per unit volume is the same. By comparing the temperature changes in the two containers, the experiment determines whether temperature is linked to average kinetic energy per particle or to energy density.",Organic_Rip2483,1flxbj4,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1flxbj4/does_anyone_know_if_an_experiment_like_this_has/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1flxbj4/does_anyone_know_if_an_experiment_like_this_has/,2024-09-21 07:09:00,0,0.19,0,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1flxbj4

This is our optical system configuration:  
The laser beam from the laser diode is directed to a prism (triangular mirror), and then it falls onto the MEMS device, which has a tiny rotating actuator. This rotation causes the mirror to reflect the laser beam at an angle of 60 degrees. The light from the object is then reflected back to the mirror and directed towards the photodiode (PD).

I want to analyze the effect of beam offset from the center of the mirror. One of our components is slightly misaligned, which is causing a beam offset, and I would like to visualize its impact through simulations.",umair1181gist,1fl0gcd,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fl0gcd/how_can_i_simulate_this_configuration_in_zemax/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fl0gcd/how_can_i_simulate_this_configuration_in_zemax/,2024-09-20 01:20:39,6,0.8,6,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/lIPSBX60peMDn9UWsiSpISofYc4AmK6REjPCQprk-Ww.jpg,t3_1fl0gcd

Physics,Why Electrolyzing Water to Use as Rocket Fuel Wouldn't Work,"I watched[ Integza's *fascinating* video](https://youtu.be/7O2MZr9B9XM?si=nLgrCPmHiYJaThCA) in which he made a rocket engine fueled by electrolysis of water. This led to a spiral of thinking about why such a thing would never be a practical propellant system. Unfortunately, my scientific knowledge is somewhat limited, so I was hoping that this sub could check my reasoning.

I know that liquid oxygen/hydrogen engines give you a pretty darn good ISP of around 460. The problem as I understand it is that even cryogenic hydrogen is bulky (\~70 moles per liter) and thus takes a lot of space, which means larger tanks, more insulation, and more weight and drag. Liquid oxygen is \~35.7 moles per liter (i.e., around half as many as H2, which I suppose is convenient if you’re making H2O). Thus, while water only has \~55 moles of hydrogen per liter (79% of a liter of liquid H2), it also has its own oxygen in the perfect stoichiometric ratio, is a lot easier to work with, and you’d only need around 1.27 liters of water to get the same amount of moles of propellant as about one liter of liquid H2 and one of liquid O2. (NB: I understand real-world rocket engines don’t work this way for a variety of reasons; for instance, the Space Shuttle’s RS-25s operated at an oxygen-hydrogen mixture of 6:03:1.)

So, even given the various other engineering problems, here’s why I think the hypothetical electrolysis engine wouldn’t work:

Reason One: Thermodynamics. Water, of course, isn’t fuel; it’s “burned” oxygen and hydrogen. Even if Kerbal Space Program was real life, I assume you couldn't use the engine to generate power to electrolyze the water and also have it do useful work (like generate thrust), since this would violate the laws of thermodynamics. Even in a theoretically 100% efficient system, you'd be pumping in the same amount of energy to break the water apart as you'd be getting out.

Reason Two: since we can’t use our combustion to power our engine, we need to get it from someplace else. Let's suppose we use a battery as the “real” source of energy we’re getting from our rocket. You need 237 KJ to electrolyze a mole of water. According to Wikipedia, the maximum theoretical energy density of a lithium ion battery [maxes out around .9 Kj/g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery). (To compare, [the energy density of hydrogen is 140 kJ/g!](https://chemistry.beloit.edu/edetc/SlideShow/slides/energy/density.html)) If I did the math right, that means means *per mole* of propellant, you’d need more than 2.6 kg of battery, and that doesn’t even count the rather heavy electrodes you’d need to get the electrolysis going! From what I can find, the Space Shuttle's RS-25s used 514 kg of propellant *per second*. Not sure how many moles that’d be, but it seems to me that would be… a lot of dead battery weight.

Ergo, electrolysis of water does not seem to be an efficient way to go to space. In fact, until we invent tiny fusion engines or manage to miniaturize nuclear reactors, it seems to me that *nothing* is going to be as energy-dense as hydrogen fuel… and if you had those technologies, I guess you might as well just heat up the water and shoot it out the back end as a nuclear-thermal rocket.",kmondschein,1fi6ucc,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fi6ucc/why_electrolyzing_water_to_use_as_rocket_fuel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fi6ucc/why_electrolyzing_water_to_use_as_rocket_fuel/,2024-09-16 15:01:12,0,0.37,0,0,26,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1fi6ucc

Physics,"I f*cking love graduate classes, why couldn't undergrad be like this?","I'm gonna say it. Graduate classes are so much better (and harder) than undergrad classes and it's not even close. It was only when I took my first graduate class that I realized exactly why my undergrad experiences felt so lackluster. Because you have to go all in for a grad class. You can't miss a single fucking beat or you're dead. Graduate classes push you beyond your comfort zone by expecting you to understand the topic at a deeper level. Undergrad is all about ""remember how to copy paste the problem solving method from your homework on the exam"" and it's lame as hell. I remember my first graduate exam when I sat down and there were literally 2 problems and I had never seen anything like them before. It's like, well if you don't understand the material deeply enough to problem solve from first principles than sucks to suck, welcome to the real world bitch. Undergrad just doesn't have the balls to force you to *get it*. Undergrad is way too easy and it set the bar too low. If I can just take 1 or 2 classes and have them be insanely hard, that is what I fucking live for. I love being able to zero in on a topic and not have to juggle 5 or 6 ""mile wide and an inch deep"" classes I have to do in undergrad.

About a week ago I read a post I think on r/Math about how the decimal point in 0.000..., if given a value of π, could simbolize the infinite expansion (which is not certain) and infinite complexity of our universe.

It's also always some complicated meaningless philosophical abstracion or a hint to solve a 50 year old mystery with no mathematical formalism, but no one ever talks about classical mechanics or thermodynamics because they think they understand everything and then fail to apply fundamental adamant principles from those theories to their questions. It's always ""Could x if considered as y mean z?"" or ""What if i becomes j instead of k?"". It's never ""Why does i become k and not j?"".

Nonetheless, the autors of these kinds of posts not only ask unreasoned questions, but also answer other questions without knowing the questions' meanings. Once I asked a question about classical mechanics, specifically why gravity is conservative and someone answered by saying that if I imagine spacetime as a fabric planets bend the fabric and travel around the bent fabric, or something like that. That person didn't know what my question was about, didn't answer my question and also said something wrong. And that's pretty hard to do all at once.

Physics,Do physicists really use parallel computing for theoretical calculations? To what extent?,"Hi all,

I’m not a physicist.

While hardware cannot really add creativity to answer fundamental questions, I’m curious to know how these parallel computing solutions are contributing to the advancement of physics and not just being another chatbot? 

A follow up question: Besides funding, what’s stopping physicists from utilizing these resources? Software? Access to hardware? 
I’m trying to understand IF there’s a bottleneck the public might not be aware of but is bugging the physics community for a while… not that I’m a savior or have any resources to solve those issues, just a curiosity to hear &amp; understand if 1 - those GPUs are really contributing to innovation, 2 - are they sufficient or do we still need more powerful chips/clusters? 

Any thoughts?

Calculus-based intro physics: Fluids, thermodynamics, optical instruments, relativity, quantum, atomic, or nuclear physics


Classical Mechanics: Non-inertial reference frames, Rigid Bodies in 3D, Lagrangian Mechanics, Coupled Harmonic Oscillators

E&amp;M: Maxwell Stress Tensor, Guided waves, Gauge transformations, Radiation, Relativity

Thermo: Chemical thermodynamics, quantum statistics, anything that ventures into condensed matter territory


Optics: Fourier optics, Fraunhofer vs Fresnel diffraction, holography, nonlinear optics, coherence theory, aberrations, stokes treatment of reflection and refraction.


Quantum: Have not taught yet.

Physics,What's the most egregious use of math you've ever seen a physicist use? ,"As a caveat, I absolutely love how physicists use math in creative ways (even if it's not rigorous or strictly correct). The classical examples are physicists' treatment of differentials (using dy/dx as a fraction) or applying Taylor series to anything and everything. My personal favourites are:

  
1. The Biot-Savart Law (taking the cross product of a differential with a vector???)

2. A way to do integration by parts without actually doing IBP? I saw this in Griffith's Intro to Quantum Mechanics textbook (I think). It goes something like this:

∫xsin(x)dx -&gt; ∫xsin(nx)dx for n = 1, -&gt; ∫ -d/dn cos(nx)dx -&gt; -d/dn ∫cos(nx)dx -&gt; -d/dn (sin(nx)/n) 

and after taking the derivative, you let n = 1.

Physics,What are your guy's thoughts on if the graviton must be massless? ,"I recently came across the Brans-Dick dRGT massive gravity model ([paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05595)). They postulate that the graviton has a mass and due to this feature, the effects of gravity are bounded, much like the effects of the weak nuclear force being bounded. This is supposed to solve issues like dark matter. 

Some questions to physicists in the field: 

* Is this assumption novel to MOND ? 
* Isn't it possible that the mass of the graviton is very tiny but not zero? 
* Perhaps so low we don't have sensitive enough instruments to detect it? 
* But when we're measuring the effects of gravity over millions of light years this very tiny mass then becomes significant?

Physics,[New Tool] Simple ICBM Simulator for Science Enthusiasts,"Hey r/Physics,

I’ve recently developed a basic tool called [ICBM Simulator](http://icbmsimulator.com/), and I wanted to share it with the community. This simulator lets you explore the launch and trajectory of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) from a scientific perspective.

**About the Tool:** The simulator is pretty straightforward—it allows you to input some basic launch parameters and see how an ICBM might travel through the atmosphere. It’s not a highly advanced tool, but it’s a good starting point for anyone interested in the basic science behind missile trajectories and orbits.

**What You Can Do:**

* **Basic Trajectory Simulation:** See the missile's path based on simple input parameters.
* **Impact Estimation:** Get a rough idea of where the missile might land.
* **Educational Purpose:** This tool is purely for scientific curiosity and learning.

**Why I Made It:** I created this simulator to help people understand the fundamentals of missile physics without getting too technical. Whether you're a student, educator, or just curious about how these things work, I hope you find it interesting.

**Feedback Welcome:** I’m still working on improving it, so I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions. If you have ideas for making it more useful or educational, please let me know!

Check it out at [icbmsimulator.com](http://icbmsimulator.com/) and let me know what you think.

I'm trying to do some N-body simulations, and while the coding is not a problem, I don't really have any practical experience with managing the project and the data and so on, and I'm wondering about the best way of storing all the results of the simulations.

In this case the results are just time series of positions and velocities, and each run is identified by a set of 10 or so parameters, so I know I could just put the results of each run in a text file and put the parameters in the title; but I could see that getting out of hand, making it hard to find what you're looking for, hard to store multiple runs where you change the numerical algorithm, and so on.

Physics,HepLean: Digitalising high energy physics,"Hi all. I’m an academic working in high energy physics. Over the last year or so, I’ve been working on a project to digitalise results (definitions, theorems and calculations) from high energy physics into a language called Lean 4. This project is called HepLean (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08863). 

Lean 4 is an interactive theorem prover and functional programming language, it allows you to write down definitions and theorems in a way close to how we would write them in LaTeX, the difference is that Lean 4 will automatically check proofs for correctness. Lean 4 has been used extensively in the formalisation of mathematics, and was recently used by google deepmind in their math olympiad challenge. 

The motivation behind HepLean is four-fold: 

1. To store results from high-energy physics in a linear manor making look-up easier. 
2. To make it easier to use automated methods, including AI, to prove results in theoretical physics. 
3. To make it easier to review papers for mathematical correctness. 
4. To introduce new pedagogical methods to the field. 

HepLean is a fairly ambitious project. Which is why I’m trying to get more people involved, and am writing here! If you would like to get involved and have a background in physics, math or computer science, head over to the GitHub (https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean). Even if you don’t know and don’t want to learn Lean there is lots to be done on the documentation side. 

Happy to answer any questions :). 

\*\*Update\*\*: There is now a way to add informal lemma and informal definitions to HepLean. These are english-written rather than Lean written definitions and lemmas. Their inclusion means that if you have a background in physics or math, but don't know Lean there is still a way to contribute.",joe_s_smith,1f2dt1s,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1f2dt1s/heplean_digitalising_high_energy_physics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1f2dt1s/heplean_digitalising_high_energy_physics/,2024-08-27 10:37:22,65,0.96,65,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1f2dt1s

Physics,Quasilocal Newtonian limit of general relativity and galactic dynamics,"Link and abstract below -
What are your impressions?

https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00358

A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies, offering an explanation for their observed rotation curves.

Physics,I feel like physics does not love me.,"Ever since I was young I had a huge interest in physics, instead of being out there and playing with kids in the Kindergarten I tried to make sense of books that were very much out of my league. Because of this interest they had me skip two grades just so I can attend Math and Science with the older kids. But the universe as a cruel joke also gave me ADHD, as I got older I realised I had the worst information retention out there, I forget constants and numbers all the time. I also mess up a lot on really precise calculations. I understand concepts very well but I bomb my tests because I make stupid errors in my calculations. But I worked really hard to get over that and I’m doing well with Mathematics. But the information retention part is still an issue. I think I did horrible on my physics test on a National Standardised test because of questions like “What’s the specific resistance of a Copper wire” and you have to answer stuff like this from memory. At this rate if I keep messing up on my tests and get Bs all the time I might not be able to pursue higher education in physics. I don’t like some fields as much as I like physics but my counsellors, teachers and parents keep telling me that some fields I might excel at would be much easier for me to get through with much better career prospects. Though I love physics I feel like physics does not love me, because of the sheer amount of roadblocks I’m facing compared to other routes. At this point should I give up and pursue something else or should I try to stick to physics.


TL;DR I like physics but I suck at it, should I pursue a different field for higher education

Physics,Square Root of Canonical Line Bundle and Spin Structure,"Sorry if this more of a math oriented question, but I am trying to understand something I read on Wikipedia that states that if a square root of the canonical bundle of a manifold M, exists, then choice of the square root corresponds to choice of spin structure. I am trying to see this intuitively.

I have one idea that seems to be in this direction. If our manifold admits an almost complex structure and the squareroot of the canonical bundle exist then the tangent bundle has even degree which means it's first chern class vanishes under a Z mod 2 reduction. This directly implies the second stiefel whitney class of M vanishes hence spin structure exists.

Self-assembly processes run deep in biological machinery, creating complex structures such as the lipid molecular assemblies in cell membranes and the dynamic multi-megadalton spliceosome complexes that precisely remove noncoding sequences from coding RNA in cell nuclei. The concept of spontaneous, bottom-up formation of nanoscale architectures, driven by weak interaction forces between molecular building blocks, holds significant promise for materials science applications. This approach contrasts with more conventional synthetic top-down methods and is particularly appealing due to the energy and resource efficiency inherent in biological systems. To extract the advantages of this nanofabrication approach, we must better understand the underlying forces that lead to the formation of both the structures and the defects in synthetic self-assembly networks.

Defects are typically associated with irregularities in atomically crystalline materials. Self-assembly materials are often amorphous at the atomic scale but periodically ordered at the mesoscale, i.e., with unit cells of tens of nanometers. In such mesoscale materials, even larger defects exist, however, that are manifested as long-range collective distortions of tens of unit cells. Studying these defects requires characterization techniques capable of observing distortions of individual unit cells at high spatial resolution over statistically significant length scales/volumes as well as methods to analyze the associated large and complex datasets. This is important as such collective behavior can lead to profound changes in material properties.

An international team of researchers has achieved a major milestone in nanotechnology by mapping the intricate topological textures within 3D nanoscale networks with cubic single-diamond crystal structure (space group Fd3̅m), synthetically produced by block copolymer self-assembly replicated in gold. This groundbreaking research utilized advanced non-destructive X-ray nanotomography at the cSAXS beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS), achieving a spatial resolution of 11 nm over a large volume of 90 µm³ thanks to state-of-the-art instrumentation for high-resolution ptychographic X-ray computed tomography. This allowed the detailed analysis of nearly 70,000 individual crystal unit cells with sizes of a few tens of nanometers.

With access to both large volume and high spatial resolution, the researchers were able to capture not just a single topological defect, i.e., a defect with high stability against perturbations, but a pair of oppositely charged entities: ""comet"" and ""trefoil"" patterns pinned at the domain boundary. These patterns resemble those observed in “soft” liquid crystals, yet exhibit typical “hard” crystal behavior. Inspired by the Moiré phenomenon of interference patterns, the researchers devised a method to analyze strain in the volume without requiring prior information on the nodes' positions in the network. The observed strain distribution suggests structural synchronization arising from the topological nature of defects. This means that topological defects attract a higher density of local “classical” defects to their location, helping to stabilize long-range ordering in the network.

This research marks a significant advancement in the reconstruction of large volumes of mesoscale structures as well as the understanding of topological textures that emerge in self-assembly networks, while simultaneously analyzing tens of thousands of unit cells with high resolution. While the current work deals with diamond structures grown as a soft condensed matter system and then templated with gold, the results of this study highlight the opportunities that will be presented to the soft-matter community with the upgrade of the SLS. The higher brilliance expected from the upgrade will likely allow for non-destructive structural studies of polymer systems at the deep nanoscale.

Physics,Help Improve the Wikipedia Page on the Klein Paradox!,"Hey everyone,

I've recently been diving deep into the Klein paradox and noticed that the Wikipedia page on this topic could use some enhancements. As many of you know, the Klein paradox is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics, where it describes the counterintuitive behavior of particles encountering high potential barriers.

Currently, the Wikipedia entry is somewhat limited and could benefit from a more comprehensive explanation. Here's a brief outline of what could be added or improved:

Historical Context and Discovery:

Detailed background on Oskar Klein, his original paper, and the historical significance of the paradox. Mathematical Formalism:

A clearer and more detailed explanation of the Dirac equation and its role in the paradox. Step-by-step derivation of the paradox with appropriate mathematical rigor. Physical Interpretation:

In-depth discussion of the physical implications and interpretations of the paradox. How it challenges classical intuition about potential barriers. Experimental Evidence:

Description of any experimental setups or observations that have confirmed or explored aspects of the Klein paradox. Applications and Relevance:

Modern applications in fields like graphene research, black hole physics, and quantum field theory. Discussion on how the paradox influences contemporary research in quantum mechanics and high-energy physics. Related Phenomena:

Connections to related concepts like the Zitterbewegung, quantum tunneling, and the Casimir effect. Visual Aids and Diagrams:

More illustrative diagrams to help explain the theoretical concepts and mathematical derivations. I believe that a more thorough and well-rounded article would be incredibly beneficial for students, researchers, and enthusiasts alike. If any of you have expertise in quantum mechanics or related fields, your contributions would be invaluable.

Let's collaborate and make the Wikipedia page on the Klein paradox a great resource for everyone interested in this intriguing topic!
