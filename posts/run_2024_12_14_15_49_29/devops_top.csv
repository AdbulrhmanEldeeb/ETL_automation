devops,Terraform or OpenTofu?,"Hello there!

I'm back into devops after a few years doing other stuff. I'll be managing AWS infrastructure and will be back to using terraform.

However in the meantime Terraform got forked into OpenTofu, and now I'm not sure which one I should install.

Our work use case is pretty simple:

- we don't resell terraform or other hashicorp stuff, in any way
- we ""just"" need to manage our infrastructure via IAC
- we really DON'T want to switch tool at some point
- we want to stay on amazon's blessed version of the tool

So, which way to go? Terraform or OpenTofu?

EDIT: No, we are not going to evaluate other tools to manage infrastructure via code. No, we won't consider CloudFormation.",znpy,1hdhlrx,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hdhlrx/terraform_or_opentofu/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hdhlrx/terraform_or_opentofu/,2024-12-13 17:37:52,77,0.93,77,0,80,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdhlrx

devops,[K8s] Good practices for sharing files between nodes in HA Kubernetes Cluster,"Hi guys, I self-host a 4-node Kubernetes cluster where three nodes have only their boot drives for storage, and one node hosts a RAID array that provides an NFS share. On the three nodes, I mount this NFS share, and I use `hostPath` in my service configurations to map each pod's files to its corresponding subdirectory on the share. However, I‚Äôve encountered significant issues with NFS during network interruptions or power outages, where it becomes unreliable or unstable.

I‚Äôm aware of \`nfs-provisioner\` for Kubernetes, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to allow me to specify a particular subdirectory in the share. This limitation forces me to configure separate shares for each service, which is cumbersome.

1. Since most of my pods don‚Äôt require multiple instances (and therefore doesn't need multi-reader/multi-writer capabilities), what are the best practices to ensure data persistence between pod rescheduling to another node/deletion and recreation while minimizing data loss or corruption during network outages or when the NFS server goes down?
2. Is there a way to configure Kubernetes to automatically evict all pods if the NFS server becomes unavailable?
3. For deployments that require multiple instances (e.g. Caddy), what would be the best practices for sharing data between pods?

Additionally, I strongly prefer that data remains directly on the filesystem in the RAID array so that I can manually edit configurations or access files directly when needed.

EDIT: Keeping nfs or similar as a provisioning option is very much preferred!

devops,"Asking for feedback - Cyberbro - Analyze observable (IP, hash, domain) with ease - (CTI / Cybersecurity project)","Hello there,

I am a junior cybersecurity engineer and I am trying to develop an open source project in Python Flask.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

My project currently lacks real tests cases but it has a build workflow that executes pytests.

I am wondering how to manage properly API Keys and maybe push the automation to automatically build and run the docker workflow to a registry / hosting service.

This project is a simple application that extracts your IoCs from garbage input (using regex) and checks their reputation using multiple services.

It is mainly Inspired by existing projects Cybergordon and IntelOwl.

I am convinced that this project is useful for SOC analysts or CTI professionnals (I use it daily for my job).

**Features**

* **Effortless Input Handling**: Paste raw logs, IoCs, or fanged IoCs, and let our regex parser do the rest.
* **Multi-Service Reputation Checks**: Verify observables (IP, hash, domain, URL) across multiple services like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, IPInfo, Spur\[.\]us, IP Quality Score, MDE, Google Safe Browsing, Shodan, Abusix, Phishtank, ThreatFox, Github, Google...
* **Detailed Reports**: Generate comprehensive reports with advanced search and filter options.
* **High Performance**: Leverage multithreading for faster processing.
* **Automated Observable Pivoting**: Automatically pivot on domains, URL and IP addresses using reverse DNS and RDAP.
* **Accurate Domain Info**: Retrieve precise domain information from ICANN RDAP (next generation whois).
* **Abuse Contact Lookup**: Accurately find abuse contacts for IPs, URLs, and domains.
* **Export Options**: Export results to CSV and¬†**autofiltered well formatted**¬†Excel files.
* **MDE Integration**: Check if observables are flagged on your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) tenant.
* **Proxy Support**: Use a proxy if required.
* **Data Storage**: Store results in a SQLite database.
* **Analysis History**: Maintain a history of analyses with easy retrieval and search functionality.
