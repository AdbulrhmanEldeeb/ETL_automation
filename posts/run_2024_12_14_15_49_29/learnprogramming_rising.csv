I’ve recently started competitive programming, and I’m finding it challenging to solve even 800-rated problems on platforms like Codeforces. Here’s a bit of context about my current situation:

1. **My Background**:
   * I’m comfortable with the basics of C++ (loops, arrays, if-else, etc.) but haven’t done much problem-solving before.
2. **Where I Struggle**:
   * Understanding problem statements: Sometimes, the language is too confusing for me to break down the question.
   * Coming up with the right logic or approach: I don’t yet recognize patterns like greedy, simulation, or brute force.
   * Solving within constraints: Concepts like O(n) or time complexity are still new to me.
3. **Example Problem**: For instance, I recently tried this 800-rated question *""Alyona and a Square Jigsaw Puzzle""* on Codeforces. Even though it’s labeled as a beginner problem, I couldn’t figure out how to approach it. The editorial solution felt complex, and I’m not sure how to think like that.
4. **What I Need Help With**:
   * How do I get better at breaking down and understanding problems?
   * What’s the best way to practice and improve? Should I stick to Codeforces or try other platforms first?
   * Are there specific resources or guides that helped you when you were at this stage?

I’d really appreciate any advice, resources, or strategies from those of you who’ve been in a similar position. How did you go from struggling with beginner problems to feeling more confident?

learnprogramming,I'm tired of Front-End Development. I've lost my passion and need something more exciting.,"TL;DR: I'm a first-year computer science student who's been learning front-end development for two years, but I'm burned out from working on layouts and animations. I want to explore something more engaging with possibility to build huge projects.



Hi, I'm a first-year computer science student from Poland. I've been learning front-end development for about two years, on and off. I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript well. I also know how to work with SQL databases using PHP and have a basic understanding of React. Thanks to my college and high school, I've learned the syntax and general basics of C++ and Python, though I haven’t tried applying them to practical projects yet. I've just made some easier console apps and solved few leetcode problems with these two.

Over the past few years, I’ve completed many web projects, starting with simple forms, followed by Odin Project exercises like Tic-Tac-Toe, and even larger websites, such as a fully usable gym site with login system or an online store with huge database.

The problem is that constantly choosing matching fonts, centering divs, and adding dark modes has become exhausting. It feels like the only thing left for me is learning more libraries and frameworks to make my code faster and my websites prettier. But creating smoother button animations no longer gives me satisfaction, to the point where nowadays, I only log in once every few days to do one or two LeetCode problems.

I’m the kind of person who loves expanding projects and adding new features. The project I’ve spent the most time on was a console-based RPG game in Python. I worked on it every day for weeks, adding new bosses and weapon upgrades, and to this day, it’s the most exciting thing I’ve ever worked with.

Next year, I’ll have to choose a specialization for my college (I don't know about the USA computer science, but in Poland there is something like specialization where you have to choose what exactly do you want to learn). The options are: Software Engineering and Mobile Technologies, Cybersecurity, and IT Systems Implementation. Obviously, I’m 99% sure that I am going to choose the first option since I’ve already spent hundreds of hours coding. Do you think it’s a good idea to start learning Kotlin/Java now to prepare for mobile technologies? Or do you have other suggestions for a learning path that could bring me joy and excitement? I have never been good at math and physics, so probably gamedev, or machine learning are not the best ideas for me.",Unable_Jicama_7069,1hdgq7d,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hdgq7d/im_tired_of_frontend_development_ive_lost_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hdgq7d/im_tired_of_frontend_development_ive_lost_my/,2024-12-13 16:59:51,19,0.86,19,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hdgq7d
