Python,I created Musync - a python CLI tool for syncing playlists between music streaming services ,"Hi r/Python \- a couple of months ago decided to try out Youtube Music as a long time Spotify user. I ended up really liking it, but was hesitant to fully make the switch for fear of losing all of my playlists, followed artists, liked songs etc. So I decided to create [Musync](https://pypi.org/project/pymusync/).

[Link to source code](https://github.com/devitt94/musync)

# What it does

Musync allows you sync your own user-created playlists, followed playlists and followed artists from one streaming service to another in a single command e.g.

`musync unisync --source spotify --destination youtube`

# Target Audience

* Spotify users interested in trying out Youtube Music (or vice versa).
* Youtube Music users who want to share playlists with Spotify users (or vice versa).

# Quickstart

# Installation

Using pip:

    pip install pymusync

Using pipx:

    pipx install pymusync

You can verify the installation worked and see a list of commands by running:

    musync --help

For more details on how to use, see the [README](https://github.com/devitt94/musync/blob/master/README.md#usage).

Python,"Feedback - Cyberbro - Analyze observable (IP, hash, domain) with ease - (CTI Cybersecurity project)","Hello there,

I am a junior cybersecurity engineer and I am trying to develop an open source project in Python Flask and HTML.

Any feedback would be appreciated on the code structure, even if it actually works I think there are many improvements to be made (OOP, classes, I/O, MultiThread, MultiProcessing?).

I would be really glad to have a real Python programmer giving me even small pieces of advice to improve the project. 

This project is a simple application that extracts your IoCs from garbage input (using regex) and checks their reputation using multiple services.

It is mainly Inspired by existing projects Cybergordon and IntelOwl.

I am convinced that this project is useful for SOC analysts or CTI professionnals (I use it daily for my job, and my company took interest for it).

**Features**

* **Effortless Input Handling**: Paste raw logs, IoCs, or fanged IoCs, and let our regex parser do the rest.
* **Multi-Service Reputation Checks**: Verify observables (IP, hash, domain, URL) across multiple services like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, IPInfo, Spur\[.\]us, IP Quality Score, MDE, Google Safe Browsing, Shodan, Abusix, Phishtank, ThreatFox, Github, Google...
* **Detailed Reports**: Generate comprehensive reports with advanced search and filter options.
* **High Performance**: Leverage multithreading for faster processing.
* **Automated Observable Pivoting**: Automatically pivot on domains, URL and IP addresses using reverse DNS and RDAP.
* **Accurate Domain Info**: Retrieve precise domain information from ICANN RDAP (next generation whois).
* **Abuse Contact Lookup**: Accurately find abuse contacts for IPs, URLs, and domains.
* **Export Options**: Export results to CSV andÂ **autofiltered well formatted**Â Excel files.
* **MDE Integration**: Check if observables are flagged on your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) tenant.
* **Proxy Support**: Use a proxy if required.
* **Data Storage**: Store results in a SQLite database.
* **Analysis History**: Maintain a history of analyses with easy retrieval and search functionality.

Python,Gravity Modelling Fast Multiple Method - Request for Assistance,"Hi all,

I'm trying to model the gravity field of stationary irregularly shaped body in a discredited space using the Fast Multiple Method.

 I just can't seem to get sensible results when I compare it against my response on a set of receivers using other methods such as Barnes-Hutt. 

Does anyone have any experience, or has used any open source applications/examples for something similar? I have seen papers and some GitHub repos, but I'm finding them hard to replicate.",BitcoinBeers,1hdubjp,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hdubjp/gravity_modelling_fast_multiple_method_request/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hdubjp/gravity_modelling_fast_multiple_method_request/,2024-12-14 03:49:36,0,0.5,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdubjp
