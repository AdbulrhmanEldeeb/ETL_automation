gaming,Chinese players are review bombing Baldur’s Gate 3 because Swen presented GOTY to not-wukong,"Go here, filter recent negative comments, and make sure to show all languages: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/

Context: Astro Bot win GOTY, and Chinese players are really butthurt. Astro Bot is not on Steam though, so they lashed out at the presenter of the award instead, among other things.

Some choice quote translated (by me):

""销量不重要，那想必玩家口碑也不重要吧，这差评你可接好了。“年度是给不追求销量的游戏的”，那以后拉瑞安的游戏我可就不买了""

""Sales not important? Then player review must not be important either. Take this negative review. GOTY doesn’t have to meet sales targets? I’ll never buy Larian games again.”

""屠魔的少年，终究成魔""

“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he hereby become a monster.”

""我花钱了 不爽打个差评""

“I spent money and am pissed off so I’m giving a negative review.”

""不如小机器人，一个销量辣鸡游戏仅此而已""

“Worse than Astro Bot. Just a garbage game with good sales.”

""游戏开发不要在意玩家评价和销量，我给差评也请不要在意。""

“If developers don’t need to care for sales or reviews, please don’t mind my negative review.”

""为虎作伥""

“Accomplice of evil”

Rockstar Games dont need those shows really, they can shadowdrop on a monday at 7 am and still sell hilarious number.. Switch 2 .. same story Nintendo does their own stuff, whenever they want to. .

But.. for me most notably: 

What about the new Fable? Shouldnt there be some gameplay by now? This game has been in dev for ages.. (also since Playground games works hard on this.. is Forza Horizon on ice?)

Judas (from Ken Levine, Bioshock founder) should also be playable? No Trailers? Should we be worried? A new Bioshock game is also in develoopment right now... 

 I thought we might get a few hints about new Marvel games.. Wolverine? Blade? 

No news from the KOTOR remake.. 

I thought about Devil May Cry aswell,but Capcom had Okami and Onimusha so that was great.

Silksong?

Kojima was there.. but no new Death Stranding 2 infos... sus?

Doom Dark Ages?

And I'm firmly of the opinion that this game so far has done WAY........WAAAAYYY with the symbiote storyline and the portrayal of the symbiote itself than Sony Pictures has done since 2007.

And Venom in this game is actually intimidating with a badass voice, with a sinister vibe compared to the over the top goofy tone that's in the movies.

gaming,Balatro’s Success got me thinking of some other unorthodox roguelike ideas,"A poker inspired rogue-like becoming one of the most lauded indies of recent memory is definitely not something that was on my 2024 bingo card. But it got me thinking… what are some other genres that haven’t been explored by the often dubbed “over explored” genre of roguelikes?

Specifically, I thought of bowling and darts. Choose to start off a run with a specific bowling ball or dart set with their own unique playstyles. Upgrade your rolling or throwing techniques with rogue-like abilities. Add cool interactions between the bowling pins or the way darts are scored. If there are any hidden games like these please inform me as I would love to check them out. 

Additionally I was thinking that maybe the rogue-like genre could be a good way to reintroduce the old-school arcady street sports games from the 2000s. The industry has pivoted away from them for whatever reason but maybe put it under the umbrella of the popular rogue-like genre and we could get a spiritual successor to those nostalgic games. 

What are some other underutilized genres that haven’t already been combined with the rogue-like genre?",DairyParsley6,1hdkq1m,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdkq1m/balatros_success_got_me_thinking_of_some_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdkq1m/balatros_success_got_me_thinking_of_some_other/,2024-12-13 19:54:21,0,0.18,0,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdkq1m
gaming,The irony of Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit,"Does anyone else think Nintendo ironically did more harm than good with their Palworld lawsuit? I feel a few weeks ago, Palworld's popularity was steadily dying and that the initial hype was more 'trend' than substance (not that Palworld is a bad game, but that the launch hype was something that they likely would never get close to replicating again).

But now after the lawsuit, at least in my head, I feel like Palworld as a franchise has gone from 'indie one hit wonder' to something more meaningful and long-standing. It feels like the fight against Nintendo makes Palworld even that much more legitimate of a gaming universe going forward... The full release of Palworld is going to go viral again merely off of all the new lawsuit drama lol

Very interested to see how everything plays out going forward, but seeing Nintendo's legal bullying coming back to bite them would be quite the irony ",beatinbunz247,1hdj5d1,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdj5d1/the_irony_of_nintendos_palworld_lawsuit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdj5d1/the_irony_of_nintendos_palworld_lawsuit/,2024-12-13 18:44:47,0,0.38,0,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdj5d1

gaming,Why are people calling the Intergalactic premise/aesthetic unoriginal?  What about Uncharted and the Last of Us was original to you?,"
I know it’s cool to hate on Naughty Dog at the moment but to try and bash this trailer by calling the premise unoriginal is hilarious to me.  

Uncharted and The Last of Us are both phenomenal franchises but they both HEAVILY borrow themes and aesthetics from existing media, and that’s part of their charm.  Naughty Dog do not make experimental, avant-garde games.  They design games in environments we’re familiar with from films, literature and other video games and they do it better than anyone else - that’s precisely the reason they’re so popular.

The only reason this is now suddenly an issue is unfortunately obvious following the discourse surrounding Naughty Dog lately but it’s so frustrating because all I want to do is engage in a positive discussion over what is a really fucking impressive trailer. 

The technical achievements alone in that trailer are absolutely outstanding.  The animation, the voice work, the fucking AWESOME original soundtrack.  That’s what we should be discussing here surely, and I hate that some people are writing off a trailer like that because of pre-determined personal bias.",Finellaclark,1hdlxh4,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,2024-12-13 20:49:00,0,0.44,0,0,35,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdlxh4

gaming,Witcher 4 Controversy ,"The Witcher 4 trailer and the discussions around it really have me thinking, we aren’t ever gonna solve the problem with bickering in gaming are we? I mean I have seen so many comments complaining about people who are complaining that they “don’t want to play as a girl” than I have of actual people complaining about playing a girl. It’s got the point where people are so ready for outrage and bigotry that they pre-empt it, which in turn causes the bigotry and complaints they didn’t want to see. Now I am not saying there aren’t some weird bigots out there because there are. But man we are so ready for L takes that we start to complain about them when they don’t exist and almost breath life into them. 

I thought the trailer was great and it hyped me up. It’s sad to see the state of the gaming community, I think social media has a lot to blame for this tbh. I personally don’t like forced inclusivity, you know the kind where the protagonist is a minority and the devs harp on about their gender, ethnicity, cultural background or sexual orientation more than they do the game mechanics or story, ye that I dislike. This however, isn’t that. It’s been very obvious where they were going after the Witcher 3 and this feels like a natural progression.
