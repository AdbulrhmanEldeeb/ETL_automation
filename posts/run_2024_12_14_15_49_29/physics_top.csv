Physics,"If you're looking for lessons in undergraduate/graduate Physics, I've got something that might be useful!","I've been posting videos on this subreddit lately from [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGDanWUzNMbIV11lcNi-yBg/videos) that cover higher level Math and Physics in rigorous detail.

Some popular series include:

1. [Tensors](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdgVBOaXkb9D6zw47gsrtE5XqLeRPh27_).
2. [Special Relativity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdgVBOaXkb9CkdpdSWT9oPDSvQ8BjjNTq).
3. [Quantum Mechanics (Background)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdgVBOaXkb9Bv466YnyxslT4gIlSZdtjw) and [Quantum Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdgVBOaXkb9AtG88OsK_c8FDEBDLCC6_9).
