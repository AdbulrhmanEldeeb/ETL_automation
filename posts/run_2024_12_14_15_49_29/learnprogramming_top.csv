learnprogramming,I'm tired of Front-End Development. I've lost my passion and need something more exciting.,"TL;DR: I'm a first-year computer science student who's been learning front-end development for two years, but I'm burned out from working on layouts and animations. I want to explore something more engaging with possibility to build huge projects.



Hi, I'm a first-year computer science student from Poland. I've been learning front-end development for about two years, on and off. I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript well. I also know how to work with SQL databases using PHP and have a basic understanding of React. Thanks to my college and high school, I've learned the syntax and general basics of C++ and Python, though I haven‚Äôt tried applying them to practical projects yet. I've just made some easier console apps and solved few leetcode problems with these two.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve completed many web projects, starting with simple forms, followed by Odin Project exercises like Tic-Tac-Toe, and even larger websites, such as a fully usable gym site with login system or an online store with huge database.

The problem is that constantly choosing matching fonts, centering divs, and adding dark modes has become exhausting. It feels like the only thing left for me is learning more libraries and frameworks to make my code faster and my websites prettier. But creating smoother button animations no longer gives me satisfaction, to the point where nowadays, I only log in once every few days to do one or two LeetCode problems.

I‚Äôm the kind of person who loves expanding projects and adding new features. The project I‚Äôve spent the most time on was a console-based RPG game in Python. I worked on it every day for weeks, adding new bosses and weapon upgrades, and to this day, it‚Äôs the most exciting thing I‚Äôve ever worked with.

Next year, I‚Äôll have to choose a specialization for my college (I don't know about the USA computer science, but in Poland there is something like specialization where you have to choose what exactly do you want to learn). The options are: Software Engineering and Mobile Technologies, Cybersecurity, and IT Systems Implementation. Obviously, I‚Äôm 99% sure that I am going to choose the first option since I‚Äôve already spent hundreds of hours coding. Do you think it‚Äôs a good idea to start learning Kotlin/Java now to prepare for mobile technologies? Or do you have other suggestions for a learning path that could bring me joy and excitement? I have never been good at math and physics, so probably gamedev, or machine learning are not the best ideas for me.",Unable_Jicama_7069,1hdgq7d,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hdgq7d/im_tired_of_frontend_development_ive_lost_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hdgq7d/im_tired_of_frontend_development_ive_lost_my/,2024-12-13 16:59:51,19,0.86,19,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hdgq7d

learnprogramming,"Best resources to learn Python (ultimately, machine learning)?","Hey people, hope you're having a great day;

I wanted to ask which are the best resources out there for learning and mastering python, i started with R since my field would be data analysis and prediction projects (i guess ultimately neural networks \[i apologize for my apparent ignorance, that's why i'm here\]) but i found out Python has everything R can do and much more.

As of right now i have already taken the Introduction and Intermediate Python courses on DataCamp, i plan to go ahead with Data Manipulation with pandas and matplotlib, to then go for Statistics in Python and ultimately Introduction to Machine Learning in Python; i am also planning to participate in Kaggle tournaments but i just want to make sure this is the right track.

(I have seen the first few videos of CS50, but i don't like my rhythm being dependent on a video, i have my own pace and would like better to learn in the most practical way, i need to see the objective or the functionality of something in order to fully understand; i know CS50 has its own environment and its own mini projects for learning but i need something more dynamic, to me, the best way to learn is by fucking up.)

My ultimate goal is literally to be a problem solver, i want to be able to build projects regardless of the field, be it marketing, marine biology, trading, economics, optimization of any kind, etc. As you can probably guess i am pretty new to this, i barely started this journey on december 10th.

I do not want to discard any alternative, be it learn other languages, go to another platform, or rectify my idea of what i need to do in order to achieve my goal; i live in a country where data science and programming is really neglected and want to show people within my reach how big this field is and how it will be the future of everything, i have always thought that in 5 years, not knowing how to program will be the equivalent to not knowing how to read in medieval times.

learnprogramming,Unsure how to move forward with project for Java Fundamentals class,"This is my second time asking this subreddit's help for my lessons... As I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding them, and have only been learning Java for this school semester, but that's a whole other topic... I reached out to my teacher over a week ago now, and received no response or help, so this is a last resort for me...

We have to design an inventory system for this project in Eclipse IDE. I followed and replicated the lessons as closely as possible. There are two classes in the project, named Product.java and ProductTester.java. The project at this stage is intended to print out the inventory products and information in some way, but prints nothing when the program is run. The code is as follows.

For Product.java:

    package inventory;
    
    public class Product {
      //instance field declarations
      private String name;
      private double price;
      private int qty;
      private int number;
    
      //default constructor
      public Product(String string, double d, int q, int n) {
      }
    
      //mutator methods
      public void setName() {
        this.name = name;}
      public void setPrice() {
        this.price = price;}
      public void setQty() {
        this.qty = qty;}
      public void setNumber() {
        this.number = number;}
    
      //accessor methods 
      public String getName() {
        return name;}
      public double getPrice() {
        return price;}
      public int getQty() {
        return qty;}
      public int getNumber() {
        return number;}
    
      //toString return
      public String toString() {
        return ""Name: "" + name +""\n"" + ""Price: "" + price + ""\n"" + ""Units: "" + qty + ""\n"" + ""Item       Number: "" + number;}
    }

For every line of code under the ""mutator methods"" comment, it reads ""The assignment to variable (x) has no effect"". Having these methods were outlined in the project requirements.

For ProductTester.java:

    package inventory;
    
    public class ProductTester {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
        Product p1 = new Product(""Pens"", 13.99, 50, 0001);
        Product p2 = new Product(""Sticky notes"", 16.99, 70, 0002);
        Product p3 = new Product(""Office tape"", 20.99, 50, 0003);
        Product p4 = new Product(""Calendars"", 6.99, 20, 0004);
        Product p5 = new Product(""Envelopes"", 13.39, 100, 0005);
        Product p6 = new Product(""Binders"", 6.49, 50, 0006);
      }//end method main
    }

For every variable assignment, it reads ""The value of the local variable (p1, p2, etc) is not used"".

    SetSwitchValue( 0 );

myCFile.h:

    #include ""extern.h""

extern.h:

    extern void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value );

The .cpp files:

Connector.cpp:

    #include ""Connector.h""
    extern ""C"" void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value ) {
      // some code
    }

Connector.h:

    extern ""C"" void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value );

That's the setup and it compiles. Nowhere in the C source and header files is `Connector.h` ever included. When I did add `#include ""Connector.h""` directly in `myCFile.h` without going through `extern.h,` there were errors, mainly:

    Connector.h:18:8: error: expected identifier or '(' before string constant
       18 | extern ""C"" void SetSwitchValue( unsigned char value );

Why is this the case? Why does one work when the other doesn't? What's happening with the compiler?

Thanks in advance!

learnprogramming,Struggling with Competitive Programming at Beginner Level (800 Rating) ‚Äì Need Guidance!,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve recently started competitive programming, and I‚Äôm finding it challenging to solve even 800-rated problems on platforms like Codeforces. Here‚Äôs a bit of context about my current situation:

1. **My Background**:
   * I‚Äôm comfortable with the basics of C++ (loops, arrays, if-else, etc.) but haven‚Äôt done much problem-solving before.
2. **Where I Struggle**:
   * Understanding problem statements: Sometimes, the language is too confusing for me to break down the question.
   * Coming up with the right logic or approach: I don‚Äôt yet recognize patterns like greedy, simulation, or brute force.
   * Solving within constraints: Concepts like O(n) or time complexity are still new to me.
3. **Example Problem**: For instance, I recently tried this 800-rated question *""Alyona and a Square Jigsaw Puzzle""* on Codeforces. Even though it‚Äôs labeled as a beginner problem, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to approach it. The editorial solution felt complex, and I‚Äôm not sure how to think like that.
4. **What I Need Help With**:
   * How do I get better at breaking down and understanding problems?
   * What‚Äôs the best way to practice and improve? Should I stick to Codeforces or try other platforms first?
   * Are there specific resources or guides that helped you when you were at this stage?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice, resources, or strategies from those of you who‚Äôve been in a similar position. How did you go from struggling with beginner problems to feeling more confident?

I've been programming off and on since the late 80's and have used a bunch of different languages. However, I haven't programmed for almost ten years since I worked on my EE (Computer Eng) degree (long story). 

I know that there have been some changes in what is common/best for different uses now so I'm looking for a recommendation for: Cross-platform desktop application development but programmed in a Linux environment to start. Application would need to load/save XML, be able to draw basic line drawings, and have multiple resizable/toggled window areas. Basic productivity type application that might consume a ton of memory.

So, what should I use? I've seen NW.js talked about but that seems a bit passe and possibly lacking in power. I know Rust is big right now, but I've also seen some negative comments about using it for desktop app development.
