books,A Year of Reading to a 5 Year Old,"My son turned 6 this fall and this is the first really consistent year I've spent reading chapter books with him. I've looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I'd look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old's perspective.

**The BFG** by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it's fun.

**Charlie and the Chocolate Factory** by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We've been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)

**Fantastic Mr. Fox** by Roald Dahl - A lot shorter than I was expecting and probably my kid's least favorite Dahl.

**James and the Giant Peach** by Roald Dahl - Kid liked it fine, it was my least favorite Dahl and there are a lot of voices to do if you do that.

**The Wild Robot Trilogy** by Peter Brown - We finished the 3rd one about a week before the movie came out by coincidence. The first 2 are really good and my son was constantly asking if we could read just one more chapter since the chapters are short. The 3rd one is fine but it's not as connected as the first 2 are. It felt more like an afterthought.

**Stuart Little** by E.B. White - I thought this was a pleasure to read as an adult. The kid enjoyed it although he was startled by the abrupt ending.

**The Horse and His Boy** and **The Silver Chair** by C.S. Lewis - This concluded Narnia for us, I think. We've read everything but The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. I loved Narnia as a kid but it's rough for this age. There are some very talky and slow parts that my kid just didn't get. He really like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which we read last year but otherwise, Narnia is maybe better left for an older kid.

**The Wizard of Oz** by Frank Baum - This seems like a perfect book for this age group.  It's very episodic in it's structure.  The language was a little old fashioned (which isn't surprising), but the kid really liked it.  The tornado scene was very memorable and he really liked the color coding that happens in the book.  The biggest surprise here was that the movie was likewise a huge hit.

We're currently reading **Phantom Tollbooth** by Norton Juster and while I don't dislike it,  I wish we weren't.  There is a lot of word play that is missed by reading out loud (witch vs. which, weather vs. whether).  But he seems to be enjoying it.

For this age, what is working for us is shorter chapters, not too talky, some pictures, and a touch of silliness.  I don't think we need all those ticked off for a successful ""read aloud to a 5/6 year old but it helps.  Reading a lot of older books means explaining somethings that just aren't a part of my kid's life like porcelain and corporal punishment.",CliffDiverLemming,1hdsiyd,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,2024-12-14 02:08:52,638,0.96,638,0,131,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdsiyd
books,"I forget the books after I read them, and it makes me a bit frustrated","When someone brings this matter up, usually the following quote is posted: 

&gt;I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

While I understand how perfectly natural and reasonable this phenomenon is, it still irks me from time to time. Isn't it quite irritable that, say, eight month after finishing a novel, I can recall only some vague details and general atmosphere, maybe one or two motifs? 

For example, the books I read about 2 years ago, that captivated me for weeks after I had finished them - *Les Miserables* by Victor Hugo, *The Idiot* by Dostoyevsky or *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem - are now almost vanished from my memory, for I recount only their outline, some random impressions. I bet I couldn't speak about them for more than ten minutes if I were forbidden to make vague statements like 'the writing was amazing', 'the characters were multi-dimensional', etc. Theoretically I even lack the proof that I ever opened them. 

And the matter is worse! This summer I have read, among others, two magnificent novels that produced on me the most profound impression - *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck and *Joke* by Milan Kundera. I was so excited that I hastened to write some (flawed) reviews here on Reddit. And now I feel that they are fading away from my memory, the same novels that I reckoned the height of literature, among the finest masterpieces I have ever read! 

This week I finished two novellas of Steinbeck that held me engrossed from first page to last, and I can't help thinking that in six months time, I won't even remember the characters' names. 

Once again, I perfectly understand that this all natural and intrinsical. I can only hope that in the end there is *something* indefinite that persists from every book, remaining somewhere in my subconsciousness.

books,"Polygamy, by Paulina Chiziane (2002)","This author is from Mozambique (SE coast of Africa, bordering Tanzania in the north and South Africa in the south).  The book is basically a story of the struggle of one woman to keep her man, who is apparently irresistible to women and has no interest in monogamy.

I thought it was hilarious and poetic and also representative of a culture so different from ours that if you were to make a list of books representing cultures by how different they are, this one would have to go at the top.  Chaucer's Canterbury Tales was not about a more different society.  Snow, by Orhan Pamuk, which is (at least to me) basically a machine for turning an American into a Turk, is less dramatically different, by about half.

In fact, the way the author thinks of her life, the way the people she tells us about think of their lives, they approach society and themselves so differently that I think the book must be an education even to a psychologist.  It seems to reveal a new dimension of perception of humanity.  If properly considered.  I did not know people could behave like this.  I didn't know it was possible to think this way.  The poetry I'm used to, by comparison, seems to me now to hammer down along the path across its images (Frost said a poem is a tune or a ground of images, across which we may choose to strike a path) as though it were laying rail.  The poetry she tells flies like a bird.  Like a flock of birds, actually.

It's different.  I won't forget it.  I hope not, anyway!!  At one point our heroine was ""well and truly kutchingered,"" and you'll have to read the book to learn more about THAT, but I'm sure the search will be worth while lol...",tolkienfan2759,1hdfigo,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdfigo/polygamy_by_paulina_chiziane_2002/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdfigo/polygamy_by_paulina_chiziane_2002/,2024-12-13 16:06:05,9,0.7,9,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdfigo
books,How do you feel about bits of music in audiobooks?,"Currently listening to the latest Michael Connelly, The Waiting. 

On the one hand, I like that they got Titus Welliver, the actor from the Bosch TV series, to narrate his parts. I believe the daughter's from the show as well, and the main narrator, Christine Lakin, is excellent.

But they occasionally interject snippets of music, and for some reason I just can't get into that. Every time I hear music in an audiobook, it kind of takes me right out of it.

books,Stoner - not finished yet but this one is not what I expected,"This has spoilers; I tagged it but just an extra heads up.


You may have come to this expecting glowing words about a book that everybody seems to have only good things to say about, but maybe I’m missing something.

One of the many things that I don’t like about this book but chief among them and which I don’t see people mention is the fact that the author just tells the reader everything and you don’t really see it. A character is reduced to a paragraph that basically tells everything about them. This happens many times in the book. 

The character of Edith: She’s super weird. Her behavior and the way the author describes her from Stoner’s first meeting is just completely bizarre. And circling back to my earlier point about how the author tells everything, her strange little speech as Stoner is about to leave her parent’s house, thinking himself rejected, in which she tells him all about herself is one of the prime examples (but not the only one), and it’s bizarre. It’s very offputting. And I’m not saying that I can’t like a book with a weird character, but her characterization and mannerisms  were extremely strange. Unless she’s insane, it’s just not believable. I would actually say she kind of reminded me of Rochester‘s first wife in Jane Eyre.

BUT (big point here) this doesn’t justify Stoner raping her…..yep….

Why Edith married him, I don’t know. I’m almost halfway through and not enthusiastically picking the book up at this point. 

Watch this get downvoted, but thus far, not finding this engaging or gripping or interesting. 

I’ve seen people saying that this is one of the best books they’ve ever read and that Stoner is such a hero. You can certainly think those things. 

What exactly drew other readers in to this book? I’m finding the writing deliberate but very dry and the characters wooden. The atmosphere is dry and bleak. I’m aware of the ending, because there’s so much about this book on this subReddit (and others), that I happened across the ending accidentally. That has nothing to do with any of the things I’ve written. If I had an issue with an ending like what comes in this book, I wouldn’t be reading it. It’s just all the rest of the stuff. 

I’ve gotten to a part where a new character is introduced and the author once again gives the intro paragraph explaining exactly who this person is, telling it all. This has happened so many times in the book. It’s so obtrusive. As far as the characterization of Edith, if Williams intended for her to be a normal woman, (and I can’t imagine how that could be the case) that is concerning.

I do not like when authors tell rather than show it with action or allowing the reader to discover it. Williams reveals a lot well in advance. An author can do that. I’m not a huge fan of that method. What are other reader’s thoughts? If you loved it, great. So far, I’m not at that point. And also, I can’t find the character of Stoner. He’s just kind of there for this ride he’s on.",Neon_Aurora451,1hdpoyo,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdpoyo/stoner_not_finished_yet_but_this_one_is_not_what/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdpoyo/stoner_not_finished_yet_but_this_one_is_not_what/,2024-12-13 23:43:38,0,0.44,0,0,33,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1hdpoyo
books,Are all the girlies reading ACOTAR and Fourth Wing?,"I had been hearing a bit about them (especially ACOTAR) so I finally bit the bullet and read the first book of A Court of Thorns and Roses and Fourth Wing. I do love fantasy and YA (think Percy Jackson, the Hunger Games, etc.) and I enjoy a cute slow burn romance but I haven’t really read a lot of “romantasy”. And I have a lot to say lmao😭.
If anyone has read them please share your experiences and thoughts!

I want to keep this post short so I’ll probably say more in the comments but a short summary of my thoughts so far:

ACOTAR
(I only read the first book.)

It was overall a fun/ easy read. The writing and pacing make it hard to put down. But tbh it felt kind of unserious. The world felt like it existed for the plot, rather than the plot naturally happening because of the world it is set in. Which in turn made the world feel less real to me. Some goes for the characters (especially Feyres family).

Now to my biggest issue: Feyre. I was honestly so frustrated with how stupid she is in 99% of the book😩😭 I think she might be somewhat inspired by Katniss Everdeen but she lacks the intelligence and forethought that made Katniss feel real- like she has what it takes to survive.
Feyre on the other hand is constantly doing things that she has been repeatedly told are dangerous and life threatening and then acts surprised when those things are actually *shoker* dangerous and life threatening.. Then she doesn’t even listen to the advice she almost dies for 🫠 oh well.

My second issue was the sheer amount of violence and suffering at the end of the book. Idk what I was expecting but it just kind of felt gross to me and like I was “watching” a weird “fetish”(?). Like I don’t mind violence if it feels like it furthers a point or an emotional payoff but here it just felt an over the top and unnecessary. Ultimately it’s what stopped me from getting the second book because I simply didn’t enjoy or see the point.

Summary: pretty fun/ entertaining to read but frustrating main character (the other characters too tbh) and violent ending. (Also very weird/inappropriate timing of the last s*x scene)


Fourth Wing:
(currently reading Iron Flame)

I read this after ACOTAR and actually enjoyed it way more! The world felt more real and the romance was a nice slow burn and the payoff felt satisfying. The writing is also pretty good and the characters feel more real. 

Again my main gripe is the intelligence of the MC. Even though Violet is often described as this extremely intelligent person I don’t feel like we actually get to see it often. She’s not stupid but the fact that her high intelligence is constantly mentioned highlights how average it is. How are you that intelligent but talking “secretly” in places where you are so easily spotted? Especially in Iron Flame she’s become kind of annoying with this whole woe is me. Like girl the life of literally millions of people are on the line and you are mad someone held secrets about things that are dare I say way more important than you?? Especially after what happened in the last book? Isn’t trying to survive and save humanity a bit more important rn? You don’t really need more secrets to keep. But anyways I digress.. I understand that it’s hard to write a really intelligent character.

Summary: Fun read, interesting world, nice romantic build up, but the main character isn’t as intelligent as she is described to be. I wish we saw her have more forethought and strategic thinking.

Tbh I kind of went in blind reading these books so I didn’t really know what I was getting into but overall it’s been fun. I’m curious what people like so much about them.
I think I have just read too many really well written books growing up (as many of us probably have) lol.

Anyway I’m excited to read what you guys think of these books!",NervousCup6934,1hdlk8i,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdlk8i/are_all_the_girlies_reading_acotar_and_fourth_wing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdlk8i/are_all_the_girlies_reading_acotar_and_fourth_wing/,2024-12-13 20:32:13,0,0.38,0,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdlk8i
