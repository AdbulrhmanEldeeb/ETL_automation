math,Why is Algebra Chapter 0 by Aluffi so expensive?,"Trying to get into category theory and chapter 0 was recommended, but can’t seem to find a copy under $80.

math,Murphy vs Averson for C* algebras?,"I want to self study C\* algebras because of motivation from quantum mechanics and because they seem interesting in their own right. I'm not looking to be an operator algebraist or anything like that, I just want to get a good understanding of the basics, the motivation behind them, some of the big results, and how they can be applied in physics. Some things I'm looking beyond the basics are the GNS construction and representations of C\* algebras on Hilbert spaces. It would be even better if the book covers Von Neumann algebras and representations of the canonical commutation relations in physics. I have studied functional analysis but I know very little about operator algebras beyond what a Banach algebra is.

Based on the above I've narrowed it down to two books though I'm open to others as well. Averson's book seems very short and to the point, but also looks like it can be dense and does not provide a lot of hand holding. Does it leave anything important out? Murphy's book seems to be the opposite but is also three times as long. Has anyone read either of these books?",If_and_only_if_math,1hdyj8s,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hdyj8s/murphy_vs_averson_for_c_algebras/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hdyj8s/murphy_vs_averson_for_c_algebras/,2024-12-14 08:29:28,6,1.0,6,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hdyj8s

math,Is there a bridge between group rings and Lie algebras?,"Lie groups can be factored into the discrete group of connected components and the connected component of the identity, so in this sense a connected Lie group corresponds to the trivial group.

This feels unsatisfying though because there are analogies between groups and **connected** Lie groups as well:

1. Group rings play the same role in the representation theory as Lie algebras,
2. One parameter subgroups are kind of like cyclic groups, e.g. abelian groups have a particularly simple structure in both cases and decompose into products of cyclic groups/one parameter subgroups,
3. There are many other almost exactly shared theorems (which isn't a big surprise of course because they're both groups).

So my question is: is there some kind of a functorial connection between group rings and Lie algebras (or their modules) that has non-trivial consequences on their representation theories?",CutToTheChaseTurtle,1hdmxha,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hdmxha/is_there_a_bridge_between_group_rings_and_lie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hdmxha/is_there_a_bridge_between_group_rings_and_lie/,2024-12-13 21:33:47,22,0.9,22,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hdmxha

math,Is there a way to go about parametrizing 3-manifolds?,"I’ve been having fun lately trying to find parametrizations of surfaces I think might be interesting. I always use the exact same steps though: I embed the 2D surface into 3D Euclidean space with Cartesian coordinates, I create a 2D coordinate system intrinsic to the manifold, I write the 2D coordinate in terms of the 3D coordinates, then I find the 2x2 metric tensor using multivariable chain rule.

I’ve been trying to think about how I would go about doing this for 3-manifolds. I suppose I start by embedding it in 4D Euclidean space. Only problem is that I can’t visualize any of this in my head nor can I draw it so I have no idea how to come up with an intrinsic coordinate system to the 3-manifold. 

I’ve searched up the parametrization of a 3-sphere but I’ve found that most of the explanations just involve saying that the coordinates squared should equal to 1. The problem with this is that I’m pretty sure it only works for n-spheres due to their high symmetry. For example, I have no idea how I would go about parametrizing a 3-Torus.",TransgenderModel,1hdkdek,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hdkdek/is_there_a_way_to_go_about_parametrizing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hdkdek/is_there_a_way_to_go_about_parametrizing/,2024-12-13 19:38:33,19,0.85,19,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hdkdek
