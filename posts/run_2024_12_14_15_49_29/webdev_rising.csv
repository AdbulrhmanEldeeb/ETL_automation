webdev,[Showoff Saturday] Build a very basic RAG anyone can deploy and use,"Part of my AI learning journey, I wanted to see how complex it is to build and configure a RAG.

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is a framework that combines information retrieval and GenAI models to improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated outputs. It is useful when the LLM you use needs to produce responses based on up-to-date information that was not included in its training data.

Written in Typescript using Express, Mongo, NodeJS and hosted on [Genezio.com](http://genezio.com/), it needs a key from OpenAI for the LLM part and takes a URL as input.

It starts by crawling the URL and all sub-pages (by looking for \`&lt;a hrefs/&gt;\`, then it creates the vector database and then shows a UI to query the content with the help of OpenAI's Chat APIs.

The Vector DB and the page contents is stored and queried in MongoDB.

You can play with it here: [https://openai-rag.app.genez.io/](https://openai-rag.app.genez.io/) (it indexes Genezio's website, articles and documentation). Please don't over-test this as it uses my personal API key. I've put some spending limits, so it will stop working if you spam it. :)

You can look at the source code here: [https://github.com/bogdanripa/openai-rag](https://github.com/bogdanripa/openai-rag)

You can deploy your own instance using the ""Deploy"" button from Github (it's in the README file). While deploying, you'll need to specify your OpenAI API key and the URL to crawl. Then, when visiting the front-end for the 1st time it will crawl, index and then let you search.

If you want to crawl another URL, simply change the corresponding env variable to the new URL.

What other similar projects should I start?

webdev,Best Headless CMS for Freelancing (editable by the client?),"Hey guys,

I'm a freelance web developer who enjoys building websites with custom code (often using Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS). I'm looking for the best headless CMS solution to allow my clients to easily edit website content.

**Current Challenge:**

* I want to maintain full control over the front-end development, avoiding limitations imposed by traditional CMSs like WordPress.
* My clients need the ability to easily edit all aspects of website content (text, images, etc.) through a user-friendly interface, not the layout or design, just the content.

**Current Considerations:**

1. **Astro with DecapCMS:** While promising, I feel it might limit client editing to specific components, and I'd prefer more granular control, also I can't seem to figure out how to customize the user interface/dashboard of the CMS.
2. **Storyblok:** I haven't used it extensively, but it seems like a strong contender.

**What are your recommendations?**

* What headless CMS do you recommend for this scenario?
* Are there any with highly customizable interfaces that I can tailor to my clients' specific needs?
* What are your experiences with client-facing CMS interfaces? Any tips or pitfalls to avoid?

I'm open to exploring other options and appreciate any insights!

webdev,How did web advertising become so bloated?,"I'm not talking about the excessive, obnoxios ad campaigns that cover content or exceed its quantity; that's a separate issue. What I'm talking about are articles, even from known and relatively trusted (at least for reading content) websites, that become so bogged down with ads that they wind up freezing or outright crashing mobile browsers, or lagging noticably on budget or low-power PC-based devices.

I don't think their quantity alone, as annoying as it is, is enough to account for their overhead. Many just display static images or simple animations which barely take up any processing power at all once loaded from the server. What are a few dozen animated images for a device that has no trouble whatsoever running quite complex browser games? The rest are presented as videos that take up some fraction of the screen, and only two or three of these videos are onscreen and playing at any given time. Meanwhile it would take at least a dozen videos at the same resolution to match the load of a single 1440p video stream which the same devices can comfortably handle, in a browser, even after downsampling it to fit the display.

What are these ads doing in the background that takes up so much processing power?
