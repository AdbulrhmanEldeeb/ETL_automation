movies,"Unforgiven is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies as a director ever. I mean imagine deconstructing the gunslinger image that made you a star, and stripping away the glamor behind the Wild West.","https://preview.redd.it/yicntwi7lq6e1.png?width=219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4058b385363489b27ba3d34b8e628fe804990207

William Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.

https://preview.redd.it/9eglkeoplq6e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb95dfb6da04b33733c5019ea3b5560fbd7cafb



But much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the  sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207

Characters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.

It is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.

And it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it. And Freeman is as reliable as ever as the soft spoken Ned.",LoneWolfIndia,1hduhu8,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,2024-12-14 03:59:59,1532,0.91,1532,0,169,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hduhu8

movies,28 Weeks Later: Alice was NOT asymptomatic,"In 28 Weeks Later part of the premise is that mother of the children Alice is left behind in mainland Britain with the infected, when found she carries the infection but is asymptomatic. I was rewatching 28 Weeks Later today and it is clear that Alice is not actually asymptomatic at all. Although she appears to largely retain her memories and her basic faculties, she displays all the signs of infection such as disfigurement (one of her eyes is heavily bloodshot), insanity she is found cowering alone in a room covered in crosses and symbols, aggression (both passive and overt), she appears to attempt to hurt her son and then when questioned by the US military she remains silent during questioning, possibly suggesting anger and an ulterior motive. The fact she allows her husband to kiss her could possibly be a sign of calculation, if she knows she is carrying the virus.

One of the main things I noticed in the room Alice was found hiding in is that it is covered in crosses drawn on the wall. The same symbol seen heavily in the 28 Years Later trailer.

I wonder if Alice was actually the first of the new type of infected we will see in 28 Years?",twixeater78,1he2rio,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he2rio/28_weeks_later_alice_was_not_asymptomatic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he2rio/28_weeks_later_alice_was_not_asymptomatic/,2024-12-14 13:22:52,271,0.76,271,0,99,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he2rio

However, from what I have read and seen, he seems to be a rather divisive figure in Hollywood. In addition to the surprising amount of Razzies he's been nominated for, many see him as style over substance and a major Hitchcock ripoff in many of his flicks.

movies,Educating Rita is the most beautiful film about self-determination and friendship,"So Educating Rita (1983) sees Blood Brothers author Willy Russel's updated take on the classic George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. He really subverts the narrative into something special and important. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are just phenomenal and arguably at their very best, as the middle class professor and his working class student, who also works as a hairdresser, in the 1980s. He is teaching her how to pass a literary course, with the narrative building up towards that final exam.

The three key themes I identified were self-determination, friendship, and social class dynamics. 

Now, Pygmalion is the classic tale of a working-class woman being educated and transformed into a member of upper class society by a wise professor.

The ending is quite dark, and it makes a point of how Eliza Doolittle feels she has lost her identity and it's exceedingly bleak. This was famously changed into a happy ending for the wonderful and far more famous musical My Fair Lady. Both have their charms , but I'll take the politically charged Pygmalion any day.

Now, what I love about Pygmalion is Russel kind of flips the roles on a psychological level. Caine's professor character Frank is far more vulnerable than hard-nosed Rita. He struggles with alcohol addiction and Rita's transformation kind of breaks him. He can't stand losing her, what she was (his pet project), as he's so unhappy in his life, otherwise.

Throughout the movie we see Rita taking more control over her life and doing what she wants instead of what society expects of her. She ditches the oppresive husband who wants a baby and breaks out of her shell to become a popular and highly regarded student at the university. She smashes the exam and gets a distinction. 

In an absolute Tour de Force of a monologue, Rita explains why she decided to carry on down that path. She explains that she had 'a choice' and made it, after considering it. She then talks about all the potential she has now the exam is over and how she can choose to do pretty much anything she likes and doesn't feel held back like before. A complete 180 from the Rita we saw at the start.

In both characters, Russel is exploring the idea of self-determination. Frank makes every wrong decision and falls apart as the film progresses. And Rita seems to make every right one.

Through this journey, we also explore their friendship amid the backdrop of the middle and working class dynamics in 1980s Liverpool (you couldn't pick a better time or setting to explore this). 

Throughout the movie, you get a whiff of palpable romance but I think that's just because Walters and Caine's chemistry is just so good. At the very end, the characters look like they may kiss as they're about to embrace to say goodbye, but no, thankfully they give eachother a nice big hug.

Frank takes a bold new step and transforms his life by jetting off to Australia. 

Then, in the final shot, Rita is walking off down the corridor. In an earlier scene, Frank implored Rita to come with him. Rita turns and looks back, you can tell she's thinking about going. But then she decides to carry on striding forward to make her own way in life.

movies,I love Hidden Identity / Hidden Talent movies like Anastasia (1956) or Babette's Feast,"I somehow lump these two together but I guess they are somewhat different genres / tropes.  But I just adore the movies where a person is mistaken for someone else and is taken into a new group of people and then makes strong relationships and changes things for the better.  Movies like this are

* Anastasia (1956) with Yul Brynner and Ingrid Bergman
* While You Were Sleeping
* Mrs Winterbourne
* Dave
* Regarding Henry
* Princess Caraboo
* Freaky Friday and Your Name are kinda like that too


Or similarly when a person comes into a new place and has this super talent for something and it slowly comes out.  Sometimes I think of Babette from Babette's Feast as basically the John Wick of cooking.

* Babette's Feast
* Man From Nowhere
* John Wick
* Good Will Hunting
* Shane
* The Fugitive tv series is kinda like this
* Unforgiven is kinda like this also; it's just that the kid doesn't realize just how badass Clint Eastwood is/was.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 3 - Scotland,"Hello there,

I've really been on a Reddit journey through filmed Europe for quite a while now and yes, it makes me wistful that it's coming to an end... but it's going to get wild here at the end. I've arrived at U, and I have to say: Sorry, UK, but this concept of a country made up of several countries is just confusing and I'm in favour of any (non-violent) way to clean up this mess somehow.

But since I don't want it to become too political, I've come up with an idea: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will each have their own thread and at the end the overall UK winner will be chosen from the individual winners. England and Northern Ireland are now more or less through and today we are looking for movies set in **Scotland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hdfvxo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-13 16:22:45,4,0.59,4,0,54,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdfvxo

movies,What are some cases of sudden and unexplained time jumps in movies you might be surprised by? ,"The biggest one for me is in fellowship of the ring, I am not a big lord of the rings nerd at all.  So when I see Gandalf ride off to research the ring to see if it is THE one ring and come back to confront Frodo about it I didn't think much of it, Gandalf left for a day maybe two right? NOPE! He was gone for 16 years Frodo doesn't look any older and very easily could have had an entire life with a wife and kids by the time Gandalf came back.  The editing of this sequence as well as my lack of understanding of the story from the books meant that this fact about the plot of the movie blew me away and changed a lot of the context of that part of the movie for me. 

Another one is Once upon a time in Hollywood.  The plot is chugging along, then right at the end of act 2 a narrator comes in and says how several months have passed, Leo's character has left to film spaghetti westerns got a girlfriend etc. It just felt so sudden and kinda unnecessary

movies,What are your thoughts on watchmen chapter 1 and 2 is it a perfect adaptation ,"The animated Watchmen chapters I and II are a true love letter to the original graphic novel, staying incredibly faithful to the source material.

The pacing mirrors the comic’s episodic structure, and the dialogue stays true to the sharp, complex exchanges that define the characters.

While this faithfulness will undoubtedly resonate with long-time fans, it also raises an interesting question: is it too faithful? The adaptation feels almost like a direct retelling, which can leave little room for new interpretations or creative risks. For those familiar with the comic, it offers a nostalgic experience, but does it stand out as something more than just a faithful retelling?

movies,"How much ""profit"" does a movie have to make to actually be profitable?","I've seen movies that made $30 million in ""profit"" against a budget of $150 million be considered a ""commercial flop"". 

I've read that a film's budget should be doubled to account for marketing costs, so that $100 million budget film that made $300 million actually resulted in a $100 million loss. 

That can't be a rule of thumb, right? I always figured the ""double for marketing"" only applied to the tentpoliest of tentpole movies. 

An example: A Series Of Unfortunate Events (2004) grossed $211 million on a budget of around $140 million. Going by the double for marketing rule, that's a horrendous box office failure. Even if you stake out a half for marketing rule for mid-level productions, the film barely broke even. 

But there was at one point in time a sequel in the works. I wouldn't think they'd entertain the idea of a sequel if the first one barely broke even at best or blew $150 million at worst. So the oft-stated double for marketing rule or half for marketing rule that I just made up couldn't possibly apply to this film, right?

It's not as if this film came out in the 2020s, when studios were trying to status-quo their way through the post-pandemic film industry shakeup. Duds were still duds in the early 2000s when this film came out. 

So how exactly does profit work in Hollywood? Not everyone can be Paranormal Activity or Avengers: Endgame, and we've all seen movies that made a couple milly in profit get 3 or 4 sequels. It's clear they made enough money from the first one to warrant sequel(s), so a multiple of the production budget for marketing is not a universal rule.",Danielnrg,1hdr76o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,2024-12-14 00:58:58,0,0.43,0,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdr76o

Bonus points for martial arts focused films ,"I was recently watching the latest batch of Cobra Kai episodes and thought that this show has jumped the shark for some time now.

That got me thinking, what are  some movies that have a lot of fighting in them that remain somewhat grounded? No over the top kung fu, no fake martial arts. Just technical fighting and good cinematography to sell it. I could think of some examples, like last year's ""The Killer"" which was sort of an anti John Wick film, with fight scenes without jumping around, no telegraphed swings, no spinning kicks or anything, just people mostly shoving/punching/grappling until someone wins.

For numerous reasons my wife and I rarely go see a movie at the theater. We’ve often wondered if studios might eventually release some movies for home viewing on the same day that they are released at the theaters. We’ve seen this happen before, but I don’t remember it happening with very many high profile movies. They could charge $50 or so and we would still be interested. I understand that they might be afraid of losing  revenue but there are people like myself that are not going to the theater who would be providing additional income.

movies,2025 might be one of the most interesting years for mainstream cinema and maybe a new creative resurgence in filmmaking.,"The last 5 years honestly had been probably one of the roughest eras in mainstream cinema creatively and  as far as what was getting made and how they were being treated particularly as far as theatrically released or original mid budget movies goes.

And part of the fact was covid's impact towards the film industry and led up to the major studio's  misguided push towards streaming and the Netflix route of ""throwing whatever at the wall and seeing what sticks and not give a lot of marketing into while the execs and shareholders who greenlight these movies get all the nice fat checks  in the world. I think it's starting to die out a little bit though thankfully.

 Like guys remember 8-Bit Christmas on HBO max? or the Chip n Dale movie on Disney+? What about No One Will Save You on Hulu? that one movie that a lot of genre fans raved about the week it came out  only to feel like it was buried afterwards and used as filler for a streaming service? *crickets chirping*

But anyway that the majority of  theatrical mainstream movies and the  industry leaned towards a more toxically nostalgic shift  for reboots/remakes/rehashes of IP's from 10-50 years ago. Like Indiana Jones 5 with an 80-year old  Harrison Ford or the umpteenth reboot of The Exorcist  with a 90-year old Ellen Burstyn and a reboot of Twister of all things. 

But looking at next year, yeah there's going to be some movies that looked like it was approved for shareholders like reboots to Final Destination and I Know What You Did Last Summer, A reboot of the Jurassic Park reboot (Universal still hasn't learned i guess), and Hollywood taking a dump on Chris Sanders' legacy by making live action versions of his movies to make a quick buck for nostalgic manchildren. 

But there is some interesting mix or IP's and original stuff . And some of the original stuff are from directors like  Ryan Coogler, Koganada, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, James L Brooks, Joseph Kosinski, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Sure  the schedule could change and  are they going to be homeruns? Who knows but even then it starting to regain my confidence towards mainstream movies again and maybe it's going to start a new resurgence in getting more quirkier or high concept movies made again from the majors.",gearwest11,1hdjul2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,2024-12-13 19:15:10,0,0.26,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdjul2
movies,The Last of the Mohicans is a Terminator movie.,"Magua (Wes Studi) is a Terminator who can’t be bargained with, can’t be reasoned with, doesn’t feel pity or remorse or fear, and absolutely will not stop… EVER, until the grey hair and his seed are dead.  
Once she’s being hunted by this relentless dark force, it takes hardly any time at all for Cora (Madeleine Stowe) to be captivated and changed by her rescuer, Hawkeye, who comes from outside of normal society.  
The English, like the police in *The Terminator*, are no match at all for what they’re up against. They separate the two lovers and condemn Hawkeye.  
Both the heart scene and Magua’s fight with Hawkeye’s father look like the T-800 in action.  
Cora: “You’ve done everything you can do. Save yourself! If the worst happens, and only one of us survives, something of the other does too”. This is like a line out of Wuthering Heights. Two souls metaphysically entwined. Two of the most romantic movies ever made.",Cosmo_Glass,1hdq03o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdq03o/the_last_of_the_mohicans_is_a_terminator_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdq03o/the_last_of_the_mohicans_is_a_terminator_movie/,2024-12-13 23:58:48,0,0.31,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdq03o
movies,Alternate ending to Turning Red ,"I used to love Turning Red but I don't anymore. When I washed it for the second time the flaws in it became a lot more visible:

If the concert was happening on the 25th instead of the 18th, how did May and her friends go so long thinking it was the 18th? Did they not double check? Do nobody tell them?

If they stopped being friends for a while, why did Miriam keep Mei's pet toy?

Why did they suddenly love Tyler if he was a 4*Townie? Just because he likes the same band as them doesn't mean he's a good person.

Keeping these flaws in mind, here is how I would have done it:

At the party, Mei and her friends (Miriam, Priya, and Abby) hear that 4*Town's Toronto concert has been cancelled. Mei attacks Tyler after he insults her family and doesn't stand up for her friends when her mother blames them for everything. The ritual goes off without a hitch and her red panda form is sealed away.

When Mei returns to school the following Monday, she is shunned by her former friends, who are still mad at her for throwing them under the bus. She is heartbroken until Tyler approaches her and apologizes for his past behaviour. Mei extends an offer of friendship, which he gladly accepts, and the film ends with the two walking happily into the sunset.

movies,"What Do You Suggest For Superman 2025, A ONYX Screen or IMAX? ","I know Superman is more than half a year away. But I'm already mentally preparing where I want to watch it. I watched Deadpool and Wolverine on a ONYX screen and I really liked it. I was too close to the screen though so I will have to remedy that next time. But my IMAX is with Laser and I just saw War of the Rohirrim on it. 

So I'm deciding which screen is best for Superman. (Superman is my favorite superhero and character so that's why I'm preparing so early) Superman is being shot on IMAX and will most likely have a bigger aspect ratio for the entire film or specific action scenes. 

I like ONYX because of the LED screen, better color, brighter, and higher resolution. Though I don't like that the cinema with the ONYX screen has in person waitress so they are just walking in front of you while the movie plays.

movies,Movie budgets make me sick,"With the Brutalist nearing release (at least down under), it’s had me thinking about the sickening budgets of movies. The Brutalist was reportedly made for $10m and is, by all accounts, amazing.

Comparatively, the recent shit show of Joker Folie a Deux was made for $250m, 25x the budget of the Brutalist.

Where has the industry gone so wrong that $250m is blown on a horrific flop when we could get multiple smaller movies, that have every chance of being much better??

Edit: Yes, I understand that there’s no correlation between budget and quality, my point is that a hell of a lot more talented filmmakers would be able to take their shot if there were 25 smaller budget movies instead of a single giant budget flop. Not all of them would be good, but some would.",Spongey13,1hdmulb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdmulb/movie_budgets_make_me_sick/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdmulb/movie_budgets_make_me_sick/,2024-12-13 21:30:21,0,0.3,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdmulb

movies,Do you find Million Dollar Baby sad?,"Do people truly find this movie sad or moving? Maybe I'm heartless but the randomness of her injury just made me chuckle. I get that ""life is random, shit happens"" But it just felt so random it took me completely out of the movie. I thought it might be based on a true story because I can't imagine why else they'd take this direction but it doesn't seem like it is (thankfully)

I also felt the characters were extremely one dimensional and by the end I really didn't care about any of them. Her fate had no impact on me because I really just didn't feel connected to her or Frankie.

Also, shouldn't her doctors/nurses be caring for her and preventing those bedsores from forming? Not a complaint it just made me scratch my head a bit lol

I'm sure I'm in the minority here, and that's fine. I just thought the movie was meh.
