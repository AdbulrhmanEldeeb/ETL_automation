A few years ago we held a graduate student panel, where many recently accepted grad students answered questions about the application process.  That [thread is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3i5d4u/graduate_student_panel_fall_2015_1_ask_your/), and has a lot of great information in it.
