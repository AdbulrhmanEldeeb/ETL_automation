webdev,Best Headless CMS for Freelancing (editable by the client?),"Hey guys,

I'm a freelance web developer who enjoys building websites with custom code (often using Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS). I'm looking for the best headless CMS solution to allow my clients to easily edit website content.

**Current Challenge:**

* I want to maintain full control over the front-end development, avoiding limitations imposed by traditional CMSs like WordPress.
* My clients need the ability to easily edit all aspects of website content (text, images, etc.) through a user-friendly interface, not the layout or design, just the content.

**Current Considerations:**

1. **Astro with DecapCMS:** While promising, I feel it might limit client editing to specific components, and I'd prefer more granular control, also I can't seem to figure out how to customize the user interface/dashboard of the CMS.
2. **Storyblok:** I haven't used it extensively, but it seems like a strong contender.

**What are your recommendations?**

* What headless CMS do you recommend for this scenario?
* Are there any with highly customizable interfaces that I can tailor to my clients' specific needs?
* What are your experiences with client-facing CMS interfaces? Any tips or pitfalls to avoid?

I'm open to exploring other options and appreciate any insights!

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] Build a very basic RAG anyone can deploy and use,"Part of my AI learning journey, I wanted to see how complex it is to build and configure a RAG.

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is a framework that combines information retrieval and GenAI models to improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated outputs. It is useful when the LLM you use needs to produce responses based on up-to-date information that was not included in its training data.

Written in Typescript using Express, Mongo, NodeJS and hosted on¬†[Genezio.com](http://genezio.com/), it needs a key from OpenAI for the LLM part and takes a URL as input.

It starts by crawling the URL and all sub-pages (by looking for \`&lt;a hrefs/&gt;\`, then it creates the vector database and then shows a UI to query the content with the help of OpenAI's Chat APIs.

The Vector DB and the page contents is stored and queried in MongoDB.

You can play with it here:¬†[https://openai-rag.app.genez.io/](https://openai-rag.app.genez.io/)¬†(it indexes Genezio's website, articles and documentation). Please don't over-test this as it uses my personal API key. I've put some spending limits, so it will stop working if you spam it. :)

You can look at the source code here:¬†[https://github.com/bogdanripa/openai-rag](https://github.com/bogdanripa/openai-rag)

You can deploy your own instance using the ""Deploy"" button from Github (it's in the README file). While deploying, you'll need to specify your OpenAI API key and the URL to crawl. Then, when visiting the front-end for the 1st time it will crawl, index and then let you search.

If you want to crawl another URL, simply change the corresponding env variable to the new URL.

What other similar projects should I start?

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] Open-Source Password &amp; Alias Manager Built with .NET Blazor WASM,"Hey r/webdev,

**TL;DR for Devs:**  
For the last couple of months I have been building an open-source, end-to-end encrypted password and alias manager called **AliasVault**. It uses C#, [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core, Entity Framework Core, Blazor WASM, and SQLite‚Äîfully containerized via Docker. It also includes integrated E2E tests (Playwright) run on every PR. You can self-host or use the cloud version, and I‚Äôm looking for feedback on architecture, deployment, performance, and developer experience.

\---

**What is AliasVault?**  
AliasVault helps users protect their privacy online by generating unique identities (email, password, etc.) for every service. Unlike password managers that only store credentials, AliasVault integrates a built-in email server so you can manage full ‚Äúalias‚Äù identities. It‚Äôs zero-knowledge and end-to-end encrypted, so the server never sees your master password, and all data is stored encrypted.

It can be compared to existing services like Bitwarden or OnePassword. But where those services focus more on storing passwords, AliasVault extends this by integrating full identity generation (aliases) and a built-in email server into a single platform.

**About me and goal**  
I've been a software developer for over 15 years and have been working primarily with PHP and .NET. I'm a big privacy advocate and have been running a website called [SpamOK.com](http://SpamOK.com) since 2013 that offers free temporary email addresses to help people protect their privacy. However by the nature of this service all emails are public which makes it anonymous but not entirely suited for occasions where privacy is important.

With AliasVault my goal is to create a fully open-source but private platform which helps protect the users privacy online. People can either choose to use the cloud hosted variant for convenience or self-host it on their own servers via Docker. Right now everything is free but if there's enough interest I am thinking about adding additional premium options (as source-available) to cover the costs of running the cloud version and aid in future development.

I'm sharing this project here on r/webdev for anyone that is interested to check it out both technically and functionally. Everything is open-source and you can install it on your own servers in a few minutes. I'm open for any feedback or questions you might have!

**Live demo and source code:**  
Here you can find the links to the cloud-hosted beta version, documentation and GitHub source code.

* **Live beta:** [https://aliasvault.net](https://aliasvault.net)
* **Docs &amp; Self-hosting:** [https://docs.aliasvault.net](https://docs.aliasvault.net)
* **Source Code:** [https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault)

**Tech stack highlights:**  
Some technical details about the tech stack that AliasVault uses:

* **C#,** [**ASP.NET**](http://ASP.NET) **Core, Entity Framework Core** for API backend and ORM.
* **Blazor WASM** for the SPA front-end, minimizing JavaScript while enabling shared .NET code between front and back-end.
* **SQLite** for a lightweight, self-contained database.
* **Docker** for painless self-hosting and one-click installs.
* **Tailwind CSS**
* [**SRP.net**](http://SRP.net) **&amp; Argon2id** for secure login without requiring master password to be sent over the network and for encryption/decryption. For more information about the encryption technologies used you can check out the Security Architecture documentation here: [https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture/](https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture/)
* **SmtpServer &amp; MimeKit** to handle virtual email aliases internally.
* **Playwright** for E2E browser tests (run on every PR via GitHub Actions), testing frontend+API communication with a clean SQLite instance each time.

**Some of the challenges I faced and lessons learned:**

* **Blazor WASM &amp; Crypto Challenges:** Blazor WASM allows C# to run in the browser which is very powerful in terms of development efficiency, but comes with trade-offs. Initial load size (\~20MB for current version) is quite big for a webapp, and certain encryption functions still require JavaScript fallbacks. I'm hoping future versions of .NET will improve on this.
* **Robust Testing with Playwright &amp; GitHub Actions:** When I started to build this project I set out on making it possible to run E2E tests automatically on each pull request. Now on every PR the front-end, back-end, and database interactions are all tested and verified in an all-in-memory environment with a fresh SQLite database per test. This allows for a lot of flexibility in creating tests to ensure all components are working nicely together. It did take some effort in order to make the test framework be stable and reduce flakiness.
* **Self-hosting convenience:** Part of my vision for AliasVault is to make it as simple as possible to install on your own servers. For this I created an extensive custom installation script that configures all environment files, pulls docker images (or builds them from scratch if you want) and takes care of lifecycle actions such as updating when a new version comes out, enabling LetsEncrypt for automatic SSL certificates etc. You can install the current version of AliasVault on a clean VM in e.g. Azure, AWS or DigitalOcean in literally minutes.
* **SQLite database limitations for back-end:** Currently AliasVault is running on SQLite for both the server and the client. With the server part I've been slowly running into concurrency limitations which causes locking and errors when multiple apps (API and worker services) try to mutate it at the same time. I am therefore planning on switching the server backend to PostgreSQL instead. When I started with just one service accessing the database it worked fine, but now that there are multiple background services, an API and an admin project the amount of locking increases.
* **SQLite database power for front-end:** The architecture for the client works quite interesting: when a new user creates a vault the WASM app creates a new SQLite database in-memory with EF migrations (thanks to the power of the full Entity Framework ORM). Then during sync with the server the WASM app locally encrypts the full .sqlite blob, and then sends that encrypted blob to the server. This allows the client to have full EF ORM capabilities such as searching through local credentials while literally all the user's vault data including all metadata is only stored in encrypted state on the server.

If you have any questions feel free to let me know and I'll happily answer them as best as i can. I'm also open for all feedback regarding architecture, deployment, ease of use etc.

Thank you very much for your time and for checking it out!

webdev,Local offline CMS for SSG (11ty preferably),"I have a personal small static site I build with Eleventy. I build it on my own computer, manually creating the Markdown files and transferring the output to my hosting provider. I don't mind managing my content manually that much, but I'm looking into ways to make it easier as files are heaping up. 

Is there anything like a GUI front-end to manage my source content in the traditional CMS way, without having to connect to any online service, all locally? I don't intend to use GitHub/GitLab or Netlify or anything. I want my computer to manage and build the static site that I can then simply upload to the hosting server, whose only job would be to serve the static files.

Decap CMS seemingly needs a remote git repo and heavily pushes towards Netlify; I don't se how to alter that. Strapi has no official documentation for integration with Eleventy.

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] Rebuilding my personal web with pure HTML and TailwindCSS,"Hello and happy saturday!

For the last couple of weeks I've been rebuilding my website from scratch, that before it was using Materialize as CSS framework (rip project), some heavy PHP and jQuery.

But now I wanted to go full minimalistic and use as minimum resources as possible, I've ended up with pure HTML page (using PHP only for the contact form), pure JS with no frameworks, and TailwindCSS for easier layout building. The page fully loaded it's just 412kB, so basically loads instantly.

Now, there are still some features to implement, like the dark mode, and also I want to add some fancy animations when changing the language, now it only changes the texts. I also need to update my PDF CV to make the download and print buttons work (side question: as .print() funcion has been deprecated for a while, is there any way to print a document, not the page, directly with a button via JS?)

I'm looking for your feedback, as this page was only viewed by me I don't have any external input on how this page looks to other, if it's appealing, and also if there are any bigger design flaws to improve.

webdev,Confusion regarding HTTP based REST APIs?,"Recently trying to wrap my head around the client/server architectures and communication protocols between them.

HTTP was originally designed to transfer web pages from a server to anyone requesting aka clients. During the early ages of the Internet where webpages were static, this was the only job of a server. Clients hit an anchor tag, you serve them a webpage. As the name of the protocol implies (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), your job was to securely transfer HTML, to the requesting party.

Now in the current times where webpages are much more dynamic and interactive, servers apart from transferring HTML, now also transfer some additional data because now navigation into a website doesn't cause a full render, it only changes some parts of the webpage, so the server sends only that part of the webpage.

This ""additional data"" in most cases is not HTML, it's JSON (or XML etc), which only contains the necessary bits needed for that part of the webpage.

So my question is, why are we still using HTTP for this purpose? Wouldn't it make sense to make a different protocol only for this purpose? And why do we call these APIs HTTP based when clearly we are not transferring any hypertext?",Patzer26,1hdzjfs,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hdzjfs/confusion_regarding_http_based_rest_apis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hdzjfs/confusion_regarding_http_based_rest_apis/,2024-12-14 09:37:29,2,0.75,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdzjfs

webdev,"[Showoff Saturday] Svelte Mini Router ‚Äì a declarative, minimal SPA router for Svelte 5, without SvelteKit","SvelteKit has a built-in router for Svelte 5, but unfortunately there is no official solution for those projects built without SvelteKit (usually simple SPAs created directly with [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)). I'm aware of at least [one](https://redd.it/1ghdpis), but I wanted a slightly different approach, so I decided to write [my own](https://xkcd.com/927/):

* https://github.com/rodrigocfd/svelte-mini-router

The idea is to have a (very) small declarative router. The API has only 2 components and 3 functions.

### Example

Folder structure has no rules, you can organize the way you want. For example:

    src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ home/
    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ MyHome.svelte
    ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ page1/
    ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ Page1.svelte
    ‚îú‚îÄ App.svelte
    ‚îú‚îÄ Error404.svelte
    ‚îú‚îÄ main.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ routerConf.ts

Router declaration:

    import {type RouterConf} from 'svelte-mini-router';

    export const routerConf: RouterConf = {
        routes: [
            // this is your home page
            {path: '/', render: () =&gt; import('./pages/home/MyHome.svelte')},

            // another page
            {path: '/page1', render: () =&gt; import('./pages/page1/Page1.svelte')},

            // nested routes are up to you
            {path: '/foo/bar/stuff', render: () =&gt; import('./pages/page1/Page1.svelte')},

            // you can use path parameters anywhere
            {path: '/foo/{name}/and/{age}', render: () =&gt; import('./pages/page1/Page1.svelte')},
        ],

        // if you use a base URL, set it here; optional
        baseUrl: '/my-web-application',

        // error 404 route; optional
        // if not defined, a simple ""404 - Not found"" text will be displayed
        render404: () =&gt; import('./Error404.svelte'),
    };

Finally add the router component to your `App.svelte`:

    &lt;script lang=""ts""&gt;
        import {Router} from 'svelte-mini-router';
        import {routerConf} from './routerConf';
    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;Router {routerConf} /&gt;

### Navigating

Rendering an `&lt;a href=""""&gt;` element to a route with the `Link` component:

    &lt;script lang=""ts""&gt;
        import {Link} from 'svelte-mini-router';
    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;!-- without query parameters --&gt;
    &lt;Link path=""/page1""&gt;
        Go to Page 1
    &lt;/Link&gt;

    &lt;!-- with query parameters --&gt;
    &lt;!-- means ""/page1?name=Joe&amp;age=43"" --&gt;
    &lt;Link path=""/page1"" params={{name: 'Joe', age: 43}}&gt;
        Go to Page 1
    &lt;/Link&gt;

Programmatically navigating to a route with `navigate` function:

    import {navigate} from 'svelte-mini-router';

    // without query parameters
    navigate('/page1');

    // with query parameters
    // means ""/page1?name=Joe&amp;age=43""
    navigate('/page1', {name: 'Joe', age: 43});

### Parameters

Current URL path parameters can be retrieved as an object with `getPathParams` function:

    import {getPathParams} from 'svelte-mini-router';

    // from ""/foo/{name}/and/{age}""
    // then ""/foo/Joe/and/43""
    const pathParams = getPathParams();
    // will be {name: 'Joe', age: '43'}

And query parameters with `getQueryParams` function:

    import {getQueryParams} from 'svelte-mini-router';

    // from ""/page1?name=Joe&amp;age=43""
    const queryParams = getQueryParams();
    // will be {name: 'Joe', age: '43'}

### That's all...

This router covers all the needs for my team, I hope it's useful to someone else.

webdev,"Conditional Fetching with SWR and React
","Hello Guys!

I am working on a project where I have to build an queue management system. It is integrated with an external API, and I need to display people on the waiting queue, and people that are being called to be served. I am using Next.js for this.

I have three components: the Page (where I do the fetching), the Tail (people that are waiting) and the Head (people being called, it can be one or more people).

In Page, i use SWR to fetch an object with the head and the tail, and pass them as props to Head and Tail.

The thing is that for every person on the Head, I use the Speech Synthesis Browser API, and that can take some time, if the name of the person is big and there are multiple people on the head.

I have set the polling time on SWR to be 60 seconds, a value that I believe will be fine for the system. But that time being a minute makes the system feel clunky and slow for the attendants.

Is there a way to tell SWR not to fetch data while the speech synthesis is happening for each person on the queue? For that, I would need to pass some kind of information to the parent component, how should I do that, use Context?

Also, in the Head component, I'm using three useEffects. The first one to retrieve the voice that will be used in Speech Synthesis, the second one triggers the speaking event for every person on the array and the third one cycles through the people on the array. Is that pattern of programming a bad practice with React or is that a valid solution?

webdev,Help me estimate cost of an app,"Hi, I‚Äôm thinking to start creating a project, I‚Äôm not yet sure to begin.

Anyway, I‚Äôve experience in creating app with small audience (internal tools) so usually the cost of hosting and databse is very limited .

The app that I‚Äôm thinking is an app that offer a service for a single city.

The user can:
- login
- register

The main feature is:
- user open the app and see a map (like map box or Google maps ) but the map is restricted to show only one city
-user can zoom in , zoom out and move around the map
- user can add a marker to a street in the map and add some information (text only for now , images upload will be added maybe in the future but I don‚Äôt want to consider it for now)
- user can see every marker created by other user
- user can add a ‚Äúlike‚Äù on a marker 
- user is not happy to pay for this, but the user expects that the app to be a free service payed by the city (so the user indirectly pays for this with taxes)

My question is: how much monthly it will cost to have an app like this ? Development excluded.
The things that need to be payed are:
- hosting (VPs or serverless)
- frontend (react for sure so next js or vite)
- db (with only text I don‚Äôt think the disk space of the db will be higher that 1 go for a while
- map service ( I never used for an app like this a service for map so I have no idea how to estimate it.user will zoom in,zoom out and move around the map
so I presume a lot of requests are performed under the hood.
- Auth service

For sure the app will have an initial stage with super low traffic , then later it can increase highly but not sky rocket. 
How to estimate these two stages?



The city has 15000 people in the main area, and with interland it reaches 300000 people. It isn‚Äôt expected that every user will use that , so I think 10/15% of total people can spend 30 minute every month on the app.
This when the app is in high traffic stage.

Once the email service had expired, 3-4 months later I realized I was still paying for a service that I wasn't using. After digging on the website to see what was being charged, since I wasn't sure at first if my account had been hacked, I finally found that I was being charged for their relate social pro service.

I tried contacting namecheap and submitted a ticket regarding the situation, seeing if I could get a refund on the service I didn't use but no response. So I decided to chargeback through my credit card company thinking it would be okay, but then just recently I receive this from namecheap.

webdev,Clerk bombed my NextJS deployment,"Word to wise, stop using shitty libraries that invest more in marketing than development, and don't fall for sponsored influencers, no matter how ""Fireship"" they may be.

I fell for the Youtubers shilling for Clerk and in my latest project I switched from NextAuth to Clerk. I've done several Nextjs projects before with NextAuth, hosting them on a Digital Ocean VPS and proxying them with nginx, with no major issues whatsoever.

This time, with Clerk, everything was OK in development, though their middleware seemed a bit fussy. Deployed to the vps, though, it went crazy and blocks all my api routes, due to some cors issues that seem to be out of my control. Nothing I can think of has any effect, ChatGPT goes around in circles, and I'm stuck now with basically a sabotaged app. User signUp/signIn/signOut works fine, it just messes up with \*my\* bloody api.

Clerk's customer support is as helpless as it is arrogant. First they just copy pasted some irrelevant code from their useless docs, then told me I'm using localhost. I don't know how Vercel does it, but what other ways are there to serve something other then from a local host? I also set up everything correctly, both on the DNS and the Clerk dashboard, so cors shouldn't be issue. But that's where all communication stopped with Clerk.

I don't have time this year to switch to NextAuth, so the project will be late, and I will finish the year and conclude several months of work in quite a shitty manner.

Did something like this happened to anyone else? Any possible advice on this?

  
Edit: Wow, such  a friendly and helpful community, you guys never disappoint. Just as none of you have ever used ChatGPT.
