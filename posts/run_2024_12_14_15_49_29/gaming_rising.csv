gaming,Chinese players are review bombing Baldur’s Gate 3 because Swen presented GOTY to not-wukong,"Go here, filter recent negative comments, and make sure to show all languages: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/

Context: Astro Bot win GOTY, and Chinese players are really butthurt. Astro Bot is not on Steam though, so they lashed out at the presenter of the award instead, among other things.

Some choice quote translated (by me):

""销量不重要，那想必玩家口碑也不重要吧，这差评你可接好了。“年度是给不追求销量的游戏的”，那以后拉瑞安的游戏我可就不买了""

""Sales not important? Then player review must not be important either. Take this negative review. GOTY doesn’t have to meet sales targets? I’ll never buy Larian games again.”

""屠魔的少年，终究成魔""

“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he hereby become a monster.”

""我花钱了 不爽打个差评""

“I spent money and am pissed off so I’m giving a negative review.”

""不如小机器人，一个销量辣鸡游戏仅此而已""

“Worse than Astro Bot. Just a garbage game with good sales.”

""游戏开发不要在意玩家评价和销量，我给差评也请不要在意。""

“If developers don’t need to care for sales or reviews, please don’t mind my negative review.”

""为虎作伥""

“Accomplice of evil”
