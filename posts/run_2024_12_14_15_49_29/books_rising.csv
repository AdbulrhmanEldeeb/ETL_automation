books,Gift The Poisonwood Bible for super conservative parent?,"I always like to gift my parents a book for Christmas but it can be a challenge finding something they will enjoy that isn’t right wing propaganda. For reference they are very religious and conservative. They do like history. I gifted All the Light We Cannot See last year and they seemed to enjoy that. The Poisonwood Bible sounded interesting but I wanted to ask people who have read it, is it politically heavy handed? I only read the brief summary and I want to make sure I’m getting something that they will enjoy.

books,How do you feel about bits of music in audiobooks?,"Currently listening to the latest Michael Connelly, The Waiting. 

On the one hand, I like that they got Titus Welliver, the actor from the Bosch TV series, to narrate his parts. I believe the daughter's from the show as well, and the main narrator, Christine Lakin, is excellent.

But they occasionally interject snippets of music, and for some reason I just can't get into that. Every time I hear music in an audiobook, it kind of takes me right out of it.

books,"I forget the books after I read them, and it makes me a bit frustrated","When someone brings this matter up, usually the following quote is posted: 

&gt;I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

While I understand how perfectly natural and reasonable this phenomenon is, it still irks me from time to time. Isn't it quite irritable that, say, eight month after finishing a novel, I can recall only some vague details and general atmosphere, maybe one or two motifs? 

For example, the books I read about 2 years ago, that captivated me for weeks after I had finished them - *Les Miserables* by Victor Hugo, *The Idiot* by Dostoyevsky or *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem - are now almost vanished from my memory, for I recount only their outline, some random impressions. I bet I couldn't speak about them for more than ten minutes if I were forbidden to make vague statements like 'the writing was amazing', 'the characters were multi-dimensional', etc. Theoretically I even lack the proof that I ever opened them. 

And the matter is worse! This summer I have read, among others, two magnificent novels that produced on me the most profound impression - *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck and *Joke* by Milan Kundera. I was so excited that I hastened to write some (flawed) reviews here on Reddit. And now I feel that they are fading away from my memory, the same novels that I reckoned the height of literature, among the finest masterpieces I have ever read! 

This week I finished two novellas of Steinbeck that held me engrossed from first page to last, and I can't help thinking that in six months time, I won't even remember the characters' names. 

Once again, I perfectly understand that this all natural and intrinsical. I can only hope that in the end there is *something* indefinite that persists from every book, remaining somewhere in my subconsciousness.

books,A Year of Reading to a 5 Year Old,"My son turned 6 this fall and this is the first really consistent year I've spent reading chapter books with him. I've looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I'd look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old's perspective.

**The BFG** by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it's fun.

**Charlie and the Chocolate Factory** by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We've been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)

**Fantastic Mr. Fox** by Roald Dahl - A lot shorter than I was expecting and probably my kid's least favorite Dahl.

**James and the Giant Peach** by Roald Dahl - Kid liked it fine, it was my least favorite Dahl and there are a lot of voices to do if you do that.

**The Wild Robot Trilogy** by Peter Brown - We finished the 3rd one about a week before the movie came out by coincidence. The first 2 are really good and my son was constantly asking if we could read just one more chapter since the chapters are short. The 3rd one is fine but it's not as connected as the first 2 are. It felt more like an afterthought.

**Stuart Little** by E.B. White - I thought this was a pleasure to read as an adult. The kid enjoyed it although he was startled by the abrupt ending.

**The Horse and His Boy** and **The Silver Chair** by C.S. Lewis - This concluded Narnia for us, I think. We've read everything but The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. I loved Narnia as a kid but it's rough for this age. There are some very talky and slow parts that my kid just didn't get. He really like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which we read last year but otherwise, Narnia is maybe better left for an older kid.

**The Wizard of Oz** by Frank Baum - This seems like a perfect book for this age group.  It's very episodic in it's structure.  The language was a little old fashioned (which isn't surprising), but the kid really liked it.  The tornado scene was very memorable and he really liked the color coding that happens in the book.  The biggest surprise here was that the movie was likewise a huge hit.

We're currently reading **Phantom Tollbooth** by Norton Juster and while I don't dislike it,  I wish we weren't.  There is a lot of word play that is missed by reading out loud (witch vs. which, weather vs. whether).  But he seems to be enjoying it.

For this age, what is working for us is shorter chapters, not too talky, some pictures, and a touch of silliness.  I don't think we need all those ticked off for a successful ""read aloud to a 5/6 year old but it helps.  Reading a lot of older books means explaining somethings that just aren't a part of my kid's life like porcelain and corporal punishment.",CliffDiverLemming,1hdsiyd,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,2024-12-14 02:08:52,637,0.96,637,0,131,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdsiyd
