movies,28 Weeks Later: Alice was NOT asymptomatic,"In 28 Weeks Later part of the premise is that mother of the children Alice is left behind in mainland Britain with the infected, when found she carries the infection but is asymptomatic. I was rewatching 28 Weeks Later today and it is clear that Alice is not actually asymptomatic at all. Although she appears to largely retain her memories and her basic faculties, she displays all the signs of infection such as disfigurement (one of her eyes is heavily bloodshot), insanity she is found cowering alone in a room covered in crosses and symbols, aggression (both passive and overt), she appears to attempt to hurt her son and then when questioned by the US military she remains silent during questioning, possibly suggesting anger and an ulterior motive. The fact she allows her husband to kiss her could possibly be a sign of calculation, if she knows she is carrying the virus.

One of the main things I noticed in the room Alice was found hiding in is that it is covered in crosses drawn on the wall. The same symbol seen heavily in the 28 Years Later trailer.

I wonder if Alice was actually the first of the new type of infected we will see in 28 Years?",twixeater78,1he2rio,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he2rio/28_weeks_later_alice_was_not_asymptomatic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he2rio/28_weeks_later_alice_was_not_asymptomatic/,2024-12-14 13:22:52,278,0.76,278,0,99,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he2rio
movies,"Unforgiven is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies as a director ever. I mean imagine deconstructing the gunslinger image that made you a star, and stripping away the glamor behind the Wild West.","https://preview.redd.it/yicntwi7lq6e1.png?width=219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4058b385363489b27ba3d34b8e628fe804990207

William Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.

https://preview.redd.it/9eglkeoplq6e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb95dfb6da04b33733c5019ea3b5560fbd7cafb



But much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the  sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207

Characters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.

It is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.

And it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it. And Freeman is as reliable as ever as the soft spoken Ned.",LoneWolfIndia,1hduhu8,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,2024-12-14 03:59:59,1534,0.91,1534,0,169,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hduhu8

movies,"The filmmakers who are taking inspirations from ""Die Hard"" seems to be forgetting something, especially with regards to the main character.","I have seen the trailer ""Cleaner"" starring Daisy Ridley and it seems that the filmmakers have taken cues from the film ""Die Hard"". However, I've noticed something when others are taking inspirations from the said film. John McLane is basically a normal cop who is just trying to fix his marriage to his wife who is working in the building that he came in. When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beats some of the bad guys, but he's hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he's gonna die but he's afraid of it). These are the reasons why I loved this character. He's vulnerable but he's determined to his job especially when he has to save his wife.
