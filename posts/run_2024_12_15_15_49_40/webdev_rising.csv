webdev,I'm really enjoying AdonisJS. My new preferred full-stack framework.,"There was a post (last week I think) about AdoniJS. The comments were along the lines of ""oh great another JS framework"", but I thought I'd try it for a new private project.

Really glad I did. It feels like a Typescript version of Laravel.

webdev,I think we should do a subreddit-wide hackathon! (If mods allow it),"I noticed a ton of cool stuff posted here yesterday on showoff saturday and I think it would be really cool to do a week/month long hackathon and show off what we built on a showoff saturday. With something like `""[Hackathon submission] - Project name""` as the post title.

I for one would like the challenge, there are almost 3m members here and I think some pretty cool stuff would come out of it.

I don't think a prize is even necessary, but maybe as a prize top 3 winner's projects could be stickied on a post for about a week or so. Again, there are almost 3m members, the attention those projects would get from the stickied post would worth at least a few hundred bucks.

We can track the legitimacy of the projects by creating date and progress of the projects' GitHub repos so there won't be people showing something they've built before.

webdev,Please Roast My Landing Page,"This isn’t an attempt to advertise—it’s simply a heartfelt request for honest, constructive feedback.

As a solo entrepreneur focused on app design and development (which takes up most of my time), I find it tough to step back and view my app objectively after months of work, particularly when it comes to the overall marketing communication.

Looking at my relatively low download numbers, I worry that I’m not effectively communicating the benefits and quality of my app.

I’m also not very familiar with web development, so I’d appreciate any technical improvement suggestions as well. I created the landing page using plain HTML/CSS.

What do you think I could improve?
