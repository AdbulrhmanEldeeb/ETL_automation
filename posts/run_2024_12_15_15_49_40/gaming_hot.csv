""Sales not important? Then player review must not be important either. Take this negative review. GOTY doesn’t have to meet sales targets? I’ll never buy Larian games again.”

[https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27096](https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27096)

[https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/](https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/)

From Famitsu:

**--Even though there is an online main mode, why did you include the single mode ""Old Amasia Investigation""?**

**Futami**　I didn't want to make a game that would become unplayable if online play were to become unavailable in the future, so I prepared a single mode. Of course, we intend to continue the service, and I don't want it to be taken in a negative sense, but I wanted players to feel reassured that this is not a game that they will no longer be able to play. I also wanted to draw a contrast as a story. In the main story, the player and their own Magus will depict the drama of each player. However, it is not conveyed from within the game how the player interacts with other Magus. So, by looking at the relationship between Alba and Ada, I wanted players to be aware of the relationship between themselves and their own Magus.

**--It has increased a little recently, but most online games cannot be played again once the service ends, so that is a nice consideration.**

**Futami**　Of course, we want to continue the service, but we wanted to get rid of the feeling that the game would become unplayable once the service ends.

**--Will it be possible to play the game completely offline from the beginning?**

**Futami**　No, the introduction to online play is absolutely necessary, and it is unlocked once you have progressed to a certain extent. It is a mode that can be played even after the service ends, but it is not set to be playable completely offline from the time of release.

　Of course, we are considering how to deal with that situation, but we are only making it possible to deal with it, and we do not want to change our stance that it is basically a ""mode that is useful for online play,"" so at this time online play is also required.

From GamerNE:

\--This game is an online-only title, but I think it's quite rare for an online-only title to be sold as a one-time purchase.

Futami: That's right... I think what everyone is worried about on that point is, ""Will I no longer be able to play the game once the service ends?""

However, I would like to make it clear that even if the online service ends, the game will still be playable.

\--What do you mean?

Futami: It's true that currently, online play is required to play this game, but we've already prepared a way to make it possible to play offline. The reason it's required to be online is because we don't want to store data locally to prevent so-called cheating.

Of course, since the game is primarily online, there will be limitations to what you can play, but please rest assured that the packages and games you purchase will not be completely wasted.",JaSonic2199,1heahcu,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,2024-12-14 19:32:43,38,0.78,38,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heahcu

Our art has been dressed down into an industry,and this industry has been pilfered by corrupt executives, by the vulgar profiteering of corporate bodies moving like leviathans in the dark, burning human fuel in their insatiable lust for money.

It is not pencil-pushers and moneylenders who make games. It is the relentless passion of the workers that creates an art form capable of saying something true.

  
As creators and game makers, we have too long been led away from the truth, away from the right to define ourselves as artists in service of the definitive art form of the future, one that has made us dream since we were children.

Instead, the disposability culture operating at the ruthless core of this industry wants us to think of ourselves as cogs in the machine: rudimentary craftsmen, disposable career workers, inert producers of made-to-order marketing-driven ""content"" — empty calories leaving the soul hungry.

The Profiteer knows that by keeping your dignity low, he will keep you crawling on the treadmill of passion until he lays you off for the sake of the red number in his book.

We make games because we have to. It is our calling. Because we have no choice but to see the transformative potential of this youngest medium of human interaction. You can't turn away once you've seen the light,Or it will always feel like everyone else in the world is doing something without you, there in the light you try to abandon but can't, because — oh, the horror — it comes from inside you.

All art is communication — dialogue across time, space and thought. In its rawest, it is one mind’s ability to provoke emotion in another.Large language models— simulacra, cold comfort, real-doll pocket-pussy, cyberspace freezer of an abandoned IM-chat — which are today passed off for “artificial intelligence”,will never be able to offer a dialogue with the vision of another human being.

Machine-generated works will never satisfy or substitute the human desire for art, as our desire for art is in its core a desire for communication with another,with a talent who speaks to us across worlds and ages to remind us of our all-encompassing human universality. There is no one to connect to in a large language model. The phone line is open but there’s no one on the other side.

The peddlers who aim to get rich quick from this scheme will always PLAY THE FOOL to any ethical or artistic argument. This is why we must push back against Big Tech's encroachment on the territory of our art,against increasing corporatization and alienation of game creators from their work, against the robbery of rights from workers, performers, artists and all contributors to this complicated and MULTI-FACETED medium.

Our mission is to unite world-class artists and creatives in a truly independent game studio which will always prioritize artistic integrity over personal comfort, profit margin, short term interests and Big Tech profit-bubbles.

There we will be able to embark on that treacherous road of building a cultural megaproject, a Role Playing Game with complexity and ambition worthy to rival our wretched and wonderful world.

In this we are committed to pursue the highest caliber of literary quality.

Here we stand, bound by our love for games and devotion to our craft, ready to bleed and weep and ride the cavalry into machine gun fire one more time.

For this we will need all the support and help from you, our readers, colleagues and future visionaries. Come walk the desert with us.

We will not take any of your support for granted.We have seen the suffering wrought by the hunger for power, the terror of greed and envy, the complicity of the averted eye. We have also seen the triumph of the human spirit, of solidarity in the striving, of making something never before seen and seeing its miracle unfold in the world. We have seen poverty, and we have seen plenty. We will make mistakes, we will win and we will fail, but we will never forget what we are doing this for.  
  
Yours in every season,

gaming,Extraction shooter most similar to CoD DMZ (on PS5)? ,"I know that extraction shooters are the current battle royales, but I really only played DMZ so that's my only reference for the genre. I enjoyed squadding up, completing the missions against NPCs, helping others complete their missions, progressing through the missions/rewards, and the occasional PVP battle. It's one of the few games where the randoms you squad with are generally pro-team and want to help each other get things checked off. 

What Playstation extraction shooter is the most similar to the DMZ experience? I'm not sure if they all have the dual PVE/PVP aspects of DMZ or if most are mainly PVP? For me DMZ was 75% PVE and 25% PVP how I played it and that was cool for me. I know some people played it exclusively to go PVP hunting but that's not my style and the toxic proximity chat was crazy at times. Is there another game that plays the same with missions, etc. ?

gaming,(Discussion) A hilarious roast of GameInformer Magazine I emailed to them in 2012 regarding a ZombiU review and zombie games in general. (I love both). What does Reddit think of ZombiU now?,"Your reveiw of zombie U I thought was quite generally wrong. Because of this I assumed it was horrible. 

But First off, the environment hasn't played so well in a game for me since Bioshock. Sure I've played dead space, left4dead and even dayZ, warZ and even Amnesia, but I thought the sounds around you and the amount of detail going into each environment really sells the zombie apocalypse, better than anything I've seen before. And it wasn't intentionally throwing stupid scripted events at you like FEAR or dead space either

You said everything is blurry and too dark too see? First off, there are settings for brightness, and also I feel like you must have been playing on a small non HD TV in your gameinformer office somewhere. I am like 6 hours in, and I don't feel like I've played the same zombie twice, and thats been a big problem for me in every zombie game. It takes away from the moment when you see two coming at you that look exactly the same, and that hasn't happened in this yet. 

I just think you are not one to like this sort of game. The ""gimmick"" of scanning for items and doing other things with the WiiU's pro controller really worked well for me and it really isn't hard to raise up the controller, and this is coming from a guy who can only use ONE HAND for most things due to a brain tumor. And I didnt die for the first few hours, I got use to the controls very fast, and started playing right after plugging in my wiiU. Maybe you just aren't a very good apocalypse survivor ;). Left4dead is more action-oriented, and I really liked it for that, and you can take out 5-10 zombies in one hit.

Another bone I have to pick with zombie games in general is the fact that you hit a zombie once with a melee weapon, and it goes down. Is the human skull made out of pudding? No! Remember the first two kills in Shaun of the Dead? They bashed that thing like 15 times! So I like that it's more realistic and less like left4dead. Left4dead is more action oriented and I really liked it for that, and you can take out 5-10 zombies in one hit. ZombiiU is a single player experience, it can have action, but also has more of a stealthy side to it, you can't just run around like a headless chimpanzee and wack anything in site and expect to live or have a fun time. That was pretty clear to me. It sounds weird to say, but maybe you just played the game wrong. The controls seemed fine and after getting new items you just have to rearrange your immediate inventory and backpack items, and just be smart about it. Also the swinging of the bat is REALISTIC. if you pay attention while facing an enemy, the first swing is quick, and with every swing after it gets a tad slower with fatigue.

Then you said ""the useless quest tracker"" and ""confusing map system"". Are you mentally handicap? Because that was a higher point for the game to me. Its a simple freaking map! Everything is square and you can see your arrow in real time! And if you have a mission objective, you know what direction to go. In the beginning when I cleared out all the zombies in a few areas, I used the map and the arrow (you) to walk around ALONE just looking at the controller screen. 

And the audio was great! Like I said every zombie feels unique and I'm still hearing new screeching noises escape from them when I fight. And the only noise i notice coming out of the pro controller is when the British guy talks to you, which is rare, or I go in my backpack.

I have been angered by reviews before, but never enough to write in to gameinformer.  it honestly feels like you were paid off by someone to give it a horrible reputation. 

I do, however, agree with you that they needed to include online support for their multiplayer. You failed to mention though that there are spray paint cans you can find, and leave messages on walls for others to see when they play through single player, and I thought this was a brilliant idea. 

And I am not a ""fanboy"". I own the 3 biggest systems now and never wanted the original Wii. The wiiU was a christmas present

I usually really like gameinformer's reveiws....but Seeing reviews like this makes me feel happy in a way. Because I feel like I could do a better job.

I absolutely don't see the problem as long as it's well integrated, for example I didn't like the Monster product placement in Death Stranding, I found it silly and forced, but for Porsche in the trailer I find it just perfect, same for the Sony sound console or the pair of Adidas.

If it can help the studio lighten its budget and offer us well-known brands in our video games, it's just a win-win for me.

gaming,Microsoft's $100B Acquisitions: Apparently the New-Original IPs are staying Xbox-Exclusive (for now),"**Note:** As of now I only own PS5 and may setup (budget issues, lol) a PC in next couple of years if non-PS games really become attractive to me. Even though I'll get downvoted but I personally feel that there should be some exclusives attached to a brand if a brand is targeting a platform/hardware system. Since MS has spent 100B on acquiring studios, its simply not possible to keep everything exclusive as PS is the moneymaker in software as well. But I observed a very cool thing. I've seen that apart from few exceptions (Hellblade 2 &amp; Licensed IPs), Xbox hasn't announced new-owned IPs for Playstation, YET. Yes, lots of games 1st party games are announced for PS but those were already the games which had their previous parts released on PS and weren't closely associated with Xbox brand. Saying that, following is what I've observed. \[*I'm excluding PC and Nintendo from this discussion as Nintendo seems to be on another plane while PC has been adopted by even Sony*\]

   * Hellblade 2 - Still seems to be exclusive even though part 1 was released on PS, so it's a bit difficult to associate this brand with Xbox. May become multi platform
   * Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle - Licensed IP. Would have been nice for a good xbox game to be exclusive but since branding is the main thing so it may not have much of an impact.
   * Blade - May become multi-platform. It's a Marvel brand so no point of pushing it to become Xbox's brand
* State of Xbox - Rumors/Confirmations/Observations
   * GamePass seems to be the core brand for MS Gaming and future
   * Pushing for everything to be ""This is an Xbox"".
   * There's still one more console that they'll release as per Sarah Bond

gaming,Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - PS5 vs PC comparison,"Lighting and Shadows
The PC version significantly improves lighting. Characters’ faces appear more lifelike with balanced illumination, and the shadows are sharper with better depth, making scenes with Aerith and Cloud stand out even more.

Background Details
The environments look much clearer and more refined. Effects like the glowing bokeh in Aerith’s scene appear smoother, while Cloud’s surroundings benefit from sharper textures and greater detail.

Texture Quality
The PC version enhances textures across the board. Aerith’s hair shows individual strands, and Cloud’s outfit looks crisper and more detailed, making the characters feel even more realistic.

Color Grading
Colors on PC are richer and more vibrant, with improved contrast. It avoids the slightly washed-out look seen on PS5, resulting in a more visually dynamic presentation.

Ambient Occlusion &amp; Effects
Small details, like shading in clothing folds and subtle creases, are much more refined. Additionally, effects like glowing particles are smoother and more polished, adding to the overall visual depth.",Tomozuki,1heis71,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heis71/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth_ps5_vs_pc_comparison/,https://i.redd.it/bmlpq3tbax6e1.jpeg,2024-12-15 02:23:00,0,0.46,0,0,45,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NoHXWvNKIZbN4D4sFBWeJK-thQEE6PHoIasXgjAoSfk.jpg,t3_1heis71

I guess there wasn't that great of a prize involved with the contest. When I spoke with u/Fuel4myrocket, they mentioned that they'd try to find the figurine and post a picture of it here as well. I'm hoping that they're able to.

The handful of times I've ever looked for an answer to this question, I've been unable to find anything.

gaming,A Fjord I made in Minecraft,"This Inlet is part of major fjord I have been developing in my Minecraft world called Sky Pixel. The fjord itself is called the ""Lullaby Fjord"" it is surrounded by large tidewater glaciers I have been making for quite some time now. 

This world is also already released on my Patreon (Sky Pixel) for users to experience and download.

Much of my builds can also be seen on my YT channel @elijahjones as well. 

This build is a small section of my world that I have been developing since 2014. Which includes many cities and landscapes. 

This glacier itself is called the ""Porter Glacier"" it's part of a series of glaciers that run near it such as the ""Harlette, Kusuah, Ellie, Jacie, Rezjvik, Lunaska, and Sathomko glaciers"" amongst others. 

This area I have been developing in my world is inspired by the Pacific Northwest landscapes. I've been doing a ton of developing similar to these landscapes because I was born and raised in the PNW. This area in particular is mostly focused on areas of British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska. I have already developed much of areas within the Cascades and Coast Mountains already. Just making my way up the line. And almost done with this region in my world.

I’ve heard some headsets are stand alone and all that you need to play. 

Generally I’m just asking for advice on what I should get to, to get into vr gaming.

And as the original paragraph said, I’m entirely clueless. Any help is appreciated.

gaming,"6 Decades of gaming, 6 Decades of Male Main Characters","Gaming as a whole has been oddly male oriented for decades, even after the gaming census a couple years ago and all data collected showing nearly 48% of ""gamers"" are women, men still seem to be the vocal majority. Recently during the game awards and this year, we've seen a bunch of trailers with females as the main protagonist (which i have absolutely no issue with, considering Lora Croft paved the way for some badass characters).

The vocal minority of social media trolls immediately jumping on the 30 second-5 minute trailers as "" woke "" or "" agenda driven "" has really made me wonder why are we so oddly angry about this now?  Take Witcher 4 for an idea, all i see is comments about people being angry that the STORY DRIVEN narrative is now Cersi's perspective even though that's the only direction it should have went. 

Some incredible games have came with female leads

Tomb Raider

Horizon Zero Dawn

The Last of Us

Cyberpunk 2077 (V is canonically female)

Bayonetta

Yet the gaming community is so wrapped up in this toxic understanding that gaming companies are pushing any sort of agenda. Of course companies have the right to produce anything they like, and the fact that most of these misogynistic apelike men masturbated to Lora Croft growing up in their miserable bedrooms, and most likely still do, what is it about now that makes you so unnecessarily loud. We pride companies on following their own values.

Just irritated how video games have fallen into this absolutely abysmal state because everyone is sucked into the abyss of politics they have NO idea about. 

Get excited for games again, give games a chance, and stop immedietly jumping on the bandwagon of "" this game sucks."" without even a second of gameplay available.

gaming,Witcher 4 Controversy ,"The Witcher 4 trailer and the discussions around it really have me thinking, we aren’t ever gonna solve the problem with bickering in gaming are we? I mean I have seen so many comments complaining about people who are complaining that they “don’t want to play as a girl” than I have of actual people complaining about playing a girl. It’s got the point where people are so ready for outrage and bigotry that they pre-empt it, which in turn causes the bigotry and complaints they didn’t want to see. Now I am not saying there aren’t some weird bigots out there because there are. But man we are so ready for L takes that we start to complain about them when they don’t exist and almost breath life into them. 

I thought the trailer was great and it hyped me up. It’s sad to see the state of the gaming community, I think social media has a lot to blame for this tbh. I personally don’t like forced inclusivity, you know the kind where the protagonist is a minority and the devs harp on about their gender, ethnicity, cultural background or sexual orientation more than they do the game mechanics or story, ye that I dislike. This however, isn’t that. It’s been very obvious where they were going after the Witcher 3 and this feels like a natural progression.

Rockstar Games dont need those shows really, they can shadowdrop on a monday at 7 am and still sell hilarious number.. Switch 2 .. same story Nintendo does their own stuff, whenever they want to. .

But.. for me most notably: 

What about the new Fable? Shouldnt there be some gameplay by now? This game has been in dev for ages.. (also since Playground games works hard on this.. is Forza Horizon on ice?)

Judas (from Ken Levine, Bioshock founder) should also be playable? No Trailers? Should we be worried? A new Bioshock game is also in develoopment right now... 

 I thought we might get a few hints about new Marvel games.. Wolverine? Blade? 

No news from the KOTOR remake.. 

I thought about Devil May Cry aswell,but Capcom had Okami and Onimusha so that was great.

Silksong?

Kojima was there.. but no new Death Stranding 2 infos... sus?

Doom Dark Ages?

If you know of any hard but fair game, whether niche or popular, feel free to name it. 

Here are just a few guidelines though:
- single player would be better

- no rogue likes/lites or bullet hells because I just don’t really like them sorry

- the game must still be somewhat fair. I don’t want inflated difficulty just for the sake of « ahah my game is absolutely unbeatable »

gaming,Balatro’s Success got me thinking of some other unorthodox roguelike ideas,"A poker inspired rogue-like becoming one of the most lauded indies of recent memory is definitely not something that was on my 2024 bingo card. But it got me thinking… what are some other genres that haven’t been explored by the often dubbed “over explored” genre of roguelikes?

Specifically, I thought of bowling and darts. Choose to start off a run with a specific bowling ball or dart set with their own unique playstyles. Upgrade your rolling or throwing techniques with rogue-like abilities. Add cool interactions between the bowling pins or the way darts are scored. If there are any hidden games like these please inform me as I would love to check them out. 

Additionally I was thinking that maybe the rogue-like genre could be a good way to reintroduce the old-school arcady street sports games from the 2000s. The industry has pivoted away from them for whatever reason but maybe put it under the umbrella of the popular rogue-like genre and we could get a spiritual successor to those nostalgic games.

I feel a few weeks ago, Palworld's popularity was steadily dying and that the initial hype was more 'trend' than substance (not that Palworld is a bad game, but that the launch hype was something that they likely would never get close to replicating again).

But now after the lawsuit, at least in my head, I feel like Palworld as a franchise has gone from 'indie one hit wonder' to something more meaningful and long-standing. It feels like the fight against Nintendo makes Palworld even that much more legitimate of a gaming universe going forward... The full release of Palworld is going to go viral again merely off of all the new lawsuit drama lol

Very interested to see how everything plays out going forward, but seeing Nintendo's legal bullying coming back to bite them would be quite the irony ",beatinbunz247,1hdj5d1,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdj5d1/the_irony_of_nintendos_palworld_lawsuit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdj5d1/the_irony_of_nintendos_palworld_lawsuit/,2024-12-13 18:44:47,0,0.41,0,0,43,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdj5d1
gaming,Why are people calling the Intergalactic premise/aesthetic unoriginal?  What about Uncharted and the Last of Us was original to you?,"
I know it’s cool to hate on Naughty Dog at the moment but to try and bash this trailer by calling the premise unoriginal is hilarious to me.  

Uncharted and The Last of Us are both phenomenal franchises but they both HEAVILY borrow themes and aesthetics from existing media, and that’s part of their charm.  Naughty Dog do not make experimental, avant-garde games.  They design games in environments we’re familiar with from films, literature and other video games and they do it better than anyone else - that’s precisely the reason they’re so popular.

The only reason this is now suddenly an issue is unfortunately obvious following the discourse surrounding Naughty Dog lately but it’s so frustrating because all I want to do is engage in a positive discussion over what is a really fucking impressive trailer. 

The technical achievements alone in that trailer are absolutely outstanding.  The animation, the voice work, the fucking AWESOME original soundtrack.  That’s what we should be discussing here surely, and I hate that some people are writing off a trailer like that because of pre-determined personal bias.",Finellaclark,1hdlxh4,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,2024-12-13 20:49:00,0,0.45,0,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdlxh4

gaming,The industry’s AAA revenue problem,"After the very real issue of layoffs and the sometimes toxic revenue model of the industry was brought to the forefront at The Game Awards last night I thought I would create a post to have a constructive discussion on the state of the industry if we can (please try).
The industry has a genuine problem.   The cost of what we consider AAA or even AA game development is at an all time high.   The old model of just selling a game for $70 and hoping to sell enough copies to make money doesn’t work anymore.  If this model was retained, the baseline price tag of most games should really be $120 for example…but consumers don’t want that. Companies are mandating either micro transactions, live-service, etc as a way to even just stay in business let alone profitable.  Gamers generally don’t want that either…but it has worked. There’s nothing wrong with profit; it often helps funds next projects.   No one is staying in this business if they are not making profit. We have seen how many companies have gone out of business even when gaming switched from SD to HD graphics with the 360 era.   Companies are less likely to take risks on new IP because they don’t want to lose money.  We have seen larger companies like Microsoft make massive acquisitions of several smaller studios and have said it’s bad for the industry; but how many of those companies would have eventually gone the way of Midway and just gone out of business eventually.   If you’re still reading this; thank you…just wanted to put some thoughts out there to have some focused discussions…not rants, discussions hopefully.

gaming,"Has there ever been a game recommendation website that behaves similar to how social media sites recommend friends based on ""mutual friends"", where it will recommend games based on ""mutual games"", however the games are reverse-weighted?","Specifically, I was thinking of a sort of unique algorithm, where it would weight games based on reverse-popularity (or at least a toggle feature for it).

So, a game like Super Mario World on SNES, or Sonic on Sega Genesis would have a very low weight, due to it's popularity (measured by how many others have the game favorited).

Whereas, a game like Gain Ground on Sega Genesis, or Xardion on SNES would have a very low weigh, due to their popularity, and the fact that me and 3 other people have played them.

My thinking is, say I had 100 of variety of games ""favorited"". Of those, if I have 20 niche games, and it pairs me up with someone who also has some of those games in their list, it would stand to reason, we have a very similar taste in games (with the other lower-weighted games help support it), and should have a very high likelyhood of enjoying what other games the other person has favorited that we are unaware of.

The website can also offer suggestions independent of other users, by stack ranking your list against the popularity of other titles, using the same algorithm.

gaming,Game narrative idea,"This is just a loose overview not a beat by beat. 

1. Player is working for a mentor performing assignments. To keep it simple let's say getting to and destroying guarded broadcast towers which are (they are told) being used to subjugate villagers. 


2. As they are partway through completing one of these quests, something gets their attention about this being not quite as believed. Further investigation unveils that these are _not_ subjugating people but form a defence network. 

The player, instead of helping people, is endangering them. The guards are also villagers protecting their defences. In fact the very mentor who directed them is a villain.

3. Although they don't have direct interaction with the mentor until the end, the enemies along the way work for the mentor. 

The player now desires to undo the damage they have done but, unsurprisingly, the villagers don't trust them so that's an additional hurdle. The player killed their friends and neighbours so at best they will get a begrudging compliance. 

4. The final boss is the former mentor (yes, this has been done before such as in Assassin's Creed 1) who has gained power in the background after the player helped them. The player does not want to fight and maybe kill the mentor but is left with no alternative. 

Thoughts? Yes I'm sure this has been done before. ",TwinSong,1hd15b5,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hd15b5/game_narrative_idea/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hd15b5/game_narrative_idea/,2024-12-13 01:36:42,0,0.43,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hd15b5

gaming,A reveal: I'm so ready for this eventuality,"Theres a microchip floating through space.  Something happened to it, but what?  

You hear a voice, Stephen Fry's voice actually:

""Oh, what do we have here?  You seem to have had a very, very, bad day.  I know just the ...thing... that might - just - help.  Ah!  And here it is now.""

A spaceship is heard arriving off screen and a glowing blue cord with a little circle at the end flows out of it after a pop.  The string grabs the Microchip and pulls it towards the still off-screen ship.  Slowly, the ship is revealed and with it a familiar silhouette pulling the cord.  It's SACKBOY!

""Its been awhile, Sack-Thing,"" Stephen Frys voice says again.  \*Sackboy begins waving his arms around and nearly (and iconically) slaps the Micro-Chip back out into space\* ""Yes, Yes, its great to see you too but be careful!  We'll reminisce later, first things first little sack-thing, can you Imagine any way to help this other-thing, whatever it is?""  

Sackboy thinks for a moment before jumping up in excitement and opening up his pop-it and creates a Sackbot from thin air.  Using his Pop-It-Cursor, he opens the Sackbots Microchip Brain and places the mysterious space microchip inside it.

Immediately, a pair of round blue eyes pop up on the Sackbots previously empty wooden face, with some glitching.  No other features appear.

""Ah yes!  Wonderful idea!  Hello new friend, can you hear me?""  The Sackbot jumps in surprise at the narrative voice, but nods a yes.

""Can you tell us what happened to you?""  The Sackbot thinks and shakes its head, ""no"".  

""No? Well, then perhaps we should just start, with your name, can you tell us that?""

The Sackbot thinks again, narrowing its solid blue eyes and says, with a question,

""I...am...Astro-Bot?""

gaming,Idea: Ranking games by their devs,"This is an idea I've had for a month or two now, and I can't imagine I'm the first person to suggest something like this:

People want to be able to experience works of art made by artists they like.  But with video games, the art in question is being developed by potentially hundreds or thousands of people, and it's harder to ascribe authorship to any one person.  Yes, AAA gaming still has the rare Hideo Kojima or Sam Lake, but it's more common for people to follow game companies- which is fine in the short term, but once enough developers leave or get laid off, it turns into the Studio of Theseus.  And all the while, the big publishers want us to focus on the franchise itself rather than the people behind it.

So what if you could keep track of all the individual game devs from project to project?  My idea here is a website that would keep track of games and their devs, and be able to compare them based on how many devs are shared.  So for instance you'd be able to select Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, and find out that they shared (wild guess) 85% of the same devs.  The most obvious challenge is how much weight you give to certain devs, since a game's director is probably more responsible for its vision then, say, a guy who modelled some of the enemy bicycles.  I know basically nothing about how responsibility is divided up within a studio, but just for example you could have the director given 25% of the credit, the department heads another 25%, and the remainder split among everyone else.

I feel like a lot of people would have the same kinds of problems with this that they do with systems like RottenTomatoes, but respect for artistic vision in AAA gaming is in such dire straits, I'd think any version of this would be an improvement.",MiloHawkins,1hcn5np,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,2024-12-12 15:10:54,0,0.38,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcn5np

gaming,My thoughts on TGA Nominees having now played them,"I finally played all of the TGA GOTY nominees thanks to Black Friday deals and I wanted to share my thoughts as award season approaches 

Balatro (9/10)

This game is a masterclass in deceptively simple design and It’s astonishing how easy to lose hours to its “one more run” hook. 

If you’ve avoided it because you think it’s “just poker” or “just a card game,” you’re seriously missing out and doing yourself a disservice. It’s a deeply engaging experience that I think you should try if you haven’t 

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (9/10)

While there’s some debate about its eligibility, for me personally there’s no denying that SOTE delivered one of the absolute best gaming experiences of the year. 

This expansion earns a spot on my Mount Rushmore of DLCs, right alongside Blood and Wine, Shivering Isles, and Phantom Liberty.

Astro Bot (9.5/10)

This. Game. Fucks.

As a fan of classic Nintendo 3D platformers, this felt like a love letter to the genre with a modern twist. 

My only complaint with the game is that I just wanted more of it at the end of the short run time to a platinum trophy. 

The final challenge run and the themed X, Square, Circle, and Triangle levels were brilliant and I’d kill for more levels of that difficulty and quality

If this game was just an appetizer, I can’t wait to see what Team Asobi has in store for the main course. If not for my ultimate favorite this year, this would have been my pick for GOTY.

Black Myth: Wukong (7.5-8/10)

While I enjoyed my three playthroughs of BM: W, I don’t think it quite reaches the same level as the other nominees. 

That said, for the developers’ first big swing, this is a fucking crazy impressive showing. I’m excited to see where they go next as this was an incredibly solid starting point and a downright great game in its own right 

Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (8.5/10)

As a huge fan of the original FF VII, the remake series has been a delight for me. 

The visuals are stunning, and it’s fucking sweet seeing the locations I remember in full 3D recreations. 

However for me it ultimately suffers from some modern open-world fatigue (developers seriously need to retire map towers and their equivalents lmao) 

Despite that, it’s a standout gaming experience, and I can’t wait for Part 3.

Metaphor: ReFantazio (9.5/10)

Jesus Christ, this game.

The characters, world-building, and narrative are utterly fantastic. 

At 40 hours in, it’s easily my GOTY—though, of course, a poorly executed ending could change that. 

My only (minor) gripe is that the soundtrack, while great, doesn’t quite hit Persona levels of perfection.

Final Rankings:
1.	Metaphor: ReFantazio
2.	Astro Bot
3.	Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
4.	Balatro
5.	Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
6.	Black Myth: Wukong

You can judge the quality of my insight by what is announced tonight, so I raise a can of Red Bull to any of you who are staying up late to watch it!

For everyone that’s not though, we’ll have coverage all through the night (or at least from after 4 am, when it ends) and continuing into the morning. 

Whether this is a milestone in the current generation of consoles or just another wet squib, I hope everyone gets at least a couple of announcements to interest them and that The Game Awards 2024 sets us up for a more optimistic 2025!

**Hi, I’m David from GameCentral and I’m part of the Metro judging panel for The Game Awards, one of many contributing to the nominations and winner ballot for this year’s event.**

I’ve been leading Metro’s video games coverage for over a decade now and can discuss every element of the games industry as long as it doesn’t involve sports or driving a car in a straight line!

GameCentral has been contributing to The Game Awards for several years now and, unlike almost everything else about the games industry, it doesn’t tend to have that many leaks about its reveals. There are some [official confirmations already though, and a lot of unsubstantiated rumours, so it’s going to be fun to speculate on](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/11/game-awards-2024-predictions-gta-6-split-fiction-rumours-22170224/) what could be the most important night of the year for gaming...

I can’t tell you who we voted for at The Game Awards, and it would be undiplomatic for me to talk about who might win, but if you want to **Ask Me Anything else about the event -** [**in particular what I hope and expect in terms of new trailers and announcements**](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/12/half-life-3-rumoured-one-game-awards-2024-megaton-announcements-22173667/) \- you can tune into our AMA on Thursday 12th December at 5 pm GMT.
