Like him snatching the box of swag like it's nothing, the whole weirdly inserted psycho-analyst that seemed way too important (like it was supposed to be the chick who ran that weird organization from Glass), tanking like 3 stun guns, and him escaping at the end.

movies,"I have a soft spot for ""Die Hard 2"" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three ""Die Hard"" entries.","There's no way, of course, that ""2"" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by ""Vengeance"" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.

But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.

I'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest ""Die Hard"" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",Mst3Kgf,1hetrq0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,2024-12-15 14:33:34,73,0.86,73,0,75,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hetrq0

I fell in love with this movie around 2018 when I finally got around to it and it’s become one of my top movies to watch.

I’ve realized why I love it so much and find it so comforting. The father and son relationship reminds me so much of my husband and his dad. They have a wonderful relationship of friendship, respect, playfulness and love. Whenever my husband is out of town and I’m missing him, I watch this movie and I’ve only just realized it’s because it reminds me of him in a way. 

We have 2 daughters and while he won’t have the son and father relationship, I know he will have the same silly and playful relationship with them rooted in love.

movies,I just finished watching all the Rocky movies ,"Holy shit man. These are some of the greatest movies I ever watched. 

The first movie is good, but it is pretty boring I can’t lie. It doesn’t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight. But man, something about that fight made it all worth it. I can’t describe it, just watching that iconic montage and fight made it feel like I didn’t waste my time. 

From there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn’t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I’m glad they gave Rocky’s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.

William Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.

https://preview.redd.it/9eglkeoplq6e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb95dfb6da04b33733c5019ea3b5560fbd7cafb



But much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the  sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207

Characters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.

It is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.

And it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it. And Freeman is as reliable as ever as the soft spoken Ned.",LoneWolfIndia,1hduhu8,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,2024-12-14 03:59:59,2391,0.92,2391,0,212,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hduhu8

movies,With AI restorations on the rise in recent years I am becoming worried about the future of movie preservation.,"I will preface this post with something positive before I discuss my concerns. The truth is that as long as there are fans of art there will be people who will properly preserve it. If you want a movie in a particular form/ cut, with the original theatrical audio mix, with every special feature ever released for that movie, and in the best/ least compressed presentation possible then there are many places online where you can access it. This post isn't referring to crazy people like me that will seek out that material. This post is aimed at people that I refer to as “casuals” or the people that aren't as crazy as me about this sort of stuff. The people that just want to watch a movie with the click of a button rather than buying a physical disc or searching for an obscure torrent. 



I want to start my concerns about this phenomenon by stating that I am not a gloomy type of person. I see some of the benefits of AI technology when it comes to movie restorations, but my perspective changed after December 12th, 2024. That day I went with a friend to see a one night only screening of Interstella 5555 (2003). That presentation of the movie is the worst my friend and I have ever seen, which is saying something because that movie is cursed with sub par home media releases. The version that my friend and I saw that day was AI upscaled. It ruined all of the details in the image. Every shot in the movie looked like someone rubbed Vaseline on random parts of the screen. It was pretty much unwatchable. (Here are some examples of what my friend and I saw that night: [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1gfqxge/interstella_ai_remaster/), [Example #2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b_sL6bSRhWw), [Example #3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pX_Ss4BrepE)).



I knew this sort of stuff had happened before like with the recent Blu-ray release of [I Love Lucy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdhJMOTPVw) and the [4Ks that James Cameron has released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxOqWYytypg&amp;pp=ygUXamFtZXMgY2FtZXJvbiA0ayBpc3N1ZXM%3D), however the difference with those is that most of them (except The Abyss) have some other decent release while Interstella 5555 is stuck with a sub par DVD and Blu-ray releases.



Then there is the issue of movies staying in circulation. If this version of Interstella 5555 is the only one available on streaming or a new Blu-ray release then what will “casuals” who have never watched this movie think. Will they think that the movie shouldn't look like that or will they think that the movie is supposed to look like a Vaseline smeared mess?



AI is a very helpful technology for movie restoration but it has become very obvious to me that studios are not using this technology properly and are getting extremely lazy with it. I will put it to you this way, you use a hammer to strike nails and you use a wrench to screw bolts. You can use a wrench to strike nails and you can use a hammer to screw bolts but the tools will do those tasks horribly if used in this manner. Use the right tool for the job and everything will be fine. After that night, I realized that these studios aren't doing that for whatever reason and that it is up to us to keep the art that we love alive.

Kind of an interesting movie just to watch with your bro but holy shit. If you don’t at least get choked up at this movie, what is wrong with you.

To some degree it’s almost gratuitously sad, like manipulatively sad. It hits you from every potential angle, poking and prodding until it finds the thing that hits you hardest and then it just hammers it over and over and over. Every moment of levity (of which there are many, it’s actually a pretty funny movie!) serving only to crush you even harder later on.

And the ending, so bittersweet. Nobody gets “fixed”, Lee doesn’t stop drinking, it’s just the most minor of victories wherein these two troubled people resolve to spend more time together. But still so sweet, so nice, such a small but warm light at the end of the tunnel.

movies,logistics in get out ,"to start out this is not a complaint post or me trying to get some super clear logic from a fictional movie. there's no way of knowing the answer to my question but I'm curious about others thoughts 

what do folks think that the people who stole black peoples bodies in get out generally did after they had their new body? do we think the community/cult who was in on this had rules on what you did afterwards? clearly they would have to be pronounced as dead otherwise they'd be missing and being white (and wealthy) there would have actually been serious efforts made to find them.

then there's the fact that they'd be seen as black by those who were outwith the group and would therefore have people treat them differently. my theory was that they saw this as an opportunity to sort of retire from society sort of how rose's grandparents were living with their family and posing as staff in the house when others were visiting. I know some people will think it illogical that they'd want to be in black bodies due to the racism in society but personally I think the types of people that were doing this probably held a respectability politics sort of mindset where they'd assume that because they'd act 'proper' they would be fine.

i also wonder if the people in the sunken place could communicate with the person piloting their body

movies,What Horror Movie Sub-Genres you’re not a Fan of and Why?,"Horror Movie Sub-Genres I’m not a Fan of and Why are:

Found Footage - Because of the shaky camera and a completely saturated market.

Just way too many low-effort movies in this genre. Similar plots, shakey cameras that doesn't really add anything (except in good ones), and such. The (sub)genre is just filled with too much of garbage, while it's still possible to find a gem

Body Horror 

Demon Possession - Because it’s the exact same movie. And I think a lot of them forget what's actually scary about the idea of demonic possession, which is the thought of not being able to control your own body and the threat of damnation, not just weird contortions and little girls shouting blasphemy with the voice of several grown men.

It's just getting overdone now with little to no innovation in the subgenre. Every single one pretty much feels the same and has a very similar story to tell. 

It always feels predictable, and the religious allusions made in the film are just annoying. It's one of the few horror sub-genres that I can't take seriously.

Initial encounter. Slow build up of strange behavior. Eventual blow up. Speaking in tongues and obscene language unusual for that person. Gets tied down in exorcism. Holy water. Screaming, writhing and contorting. Faith breaks through at the last minute and they're saved! Rinse, repeat. The possessed person always acts the same and the arc of the struggle always feels the same.

Home Invasion - Because a character usually has to do something beyond stupid to let the home invasion happen or they have the upper hand over the invader and don't kill them off until it's too late.",Amber_Flowers_133,1heuh6m,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,2024-12-15 15:09:25,0,0.31,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heuh6m

It just doesn't make sense that a major company can be THAT out of touch with its audience that they keep releasing flop after flop. Other than intentionally releasing bad products that will dilute audience attention. 

Disney has also done this to themselves by accident, with the Star  Wars franchise - released too many sub-par products that devalued the brand (although this seemed to be an overreach from Disney) - Disney publicly identified this and promised slow releases after audience fatigue. 

I know I've seen this done in other industries - Coke did this to derail Pepsi's momentum with Pepsi Crystal, they intentionally flooded the market with poorly made knockoffs to kill the interest.

However, I've noticed something when others are taking inspirations from the said film. John McLane is basically a normal cop who is just trying to fix his marriage to his wife who is working in the building that he came in. When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beats some of the bad guys, but he's hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he's gonna die but he's afraid of it).

movies,Educating Rita is the most beautiful film about self-determination and friendship,"So Educating Rita (1983) sees Blood Brothers author Willy Russel's updated take on the classic George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. He really subverts the narrative into something special and important. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are just phenomenal and arguably at their very best, as the middle class professor and his working class student, who also works as a hairdresser, in the 1980s. He is teaching her how to pass a literary course, with the narrative building up towards that final exam.

The three key themes I identified were self-determination, friendship, and social class dynamics. 

Now, Pygmalion is the classic tale of a working-class woman being educated and transformed into a member of upper class society by a wise professor.

The ending is quite dark, and it makes a point of how Eliza Doolittle feels she has lost her identity and it's exceedingly bleak. This was famously changed into a happy ending for the wonderful and far more famous musical My Fair Lady. Both have their charms , but I'll take the politically charged Pygmalion any day.

Now, what I love about Pygmalion is Russel kind of flips the roles on a psychological level. Caine's professor character Frank is far more vulnerable than hard-nosed Rita. He struggles with alcohol addiction and Rita's transformation kind of breaks him. He can't stand losing her, what she was (his pet project), as he's so unhappy in his life, otherwise.

Throughout the movie we see Rita taking more control over her life and doing what she wants instead of what society expects of her. She ditches the oppresive husband who wants a baby and breaks out of her shell to become a popular and highly regarded student at the university. She smashes the exam and gets a distinction. 

In an absolute Tour de Force of a monologue, Rita explains why she decided to carry on down that path. She explains that she had 'a choice' and made it, after considering it. She then talks about all the potential she has now the exam is over and how she can choose to do pretty much anything she likes and doesn't feel held back like before. A complete 180 from the Rita we saw at the start.

In both characters, Russel is exploring the idea of self-determination. Frank makes every wrong decision and falls apart as the film progresses. And Rita seems to make every right one.

Through this journey, we also explore their friendship amid the backdrop of the middle and working class dynamics in 1980s Liverpool (you couldn't pick a better time or setting to explore this). 

Throughout the movie, you get a whiff of palpable romance but I think that's just because Walters and Caine's chemistry is just so good. At the very end, the characters look like they may kiss as they're about to embrace to say goodbye, but no, thankfully they give eachother a nice big hug.

Frank takes a bold new step and transforms his life by jetting off to Australia. 

Then, in the final shot, Rita is walking off down the corridor. In an earlier scene, Frank implored Rita to come with him. Rita turns and looks back, you can tell she's thinking about going. But then she decides to carry on striding forward to make her own way in life.

movies,Get out,"I’m rewatching get out. Jesus. I know we’ve decided already that this movie set the bar too high, which is part of the reason some people feel Jordan’s subsequent movies don’t hold up. But rewatching it only for the second time makes me cold. 
The story presented touches on a topic in racism that always bothered me. The coveting and use of the strengths and abilities black people possess while simultaneously looking at them at no more human than those we aren’t. It’s trippy as fuck to think that they’d believe their mindset in the body of what they believe to be superior genetically would make a better person. It literally speaks to the inability to see the value in our consciousness and that disturbssss me. Roses grandfather losing to Jessie Owens. People at the auction describing how they used to be. The abilities they used to have and comparing them to his. Ugh. 
Roses obsessive need to be on Chris’s side whenever he felt uncomfortable by the weird shit was triggering. Using it as a method to hide his identity and lure him into that false sense of security that he never even really felt was crazy. I never felt more anxious than watching her bring him back into the house once the auction was over. 
And let’s talk about that fucking auction. I think what bothers me most is how sealed Chris fate is at that point . What appears like ignorance to Chris is really also lack of need to hide their true intentions. The way rose brings him around the event to introduce him to everyone , most auctions people move through. Seeing Chris being dragged from group to group, touched and questioned was disturbing to say the least . 
When Chris is having the procedure explained to him I could cry. The sunken place in its entirety is the opposite of what I fear in death. Which is the lack of consciousness. I can’t imagine playing back seat in your own body. I’m not sure how comparative to a vegetative state it is but the trauma in being moved and speaking without your own permission had to be greater than one can imagine. Seeing the color return to the eyes of Andre supports this. While I wish he managed more words lmao it took the rewatch for me to realize he has been essentially raped and used all 
with his knowledge and had no ability to stop it. 
  Rose having a real bedroom with the photos of the people she kidnapped was a choice. I can’t decide  if I appreciated the change in her character upon the reveal but I can say it was entertaining ? The conversation between she and rod and the fact that she had been Chris’s biggest ally during this ordeal. How she went from I love you to smiling during what was supposed to be her death. 
 One thing that always confused me was grandpas  ability to rationalize coming out of the sunken place quick enough to shoot rose and know there’s no way to prevent going back and kill himself. Also rose’s stupidity in not realizing the flash would take grandpa out the sunken place as it had done to Logan hours before. Handing over her gun was .. a choice 😭. Overall I really loved the movie. It was as entertaining as heartbreaking and moving &amp; thought provoking. I choose to believe since the other ending wasn’t the Final Cut it just doesn’t exist.

movies,Smile 2 (2024) My expectations where tripled what I expected! What did you think of the film?  ,"WARNING! Naturally, spoilers. If you haven't seen the film, do not proceed. 



&gt;!Ever since the first film, I jumped on reddit almost as fast as did with the sequel now, giving it heavy praise. I was shocked a good portion thought it was kind of laughable. The scares are important sure, but what Smile 2 provides is just unsettling anxiety. Thankfully the ammount of jump scares were JUST enough but not too much, which I admit the first film might of had just a little too much of. For example, when Skye (Naomi Scott) looked in her closet there was a dozen of people she knew smiling at her. I thought ""ok any moment they will rush and the movie goes on"" They rushed alright. But they just got closer. The scene which was less than a minute felt like a eternity. I was so uncomfortable (in a good movie way) I was just thinking common man what what WHATS gonna happen"". Then they get even closer but stacked on top each other. Honestly that made me smile in real life and giggle for a slight moment. The acting in this movie is superb. Naomi Scott was brilliant. I couldn't help thinking how hard it must of been to act it all out, but she brilliantly executed her performance. She made it feel so realistic. There was two jaw dropping (and i mean literally) moments in the film where i stood still silent in awe. The very beginning when Joel got hit by the car in the beginning. But better yet, the f&amp;$%ing ending!

movies,"Depictions that were considered historically or scientifically accurate at the time, but not anymore due to later discoveries","Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.

For example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the Titanic sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the James Cameron movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.

The public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of Jurassic Park . The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.

movies,I honestly like the other Terminator films after T2 because the likeness of Judgement Day but in different formats is a part of the Terminator franchise.,"I am thinking that I am one of the few people here who acknowledges this but I feel that every Terminator film, even after the ones of T2, bring something new to the concept of Judgement Day.

Sure, every single one brings the same concept of T2 over and over again (Dark Fate does not have John but it is still the same concept with the new character) but I think that this is intentional.

Since the very beginning with T1, there has been the concept about the debate between free will and determinism where the Kyle Reese goes back in time to save Sarah but he impregnates her with John and the result is the photo that she gets in the future. 

Because of this, Judgement Day still happens but it was delayed.

The same goes for T2 with the concept of 'No Fate' which apparently shows the dilemma between free will and the determined future where the characters still are able to prevent Judgement Day but it is delayed until a new Terminator comes.

This eerily reminds of the game Bioschock Infinite which shows the concept of Infinite universes and the idea behind constants and variables which basically says that even though the timing of the event did not come, it will still come in different forms and it is still a constant - hence, the determined need to bring  Judgement Day.

So in a way, T3 is still the same like the previous films except Judgement Day still happened meaning that not even John could escape his fate.

In Genysis, I liked the idea of trying to blend a little bit of the butterfly effect where even though Judgement Day was prevented, Skynet took a new format and I liked the parallel where we have become so dependent on technology that we have become slaves to it.

So that concept of technology being a literal threat and a literal idea that is possible was a good concept.

Same goes for Dark Fate.
Sure, the writing could have been handled better instead of just killing John at the very beginning

But I think I understood the idea behind Legion because it is still Skynet but with a different name.

From my perspective, it was just another manner of the butterfly effect. Skynet still exists and will exist in the future but somehow, the butterfly effect makes it have a different name but the intention is still determined.

The only thing that I really did not like it how the Terminator that killed John somehow developed empathy towards humanity without the proper programming and has basically maintained a relationship for years without his family never questioning his literal existence.

I just do not understand when people criticise when they expect something different than T2 because from my understanding, T2 is bound to happen over and over again in different formats.

Or the fact that people want something different because the other films are indeed different but are still the same story with different details and chapters but still telling the same story overall.",sammyjamez,1heq335,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,2024-12-15 10:42:00,0,0.25,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heq335

Netflix is basically the old “straight to dvd“ but now it’s straight to streaming, which I guess makes sense given the climate of entertainment these days…. But most of the memorable movies for me have premiered in theaters or get a justified release…

movies,Actors you may not have realised were British,"I want to mention five British actors that I didn't know (at least, not consciously) were British when I first saw them onscreen. Please add your own!

1. Hugh Laurie

Not everyone grew up watching British film and television and saw Hugh Laurie in his earlier roles—and even then, depending on your generation, you may not have recognised him when he became popular in American media (I didn't, at least). If your first exposure was his role as Stuart Little's dad in the movie of the same name; or as House, MD in the popular hospital drama; you might be forgiven for thinking he was an American actor.

2. Gary Oldman

A man of many faces (and voices), Gary Oldman has been in so many blockbuster movies—and is often touted as an example of characters who looked familiar but you just couldn't quite put your finger on who was playing the part... From Zorg in The Fifth Element to Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman trilogy, it may have come as a shock to some people to see (and hear) him as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter franchise.

3. Gillian Anderson

I'm a huge X-files fan. In fact, for the last year or two I have been doing a\[nother\] rewatch! Growing up, I had no idea that Gillian Anderson was a British actor. She played the part of Dana Scully so well (in my opinion), I am sure many were hoodwinked into thinking she was another fantastic American television actor.

4. Henry Cavill

Before he played Geralt of Rivia, Henry Cavill showed up in all sorts of places; but his notable role was Clark Kent / Kal-El in the mid 2010s movie, Man of Steel. At the time, I had no idea he was British. Henry's a real nerd (self-proclaimed, like many of us), and I look forward to his upcoming involvement in Warhammer 40K. :)

5. Tom Holland

This man. He's becoming quite legendary. If you haven't seen The Crowded Room, I highly recommend that you check it out. Bursting onto the screen\* as Peter Parker in Captain America: Civil War (and then of course the Spiderman movies which followed), I would hazard a guess that many fans were oblivious to the fact that Tom's a Brit. He nailed the part of Nathan Drake in 2022's Uncharted.

\* Before anyone comments that ""bursting onto the screen"" implies an actor's debut, I am aware that Tom Holland played roles prior to Peter Parker. But it wasn't until then that by all accounts his popularity began taking hold. There's no arguing it was pretty bursty, right?

I sat down recently and started watching Guy Ritchie's Netflix show, The Gentlemen. If you haven't seen it, stop reading Reddit and go fire it up. It borders on hilarious, with all the Guy Ritchie grit and wit you would expect. Anyway, there is a ""businesswoman"" called Susie Glass (rhymes with arse, not ass). It took me a minute to figure out where I'd seen her before—except she didn't have a British accent. If you've seen the Maze Runner movie trilogy, you'll know what I'm talking about: Kaya played Teresa, a major part in all three films, and it was a real trip to realise that she's actually British.

I hope you enjoyed my breakdown of five (plus one bonus) British actors that when you first saw them you may not have realised they were not American.

movies,Top 5 superhero movies ,"

1. The dark knight Christian bale and heath ledger that’s all I got to say heath ledgers joker is the best villain in a movie I’ve ever seen hands down Christian bale also the best bat man won’t see anything like this anytime soon for sure 

2. Avengers infinity war/ end game tie too hard to pick this one end game is just an incredible rollercoaster with the craziest plots and to see all those characters with eachother is just genius. 

3. Spider man 2. Spider man 1 was great but I just feel like this is just the best spider man there is Tom Holland is great but you just can’t beat tobey maguire it takes every thing from spider man 1 and just improves it 

4. Iron man now this really exceeded my expectations it’s very realistic emotional and action packed and funny and you don’t see that combo in most super hero films.

5.  Spider man across the spider verse

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 4 - Wales,"Hello there,

this is the fourth (or third, depends on what status you grant Northern Ireland) time I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a country in the country called UK. After England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's now **Wales**' turn before the grand finale. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1he6u1d,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he6u1d/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he6u1d/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-14 16:43:32,1,0.54,1,0,16,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he6u1d

movies,Kubo and the Two Strings is an unbelievable achievement in filmmaking ,"Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika – the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can’t believe this movie is real. I’m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.

Stop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of “Chicken Run” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit” (which I love, btw) – we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that’s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo’s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)

Also stop motion characters are usually dressed in tight clothes and have steady hairdos to make them easier to animate – but in Kubo, they’re using kimonos and have long hair; plus, there are animal characters and one of them is a MONKEY with fur. That means the animators had to move the kimonos and each hair strand (or the fur, in the monkey’s case) individually for every frame. And they placed that monkey in the middle of a snowstorm!!! They had to manipulate every single piece of that fur 24 times to end up with a second of footage.

Kubo is a very touching and beautiful film too, and I recommend it for its storytelling appeal as well. But I’m mostly here to praise the achievement by itself. Seriously, I couldn’t believe my eyes.",miggovortensens,1hd4puo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,2024-12-13 04:49:39,737,0.93,737,0,63,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hd4puo

With the 10 year anniversary of Interstellar happening recently, a few friends and I decided to rewatch the movie and WHOLY COW did I forget how many Oscar and other award winners there are in the film.

For those who don't remember, here's the main cast of the film listed in order according to Wikipedia:

* Matthew McConaughey (Academy Award winner)
* Anne Hathaway (Academy Award winner)
* Jessica Chastain (Academy Award winner)
* John Lithgow (No Oscar but 6 Emmys, 2 Golden Globes, a BAFTA and 4 Grammys)
* Michael Caine (2 Academy Awards)
* Casey Affleck (Academy Award winner)
* Timothee Chalamet (Academy Award nominee, almost certainly will win one soon)

Matt Damon (Academy Award winner) also has a small part in the film. Essentially everyone who plays a major role in the film is an Oscar winner, can't remember the last time that happened in a modern film. Not to mention the movie is obviously directed by Christopher Nolan who is also an Oscar winner, just an unbelievable collection of talent.

I would love some recommendations for movies that come close to this.  Just smart writing, emotional tension, great character dynamics.

So I'm wondering if the critics may have been a little more kind had another actor played his part, and if the general movie going audience also thinks this a possibility. Even if youre a fan, you gotta admitt . . . he's pretty much taken over the 'family-friendly tough guy' role.

And I understand why, I was even into it at first, but now I'm just kinda bored.

movies,tom hanks ruined the soundtrack version of the polar express theme.,"one of my all time favorite christmas movies is 2004's the polar express. and given how this year marks the film's 20th anniversary, you better believe that i made sure to watch it this year.

one of my favorite parts of the movie is when the train arrives at the north pole. they made the very smart decision to have the polar express theme play at that part. it's a really good song with great lyrics and a fast pace that mirrors the fast pace of the titular train.

when you listen to the soundtrack on a CD or a vinyl or on Spotify or however you listen to it, the version of the song on the soundtrack is different. in the soundtrack version, they have tom hanks as the conductor randomly interjecting. and to me, this ruins the song.

for starters, as talented as he is, tom hanks cannot sing. or maybe he can. i don't really know because he isn't so much singing as he is sing talking. also, like i said, he randomly interjects and i feel that it ruins things.

i'm kind of having a hard time explaining it so listen to the theme on youtube and you'll hear what i mean.",herequeerandgreat,1he74f4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he74f4/tom_hanks_ruined_the_soundtrack_version_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he74f4/tom_hanks_ruined_the_soundtrack_version_of_the/,2024-12-14 16:57:23,0,0.36,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he74f4

movies,Are We Supposed to Believe the Actor Is the Character?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about acting and how we experience it as an audience. When I watch a movie, am I supposed to believe the person playing the part is the character they’re portraying? Or is it enough to just see the actor doing their job—sometimes really well—but never fully disappearing into the role?

Take Timothée Chalamet, for example. I haven’t seen his Bob Dylan portayal yet, but when I do, am I supposed to feel like I’m watching Bob Dylan? Or will it just be Timothée doing a solid impression of Dylan? Similarly, with Adam Driver, I really like the guy and his work, but I’m always aware it’s Adam Driver. Whether he’s yelling about the Rebellion in Star Wars or breaking down in Marriage Story, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s him delivering a great performance, not me being fully immersed in the world of the character. DDL became Daniel Plainview for example. I know I know DDL is like fucking insane but shit, he raises the bar. 

Shouldn’t great acting make me forget the actor entirely? Shouldn’t I feel transported—like I’m in a dark IMAX theater, alone, completely immersed in the story and the character? Or is that asking too much? Maybe it’s enough to just appreciate the craft, even if I never fully lose sight of the actor behind it.

I’d love to hear how others feel about this. Do you find yourself believing in the character, or are you always aware of the actor? Is there a specific performance where you did feel like the actor completely disappeared? Or is that level of immersion more about the movie as a whole than the acting itself?",spacepants1990,1he7zbp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,2024-12-14 17:37:33,0,0.18,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he7zbp

I am flying. I do that lots. I love movies. So some of what I see, it is en route. I have three questions.

First, is there any website or resource that compares the airplane cuts to theatrical releases?

movies,Best realistic fights in movies? Bonus points for martial arts focused films ,"I was recently watching the latest batch of Cobra Kai episodes and thought that this show has jumped the shark for some time now. Sure the original Karate Kid movies are over the top and cheesy as hell but the whole appeal of this series was that it brought it all down to Earth and made them feel almost believable, like they could have happened. But they couldn't help themselves from leaning into cheesy, overly choreographed movie karate/tae kwon do. 

That got me thinking, what are  some movies that have a lot of fighting in them that remain somewhat grounded? No over the top kung fu, no fake martial arts. Just technical fighting and good cinematography to sell it. I could think of some examples, like last year's ""The Killer"" which was sort of an anti John Wick film, with fight scenes without jumping around, no telegraphed swings, no spinning kicks or anything, just people mostly shoving/punching/grappling until someone wins. I couldn't however for the life of me think of a martial arts focused movie that manages to remain grounded somewhat.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 3 - Scotland,"Hello there,

I've really been on a Reddit journey through filmed Europe for quite a while now and yes, it makes me wistful that it's coming to an end... but it's going to get wild here at the end. I've arrived at U, and I have to say: Sorry, UK, but this concept of a country made up of several countries is just confusing and I'm in favour of any (non-violent) way to clean up this mess somehow.

But since I don't want it to become too political, I've come up with an idea: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will each have their own thread and at the end the overall UK winner will be chosen from the individual winners. England and Northern Ireland are now more or less through and today we are looking for movies set in **Scotland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hdfvxo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-13 16:22:45,2,0.54,2,0,55,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdfvxo

movies,Mother! As interesting a movie as I've ever seen. I thought it really showed of the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence. How did you view this movie?,"I went into Mother! knowing absolutely nothing about it other than it starred Jennifer Lawrence. I watched it cold. I thought to myself Jennifer Lawrence is everywhere on social media, TV interviews, Insta Reels, and of course movies.  I thought to myself I will know if it is a good movie or not base on whether or not I become absorbed in it and forget that it's Jlaw acting in it. Well about a tenth of the way through I realized she was completely absorbed by the role. And the weirder the movie got the more she, the actress, disappeared into it. At first, as things got more and more out of hand, I thought it could turn out to be a weird dark comedy. But things never stopped getting out of hand. Every time I thought it had gone too far, it went even further. It literally took me to the very end to figure out what was going on and even then I had missed a lot of the message. I can tell I liked it and it was a good movie because I'm still thinking about it. Man what a ride it was! I'm dying to hear other people's thoughts and reactions to this movie.

Edit: Interesting. This appears to be a movie one either loves or hates. Very little middle ground. The vast majority of movies are unable to generate this kind of response - creating such a divide. That says something. Most movies I watch are just diversions, forgotten about the next day like a finished comic strip. This one lingers, generating strong feelings one way or another. That seems to me one of the defining qualities of art. So, if nothing else this movie is art.

movies,The Most 80's 80's Movie,"Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. 

  
I figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. 

  
So, for example....

  
Back To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. 

  
Top Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks ""80s""

  
But Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there.

movies,"How much ""profit"" does a movie have to make to actually be profitable?","I've seen movies that made $30 million in ""profit"" against a budget of $150 million be considered a ""commercial flop"". 

I've read that a film's budget should be doubled to account for marketing costs, so that $100 million budget film that made $300 million actually resulted in a $100 million loss. 

That can't be a rule of thumb, right? I always figured the ""double for marketing"" only applied to the tentpoliest of tentpole movies. 

An example: A Series Of Unfortunate Events (2004) grossed $211 million on a budget of around $140 million. Going by the double for marketing rule, that's a horrendous box office failure. Even if you stake out a half for marketing rule for mid-level productions, the film barely broke even. 

But there was at one point in time a sequel in the works. I wouldn't think they'd entertain the idea of a sequel if the first one barely broke even at best or blew $150 million at worst. So the oft-stated double for marketing rule or half for marketing rule that I just made up couldn't possibly apply to this film, right?

It's not as if this film came out in the 2020s, when studios were trying to status-quo their way through the post-pandemic film industry shakeup. Duds were still duds in the early 2000s when this film came out. 

So how exactly does profit work in Hollywood? Not everyone can be Paranormal Activity or Avengers: Endgame, and we've all seen movies that made a couple milly in profit get 3 or 4 sequels. It's clear they made enough money from the first one to warrant sequel(s), so a multiple of the production budget for marketing is not a universal rule.",Danielnrg,1hdr76o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,2024-12-14 00:58:58,0,0.39,0,0,30,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdr76o

\- Gerard Butler's Big Nick eats a donut from a crime after his wife kicks him out.

\- The movie does a great job at highlighting how much the criminals have to lose if they fail (50 Cent's character especially).

\- The heist sequence mines tension out of the simplest moments, such as cops asking the criminals (who are posing as cops) for ID. It shows that bureaucratic procedures can be just as nail-biting as gunfights. 

\-Butler's character follows Pablo Schneider's to a gun range and they show off their shooting skills to each other. After Schneider shows up in Butler's apartment, smiles, and walks out. It's a fun way of showing that they're on to each other.

  \- It recreates the Heat diner scene but moves it to a BBQ joint, but instead of having cops and robbers have meaningful conversations about life, they just antagonize each other.

movies,No shortage of zombie films,"No hate intended, but I'm shocked there seems to be no end to the popularity of zombie films.

I think between now and the not-too-distant future there's at the least:  
  
\-Zombieland 3  
\-28 Years Later  
\-Walking Dead, Daryl Dixon  
\-The Last of Us Season 2 (Ok a little diff but similar)  
\-Planet of the Dead  
\-Revolt of the Dead  
\-Return of the Living Dead sequel

and I'm sure more I'm missing.

I've keep seeing in some Actress &amp; Actors' listing in IMDB, they have some short movies like 5-30mins.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-jc-chandor-1236083842/) (20/100):

&gt;Punishingly dull.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):

&gt;I’ve seen much worse comic-book movies than “Kraven the Hunter,” but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn’t stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That’s a dereliction of duty, but it’s one I didn’t commit on purpose. I simply hadn’t bothered to think about it.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):

&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don’t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, “Kraven the Hunter” might be very, very bad (and by “might be” I mean “almost objectively is”), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today’s audiences might consider as “good.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):

&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

&gt;Crowe’s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there’s not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it’s best that this misbegotten series quits while it’s just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

Not watching the trailer all I knew it's just some courtroom drama.

movies,Nickel Boys review,"Nickel Boys: 

Boy oh boy, where do I begin. They told RaMell Ross that he wouldn’t pull this off, that people wouldn’t adapt to the style. Well I’m here to tell you, they were dead wrong. Nickel Boys is creatively astounding. Movies that are so unique don’t come around often and this is unique with a capital U. 

The cinematography is the obvious place to start here. This is an experiment that passes with flying colors. Every frame will be burned into your brain that you’ll see them when you close your eyes. This camera work is like nothing I’ve seen ever seen before and it’s executed to sheer perfection. 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure detail and effort that pays off massively. Don’t take your eyes off the screen cause not a single frame can be missed. Nickel Boys is a vision of artistic excellence. 

Onto the acting. Credit to all the actors and actresses involved cause they were all in danger of being over shadowed by the creative choices made, but man oh man do they hold their own. Pure emotion on display. A gripping but grounded tale. 

RaMell Ross is cinema’s Einstein. Everything about Nickel Boys is innovative and inspired, a truly staggering cinematic achievement. I felt like I was witnessing cinema history… I’m not saying it’s for everyone and Nickel Boys is a movie that will inevitably divide audiences. That said I think this movie is generational, and you can say I’m taking the bait but I have never witnessed something on this scale before and I’m deeply elated with what I have seen.

This is my first post on here and this might be a case of recency bias, but I just watched my 100th movie of the year and it was my first watch of Sideways (2004).

I believe 2004 was a good year for movies, but when I went on IMDb, I was kind of shocked to find out that Paul Giamatti wasn’t even nominated for his role in the movie. 

But regarding Best Picture award, admittedly, it’s been a while since I’ve seen The Aviator, Finding Neverland, and Million Dollar Baby, (haven’t seen Ray yet)but between Sideways and Million Dollar Baby (the Oscar winner), what do you think is the better movie? And why?

movies,What are your thoughts on watchmen chapter 1 and 2 is it a perfect adaptation ,"The animated Watchmen chapters I and II are a true love letter to the original graphic novel, staying incredibly faithful to the source material. The visuals capture the gritty, noir-like atmosphere of the comic perfectly, and the animation brings the artwork to life in a way that feels close to the original. The pacing mirrors the comic’s episodic structure, and the dialogue stays true to the sharp, complex exchanges that define the characters.

While this faithfulness will undoubtedly resonate with long-time fans, it also raises an interesting question: is it too faithful? The adaptation feels almost like a direct retelling, which can leave little room for new interpretations or creative risks. For those familiar with the comic, it offers a nostalgic experience, but does it stand out as something more than just a faithful retelling? Could it have pushed boundaries or expanded on themes in a way that feels fresh? It nails the essence of Watchmen, but does something still feel missing?

For numerous reasons my wife and I rarely go see a movie at the theater. We’ve often wondered if studios might eventually release some movies for home viewing on the same day that they are released at the theaters. We’ve seen this happen before, but I don’t remember it happening with very many high profile movies. They could charge $50 or so and we would still be interested. I understand that they might be afraid of losing  revenue but there are people like myself that are not going to the theater who would be providing additional income. I also understand the desire and need to support movie theaters so I’m sure that would be a big consideration. I’m not suggesting they do it with every movie. Maybe just occasionally.

movies,Alternate ending to Turning Red ,"I used to love Turning Red but I don't anymore. When I washed it for the second time the flaws in it became a lot more visible:

If the concert was happening on the 25th instead of the 18th, how did May and her friends go so long thinking it was the 18th? Did they not double check? Do nobody tell them?

If they stopped being friends for a while, why did Miriam keep Mei's pet toy?

Why did they suddenly love Tyler if he was a 4*Townie? Just because he likes the same band as them doesn't mean he's a good person.

Keeping these flaws in mind, here is how I would have done it:

At the party, Mei and her friends (Miriam, Priya, and Abby) hear that 4*Town's Toronto concert has been cancelled. Mei attacks Tyler after he insults her family and doesn't stand up for her friends when her mother blames them for everything. The ritual goes off without a hitch and her red panda form is sealed away.

When Mei returns to school the following Monday, she is shunned by her former friends, who are still mad at her for throwing them under the bus. She is heartbroken until Tyler approaches her and apologizes for his past behaviour. Mei extends an offer of friendship, which he gladly accepts, and the film ends with the two walking happily into the sunset.

So I'm deciding which screen is best for Superman. (Superman is my favorite superhero and character so that's why I'm preparing so early) Superman is being shot on IMAX and will most likely have a bigger aspect ratio for the entire film or specific action scenes. 

I like ONYX because of the LED screen, better color, brighter, and higher resolution. Though I don't like that the cinema with the ONYX screen has in person waitress so they are just walking in front of you while the movie plays.

movies,2025 might be one of the most interesting years for mainstream cinema and maybe a new creative resurgence in filmmaking.,"The last 5 years honestly had been probably one of the roughest eras in mainstream cinema creatively and  as far as what was getting made and how they were being treated particularly as far as theatrically released or original mid budget movies goes.

And part of the fact was covid's impact towards the film industry and led up to the major studio's  misguided push towards streaming and the Netflix route of ""throwing whatever at the wall and seeing what sticks and not give a lot of marketing into while the execs and shareholders who greenlight these movies get all the nice fat checks  in the world. I think it's starting to die out a little bit though thankfully.

 Like guys remember 8-Bit Christmas on HBO max? or the Chip n Dale movie on Disney+? What about No One Will Save You on Hulu? that one movie that a lot of genre fans raved about the week it came out  only to feel like it was buried afterwards and used as filler for a streaming service? *crickets chirping*

But anyway that the majority of  theatrical mainstream movies and the  industry leaned towards a more toxically nostalgic shift  for reboots/remakes/rehashes of IP's from 10-50 years ago. Like Indiana Jones 5 with an 80-year old  Harrison Ford or the umpteenth reboot of The Exorcist  with a 90-year old Ellen Burstyn and a reboot of Twister of all things. 

But looking at next year, yeah there's going to be some movies that looked like it was approved for shareholders like reboots to Final Destination and I Know What You Did Last Summer, A reboot of the Jurassic Park reboot (Universal still hasn't learned i guess), and Hollywood taking a dump on Chris Sanders' legacy by making live action versions of his movies to make a quick buck for nostalgic manchildren. 

But there is some interesting mix or IP's and original stuff . And some of the original stuff are from directors like  Ryan Coogler, Koganada, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, James L Brooks, Joseph Kosinski, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Sure  the schedule could change and  are they going to be homeruns? Who knows but even then it starting to regain my confidence towards mainstream movies again and maybe it's going to start a new resurgence in getting more quirkier or high concept movies made again from the majors.",gearwest11,1hdjul2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,2024-12-13 19:15:10,0,0.29,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdjul2

Comparatively, the recent shit show of Joker Folie a Deux was made for $250m, 25x the budget of the Brutalist.

Where has the industry gone so wrong that $250m is blown on a horrific flop when we could get multiple smaller movies, that have every chance of being much better??

Edit: Yes, I understand that there’s no correlation between budget and quality, my point is that a hell of a lot more talented filmmakers would be able to take their shot if there were 25 smaller budget movies instead of a single giant budget flop.

movies,What over-30-year-old movie's quality have you come to appreciate greatly over most made in the last 30?,"I watched the original The Wizard of Oz the other day and hadn't seen it in a while, and, now that I'm much older, was just absolutely in awe at the acting, casting, production quality, set designs, script, camera work, the fact that it not only had color in a 1939 film, but the use of it was better than most movies (for example, a horse that changed colors, ruby red shoes, changing from B/W to color, yellow brick road, green witch, etc.), the fact that it was also a musical... and so on.  I was blown away that it *didn't* get best picture that year (it lost to Gone With The Wind, which I have not yet seen, but based on what I have seen of it, seems wild that it beat TWOO).  

It's no wonder it's a classic and can still be watched to this day and loved.  The true effort and creativity (originality) that went into it is almost unfathomable.  This is also considering the resources and technology (or lack thereof) they had at the time to make such a film.  I miss it as films today seem so low-effort, and are all effects and shock value (which isn't inherently a bad thing, but considering some of the best movies I've ever seen had little to none, it says a lot) with little substance and poorly put together.

movies,Dumbest decisions that unravelled entire movie plots? ,"The butterfly effect is an interesting concept when seen depicted on screen: the idea that a single seemingly insignificant decision can cause a ripple effect leading to a massive consequence. In film, a lot of the time this is usually what causes a downfall, especially in the crime genre. Also usually in the crime genre, it’s usually because of extraordinarily dumb decisions that spark a chain reaction. So what are some of the best examples of dumb decisions that led to an unraveling of a films plot? 

Though there’s a multitude of reasons that added up to cause its downfall, one of my favourites is Artie Piscano’s decision to keep a ledger of his travels to and from Las Vegas despite being specifically told not to. On the one hand it’s pointed out no one could have possibly known about the bug in the store that captured him loudly and recklessly announcing that he had the ledger, especially given that the bug wasn’t even there in relation to the skim, but on the other hand Artie was told very pointedly do not keep a ledger and he still did because the bosses knew what it’d cause if it was ever discovered. Sure enough, at the conclusion of the movie as well as the other points converging the ledger is the silver bullet the FBI needs to sink the whole thing.

movies,Why I'm Frustrated with the Coyote Vs. Acme Crowd,"It’s not just about the fact that Coyote Vs. Acme is likely lost forever—that’s frustrating, yes—but what really annoys me is how some people keep reacting to *The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* as if Warner Bros. is releasing it. They're complaining that *this* movie is coming to theaters while Coyote Vs. Acme isn’t, and it’s honestly infuriating.  

Let me break this down for you:  

1. **Warner Bros. is NOT releasing this movie.** It was sold to an indie distributor. If it hadn’t been bought, it might have suffered the same fate as Coyote Vs. Acme. Thanks to this sale, it’s now getting a theatrical release, but that’s not because of WB.  


2. **This is a traditionally animated Western film in theaters!** Let’s be real—these movies don’t usually do well at the box office. Judging by the marketing's view counts, it’s probably heading toward being a flop unless it gets serious support soon. Releasing the trailer on the same day as the Game Awards? Not the best move. But instead of helping this film succeed, some people are whining about Coyote Vs. Acme. You’re not helping.  


3. **This movie has had a rough journey.** It started as an HBO Max exclusive during the pandemic, set to eventually air on Cartoon Network. Then production was halted during the WB Discovery merger and David Zaslav’s infamous tax write-off spree. Only after being sold did work resume, and now it’s finally getting a theatrical release. It had its premiere during the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and was extremely positively received. It is also the first real original Looney Tunes movie on the big screen. It's not a short. It's not a collection of shorts. It's a full-length, fully animated movie with an original story.


So, to all those targeting this film: Stop complaining about how a movie you didn’t even know or care about didn’t get released for a second. Instead, show some support for a movie that actually *did* survive against all odds. This could’ve easily been lost media too.  


If you actually care about what’s happening at Warner Bros. Discovery—or even about movies like Coyote Vs. Acme—then PROVE IT. Support The Day the Earth Blew Up. This is your chance to send a message.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 2 - Northern Ireland,"Hello there,

I think an introduction to what I'm doing here is no longer necessary after such a long time, so I'd rather start with the fact that I would like to announce an earlier winner - a winner from a country that is very close to my heart, not least because of the current situation: At least according to your votes, ***Тіні забутих предків*** (engl.: *Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors*) is the favorite movie set in Ukraine. So just before the end, a film from the 60s lands [on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) once again.

When I realise that I won't be drawing your attention to this list so often anymore, I'm getting a little wistful. Even if the watchthrough is still to come, my Reddit journey through the filmed Europe is slowly coming to an end... But what an end it is! To be honest, the UK, a country made up of several countries, is actually giving me a bit of a headache. Yesterday we found the first contender for your favorite movie set in UK, when we took a look at movies set in England. But while in the case of England it is strange that it should be a country and at the same time part of a country, its status as a country is in the end comparatively undisputed... and by that I mean the comparison with **Northern Ireland**, which you can read about on Wikipedia after all:

&gt;**Northern Ireland** (Irish: *Tuaisceart Éireann* \[ˈt̪ˠuəʃcəɾˠt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ\] Ulster Scots: *Norlin Airlann*) is a part of the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland that is variously described as a country, province or region.

As an outsider, I just want to shout out: ‘Jeez, finally decide on something!' But to keep the peace and because I'm going to declare a UK winner at the end anyway, I'll leave it that way. But I'll also keep to the usual rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,The Wackness (2008) nails the 90s New York atmosphere. ,"If you don't know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it's worth the hour and 40 minutes.
 

First of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography.  The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. 

Most of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my view you could see Dr Squires trying to help Luke so he doesn't become him. I think the movie shows that if Luke is in the same direction he is in he will end up like Squires. Honesty Luke and Squires have the best chemistry and scenes together. And the way they written Squires wife relationship and Luke and Stephanie relationship is great.
 
It also has a great soundtrack. If you love 90s hiphop the film and actually fits in with the movie well. 

And the movie has great commentery. The movie portrays 90s New York problems well with Rudy Giuliani drug war aganist weed as a supporting part of the story. 


The only problem i have is Josh Pecks acting. I think this is one of those rare times where a character is written well but the actor isn't great. Josh Peck does more better in comedic roles and his acting isn't good in this film. I don't know how you describe it but Josh Peck has trouble portraying a pot head in this story. 


Anyway I love this film, The cinematography is great, the music is great, the writing is good, and despite Josh Pecks performance, I think everyone else did a good job.

movies,If you had to say... who is the greatest actor of all time and why?,"I have watched thousands upon thousands of movies in my years. All genres of all decades. I've thought about this a lot, and I'll give my answer from a position of being a self-proclaimed ""movie connoisseur"".

There's hundreds of amazing actors that have done incredible works, but when it comes to picking a ""best"" I had to do a lot of sifting and made some very difficult choices of dropping the top players.

I won't give this accolade to anyone purely based on their merits or personal successes in the film industry. I don't how care how big their award closet is or how many top-grossing films they starred in. Although awards correlate with great acting, they are in no way indicative of who the greatest actor is in my humble opinion. 

There's good actors, great actors, and incredible ones. Then there's actors that seem to transcend acting in a movie and literally become the characters (and I'm not just talking about method acting). I'm talking about actors that have you convinced you're not watching a script come to life, but instead your watching someone's life.

I believe it is a toss up between these 2. My first pick is Daniel Day Lewis. When I watched him in The Phantom Thread, I was convinced he must be playing himself because there's no way thats an actor pretending to be someone else. Then I saw him in Gangs Of New York and ofcourse my favorite movie, There Will Be Blood. Completely different characters and each felt like they  were played by different actors. Given his reputation I'm sure it's no surprise to many that hes a contender to be one of if not the best actor ever and he deserves that recognition.

The second I'm sure will be very controversial to many, especially given the hundreds of names of big actors. I'm sorry, but it has to be Robin Williams. Yes, I said Robin Williams.

If you've ever seen one of his movies (or if you haven't seen one in a long time), I can assure you that you'll see what I mean and where I'm coming from. Every movie Robin is in feels like someone just bought a camera and filmed his life for a while.

Nothing felt acted, every word feels lived. Every action is heart-felt.
Look into his eyes as he speaks. It's almost impossible to believe that he wasn't that character, and wasn't living in that scenario.

movies,Watching Dead Man (1995) and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) back-to-back is a unique experience,"*Dead Man* is an acid western in which a wounded accountant named William Blake teams up with a strange Native American man named Nobody, who happens to be a fan of the artist William Blake and believes the accountant is a vengeful reincarnation of the more famous Blake. The movie plays with western tropes, but it is mostly a somber meditation on death.

*Ghost Dog* is more modern and less bizarre, but it explores many of the same themes and features a similarly heightened reality in which a masterful modern assassin takes strong influence from the Hagakure as he works for (and then against) a bunch of old wiseguys.

They're both unconventional independent action-thrillers by Jim Jarmusch. Both feature a protagonist who acts as a personification of death, often effortlessly killing various stereotypes (cowboys, gangsters). Both films are very philosophical and artistic, but in different ways.

In addition to death and philosophy, the two films are also quite amusing. Jarmusch's dry sense of humor contrasts well with the dark plots full of murder. I like that there's nothing flashy about either movie's world. Dead Man makes the old west feel like a dirty and miserable playground for deranged weirdos, and in Ghost Dog the modern city run by gangsters looks totally mundane and unglamorous, an environment plagued by elderly has-been punks with guns.

The subdued reality of the world and its villains allows the heightened reality of the heroes to shine. There's nothing really superhuman about Blake or Ghost Dog, but the way they intensely associate themselves with death and the fatalism that breeds puts them on another level than the basic bad guys they do battle with.

movies,Sing Sing review ,"Sing Sing: 

Now that’s how you make a movie. A completely grounded script that makes you feel emotions on such a deep level that didn’t know was possible from a movie. You can feel the tension in scenes like watching a caged tiger pace up and down staring at you. 

Colman Domingo puts in the performance of a century. The subtleness of his actions, to his breaking point in the movie. He goes to lengths that are completely elegant and alluring. His character work here is truly groundbreaking, like I said when his character reaches that breaking point you feel it all, everything his character is feeling you feel so powerfully. Clarence Maclin does supporting acting and then some. He makes you feel uneasy with the way he walks and his facial expressions but you always feel there’s something underneath the hard exterior. A perfect portrayal of character that’s desperate to protect himself from where he is. I forgot I was watching actors on a screen, everyone totally disappears in to their roles. 

The camera work here is something to behold. The hand held shots are exquisitely displayed. The cinematography like an artists gallery on display. The editing as well is of the highest quality. The score like a melodic symphony that graces your ears. The true essence of the dialogue will leave you hooked on every sentence, every word. 

From its captivating opening to its heart lifting end this movie will you make your heart and soul rise from your body. Everything is orchestrated to perfection. Well and truly revolutionary on all levels.

movies,A movie you have watched that is so obscure that it doesn't have an IMDb or Letterboxd or Wikipedia page,"For me, I think this has to be a weird animated Indian movie called [Icy N Spicy](https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=1340)

It was not difficult to find the [full movie on YouTube](https://youtu.be/fBf85FaYkHA?feature=shared) once I remembered the name. I am yet to re-watch, looks hilarious though

The funny thing is, I don't remember anything about the movie itself, but I remember when and where I watched it in great detail... It was aired at 12.00 PM on Sunday, July 3, 2011 on Doordarshan National (a state owned TV channel and the oldest TV channel in India). Why do I remember this? Well, I have a knack for remembering calendar dates, and July 2nd was when I first got eyeglasses. The 3rd of July was the last day of summer vacation and this movie is possibly the first movie I watched with vision glasses. I was in 5th grade and I didn't  really find the animation to be so ghastly as I do now. I believe the only animation movies I had watched at that point were Ice Age 1, Finding Nemo, Stuart Little 3, and a Ramayana adaptation from around that time.

movies,What do you think happens next?,"What are some of your theories that happens next after the movie is over? This could be for canned sequels or movies that ended but still seemingly have more to the story.

For example, after The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Spidey gets back to it. Harry is still crippled, so he hires Spencer Smythe to help him with Oscorps and on the side they plot to take down Spidey. Harry recruits other villains while recovering and eventually takes the helm of the Sinister 6.

After Alex Garland’s Civil War, Jessie follows in the path of Lee. She gets pretty big and Joel and her go around continuing their job. Joel recognizes he harbors resentment for Jessie basically getting Lee killed and leaves her on her own. Without overhead she gets into more compromised situations taking great shots but ultimately dies young before the war ends.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 1 - England,"Hello there,

since over one and a half month I'm asking you for your favorite movie in a certain european country once a day. This was very easy for me in the last round: I can't announce a winner yet, because the 24 hours aren't up yet (I'm a bit early today, as I have plans for later - yes, there is an RL outside of Reddit), so stay tuned, but all in all, Ukraine is still and hopefully will continue to be an independent country. But when it comes to today's country, it is sometimes a little difficult to understand, at least for me as an outsider.

I know, I know, Wikipedia can never be the last source, but let's take a look on it here. When it comes to the UK, it clearly says:

&gt;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.

At the same time, you can read on another article:

&gt;Since 1922, the United Kingdom has been made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales (which collectively make up Great Britain) and Northern Ireland (avoriously described as a country, province, jurisdiction or region.

Further internet research has shown that not only for me as a non-native speaker, but also for the British themselves, it is sometimes not so clear where their country begins and their state ends. Even here in the discussion group I have even read that the UK is not a country at all, then again that it is a country made up of several countries (sometimes by one and the same person). It's all quite confusing, but I think I've found a solution that I can live with.

Today we're going to start with films set in **England**. Over the next few days, we'll do the same with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On the fifth day, the respective individual winners will then compete against each other again, so that we have a winner for the UK, but also winners for the individual ‘sub-countries’. I think that's a lot of effort, but hey, even if I think the UK members should sort out once and for all whether they want to be federal states or separate countries, I can't ignore the actual situation. In return, I ask you not to ignore the following two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Highlander - What if Kurgan had won?  Could he really do anything?,"This is a very old movie with well know ending, so need to spoiler tag.   Don't read any further if you somehow haven't seen Highlander after 40 years.

There were lines in the movie where Ramirez (Sean Connery) warned Connor that they couldn't let The Kurgan win the prize, or mankind would enter a terrible darkness and never recover.

But what if Kurgan had beaten Connor, and won the prize?   What could he really have done to the world?  As we saw in Connor's closing comments during the ending, he became mortal.   He did say he ""knew everything"" and could basically understand everyone in the worlds feelings and intentions.

So if their worst fear came true and the Kurgan won - so what?  He is now mortal and can be killed.   How would he topple the worlds governments who were defended by massive Armies, war machines, and technology?  

The Kurgan would be the best swordsman in the world which would be meaningless in the 1980s.   He would have a great understanding of people and be able to manipulate SOME people do his bidding, but it doesn't seem like he could really surpass the level of ""local kingpin""

Any thoughts on what ""prize Kurgan"" could actually do to the world?

movies,Why do movies don't show real props and processes of elaborate things?,"I know the title is a bit confusing but I don't really know how to frame it. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, but I don't know where else to ask it.

What I'm referring to is things like in the Spider-Man movies. The way for the mask to look so perfectly fitting when Peter is using it, is by using a some sort of plastic mold in the front, so that it has the perfectly round shape on top, the straight shape on the sides without the ears popping out, and the chin shape at the bottom. However, in all movies with all 3 spidermen, whenever they take off the mask or whenever the mask is shown separately, it doesn't have that, it just shows the mask as if it was just the fabric, with no shape. Also, the way that the mask fits so perfectly with the suit and doesn't look separated at all is that it really isn't separate, the whole suit is one piece. However, in the movies they show it as if it were separate parts like the mask, the torso, the gloves, and even the the feet as if they were boots.

And what I said about processes, what comes to mind is hair, mostly for men. A lot of times there are actors who in a film have a hairstyle that clearly requires things like hairdryer and product, but according to the movie, the hair just naturally is like that by just drying it with a towel. One example that comes to mind (even though it is in a show and not a movie) Harvey Specter in Suits. Another thing is that an actor has his hair styled a certain way, and then puts on a baseball cap or does a lot of physical activity or gets his hair wet either because of rain or by falling in water, and after that, the hair is still the same. That's literally impossible. And I know a lot of people are going to say ""duh, it's a movie, it's not real"", and I know that, but I think a bit of realism would be appreciated by some.

This is just something that I have been curious about for a long time.",santivega,1hcr93z,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcr93z/why_do_movies_dont_show_real_props_and_processes/,2024-12-12 18:08:55,0,0.22,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hcr93z

I really couldn’t believe it when I read that. I would have never guess that and felt like she really made such an impact that I felt she was in way more episodes.

Another example is for me is Kathy Bates who played Jo Bennett in the office for 8 episodes as the CEO of Sabre (out of 188 episode total). Or can you imagine Game of Thrones without Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo? He was only in 11 episodes out of 73. 

Obviously as the title says it’s not only the actor but also how well written te part is, but still execution is key.

How do you guys feel about this opinion? Or do you feel it’s mostly how well written it is? Do you have any other examples?

movies,Deja Vu (2006),"So I just watched this, and I'm confused about the third act.

The movie very strongly suggests that there is only one, immutable timeline in the manner of 12 Monkeys.

We learn that the main character's partner is inexplicably killed in the ferry attack. Later we see the scientists send a warning back, which is intercepted by the partner and explains why he was killed. This is one timeline then: that note was *always* there for the partner to find

When the main character himself goes back in time, everything he does is stuff that already happened. His finger prints were found all over the house because he'd *always* traveled back in time to touch stuff. The bloody tissue was on the garbage because he'd *always* gone back in time to leave it there, etc. In this scene he realizes that this has always happened this way and then... suddenly changes things?

Did I miss something, or is this a glaring plot hole? He's been trying to use his knowledge of the future to change things for half the films runtime, only to be consistently thwarted with the realization that he'd *always* done those things. His foreknowledge consistently fails him because by trying to apply it, he's just ensuring that things happen the way they already happened. So how is he able to just suddenly change things at the end? What's different about that instance?",AnAquaticOwl,1hc4jdf,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc4jdf/deja_vu_2006/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc4jdf/deja_vu_2006/,2024-12-11 21:25:40,1,0.55,1,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1hc4jdf
movies,Recent movie styles/trends that you don't like? ,"I've noticed that most movies tend to become more of the same, especially this:

\- Action movie that tries to be nitty gritty? Lower the colors, make everything green/gray and film shaky hand style during the adrenaline/fight scene. During the 2000's, the movies would try to at least choreograph an admirable fight scene and the camera 's point of view would be at least steady

\- There are almost no epilogues for romantic movies. They basically roll the credits as soon the couple kiss. We don't get a moment to catch our breath or appreciate whatever is happening and boom the credits starts. The epilogues doesn't even need to be a 5 minute if you want to cheapen the budget. Just a minute or something to show what the future holds. Even the side characters doesn't really get their side plot resolved or hear about it what happened.

\- Movie intro. In the 90's en 00's, we would hear music, the introduction names start, we see the main character start their morning/life/moment and there is a minute of no talk. We just get a sense of what their life is before the main plot starts. Now it's bam, immediately start and it takes us a lot more minutes before finding out the gist and we have to remember everything because of possible plot relevance. And the title comes just before the credits roll.

\- Car riding scenes: 80's and early 90's could get away with this because the technology wasn't quite there yet: Green screen driving. Back then, they could hide this by filming in the dark and have the character sway the wheel furiously from left to right and back to indicate he/she is driving all while telling us the problem in thoughts. Nowadays they film with a green screen, especially when we see it from sideways. The scenery is also a bit blurry, giving us a stark contrast when the characters and the car itself is in crisp 4K quality. I see this style getting back more and more.

What is your thing that you don't like, that has been happening lately? I'm not asking about the main character grabbing a toast from a full breakfast spread and heading off examples.

movies,David Lean’s “Brief Encounter” and my paradoxical experience watching “classic” films,"I have a hard time placing my genuine thoughts towards judging older films from before the 60s, mainly stuff around the Hays Code era, as a lot of them maintain a place in the film canon by having been ahead of their time, or at least timeless enough to still be watchable in 2024. Having seen Brief Encounter last night, I didn’t fall in love with it but there are some sparkingly modern filmmaking techniques and creativity that must’ve been distinct at the time. I’m thinking of shots like the dream sequence Celia’s character has when reflected in the train window, it has this ethereal quality to it with the ornate lights that would feel very fitting to a new release today, and the “madness tilt” zoom on her when she contemplates suicide after the man leaves. Plus the whole recontextualisng of the beginning is very slickly done and easy to love. However, and this may be the jaded part of refusing myself emotional attachment to it, but like lots of classic revered titles I can’t tell if I like it for the film or the filmmaking. It’s difficult to decipher where my investment in the story ends with a recognition of how ahead-of-its-time a certain film was. 

This could be a wider humbug I have when it comes to my personal assessment of films in the “canon” and at the risk of overcomplicating matters, but when they have such a long reputation and are held up in every conversation about being essential viewing and/or revolutionary, it feels like an inevitable shadow on the film as I’m watching. I’m not just watching Brief Encounter, I’m watching David Lean’s universally acclaimed 1945 classic Brief Encounter. 

If this post ends up sounding more like an overly verbose rephrasing of “letting expectations hamper my viewing experience” then apologies for that, but it’s an issue I encounter regularly whenever I dip my toes into this circle of the movie world.

movies,"After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?","After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?

Recently I watched the Indian movie ""Devara"" starring N. T. Rama Rao Jr. of RRR, and just like RRR the movie was astonishing. There's something about modern Indian movies of the last 15 years. The Aesthetic (?) is something else. I don't know any other word, because the movies are so unique. They way male characters stand on their word, the emphasis on concern for family and the community, the hero and villains' willingness to resort to cartoonish levels of violence, the preserving of women's virtues unless it's a colourful pop video in the middle and repeated fanfare when the hero appears or begins killing people. 

I always start laughing uncontrollably at these moments but I am throughly entertained! Are there any books or online articles that explain this style of filmmaking and why Indian producers believe or know this is what their audience responds to? The closest thing I can think of is like Michael Bay, but on a budget! Because I think the directors draw on a lot of elements of music videos &amp; commercials throughout the films through colour schemes, cinematography, family scenes, fight sequences and of course the pop songs. 

Are there any Hollywood movies made like these? I know Hollywood only just recognized RRR, but there must be something good about what the Indian filmmakers are doing as they show a hell of a lot more imagination and are determined to give their audiences spectacle on what is Hollywood mid-budgets.

movies,Just got done rewatching The Green Mile.,"The Green Mile is my favorite movie of all time, along with Fight Club and another Darabont/King film, The Shawshank Redemption. But what Mile has over Shawshank is the supernatural and stronger religious themes. 

I love all the characters here, with my favorite being Paul Edgecomb. His character arc and relationship with John Coffey is so sad, but also so sweet. The way he starts to believe in miracles and actually offers John a way out is such compelling character writing. As is his relationship with Brutus and Dean. 

Wild Bill is a threatening antagonist, and you truly learn to hate him. Very satisfying seeing him get what he deserves.

John Coffey is a true miracle of God. A man who heals and helps people, and who sees the good and bad in everyone on Earth. His death had me bawling like a baby, and his dialogue is some of the best in the film. His execution is my personal favorite scene in film history for how well-executed and emotional it is.

It became such a common plot device in the genre. I'm curious why this trope was so prevalent during that period—is this still happening? Was it a product of the growing digital age, or was there something else behind its popularity in spy thrillers?

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-astonishes-young-bob-dylan-james-mangolds-thrilling-musical-drama-1236199254/):

&gt;At the center of this all is a remarkable performance by Timothee Chalamet who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lyp-synching or blending of voices between actor and subject. It is all Chalamet in the same way *Walk The Line* was all Phoenix and Witherspoon, and *Coal Miner’s Daughter* was all Spacek.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-james-mangold-1236081991/) (70):

&gt;Whatever script flaws there are in terms of structure, plot momentum and an opaque central character, *A Complete Unknown* offers rewards in its lived-in performances and in the exhilarating music sequences that propel it forward. For many audiences with an affection for Dylan’s music and the era in general, that will be enough.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (39/100):

&gt;A superficial illustration of the artist’s allure, interspersed with endless, increasingly comical shots of people watching him perform and smiling beatifically.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation) (100):

&gt;Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It’s all rise, but troubled and unclear. You might not buy Chalamet’s Dylan at first; I didn’t, until that Guthrie bedside scene. There is amazing bravado in this performance.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/10/bob-dylan-movie-review-a-complete-unknown/76857860007/) (3.5/4):

&gt;“A Complete Unknown” is that rare biopic that leaves you wanting to watch it again *and* go on a Spotify deep dive, and you're apt to find new respect both for Dylan as a bluesy contrarian and Chalamet as a top-shelf thespian of his generation.

[Collider](https://collider.com/a-complete-unknown-review/) (80):

&gt;James Mangold's A Complete Unknown explores the music of Bob Dylan with fantastic care and a great performance by Timothée Chalamet.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan) (70):

&gt;Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold takes his hands off the steering wheel for A Complete Unknown, resulting in a Bob Dylan biopic that takes unpredictable turns. Rather than connecting the dots between how the world influenced him (and how he influenced it in turn), the film frames his enormous musical sea changes as personal drama for his peers. It’s formally straightforward, but its focus on the characters in Dylan’s life – rather than the musician himself, played by Timothée Chalamet – turn him into an enigma, for better or worse.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-complete-unknown-bob-dylan-movie-review-b2661910.html) (60):

&gt;Despite the drip-fed reminders of contemporary history (the Cuban Missile Crisis! the Kennedy assassination! Weren’t the Sixties wild, man!), A Complete Unknown struggles to fully engage with Dylan’s relationship to that intersection between politics and music.

movies,Actors/Actresses who screwed up a comeback arc?,"Everyone loves a good comeback story. From sports to music and especially movies. Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, the works. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?

First one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.

Another example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo.

movies,"Pedro Almodóvar's style and writing doesn't translate well in English in ""The Room Next Door""","I wanted to like Pedro Almodóvar because Almodóvar was my childhood idol when I became obsessed with Cinema and I identified with his vision. His worldwide success after Todo Sobre Mi Madre was exciting because the world could see his genius. 

For years, I've been wanting to see Almodóvar cross over into English and after I got to watch ""The Room Next Door"", it might be a case of his style, his trademark, doesn't translate well into English. 

Because the way he writes and directs didn't change, it's always been slightly theatrical, big yet subtle at the same time when it comes with his writing, and in Spanish and the way Spanish actors accostumed with Almodóvar are, it works, yet in English, it's distracting. It's more wooden and stagy and some of the dialogue comes off as contrived. 

Yet I wouldn't call ""The Room Next Door"" a bad film, because of the use of colors, the direction, the way Almodóvar shoots scenes with symbolism and the importance of sets, and, of course, Tilda Swinton is excellent (as usual) as a dying woman who chooses euthanasia. She is fascinating and you can't take your eyes away from her. Julianne Moore is good, it's just, she's more of an observer, she exists to support Swinton, and as a result, her character ends up being underwritten. John Turturro shows up a few times to spout stuff about the world ending, I didn't like how forced his dialogue was. At one point, I thought the film was going to create a triangle when Swinton expresses interest in attending a event hosted by Turturro and it ends up being quickly interrupted.",Davis_Crawfish,1hc0ufi,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc0ufi/pedro_almodóvars_style_and_writing_doesnt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc0ufi/pedro_almodóvars_style_and_writing_doesnt/,2024-12-11 18:51:10,0,0.42,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hc0ufi

At the beginning of the movie Vincent is walking through a airport and bumps into a character played by Jason Statham.  They both drop identical briefcases and then exchange them.  We then follow Vincent on his journey but we have never revisited what Jason’s character may have been off to.  It’s provides perfect foreshadowing for a second movie loosely based on the plot of the first one (drama with drug cartels, law enforcement, litigation etc).  I always thought that Michael Mann would revisit this moment.  He could start a movie with this exact scene again and then follow Jason’s character as Vincent walks off.  Thoughts?

The soundtrack is all over the place, some random electronic beatsuthat are suddenly cut off.

The characters are all extremely unlikeable. Art is a major pushover with basically no will of its own, Patrick is a nihilistic womanizer, but Tashi takes the cake.

Anyway, why didn't Ava kill or try to kill Nathan earlier? Like, he's shown entering her room and interacting with her directly, if she wanted to escape, wouldn't she have tried to kill him at some point in the past? What Caleb did wasn't required for her to escape (recoding the security protocols etc) all she needed the whole time was Nathan's key card.

&gt;Although not hitting us emotionally on the scale of the live action films, Kamiyama has produced a visual landscape that at times , through use of motion capture, models, and hand drawn animation do register a striking visual motif, not what we have previously associated with the cinematic efforts at Tolkein, but a world of its own merged with more allegiance to Jackson than Tolkein.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236243179/) (60):

&gt;For those who can’t get enough of Middle Earth, here’s two-plus hours of deep-cut backstory to feed your appetite, centered around a siege at the stronghold that would come to be known as Helm’s Deep (where we saw Saruman’s Orcs obliterated by Ents in “The Two Towers”).

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (80):

&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore’s original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).

[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien’s appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm’s Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we’ve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):

&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie’s greatest strength — The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson’s LotR in the best way. It’s packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):

&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from ""The War of the Rohirrim."" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that’s unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It’s hard to get mad at this movie, but it’s oh so easy to be disappointed.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):

&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson’s trilogy — few do — but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.

[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):

&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth’s famous legends.

\--------

Directed by Kenji Kamiyama

&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003), *The War of the Rohirrim* tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold Helm's Deep.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Ukraine,"Hello there,

I've been asking you for your favourite film every day for almost a month and a half now, and the journey is gradually coming to an end. Following an alphabetical order, in which the United Kingdom will soon be duly dissected, I arrived at the letter T yesterday. Today I can now announce the winner for Turkey: To be honest, I'm not familiar with ***Bir Zamanlar Anadolu’da*** (engl.: *Once Upon A Time in Anatolia*) yet, but it really s to touch the heart of this project and to provide an as entertaining as accurate look into the country.

When it comes to the next country, some would say that it is particularly important nowadays that films can offer us a real insight into the country's current condition: I'm talking about **Ukraine**. But please take note: Since *20 днів у Маріуполі* (engl.: *20 Days in Mariupol*) would actually be an obvious suggestion as a prominent documentary film, I would like to explicitly point out  what was always implicitly clear to everyone in the previous rounds, namely that documentaries are excluded from [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). Apart from that, the following two rules apply as always:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Off the top of my head I’d say numbers, “Franchise: Subtitle”, and Indiana Jones/Harry Potter’s “…and the…” aren’t unique. There are probably plenty of questionable ones though…. The Matrix is “franchise: subtitle” but they’ve all got “Re-“ in them, for example. The Vacations are all different, well, vacations, but they don’t feel unique to me bc they all just state the premise. If your pick is borderline include the rationale in your argument if you’d like lmao.

I’m gonna go with Linklater’s Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight. An incredible romance that you probably approach differently as you age, just as the characters do, and which leaves you questioning your idea of love at every turn.

movies,Meet the Fockers 4,"With the recent announcement of Meet the Fockers 4 being in production, I would like to share the two ideas/predictions I had for what the plot will be. My girlfriend and I love the movies so we’re really excited for this fourth installment (I literally had not watched it until last year, safe to say I loved it). Also, regardless of what the movie is about, my girlfriend had a great idea for the name: “Everything’s Focked”. I’ll start with the best prediction my girlfriend and I came up with and then I’ll throw in the second backup guess. The most likely thing that we see happening is a repeat of the first movie, but instead with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro WORKING TOGETHER to do the same thing that was done to Ben years ago. We pictured Stiller (or Greg) having a daughter, and him going through the same situation that Deniro (or Jack) was going through in the first movie. We think that either 

A.) Robert deniro will help stiller to investigate his daughters new bf with all of the gadgets and such he possesses
or 

B.) Greg realizes that he’s acting exactly like Jack, and even when he tries to stop himself, he can’t help but see the similarities (when it comes to their daughters)

The last throw away idea we had was a huge family reunion, where we see all of the aunts, uncles, and cousins from the Focker family, and they have to interact and get along with the cousins and such from the Byrnes family. Anyways, that was our ideas. Lmk what you think and whether you agree! Honestly, I think the first idea is very likely, and if it’s not done, then i think it would be a miss that they definitely should’ve taken.

movies,Was the Duke of France gay in Elizabeth (1998). ,"Hey guys I hope you all are doing well. 
I was watching Elizabeth (1998) and am confused about a particular scene.
A Duke from France who happens to be the nephew of Mary of Guise comes to England to ask the hand of Queen Elizabeth for marriage. 

She of course is reluctant because of her ongoing affair with Lord Robert. 

Then during a party, she goes to the room of the Duke and catches him in a dress. He is drunk and dressed like woman. Does this imply that he was gay ? Or is this just a lord doing lord things. 

Also, she proceeds to extend her hand to be kissed by the Duke but he is obviously embarrassed by this. He reluctantly agrees and does not even kiss it properly. 
Why ? Can men in dress not kiss the hands of a Queen ? Why was he embarrassed and so reluctant for this. 

I hope to get answers to these two questions as I'm not European and not well aware of the customs of that region.

movies,The Real Reason Landa Kills Hammersmark - Inglorious Basterds,"Landa mentions after capturing Aldo that he was a detective before the war. I think this is supposed to be a clue for us that he can figure out what happened at the bar. He sees shoes on the ground, blood from a low impact shot, knows that whoever the shoes belong to was shot low, then laid on the ground for a while. 

He sees the corpse of Wilhelm ( guy with newborn son Max) lying not far away, with no weapon, and with some of his detective work, notices that Wilhelm has been shot from a low angle with a low-caliber pistol, from the spot where the blood and shoes are. He sees the napkin which confirms that Hammersmark knew that she was killing an un-armed man with a newborn son. 

Landa has already been shown not to kill without reason, and he seems to genuinely care about some people (like Shoshanna and the soldier at the end of the movie who is killed by Aldo). I think he proves to himself that Hammersmark killed a drunk, unarmed, and fearful new father, and regardless of what comes next, decides that she deserves to die for those actions. 

When Landa is asked what happens to Hammersmark, he says she got what she deserved. I think many would assume it's because she is a traitor, but that would make him a hypocrite a few moments later when he chooses to betray the Nazi regime. I think what he really means is that she got what she deserved for killing Wilhelm.

movies,"I find the score of Bresson's ""Pickpocket"" to be weirdly disconnected in mood from the action. Would value a discussion of it, or others.","What the subject says. I find the musical score of Bresson's ""Pickpocket"" to be weirdly disconnected in mood from what's happening on screen. Distractingly so. (I'm here, aren't I?)

I don't want a score to tell me what to think. But if it's there at all, it should unobtrusively underscore the action. I understand some will say that's the same thing, but I promise you it's not, at least not the way I mean it. But that's not the point of this. 

I just watched Pickpocket and the score seems weirdly at odds with the mood of the action.

Anyone else find the music oddly… buoyant?

And I can't say I've ever had this experience with another movie. There are scores I hate (Midnight Cowboy anyone?) but not because they're jarringly at right angles to the action, but because I just don't like them.

movies,La La Land’s (2016) ending sequence is one of the best uses of a no-dialogue scene in major modern film since the beginning of Up (2009),"I just finished a rewatch of La La Land and was reminded just how amazing the ending is, when Mia stumbles across Seb’s club and sees him for the first time since they parted ways all those years ago.

Despite having seen the movie before, the sequence that shows how one of them would’ve ended up unhappy if they stayed together still manages to make a strong emotional impact. In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would’ve played out in other circumstances, I can’t watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could’ve been, and ill-fated love. 

The way that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were able to convey so much emotion through just their movements and facial expressions was a testimony to their talent. Of course, the slowed down piano version of City of Stars also plays in a big role in setting the mood for this scene and is a gorgeous score. It’s hard to think of another movie that captures such a perfect balance of being bittersweet. 

I know it’s strange to compare La La Land to an animated children’s movie, but I couldn’t help but thinking about Up (2009) while rewatching the ending. The beginning of Up that shows how Carl met and lost his wife with no dialogue had people of all age groups in tears when the movie was released. These two scenes are both uniquely special in the way they’re able to convey strong emotions and make an impact on the audience while using no dialogue. 

Barring actual silent films, can anyone else think of a scene in a movie that manages to pack an emotional punch with no dialogue on the level of La La Land and Up?

movies,I have a question about “The substance” I seriously don’t this one thing. ,"If you haven’t noticed - spoiler ahead .

So when Elisabeth (Demi) is told about substance she is advise “you are one” with your other self, so I was watching the movie as if her consciousness has been transferred into Sue, however later in the movie I realised Elisabeth has no recollection of what Sue does when she was watching the interview on tv she was shocked and livid and clearly hearing it for the first time. Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth’s experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. 

But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it’s clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn’t? But the bigger question is if you are Elisabeth, you don’t actually get to experience being young again, you go to sleep for a week wasting away, why would anyone want to just clone themselves and keep going when they don’t get anything out of it?!

movies,Ariana DeBose needs a better agent,"TL;DR: Ariana DeBose's movies after WSS aren't very good. Hopefully that changes soon. If not then she needs to give her agent the boot.

This isn't something only exclusive to her (looking at you Tom Holland, though things are looking up for you), but I'm shocked by how drastic of a downturn Ariana DeBose's career took after West Side Story. That movie put her in the spotlight and even won her an Oscar! Yet every movie she's been in after that has been panned by both audiences and critics.

I.S.S was the first movie she stared in after WSS, which released on January 2023. For the uninformed January is seen as a dumping month for movies which studios think won't do well. That movie bombed at the box office despite a low $13 million budget and received average reviews.

Then she voiced the main character in Wish. I think we all know what happened with that movie. It flopped, making $255 million on a $175–200 million budget. Don't forget movies need to make 2.5x their budget to make a profit. I remember a lot of people on social media and irl making fun of the movie's animation, story and songs. It was seen as an embarrassment to Disney, especially since it was meant to celebrate their 100th anniversary.

In 2024 she starred in Agrylle. The movie was meant to launch a new franchise but it bombed and was ridiculed by critics and audiences. I know many people see it as a low point in Vaughn's career. Tbf her role in that movie was very minor but still.

This likely went under your radar as it's a streaming movie released on Amazon Prime but she stared in a horror movie called House of Spoils where she plays an evil chef I think. Cool premise but unfortunately it's produced by Blumhouse and you know how all their recent output has been like lately. It didn't make much splash but from what I can tell it was received quite negatively by both critics and audiences.

Later this month the 8 people still invested in Sony's Spider-Manless Cinematic Universe will be seeing her again in Kraven the Hunter. Tbh I actually think this movie's reception won't too bad, or at least not as bad as Morbius and Madame Web. I can totally see people calling it a fun turn-off-your-brain popcorn flick. But I really doubt it'll get higher than a 65% on the tomatometer.

Finding out that she was going to be in Kraven the Hunter was what prompted me to write this ridiculously long post (that and the fact that I have a lot of free time.). To be completely hyperbolic, this was what broke me and caused me to write all this out. I admit that I've never seen a single movie she's been in but I have seen clips of WSS and she was phenomenal in it. She's a scene stealer man, not just because she looks absolutely stunning but because of her amazing acting and singing. She deserves a better career man. I'd hate to see such talent be reduced to such poor and ill-fitting roles.

Not all hope is lost for her tho, next years she'll be in Love Hurts, also staring Ke Huy Quan. I have really high hopes for that movie as I love Ke Huy Quan and the premise sounds really fun! She's also staring in two other upcoming movies which don't have release dates yet. Those may be good. Who knows. I hope they are. If all three of her upcoming movies end up terrible then she ought to fire her agent cause man is she squandering her skills and potential. Of course I'm not saying gonna end up in poverty if she keeps getting bad movie roles but I do think it's odd she hasn't been in a single hit since WSS.

movies,Hellboy: The Crooked Man is better than I expected,"I'm a fan of Brian Taylor and I love the Hellboy character, but I expected this to be a complete disaster after it got buried during its release. Honestly, it isn't a great movie, but it's completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it's pretty clear that most of what we're seeing is fake, which drags it down. 

Despite me finding it passable enough, I'm really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights. The character isn't much of a box office draw either, which is a shame as the comics are excellent.

[https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols](https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols)

I did not know ANYTHING about this movie before I went in to see it and that's the best way to experience it. It won me over because the story about this woman searching for her missing brother is interesting. The atmosphere is dripping. Literally because they filmed in December on Vancouver Island, showcasing really dark, rainy and super foreboding/dread tone. The deeper they get into the woods the eerier it gets. It's strangely grounded and absorbing. It's decently-shot, but what I appreciate is it's a nice slow burn. It builds and builds to one of the tensest, scariest movies I've seen in years. Closest I can compare is UNCUT GEMS,  in style, realism and oh-my-GOD tension.

It's a locally produced Vancouver indie so a lot of the audience had heard about it through family, friends or colleagues, myself included. I showed up 20 minutes early and most movies at the Whistler film fest don't have crazy lines. This one day. I barely got in via the rush line, they had 10 spots open and I was the eighth. So it was a full up theatre.

If you love Netflix crime documentaries or movies like *Paranormal Activity* and *Blair Witch Project*, give this one a go!",Count3D,1hba2w3,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hba2w3/hunting_matthew_nichols_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hba2w3/hunting_matthew_nichols_2024/,2024-12-10 19:32:39,3,0.71,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1hba2w3
movies,"Looking for Horror/Thriller Slasher ""Extremity"" Movies ","Movies like *Inside* (2007), *The Loved Ones*, *Frontiers*, *The Hills Have Eyes,* or any other kind of violent splatter film that is either consistent or reserved in its levels of violence. It doesn't have to be limited to New French or of a particular movement.

Preferably though absolutely not just limiting to, movies where a group or a select few individuals have to escape or defend themselves against larger, stronger, or outnumbered foes like in *Green Room*, *You're Next*, and *Dog Soldiers.* 

If the movies have some kind of cross into the action field but still have horror themes and elements like *I Saw The Devil*, they are also welcome.

You are welcome to, but preferably not on this specific post, to also submit more overall action thrillers like *The Night Comes For Us* but try and limit it towards more leaning still on horror if you can.

movies,What's the most satisfying defeat of a bad guy in movie history?,"I mean Lord of the Rings probably has to be up there, but I also really liked how they brought down Willy Bank in Oceans 13 - even though the movie probably is no cinematic masterpiece 😄 
Maybe we can also include series if you feel like something has earned it's place here.

Looking forward to the suggestions and happy discussion! 😄🙌🏻
