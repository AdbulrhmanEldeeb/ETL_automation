math,Math wrapped ,"Hello everyone.

Since it is that time of the year to do retrospectives, it could be nice to do it for math in general. What have been highlights in mathematics this year (research or not) ? What's have been important or what's did you observe in the community ? And what kind of math did you do ?",VitaaSerena,1heq193,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1heq193/math_wrapped/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1heq193/math_wrapped/,2024-12-15 10:38:05,34,0.91,34,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1heq193
math,"What does it mean for a proof to be ""rigorous""?","One thing that I'm hearing a lot more now than ever is the idea of a proof being ""rigorous"". Are there certain kinds/methods of proofs that are considered more or less rigorous than others? How does one know that their proof is rigorous?

Currently, my best guess as to what this could possibly mean is that it's a proof that resorts to the conclusions of other results as minimally as possible unless that result is popular enough to almost be common knowledge. Though, admittedly, I am only basing this on how my professor's proofs look. Does anyone have any insight as to what this actually means?

math,I just want to say that I love ε-neighborhoods!,"I’m mostly making this post to give a lighthearted shoutout to how much I liked my analysis course this semester, but I’m also making it partially as advice to figure students who are worried about the language of real analysis. 

I took analysis as a non-math major this semester and was able to get an A in the class. I think a big part of my success was internalizing the topological versions of definitions for things like convergence. If I were to give one piece of advice to future analysis students who don’t like using quantifiers all that much, it would be to think about things in terms of ε-neighborhoods, which either your professor or textbook will likely mention. It’s a great way to actually visualize some of the more seemingly complicated definitions that are discussed in the class.

math,"People who have had low undergraduate GPAs, how did you get into graduate school?","I have a pretty poor undergraduate GPA for various reasons. One of the main reason was because I thought I wanted to study Computer Science, but I ended up failing and getting Cs in a lot of those classes. However, I realized that I never liked Computer Science. Rather I liked seeing how mathematics could be used in it. Nevertheless, I haven't done that well in my undergraduate math classes the first two years because I was more focused on my computer science courses. However, this semester I think I will finish all my classes with at least an B- to an A in all of four math classes, this semester. I was wondering if there's still time to improve my GPA, so that I may be competitive for PhD and masters programs.

math,OEIS Donation Drive,"[https://oeisf.org/donate/](https://oeisf.org/donate/)

Doron Zeilberger's Opinion 124 can be summarized based on its title by the sentence ""A Database is Worth a Thousand Mathematical Articles"".  I think that this is a fair assessment, since a good mathematical database can distill the essence of many thousands of mathematical articles. OEIS (On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) is the best example of a good mathematical database.

If you go to the main page of OEIS you can see the Year-end donation appeal. The link at the top of the post however, goes to the OEIS donation page  (it has useful info and links). 

Somebody already made a post on this subreddit that mentions that OEIS is looking for a part-time or full-time Managing Editor (paid position).  The salary of the managing editor will probably be the biggest expense of the organization, especially if it's a full time position. Maybe, if enough math enthusiasts donate , OEIS can have the budged to hire a full-time managing editor for 5 or more years. More top candidates would want the position if it's full time, stable and long term.

How are we being able to do that? Why are we allowed to do that? Why are we allowed use determinants while finding the cross products of two vectors?
