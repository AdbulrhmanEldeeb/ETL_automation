datascience,Visualization Process and Time Management,"At work I make many *exploratory* data visualizations that are fast, rough, and abundant. I want to develop a skill for *explanatory* visualizations that are polished, rich, and curated.

I've read a couple books on design principles and visualzation libraries (i.e. Seaborn and Matplotlib) and have some idea what I am after. But then I'll sit down to draft a paper with my outline and my hand-sketches, and I'll blow through my time budget just tweaking one of the charts!

I've learned a reliable process for writing, but I haven't mastered one for graphics. I'd love to hear what other people are doing. Some rudiments of a process:

- Start with cheap exploratory viz to find your story.
- Outline and revise your explanatory graphics by hand-- seems faster.
- Draft the ""data ink"" completely before tweaking aesthetics.
- Draft 80%-polished versions of graphs before the day you need them.
- Ruthlessly cut and consolidate graphics to the essentials.
- Forego graphics when narrative or tables are equally effective.
- Accept that a given chart typically takes X hours and plan accordingly.
- Practice, practice, practice so at least the tooling comes natural.

datascience,Unexpectedly let go. Best ways to get a job fast?,"Hey all, 

I’m in Germany and was let go at the end of my probation period. 

I was ensured I would make it and actively made money for the company with proof. 

My reasons for termination were unclear and actually not inline with my responsibilities as a data scientist. 

Essentially, I was given peace of mind, and could ensure I needn’t worry. 

Whatever it may be, I’m now out of a job. That’s the way it goes sometimes. 

What are your tips for grabbing that next position fast? I’m not picky, I just want a job in my field, and with a team I enjoy - easier said than done. 

Any tips would be amazing!

datascience,Help with clustering over time,"I'm dealing with a clustering over time issue.
Our company is a sort of PayPal. We are trying to implement an antifraud process to trigger alerts when a client makes excessive payments compared to its historical behavior.
To do so, I've come up with seven clustering features which are all 365-day-long moving averages of different KPIs (payment frequency, payment amount, etc.). So it goes without saying that, from one day to another, these indicators evolve very slowly. I have about 15k clients, several years of data.
I get rid of outliers (99-percentile of each date, basically) and put them in a cluster-0 by default.
Then, the idea is, for each date, to come up with 8 clusters. I've used a Gaussian Mixture clustering (GMM) but, weirdly enough, the clusters of my clients vary wildly from one day to another.
I have tried to plant the previous mean of my centroids, using the previous day centroid of a client to sort of seed the next day's clustering of a client, but the results still vary a lot.

At best, the results are fragile and optimistically biased. At worst, they know what they're doing and it's intentional fraud. Especially when the project has real stakes/stakeholders.

I was chatting to a colleague about this last week and shared a few examples of ""random seed hacking"" and related ideas of test-set pruning, p-hacking, leader board hacking, train/test split ratio gaming, and so on.

datascience,"How do you track your models while prototyping? Sharing Skore, your scikit-learn companion.","Hello everyone! 👋

In my work as a data scientist, I’ve often found it challenging to compare models and track them over time. This led me to contribute to a recent open-source library called [**Skore**](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore), an initiative led by Probabl, a startup with a team comprising of many of the core scikit-learn maintainers.

Our goal is to help data scientists use scikit-learn more effectively, provide the necessary tooling to track metrics and models, and visualize them effectively. Right now, it mostly includes support for model validation. We plan to extend the features to more phases of the ML workflow, such as model analysis and selection.

I’m curious: how do you currently manage your workflow? More specifically, how do you track the evolution of metrics? Have you found something that worked well, or was missing?

datascience,The Solitude of Data Science: Looking for a Kindred Spirits,"Hello!



I’ll try to keep this short because I’m terrible at being concise.



I came from a different world—operations and sales. It didn’t take long for me to realize that I wanted to move away from... well, salespeople. I applied for a dev job at my company and got rejected, but they saw potential in my knowledge and experience with machine learning, deep learning, and some other rogue projects I had been working on.



They asked if I could develop a proof of concept (POC) to present to our board of directors. The company had previously attempted to work with three external teams, but none of those efforts were successful. I presented the POC, and it went exceptionally well. We secured funding and created a junior data science position specifically for me. Previously, the company had no such role or anything similar. While the IT team is very strong, they haven’t had the capacity to handle initiatives like this.



Since then, I’ve been obsessed—reading everything I can and taking stats classes for a certificate program at MIT (with plans to continue my education). I’m pretty sure I’ve been driving my wife and friends crazy because I love talking about this stuff. I’m genuinely passionate about it!



That said, I still have so much to learn and need to overcome my imposter syndrome. On top of this fast-moving environment, I’ve never worked in IT before, never used Jira, or been involved in their overall processes, so I’m navigating that learning curve too. I’d love to connect with others here, hear your stories, and get more involved in this r/datascience community!

I wonder if specifically the stress caused by the unpredictability of the amount of work and the constant pressure dirty data causes has been studied as a health concern/risk.

I juggle tasks like automating deployments, managing Kubernetes clusters in AWS, and scripting in Python and Bash, manage and analyze SQL databases, working with APIs, etc.  
  
**What I like**  
- I get paid well  &amp; have skillsets that makes it more difficult for companies to replace you  
- I need to learn and stay up to date on a variety of technologies (I consider this a plus since you're never really 'out of date' on your role)     
- I enjoy makes graphs and gathering statistics/data to help our team  
- I enjoy interpreting that data to determine the root cause of an issue  
- In terms of scripting, I like making quick and dirty scripts that help my team automate something for us (this doesn't including writing large complicated scripts for other teams)   

    

**Why I hate it and want to leave**  
- The job, by its very nature, means everything is always urgent  
- On call, so a consistent 9-5 is not possible. You're often staying past your shift  
- Have to constantly work with devs and other parties to ensure their services or code gets fixed  
- Rarely any slow days, you're either automating a new large project or jumping on an urgent issue

datascience,Thoughts on the ethics of health insurance companies using Data Science to increase profits based on selective coverage ,"I want to have a good discussion on this topic since no one is talking about it outside of just the context of a CEO making decisions, but as a lot of us know, company decisions and strategy are driven by the suits(board) and the higher ups a lot of times, and that strategy is trickled down to the analysts and other groups forming projects to support the strategic initiative. I think not talking about this from a data science perspective is an ethics violation because we as practitioners can make the decision to not engage or pursue a project just because “I have a boss and they told me I need to because it aligns with our strategy.” I personally have quit a job in the past because the ethics of the CV models we were creating dawned on me and didn’t make me feel right. Sure I could validate it by saying I was only creating a small part of the software system, the reality is I knew the end goal and was actively participating in the development of a system that could be used for an ethically questionable use case. 

The possibility of UHCs actuarial science, analysts, and Data Scientists developing models to contribute to the strategy of increased profits and increased denials should be questioned. And I know “denial rates” aren’t apples to apples as back office rev cycle management people could wrongfully code a claim which can cause it to be denied. I’m talking more from a targeted perspective. Actuaries that work in insurance are very smart, but I want to get some insight about the specifics of what goes on from a health insurance perspective when they are denying a claim.

datascience,Master Data science vs Quantitative Finance ,"Major data science vs Quantitative Finance

Hi, 
I am currently studying the bachelor Econometrics in The Netherlands and next year I will need to choose a master to pursue. My main doubt is, as you can see from the title, between data science (which is a bit outside my bachelor) and quantitative finance. 

On the one hand I may be a bit more interested in data science, but on the other hand I have the feeling that I will ‘throw away’ my Econometrics bachelor that is quite unique. From my point of view data science is followed by many people, also people from lower wage countries, while quantitative finance is a master that not many people follow. 

That’s why I’m curious what other people think about this, will I be going the wrong path if I choose data science which is pursued by many students overall, should I stick to the specific field of quantitative finance or will it not matter?",RelationshipParty749,1hb2048,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hb2048/master_data_science_vs_quantitative_finance/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hb2048/master_data_science_vs_quantitative_finance/,2024-12-10 13:42:11,6,0.69,6,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hb2048

My proposal is to try to make a docker container and then try to figure out how to deploy the scoring model with the python code for feature engineering.

Where can i learn more about how to deploy this and what type of format do i need to deploy my models?

datascience,Classification threshold cost optimisation,"Say you’ve selected the best classifier for a particular problem, using threshold invariant metrics such as AUROC, Brier score, or log loss. 

It’s now time to choose the classification threshold. This will clearly depend on the use case and the cost/ benefits associated with true positives, false positives, etc. 

Often I see people advising to choose a threshold by looking at metrics such precision and recall. 

What I don’t see very often is people explicitly defining relative (or absolute, if possible) costs/ benefits of each cell in the confusion matrix (or more precisely the action that will be taken as a result). For example a true positive is worth $1000, a false positive -$500 and the other cells $0. 

You then optimise the threshold based on maximum benefit using a cost-threshold curve. The precision and recall can also be reported, but they are secondary to the benefit optimisation and not used directly in the choice. I find this much more intuitive and is my go-to.

datascience,Which of these two jobs should I take?,"I have the opportunity to take two jobs. One is for a senior BI analyst at a medium-sized sports betting company ($500M revenue) and the other is for a “reporting analyst” position with a large asset management firm (&gt;$1B revenue).

Here is my dilemma: 
- The BI analyst one involves a lot more data science  methodology and probably offers more direct advancement in this field

- The reporting analyst one is mostly focused on outreach and data collection (calling member banks and whatnot) to report investment data to supervisors 

- however, I would prefer to work in the financial industry long term as I enjoy economic data more and enjoy the idea of working within capital 
Markets and economic planning. I’m worried that if I take the sports betting role, I wont be able to pivot into this field later on.

I would appreciate any and all advice.

datascience,Why hasn't forecasting evolved as far as LLMs have?,"Forecasting is still very clumsy and very painful. Even the models built by major companies -- Meta's Prophet and Google's Causal Impact come to mind -- don't really succeed as one-step, plug-and-play forecasting tools. They miss a lot of seasonality, overreact to outliers, and need a lot of tweaking to get right.

It's an area of data science where the models that I build on my own tend to work better than the models I can find.

LLMs, on the other hand, have reached incredible versatility and usability. ChatGPT and its clones aren't necessarily perfect yet, but they're definitely way beyond what I can do. Any time I have a language processing challenge, I know I'm going to get a better result leveraging somebody else's model than I will trying to build my own solution.

Why is that? After all the time we as data scientists have put into forecasting, why haven't we created something that outperforms what an individual data scientist can create?

datascience,Peaking too early with my job title,"I was given the title of Director of Data  after only 3 years of being a Data Analyst.

I am a one-man department in a company of ~30 employees with ~$6-7 million in revenue/yr. I only recently hired a direct report part-time to assist with some of the more mundane tasks.

I was given the title because I routinely deal with executives. The management at my company wants them to view me more as an equal rather than reaching out to them and they just forward to me anyways to complete the data request.

While I enjoy the pay bump and increase in autonomy, my goal is to work as an individual contributor at a high level (DA or DS) as I do not want to deal with direct reports if possible. Especially not ones that have to be micromanaged. 

I've noticed since my title change ~2 years ago recruiters reach out to me asking me to hire candidates rather than approaching me as a candidate. This makes me think this job title may be too early as I am not even 30 yet and I am not ready to settle into a management role long-term.

Has anyone else had a similar experience and how did you deal with it? I am in a situation where my employer would be willing to essentially give me whatever title I want if I left on good terms when  a company calls for a reference.

Edit: for any new comments, I do not claim to be a Data Scientist. My role is a mix of data analyst and data engineer as I do both Ad Hoc analysis and manage our SQL database.

Because I'm already getting paid around 120k, I would likely need to move into a Senior Data Analyst or entry level Data Scientist role to maintain my salary. And I likely could only enter a DS role after I finish my Masters in Data Science as my Bachelors is in Finance and my Python skills are still in the early stages.",Inception952,1h5yiul,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5yiul/peaking_too_early_with_my_job_title/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5yiul/peaking_too_early_with_my_job_title/,2024-12-03 21:20:43,197,0.91,197,0,74,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5yiul
datascience,Sales Engineering vs Data Science vs Product Management,"Hi, I’m at the beginning of my career. Currently, my main focus has been to get into data science (product side), then maybe in the future decide to become a PM or stay in DS, depending on the role and company I get. Recently, I came across a company hiring for a Sales Engineer position. The company is a SaaS for data science, so I researched the role and felt I would like it. I do enjoy working with people, presenting things, and public speaking if required. I’ve heard the pay is pretty good in sales engineering too.
However, I was wondering if I didn’t like it after a few months or years, would it be possible to come back to product or data science? I do like the data science field as I’m curious about finding insights, solving problems, and on the product side, improving user experiences and creating new features. I’ve been looking for an opportunity since last year and haven’t been able to land a job, not even as an analyst. So my fear is if I get into sales engineering (I’m only interested in this particular firm for this role), would it be hard to get back into the industry? I’m currently working as a volunteer data science to maintain visa, so not like I will be leaving actual DS job. Also, I don’t know if I will get the role for SE as well, but wanted to decide as I have someone who will refer me and i feared that it would look bad when I ask them for referral for data science role (in future as they don’t have any open role now for DS). 
Also, in the long term, I was thinking if money is the biggest driver for me, which would be better? Additionally, I’m an international on a STEM visa in the US. So, how hard is it for other firms to sponsor a sales engineering role?

datascience,Reducing the amount of stream of consciousness info dumping from stakeholders.,"A huge part of this job is working with stakeholders to take their grand ideas and make them a reality. Naturally, there's gonna be trial and error, dead ends, talking through different approaches, and that's all fine. That's not what I'm complaining about. 

The problem is that these stakeholders are higher up in the company and they're just strapped for time. They don't think about the things they ask me to do until I'm actually in a meeting with them, then it turns into a lot of ""yeah let's do it this way, no actually that won't work, wait no it will disregard that just do it the first way"".... I'm sitting here with a pen and paper or onenote open trying to catch everything and I just simply can't. I've tried to  summarize at the end of meetings what the next steps are that we've settled on, and it's intended to be a yes/no question but it just ends up turning into another stream of consciousness info dump that leaves me with more questions than answers.

Often times I run into simple questions as I'm working through a project. They're yes/no or not much more involved than that, but whenever I try to email or chat with a stakeholder they ALWAYS want to just meet and then what should've been a 30 second call ends up going past the hour mark, and I'm left with more questions than I started with and now I have to burn more time trying to make sense of the notes I just took. That's not even considering that 50% of the time when they get me on the call there's a ""oh by the way since you're here can you do this project as well"". 

This has the effect of disincentivizing me from seeking guidance. Furthermore, I never actually get projects over the finish line because every time I pass off my results there's millions of changes and updates that I'm asked to do. I used to be a very proactive person in school and in more junior jobs, I used to get things done ahead of time. But not anymore, If I finish a project ahead of time they'll just scope creep it to death, vs if I just sit on it and pass it off right before the deadline, they'll be forced to accept that it's good enough and just take it. I'm also being disincentivized to work efficiently. 

The biggest part of my job is stenography. I'm not even exaggerating. 

I know you guys are going to say it sounds like a culture problem, but it has been like this in the last 3 DS positions I've had at different companies. As I said, I think the root of the problem is that the stakeholders are strapped for time,  but in a world of ""streamlining headcount"", I don't really see that changing.

datascience,PowerBI is making me think about jumping ship,"As my work for the coming year is coming into focus, there is a heavy emphasis on building customer-facing ETL pipelines and dashboards. My team has chosen PowerBI as its dashboarding application of choice. Compared to building a web-app based dashboard with plotly dash or the like, making PowerBI dashboards is AGONIZING. I'm able to do most data transformations with SQL beforehand, but having to use powerquery or god forbid DAX for a viz-specific transformation feels like getting a root canal. I can't stand having to click around Microsoft's shitty UI to create plots that I could whip up in a few lines of code. 

I'm strongly considering looking for a new opportunity and jumping ship solely to avoid having to work with PowerBI. I'm also genuinely concerned about my technical skills decaying while other folks on my team get to continue working on production models and genAI hotness.

Have done an 8 week Software Engineering internship (focused on fullstack JS/TS stack.)

Have done 2 months Internship as a ""Data Science intern"" but it was focused on web scraping, cleaning data obtained through an API to generate market leads, building proof of concept LLM applications using Langchain and Google Gemini/OpenAI API keys.

datascience,Is any of you doing actual ML work here?,"I'm really passionate and i love the mathematics of machine learning, especially the one in deep learning. I do have experience with training DL models, genetic algo hyperparameter tuning, distribution based models/clustering (KL div, EM), combining models or building them from scratch, implementing complex ones in C from zero, signal analysis, visualizations, and other things.

I work in a FAANG, but most of the work is actually data engineering and statistics. At first I was given the chance to work on a bit of ML, but that was just for me to have the motivation to learn the already existing systems, because no one in the entire department does any ML, and now I'm only getting engineering/statistics projects.

I had jobs in the past at startups where the CEO would tell me to hard code IFs instead of training a decision tree for different tasks.

They all just want ""the simplest solution"", and I fully agree with the approach, except that the simplest possible approach is not an actual solution some of the time. We may need to add in some complexity to solve different tasks, but most managers/bosses I've encountered have been terrified by any actual ML/mathematics. I agree that explainable and low risk high reward are the best approaches, but not if your ""low risk"" solution is hardcoding hundred of if statements instead of a decision tree, man.

Is it because I'm from Europe and not US? I've been told by HR that we're inferior and that ideas only come from the US and to keep my head down more instead of proposing projects before.

I'm a very tryhard and hard working person, but I just can't perform in a job where the task is to put together two SQL software pieces built 10 years ago in a rush and with zero documentation...... And my bosses refuse to understand that. Sure, I can do some of it, the job does not need to be perfect. But not if that is 100% of the job.

datascience,Daily averaged time series comparison -Linking plankton and aerosols emissions?,"Hi everyone, so we have this dataset of daily averaged pytoplankton time series over a full year; coccolithophores, chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, phaecocystis, zooplankton.  
Then we have atmospheric measurements on the same time intervals of a few aerosols species; Methanesulphonic acid, carboxylic acids, aliphatics, sulphates, ammonium, nitrates etc...  
Our goal is to establish all the possible links between plankton types and aerosols, we want to find out which planktons matter the most for a given aerosols species.

So here is my question; Which mathematical tools would you use to build a model with these (nonlinear) time series? Random Forest, cross-wavelets, transfer entropy, fractals analysis, chaos theory, Bayesian statistics? The thing that puzzle me most is that we know there is a lag between the plankton bloom and aerosols eventually forming in the atmosphere, it can take weeks for a bloom to trigger aerosols formation, so far many studies have just used lagged Pearson´s correlation, which I am not too happy with as correlation really isn´t reliable, would you know of any advanced methods to find out the optimal lag? What would be the best approach in your opinion?  
I would really appreciate any ideas, so please don´t hesitate to write down yours and I´d be happy to debate it, have a nice Sunday, cheers :)",Pleromakhos,1h4080y,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h4080y/daily_averaged_time_series_comparison_linking/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h4080y/daily_averaged_time_series_comparison_linking/,2024-12-01 10:08:42,11,0.87,11,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4080y

datascience,"Large scale video processing help
","I want to extract CLIP embeddings from 40k videos at a certain frame rate. To do this there are three main things I need to do, which are to first read the video to extract frames, preprocess the frames using the CLIP Image processor and use CLIP itself to extract the embeddings. The first two operations are cpu heavy and the last one is gpu heavy.

One option to do this would be to use Spark with a cluster of T4 machines, with more cores and RAM, that reads a chunk of the video, preprocesses it and encodes it using CLIP. But if I was to do that sometimes the GPU would be idle and sometimes the CPU would not be used to it's full potential.

What would be the best way to solve this issue? Note that if I was to split this into two tasks I would need to store the preprocessed video frames and that seems overkill because it be around 100 TB of storage (yeah, mp4 really compresses videos well). Is there a way to do this processing using two different kinds of machines on the same cluster? One that is CPU and RAM heavy and one that has a GPU?

I'm sure this could be achieves with Kubernetes, but that seems overkill for this task. Is there an easy way to do this with Spark? Should this even be done with Spark?

The most exciting part for me is improved dataframe support:

\- previously, if Plotly received non-pandas input, it would convert it to pandas and then continue

\- now, you can also pass in Polars DataFrame / PyArrow Table / cudf DataFrame and computation will happen natively on the input object without conversion to pandas. If you pass in a DuckDBPyRelation, then after some pruning, it'll convert it to PyArrow Table. This cross-dataframe support is achieved via [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals)

For plots which involve grouping by columns (e.g. \`color='symbol', size='market'\`) then performance is often 2-3x faster when starting with non-pandas inputs. For pandas inputs, performance is about the same as before (it should be backwards-compatible)

datascience,Math Question on logistic regression and boundary classification from Andrew Ngs Coursera course,"I'm following Andrew Ngs Machine Learning specialisation on Coursera, FYI.

If the value of the sigmoid function is greater than 0.5, the classification model would predict y\_hat = 1 or ""true"".

However, when using more complex functions inside of the sigmoid function, e.g. an ellipse:

1 / (1 + e^(-z)) where z = x1^(2)/a^(2)   \+   x2^(2)/b^(2)   \-1

in order to define the classification boundary, Andrew says that the model would predict y\_hat = 1 for points inside of the boundary. However, based on my understanding of the lecture, as long as the threshold is 0.5, and you're predicting y\_hat = 1 for any points where the sigmoid function evaluates to &gt;= 0.5 then it should be points **outside** the boundary.

I have to build an optimization algorithm on a domain I have not worked in before (price sensitivity based, revenue optimization)

datascience,Is Freelancing as a Data Scientist Even Possible for Beginners?,"Hi everyone,

I’m new to data science and considering freelancing. I’m fine working for as low as $15/hour, so earnings aren’t a big concern for me. I’ve gone through past Reddit posts, but they mostly discuss freelancing from the perspective of income. My main concern is whether freelancing in data science is practical for someone like me, given its unique challenges.

A bit about my background: I’ve completed 3-4 real-world data science projects, not on toy datasets, but actual data (involving data scraping, cleaning, visualization, modeling, deployment, and documentation). I’ve also worked as an intern in the NLP domain.

Some issues I’ve been thinking about:

1. Domain Knowledge and Context: How hard is it to deliver results without deep understanding of a client’s business?


2. Resource Limitations: Do freelancers struggle with accessing data, computing power, or other tools required for advanced projects?


3. Collaboration Needs: Data science often requires working with teams. Can freelancers integrate effectively with cross-functional groups?


4. Iterative and Long-Term Nature: Many projects require ongoing updates and monitoring. Is this feasible for freelancers?


5. Trust and Accountability: How do freelancers convince clients to trust them with sensitive or business-critical work?


6. Client Expectations: Do clients expect too much for too little, especially at low wages?



I’m also open to any tips, advice, or additional concerns beyond these points. Are these challenges solvable for a beginner? Have any of you faced and overcome similar issues? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I wrote a guide on discrete-event simulation with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to help you learn how to build simulations using Python. Kind of like the official documentation but on steroids.

I have used SimPy personally in my own career for over a decade, it was central in helping me build a [pretty successful engineering career](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1gh8at0/my_13_year_nontraditional_meche_career_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling real world industrial systems such as factories, mines, railways, etc.

My latest venture is teaching others all about this.

datascience,OGI - An Open Source Framework for General Intelligence ,"Dan and I often found ourselves deep in conversation about the future of artificial intelligence, particularly how we could create a system that mimics human cognition. Our discussions revolved around the limitations of current AI models, which often operate in silos and lack the flexibility of human thought. 

From these chats, we conceptualized the **Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework**, which aims to integrate various processing modules that can dynamically adjust based on the task at hand. We drew inspiration from how the human brain processes information—using interconnected modules that specialize in different functions while still working together seamlessly.

Our brainstorming sessions were filled with ideas about creating a more adaptable AI that could handle multiple data types and switch between cognitive processes effortlessly. This collaborative effort not only sparked innovative concepts but also solidified our vision for a more intelligent and reliable AI system.

datascience,Doubts on credit scorecard devlopment ,"So I had a few questions when I was learning about score cards and how how they are made etc, and I came accross a few questions that I would like to discuss on.


1). Why do we have Policy as a critical part of underwriting when Scorecard can technically address all aspects related to credit risk (e.g., if Ag&lt;18 is a decline as per lender policy, we can put a very low score for Age&lt;18 and it would automatically be declined. Hence, Scorecard can cover Policy parameters also.)? Do we really need to have Policy? What purpose does it serve?

2. One lender (a client of a credit bureau) uses Personal Loan scorecard with very high Gini. However, the client experienced very high default rate on low-income customers who had high custom score. Under what circumstance is it possible? Or it is not a possibility?

3. Should Fraud be checked as top of funnel in underwriting or should it be done at the end of the underwriting funnel?


My answers are as follows :-
Ans 1) even if I give a very low score to applicants under 18, it is still possible for that applicant to score high on other parameters and come accross as a good customer contradictory to my policy which states that I have to reject him.

Ans2)I think the answer to this is that the model is overfitting,Maybe the score card when being developed did not have enough data on low income customer so the model is not able to discriminate between the low income and other income levels of customer so it's overfitting when it is validated.

Ans3)fraud must be checked as early as possible so that , fraudulent customers are rejected outright to avoid wasting resourcess on those customers.

This is my take on the questions, I would love to hear yours.

Also if you guys know any resources (books,videos etc) that goes in the detail about scorecard devlopment etc.


Thanks In advance.


Thanks for your replies, I am still having a hard time understanding some of the answers , so I will elaborate a bit more as maybe I didn't frame my questions properly.

Q1) let's say I don't want to provide loans to people in certain regions..let's say a war torn country, but the individuals of the region have a good credit history and they seem to pay back their loans. But I have a policy that says I can't operate in this region , can I not price this risk accordingly in my scorecard?so does this undermine the need for policy.

Q2)For the second question, what I wanted to ask was is as follows  let's say I have built a model with a high gini , but let's say that for a lot of low income individuals for whom my scorecard gave a high custom score , turned out to be defaulters. Is this possible and if so, why does this happen? Was the income relationship too complex to capture? Is my model overfitting? 

Q3)what is the loan underwriting process ? What is fraud risk and credit risk ? As per my understanding fraud risk eventually becomes credit risk , hence checking fraud must be the first thing to do when underwriting.

Now for my training set, I was thinking of using customer data from the past 12-months. In that twelve months, I will have customers that have churned in that time and customers that have not. Since I am looking to predict churns in the next month, should my training set consist of lost client and non-lost customers in each month for the past twelve month where if a customers has not churned at all in the past year, I would have 12 records for that same customer and the features about that customer as of the given month? Or would I only have one record for the customer that has not churned and remained active and the features for that client would be as of the last month in my twelve month window?

datascience,Help choosing between two job offers,"Hello everyone, I’m a recent graduate (September 2024) with a background in statistics, and I’ve been applying for jobs for the past three months. After countless applications and rejections, I’ve finally received two offers but seeing my luck they came two days apart, and I’m unsure which to choose.

1/ AI Engineer (Fully Remote): This role focuses on building large language models (LLMs). It's more of a technical role.

2/ Marketing Scientist (Office-based): This involves applying data analytics to marketing-related problems focusing on regression models. It's more of a client facing role.

While my background is in statistics, I’ve done several internships and projects in data science. I’m leaning toward the AI engineer role mainly because the title and experience seem to offer better future growth opportunities. However, I’m concerned about the fully remote aspect because i'm young and value in-person interactions, like building relationships with colleagues and being part of a workplace community.

Does anyone have experience in similar roles or faced a similar dilemma? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

datascience,"Does anyone function more as a ""applied scientist"" but have no research background?","**TLDR: DS profile is shifting to be more ML heavy, but lack research experience to compete with ML specialists.**

I've been a DS for several years, mostly in jack-of-all-trades functions: large-scale pipeline building, ad-hoc/bespoke statistical modeling for various stakeholders, ML applications, etc. More recently, I've started on a lot more GenAI/LLM work alongside applied scientists. Leaving aside the negativity on LLM hype, most of the AS folks have heavy research backgrounds: either PhDs or publications, attendance at conferences like ICLR, CVPR, NeurIPS, etc. I don't have any research experience except for a short stint in a lab during grad school but was never published. Luckily my AS peers have treated me as their own, which is good from credibility perspective.

That said, when I look at the market, DS jobs are either heavy on product analytics (hypothesis testing, experimentation, product sense, etc.) or DA/BI (dashboards, reporting, vis, etc.). The ones that are ML-heavier generally want much more research experience and involvement. I can explain the theory behind transformers, attention, decoders vs. encoders, etc. but I have zero publications and wouldn't stand a chance against people with much deeper ML research experience.

datascience,How do you mange the full DS/ML lifecycle ?,"Hi guys! I’ve been pondering with a specific question/idea that I would like to pose as a discussion, it concerns the idea of more quickly going from idea to production with regards to ML/AI apps.

My experience in building ML apps and whilst talking to friends and colleagues has been something along the lines of you get data, that tends to be really crappy, so you spend about 80% of your time cleaning this, performing EDA, then some feature engineering including dimension reduction etc. All this mostly in notebooks using various packages depending on the goal. During this phase there are couple of tools that one tends to use to manage and version data e.g DVC etc

Thereafter one typically connects an experiment tracker such as MLFlow when conducting model building for various metric evaluations. Then once consensus has been reached on the optimal model, the Jupyter Notebook code usually has to be converted to pure python code and wrapped around some API or other means of serving the model. Then there is a whole operational component with various tools to ensure the model gets to production and amongst a couple of things it’s monitored for various data and model drift.

Now the ecosystem is full of tools for various stages of this lifecycle which is great but can prove challenging to **operationalize** and as we all know sometimes the results we get when adopting ML can be supar :(

I’ve been playing around with various platforms that have the ability for an end-to-end flow from cloud provider platforms such as AWS SageMaker, Vertex , Azure ML. Popular opensource frameworks like MetaFlow and even tried DagsHub. With the cloud providers it always feels like a jungle, clunky and sometimes overkill e.g maintenance. Furthermore when asking for platforms or tools that can really help one explore, test and investigate without too much setup it just feels lacking, as people tend to recommend tools that are great but only have one part of the puzzle. The best I have found so far is Lightning AI, although when it came to experiment tracking it was lacking.

So I’ve been playing with the idea of a truly out-of-the-box end-to-end platform, the idea is not to to re-invent the wheel but combine many of the good tools in an end-to-end flow powered by collaborative AI agents to help speed up the workflow across the ML lifecycle for faster prototyping and iterations. You can check out my initial idea over here [https://envole.ai](https://envole.ai)

datascience,Is Pandas Getting Phased Out?,"Hey everyone,

I was on statascratch a few days ago, and I noticed that they added a section for Polars. Based on what I know, Polars is essentially a better and more intuitive version of Pandas (correct me if I'm wrong!). 

With the addition of Polars, does that mean Pandas will be phased out in the coming years? 

And are there other alternatives to Pandas that are worth learning?

datascience,What’s the correct nonnulls % threshold to “save the column”? Regression model.,"I have a dataset that has many columns with nans, some with 97% non nulls, all continuous. I am using a regression model to fill nans with data from all other columns (obviously have to only use rows that don’t contain nan). I am happy to do this where non nulls range from 90-99%.

However, some features have just above half as non nulls. It ranges ie 51.99% - 61.58%. 

Originally I was going to just delete these columns as the data is so sparse. But now I am questioning myself, as I’d like to make my process here perfect.

If one has only 15% non nulls, let’s say, using a regression model to predict the remaining 85% seems unreasonable. But at 80-20 it seems fine. So my question: at what level can one still impute missing values to a column that is sparse?

datascience,Self Study or a Second Masters (free tuition) for Learning,"So background, I'm a Civil Engineer (BS+MS in Civil Engineering) who's been working in Traffic and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) with almost 7 years of experience. I've done regular civil design engineering at consulting firms, software product management at civil-tech companies and then ITS engineering at an autonomous vehicle start up where I dabbled in everything from design of the civil infrastructure, coordinating with tech teams on the hardware functionality and concepts of operation.

Now I'm back to an engineering firm where I'll be working in an intelligent transportation + data science group. I'll be working on more design side doing freeway ITS design, design and concept of operations of ""traffic tech"" pilot and will be working with my manager on getting ramped up into data science projects.

So about 2 years ago I got into OMSCS at GaTech a while back but had to drop due to some health issues, I just applied for readmissions (pay $30 and fill out a form). I'm also considering programs like EasternU's data science program or even taking OMSA classes while enrolled in OMSCS with the intent to apply and swap over to that. The reference to the free tuition is that my employer will happily pick up the tab as the degree is relevant to demand in our department.

So my question is do I suck it up with the CS degree (ML focus), swap to OMSA or consider just taking a faster option like EasternU's program? Or do I not even bother and pick up a few books and get at it on my own.

You try to assign to a column of a df2 = df1[df1['A']&gt; 1] you get a ""setting with copy warning"".

accidentally assign a column of length 69 to a data frame with 420 rows and it will eat it like it's nothing, if only index is partially matching.

You df.groupby? Sure, let me drop nulls by default for you, nothing interesting to see there!

You df.groupby.agg? Let me create not one, not two, but THREE levels of column name that no one remembers how to flatten.

Df.query? Let me by default name a new column resulting from aggregation to 0 and make it impossible to access in the query method even using a backtick.

Concatenating something? Let's silently create a mixed type object for something that used to be a date. You will realize it the hard way 100 transformations later.

Df.rename({0: 'count'})? Sure, let's rename row zero to count. It's fine if it doesn't exist too.

**Problems:**
- Single modality is dead. Real intelligence isn't just text/image/audio in isolation
- Another day, another LLM with 0.1% better benchmarks. Yawn
- Where's the novel architecture? All I see is parameter tuning
- Transfer learning still sucks
- Real-time adaptation? More like real-time hallucination

**The Challenge:**
1. Build systems that handle 3+ modalities in real-time. No more stitching modules together
2. Create models that learn from raw sensory input without massive pre-training
3. Push beyond transformers. What's the next paradigm shift?
4. Make models that can actually explain cross-modal reasoning
5. Solve spatial reasoning without brute force

**Bonus Points:**
- Few-shot learning that actually works
- Sublinear scaling with task complexity
- Physical world interaction that isn't a joke

However, I’m also considering applying to a handful of online masters programs (ranging from applied statistics, to data science, to analytics).

My reasoning is that:

a) I can keep my options open. Assuming I’m unable to land an internship or job, I would have a masters program for fall 2025 to attend. 

b) During an online masters I can continue applying to jobs and internships. I can decide whether I am a full time or part time student. If full time, most programs can be done in 12 months.

c) I feel like there’s no better time than now to get a masters. It’s hard to break into the field with a bachelors as is (or that’s how it seems to me) so an MS would make it easier. There’s also no job tying me down. 

d) I am not sure whether I wish to pursue a PhD. A masters would be good preparation for one if I do decide to do one.

datascience,How sound this clustering approach is? ,"Working on developing a process to create automated clusters based on fixed N number of features. For different samples relative importance of these features vary. To capture that variation, I have created feature weighted clusters (just to be clear not sample weighted).  Im running a supervised model to get the importance since I have a target that the features should optimize. 

Does this sound like a good approach? What are the potential loopholes/limitations? 

Also, side topic, Im running Kmeans and most of the times ending up with 2 optimal clusters (using silhouettescore) for different samples that I have tried. From manual checking it seems that there could be more than 2 meaningful clusters.

datascience,Non-Data Science Teams Going It Alone on DS Projects - what to do?,"My organization's DS shop is relatively small and lives entirely in the Analytics department. With myself, and my manager, being the only ones with the experience to take on DS oriented work.  Other teams have a growing appetite for DS solutions (running experiments, building predictive models, etc.) giving us some justification to grow our team. Overall, this is a positive development compared to a few years ago when much of this work was done through vendors/consultants.

However, we have noticed that some teams appear to be employing their own DS solution without any initial input from us. In some cases we have been pinged asking for guidance (like asking for a Power analysis or a more complicated Data pull), but in other cases we are brought on when something has gone wrong (like poorly randomized A/B testing or inability to conduct significance testing). My boss hasn't really pushed back on any of this opting to take a a wait and see approach as we ramp up our team; however, I am concerned this will lead to either a fractured DS culture or worse a shift of responsibility to another team. One thing I saw recently was one of these teams recruiting for a Sr. Data Scientist in all but title.

Personally, this is also a concern for me as it limits my ability to advance into a more Senior position. It also leaves our team leaving credit on the table. We are critical to these projects, but none of them have our ""label"" on it.

Is my boss right to take a reactive approach as we ramp up or is this a sign of a future inefficient Data Science culture at my org?

**Update**: My takeaway from this is to stick with my manager's plan to wait and see, try to push for a formalization of our team as the ""center of excellence"" team, and then flag/highlight DS's contribution/work vs the DS work adjacent teams are doing. Most of the comments seem to highlight this as an org issue rather than a team structure issue - which makes sense to me.",Illustrious-Mind9435,1gt52tv,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gt52tv/nondata_science_teams_going_it_alone_on_ds/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gt52tv/nondata_science_teams_going_it_alone_on_ds/,2024-11-17 03:55:19,48,0.84,48,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gt52tv

datascience,How to effectively use a data science team?,"Hi all! The situation is as follows: I have 5 data scientists in my team, and 5 business analysts. The team has grown from 4 to 10 people (ex. Manager) over the year and I think we're ready to take things to the next level.

We are part of the business, and the data scientists have different expertises besides statistics etc., for example data engineering, DevOps, web development, but also more soft skills such as presenting and networking.
Not unimportantly: data is available, and there a opportunities to get more data available if needed (e.g. automated extract from systems for easy use in other work)

Currently many of the dashboarding requests were dropped om the DS plate, but i want to push that workload go the business analists to make room for more interesting (and valuable) DS projects. 

For context, there are many other disciplines 'nearby' in the organisation, meaning its possible to get a project team with a process expert (when new/updated processes are needed), business analysts or system experts.

TL;DR: What's the best use of a data science team, that's part of a business team?

datascience,I built a full stack ai app as a Data scientist - Is Future Data science going to just be Full stack engineering?,"I recently built a SaaS web app that combines several AI capabilities: story generation using LLMs, image generation for each scene, and voice-over creation - all combined into a final video with subtitles. 

While this is technically an AI/Data Science project, building it required significant full-stack engineering skills. The tech stack includes: 

\- Frontend: Nextjs with Tailwind, shadcn, redux toolkit 

\- Backend: Django (DRF) 

\- Database: Postgres

  
After years in the field, I'm seeing Data Science and Software Engineering increasingly overlap. Companies like AWS already expect their developers to own products end-to-end. For modern AI projects like this one, you simply need both skill sets to deliver value.

The reality is, Data Scientists need to expand beyond just models and notebooks. Understanding API development, UI/UX principles, and web development isn't optional anymore - it's becoming a core part of delivering AI solutions at scale.

Some on this subreddit have gone ahead and called Data Scientists 'Cheap Software Engineers' - but the truth is, we're evolving into specialized full-stack developers who can build end-to-end AI products, not just write models in notebooks. That's where the value is at for most companies.

This is not to say that this is true for all companies, but for a good number, yes.

1. **Company A**: I made it to the final round, and the hiring manager explicitly said I was their top candidate, mentioning that my background fit their needs perfectly. My take-home assignment was positively reviewed, especially since I went above and beyond the requirements. The final interview also went well, and I was told to expect a decision within two weeks unless delays arose. However, after three weeks of no communication, I reached out to the hiring manager (my main contact), but received no reply. While I can understand if they chose another candidate, I didn’t anticipate being ghosted, particularly after what I thought was a strong rapport with the hiring manager. When I checked LinkedIn, I saw that the job posting was closed, but the position wasn’t filled. I wonder if the headcount was canceled.
2. **Company B**: I reached the final round for an internship with a full-time conversion potential. I met with the hiring manager in the first round and other team members in the second, both 30-minute conversations without technical questions, which surprised me. They mentioned I'd hear back within a week, but I only received a rejection two weeks later after reaching out myself. I later found a job post to hire an ""entry-level"" FTE with five years of experience instead. Initially, I applied for their senior data scientist role due to my doctoral background, so I’m left wondering if they were seeking someone with senior experience but at an entry-level salary.
3. **Company C**: I was contacted by a recruiter to complete a take-home assignment that felt more aligned with data analyst responsibilities. Despite my effort and confidence in the result, I was informed I wasn’t selected, with no feedback provided. I noticed the job posting was removed just after I received her email.

datascience,The coding issues data teams encounter are truly intriguing,"Hi, over the past 9 months, we have been working on Upsonic and have obtained some outputs from the discussions we've had. I would like to share these with you as well. If there are any points you disagree with, please feel free to write them down, I would be very happy about that🙏🏻

We conducted more than 300 interviews with data teams. During these conversations, we noticed that across different projects, around 30-40% of the code in their notebooks is repetitive and reusable.

The development-related problems of data teams are not clearly understood, and the problems also vary by location. It's like they are in a fog, and it's very hard to find a solution. We discovered these 3 main reasons for this problem in data teams:

1- The product for data teams is the output they get from the data, not the code. But in development, code is the product. There are best practices in the coding world, so if you are writing code, you need to adhere to these best practices as much as possible, regardless of your purpose. However, these practices and tools are developed for developers. That's why data teams struggle with using these tools in their development processes. Moreover, these tools are not compatible enough, and not everyone in the team is equally proficient with them.

2- While doing data exploration in Jupyter, they can't directly push the code to Git to share it. There is a diff issue between Git and Python/Jupyter. That's why they struggle with collaborative work.

3- Data scientists have many reusable components and things they can share, but the individual work culture affects the collaborative work culture. The same things are repeatedly done for the company.



After discovering these problems and their reasons, we built a function hub to facilitate collaborative work. We provide 3 key features that data teams need:

1- We allow teams to share their functions with teammates with a single command from within their notebooks. Other team members can pull the same function with a single command. 

2- We document everything that is pushed to the function hub, including the functions, commits, and release notes, so teams can understand each other's code. 

3- We use AI to read Jupyter files, find the reusable components, and send them to the platform. This way, even if the code quality is low, it can be refactored into a function and made available for the team to use.

Since there is no one with extensive DS experience in our team, we conducted 300 interviews. We are still continuing our research. I would love to hear your feedback.

datascience,Should I go for a CS degree with a Stats Minor or an Honours in CS for Data Science/ML?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a CS student trying to figure out the best route for a career in data science and machine learning, and I could really use some advice.

I’m debating between two options:

1. **CS with a Minor in Statistics** – This would let me dive deep into the stats side of things, covering areas like probability, regression, and advanced statistical analysis. I feel like this could be super useful for data science, especially when it comes to understanding the math behind the models.
2. **Honours in CS** – This option would allow me to take a few extra advanced CS courses and do a research project with a professor. I think the hands-on research experience might be really valuable, especially if I ever want to go more into the theoretical side of ML.

If my main goal is to get into data science and machine learning, which route do you think would give me a better foundation? Is it more beneficial to have that solid stats background, or would the extra CS courses and research experience give me an edge?",No-Brilliant6770,1gp8x38,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gp8x38/should_i_go_for_a_cs_degree_with_a_stats_minor_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gp8x38/should_i_go_for_a_cs_degree_with_a_stats_minor_or/,2024-11-12 01:16:57,21,0.8,21,0,44,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Education,self,t3_1gp8x38

After some preliminary research, it’s become clear that there are tons of different tests that a statistician would hypothetically need to know, and that understanding all of them without a masters or some additional schooling is infeasible.

However, with something like conversion rate or # of clicks, it would be same type of data every time (one caviat being a proportion vs a mean). So, give it to me straight: are the following formulas reliable for the vast majority of A/B testing situations, given same type of data?

datascience,"Company has DS team, but keeps hiring external DS consultants","TL;DR: How do I convince my hire-ups that our project proposals are good and our team can deliver when they constantly hire external DS contractors?

Hi all,

I'll soon be joining a team of data scientists at our parent company. I've had lots of contact with my future team, so I know what they're going through. The company is not tech (insurance), but is building a portfolio of data scientists. Despite skill and the potential existing in the team, the company keeps hiring consultants to come in and build solutions while ignoring their employees' opinions and project proposals. Some of these contractors are good, some laughably bad.

External developers and DS are given lots of leeway and trust. They can build in whatever tech stack they propose while ignoring any and all process and our eng team then has to pick up the pieces.

Our teams are often criticized for not delivering quickly enough, while contractors are said to iterate rapidly. I work in an industry with *a lot* of red tape. These contractors are often allowed to circumvent this. In turn, the internal DS team cannot gather enough experience to compete.

I guess my question is: how do I change this? I don't necessarily want to switch companies again so soon and I really do want to empower my (future) team to make their ideas and proposals heard.",Morpheyz,1gorxj3,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gorxj3/company_has_ds_team_but_keeps_hiring_external_ds/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gorxj3/company_has_ds_team_but_keeps_hiring_external_ds/,2024-11-11 13:16:12,153,0.96,153,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Projects,self,t3_1gorxj3

datascience,Luxxify Makeup Recommender,"# [Luxxify Makeup Recommender](https://luxxify.streamlit.app/)

Hey everyone,

I(F23), am a master's student who recently designed a makeup recommender system. I created the Luxxify Makeup Recommender to generate personalized product suggestions tailored to individual profiles based on skin tone, type, age, makeup coverage preference, and specific skin concerns. The recommendation system uses a RandomForest with Linear Programming, trained on a custom dataset I gathered using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4. The project is deployed on a scalable Streamlit app.

Feel free to use the dataset I created for your own projects!

# Technical Details

* **Web Scraping:** Product and review data are scraped from [Ulta](https://www.ulta.com/), which is a popular e-commerce site for cosmetics. This raw data serves as the foundation for a robust recommendation engine, with a custom scraper built using requests, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup4. Selenium was used to perform button click and scroll interactions on the Ulta site to dynamically load data. I then used requests to access specific URLs from XHR GET requests. Finally, I used BeautifulSoup4 for scraping static text data.
* **Leveraging PostgreSQL UDFs For Feature Extraction**: For data management, I chose [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for its scalability and efficient storage capabilities. This allowed me to leverage Postgres querying to unroll complex JSON data. I also coded Python PostgreSQL UDFs to make feature engineering more scalable. I cached the computed word embedding vectors to speed up similarity calculations for repeated queries.
* **NLP and Feature Engineering:** I extracted Key features using Word2Vec word embeddings from Reddit makeup discussions (https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/). I did this to incorporate makeup domain knowledge directly into the model. Another reason I did this is to avoid using LLM models which are very expensive. I compared the text to pre-selected phrases using cosine distance. For example, I have one feature that compares reviews and products to the phrase ""glowy dewey skin"". This is a useful feature for makeup recommendation because it indicates that a customer may want products that have moisturizing properties. This allowed me to tap into consumer insights and user preferences across various demographics, focusing on features highly relevant to makeup selection.

These are my feature importances. To select this features, I performed a manual management along with stepwise selection. The features that contain the \_review suffix are all from consumer reviews. The remaining features are from the product details.

[Graph of Feature Importances](https://preview.redd.it/9zblqwmz8b0e1.png?width=2036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61ee1d186f9e53f209e010d107caa12b442d616f)

* **Cross Validation and Sampling:** I employed a Random Forest model because it's a good all-around model, though I might re-visit this. Any other model suggestions are welcome!! Due to the class imbalance with many reviews being five-stars, I utilized a mixed over-sampling and under-sampling strategy to balance class diversity. This allowed me to improve F1 scores across different product categories, especially those with lower initial representation. I also randomly sampled mutually exclusive product sets for train/test splits. This helped me avoid data leakage.
* **Linear Programming for Constraints:** I used linear programming (OrTools) to add budget and category level constraints. This allowed me to add a rule based layer on top of the RandomForest. I included domain knowledge based rules to help with product category selection.

# Future Improvements

* **Enhanced NLP Features:** I want to experiment with more advanced NLP models like BERT or other transformers to capture deeper insights from beauty reviews. I am currently using bag-of-words for everything.
* **User Feedback Integration:** I want to allow users to rate recommendations, creating a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.
* **Add Causal Discrete Choice Model:** I also want to add a causal discrete choice model to capture choices across the competitive landscape and causally determine why customers select certain products. I am thinking about using a nested logit model and ensemble it with our existing model. I think nested logit will help with products being in a hierarchy due to their categorization. It also lets me account for implied based a consumer choosing not to buy a specific product. I would love suggestions on this!!
* **Implement Computer Vision Based Features:** I want to extract CV based features from image and video review data. This will allow me to extract more fine grained demographic information.
