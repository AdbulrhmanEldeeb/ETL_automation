Physics,I still don't understand buoyancy,"Especially for gases inside liquids, I get the elementary explanation where the density of the gas is lesser, so it floats.

But I don't get it intuitively. Like how does a gas bubble know which way is up if released from the depths of the oceans if the pressure is practically the same above and below the bubble? 

Is it negligible pressure difference between the above and below that drives buoyancy?",Karkiplier,1hevap3,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hevap3/i_still_dont_understand_buoyancy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hevap3/i_still_dont_understand_buoyancy/,2024-12-15 15:47:58,2,1.0,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hevap3

A few years ago we held a graduate student panel, where many recently accepted grad students answered questions about the application process.  That [thread is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3i5d4u/graduate_student_panel_fall_2015_1_ask_your/), and has a lot of great information in it.
