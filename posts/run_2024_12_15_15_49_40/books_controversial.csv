books,which book made you DNF at page 1?,"not out of boredom, but something that makes you go nope!

i was really looking forward to reading the brief and wondrous life of oscar wao, because I saw so many vague reviews claiming it's the best book they have ever read.

on page 1, while describing the (real) dictator and his crimes against women - as something trivial or worse a flex, 
even humourously by a man.

books,How to step outside your book comfort zone more?,"So I’ll step outside it a little but not usually and while obviously if it’s my comfort zone that means I love it but still I need to branch out I feel.

My book comfort zone is Romantsy, found family trope, and enemies to lovers. 

It’s to the point where like every book I open has the same layout of young woman who is strong but deep down is broken by her traumatic past and there’s magic and a training arc and oh wow she has magic now and the guy who seemed so tough on the outside who she hated but now theres some feelings there. And ofc a whole found family that is just like her with traumatic passes and magic and are so badass and hot and cool in a laid back way and would do anything for each other. I mean I just eat it up every time! 

It’s the adult version of the type of books I devoured as a child. It’s magic but also there’s sex and trauma and the stakes are way higher lol.

Oh and how can I forget I also love Gods and different mythology elements and just all that.

But I do think it’s time to maybe branch out a little bit more than I do. I think I could be convinced to take a leap into horror, probably not regular romance, and I’m ok with historical fiction (it’s still better with magic though). We can’t scare me away here though ok nothing too modern and calm ok no romcoms.

You know I just how do y’all stop reading practically the same book every time?

Not every book needs to be 500+ pages of magic and fighting and love and break my heart! I say as I just ordered another of that exact type…",MooMooTheDummy,1hekfy9,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hekfy9/how_to_step_outside_your_book_comfort_zone_more/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hekfy9/how_to_step_outside_your_book_comfort_zone_more/,2024-12-15 04:01:10,10,0.68,10,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hekfy9
books,The Long Walk by Stephen King ,"Now, first I want to say the book is pretty good BUT I have one major, glaring issue with the book. The whole premise of the book is that these boys are walking for miles and miles and if they drop below a certain pace they get a warning. After three warnings the boy is shot and killed. Okay, that’s a great premise and I loved the execution of the story! Here’s my one issue….the walking pace is set to 4mph. For anyone who has been on a treadmill would soon find out, four miles per hour is a breakneck walk. In the book I am often picturing boys just barely shuffling along at the minimum speed, and some boys end up crawling for a time at the right speed!! I’m on a treadmill as I write this walking at a reasonable 3mph and the guy next to me is jogging at 4mph. I just remembered this main plot point in that book and how much it bothered me and apparently still bothers me. Unless Stephen King has an amazing walking pace, I don’t think he ever stepped on a treadmill to see if his main plot point even made sense…",DanielGaff,1he8orv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he8orv/the_long_walk_by_stephen_king/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he8orv/the_long_walk_by_stephen_king/,2024-12-14 18:10:12,116,0.84,116,0,78,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1he8orv

books,How did you get into your favorite genre?,"I read a lot of fantasy.  I was just thinking about how I got into fantasy.  Some 30 years ago in my early high school years I was reading Stephen King.   I read Tommyknockers and Needful Things,  then I stumbled across The Eyes of the Dragon and LOVED it.  While reading it, my uncle bought me the first book in the Dragon King trilogy by Stephen R. Law Lawhead which I devoured and then followed it with his Pendragon Cycle.

books,"Paradise Lost (John Milton, 1608-1674)","So, I have been reading Paradise Lost by John Milton again for a while now, and I can fully say that I am enamored with this book. Ever since reading Milton a couple of years ago I have been captivated by his sheer prose and poetic works. Two years ago I bought Paradise Lost, a Poem that I've grown to love and to place in the literary Parnassus along with Dante, Virgil, Ovid, Shakespeare and other major works of ancient and modern literature.

Paradise Lost was written during a time of political and literary upheval in Britain (Civil War, execution of Charles I, rule of Lord Protector Cromwell over Britain until his death in 1658, the Restoration of King Charles II), and so many themes about Monarchy and Republicanism can be found in it. Milton composed this work when he was already blind (he became blind in 1652) with the help of friends and amanuenses, and he sold the rights of the poem in 1667 for only 10£ (Milton was severely impoverished by the time he concluded the poem in 1665). Either way, this Poem placed him in the Parnassus of English poets and went on to place him on the pedestal of many romantic writers in the 1800's (most notably William Blake, Lord Byron, John Keats, etc...). 

Paradise Lost describes the struggle of Satan (show in comparison with Achilles, Aeneas, Odysseus, etc.), following the Epic tradition of Homer and other Greek Poets. The Poem begins with an invocation to a muse (but Milton skilfully puts Urania, the Muse of Astronomy and Divine Wisdom, instead of the classical muses), and the poem begins with the fall of Satan and all of the other rebel angels after the angelic war in Heaven. Satan resolves to cause chaos on God's new creation (Earth) and on God's newfound race: Humanity. He sneaks inside the Garden of Eden and whispers into Eve's ear when she is sleeping, but he gets caught by Michael and other celestial angels. 

The plan is slowly set in motion: Eve, frightened, searchs for comfort in Adam's arms; Raphael, one of God's Archangels, describes the dangers of Satan to Adam and the celestial war that was fought in Heaven to save Heaven from the yoke of the terrible apostate angel. Eve, meanwhile, is approached by Satan (in the guise of a snake) and is tempted into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge, causing the original sin and the fall of man from Eden. Adam, seeing Eve eat the fruit, decides to share the guilt of the sin togheter with his wife (which he himself had requested as a ""consort""), ultimately getting condemned by God to work the fields, for they will never give Adam the fruits that he had freely enjoyed in the Garden of Eden; Eve is condemened to suffer through the pains of childbirth. The poem ends on a soft note though, as Adam can find a ""Paradise within thee, happier far"". 

This is honestly one of the best works in English literature that I have ever read, and I want to know more from people who live in the United Kingdom themselves. What do you think about this Epic Poem? Is it good? Is it bad?",Justanotheryankee-12,1heb6e5,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1heb6e5/paradise_lost_john_milton_16081674/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1heb6e5/paradise_lost_john_milton_16081674/,2024-12-14 20:04:01,32,0.88,32,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heb6e5
books,"Just finished Let the Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist, some questions","As the title says. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride but had a few things that stood out to me as either I missed something, or that were a wrinkle for me in the story's consistency. A lot can be left up to imagination, certainly, but some things felt unintentionally missing. 

&gt;!1: Elias has to ""turn off"" Jocke after biting him. Those he does not disconnect this way become infected, indicating that saliva as well as blood transmits the disease. Though the wound is made with a razor, Elias drinks directly from Tommy. How was Tommy not infected?!&lt;

&gt;!2: Elias sleeping in a bathtub full of blood raised a lot of questions. Where did the blood come from and what was it's purpose? Elias needed to consume relatively fresh blood, and there was nothing I found indicating either Hakan or Elias getting hold of so much, certainly not in a short time span as to be ""fresh"". So then was it Elias' from the wound in his back, or something similar to how he began emptying out when not invited into Oskar's apartment - like he rests in his own blood that seeps out of him? If that was the case, it was all lost when Lacke ran it down the drain which seems would have left Elias severely weakened. And, did the wound in the back come from the fight with zombie Hakan? The other damage suffered in that scene seemed to be mostly correcting itself before Elias had even left the basement.!&lt;

&gt;!3: Probably the biggest, as it's a sizeable element of the story, why was Elias acting as a girl? What's more, how did he even come to be infected? The initial vampire - the royal pervert - had Elias castrated and bled from the wound into a bowl, drinking from that. How then was Elias infected? And, more complicated because I get the idea that, *should anyone look down there* it might be an easier explanation to start from the premise of being a girl. But given what Elias is capable of, who is going to be inspecting him to find out? And, anyone who was allowed/able to inspect would find exactly what Oskar saw, a flat nothing space with a scar. So then, what's the value of acting as though he's a girl, unless as a means of manipulation - which really doesn't work because Hakan liked little boys.!&lt;

Thoughts? Opinions? I do try to be attentive in my reading, though can be distracted at times and able to miss details. Are any of these easily explained or am I raising similar questions now for others who read the book also?",dl00lIl00lb,1helwf3,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1helwf3/just_finished_let_the_right_one_in_by_john_ajvide/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1helwf3/just_finished_let_the_right_one_in_by_john_ajvide/,2024-12-15 05:32:25,10,0.79,10,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1helwf3
