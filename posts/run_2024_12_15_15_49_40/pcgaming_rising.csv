pcgaming,"PC gaming in 2024: Revenue numbers closing in on matching Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo combined ","https://www.statista.com/statistics/278181/global-gaming-market-revenue-device/

PC gaming revenue in 2024 is 43.2 billion compared to combined console revenue of 51.9, only about a 20 percent difference.

 https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/2023-pc-games-revenue-increase-newzoo/

PC gaming is also growing much faster than console gaming. Consoles are almost stagnant in revenue while PC grows. 

In 5-10 years, it's easy to see how PC will be bigger than all the consoles combined.

pcgaming,Swen Vincke's (Baldur's Gate 3 Director) TGAs speech was remarkable,"Last night at The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, the director of Baldur's Gate 3 gave a shocking speech that put's many things into perspective about the video game industry.

This is what he said:

""The Oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by a studio, a studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage. It's stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost. Studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves. They created it because it hadn't been created before.

They didn't make it to increase market share. They didn't make it to serve as a brand. They didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if they didn't meet those targets.

And furthermore, the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design. They didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet. They didn't treat their players as users to exploit. And they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics.

They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow. They were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun. And they realized that if the developers didn't have fun, nobody was going to have any fun. They understood the value of respect, that if they treated their developers and players well, those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned. But above all, they cared about their game because they loved games. It's really that simple, said the Oracle.""

ü§î This reminds me of a quote I heard from David Brevik, the creator of Diablo, many years ago, that stuck with me forever, in which he said that he did that game because it was the game he wanted to play, but nobody had made it.

‚ùå He was rejected by many publishers because the market was terrible for CRPGs at the time, until Blizzard, being a young company led by gamers, decided to take the project in. Rest is history!

‚úÖ If anybody has updated insight on how to make a game described in that speech, it is Swen.

pcgaming,Car / Driving Game,"Greetings strangers!

Wondering whether such a car driving game exists on the market (pc platform only):

- featuring a large open world instead of track to track / map to map

- just driving a car around chilling and relaxing; exploring and enjoying beautiful sceneries; no competition with other players; not doing illegal street racing / breaking traffic laws as gangsters or mafia and having cops on your heels 

- a roster of just normal day to day cars as opposed to super cars / sports cars / performance cars / racing cars / muscle cars / luxury cars is a plus but not a deal breaker

- preferably the map is wilderness / nature oriented that features landscapes such as rivers, oceans (roads beside sea), forests, jungles, mountains, hills, driving through tunnels in caves; by this i do not mean off-road using four wheel drives but still driving past scenery on the actual road 

- seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), day / night cycle, weather (raining, sunny, cloudy and windy, snowy, misty, foggy) will be appreciated ",Fiora_Atoria_Asamiya,1hes4pz,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hes4pz/car_driving_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hes4pz/car_driving_game/,2024-12-15 13:01:56,0,0.5,0,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hes4pz
