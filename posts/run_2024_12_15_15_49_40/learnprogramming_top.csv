learnprogramming,Giving up programming after 5 years trying it.,"This is more of a vent than anything else, and maybe it will be useful to someone as to not give up too late as I did.

You see, Programming is an ability that much like a Soccer Player, an Artist, etc, you either can do it or you can't. You see some people simply sit in front of the keyboard, and in less than 10 seconds they write 30 lines of code, whereas others like me, even trying so hard to dig in deep into the subject, couldn't even get past my 5th line. To have that level of understanding, in less than one year some people may do what you took 3 or 4 to make.

Programming is an exceptional and amazing ability, maybe professional programmers don't see it as outsiders like me do, but if you can code, you do HAVE a really valuable ability that sooooo many people wish they had, so try not to stress that much over non important things, because you are amazing.

Unfortunately, I won't be there with you guys. The competition is harsh, and I can no longer keep being left behind in a market I can't compete. Just wanted to let it all out.

It's no shame if you're in doubt if you should quit or not. To lose a battle is natural, but as long as you can keep standing. I will still stand, but somewhere else that fits me more. It's not healthy either to keep doing something that clearly isn't giving results. It was a good (and LONG, long long) journey.

My app would be a game to help people learn a skill (diabolo juggling), giving them a list of things they can work on next (linked to a tutorial) dependent on what they already learned. I would like to be able to add to the skill tree whenever I want (ie when I create more tutorials).

learnprogramming,Common Misconceptions About Open-Source,"I work in OSS based company, have my own popular OSS projects, and contribute to OSS, for last 15 years. So no BS.

1\. ""If I share my code, someone will steal my idea""

The success of a project depends on people, not just the code. You can also protect yourself legally by choosing the right license.

2. ""Open-source equals free""

Open-sourcing simply means sharing your work with the public. It doesn't dictate anything about the commercial aspects of your project.

3. ""If I open-source my product, no one will buy it""

There are many ways to legally protect your product from unauthorized use. Companies take licensing seriously because violating licenses can create significant problems during audits, investments, or certifications. The risks of abusing licenses aren't worth it.

In fact, being open-source can be a major selling point, as it reduces vendor lock-in risks and helps with security audit processes.

4. ""Open-sourcing means giving away control to the community""

It's perfectly acceptable to reject community contributions that don't align with your vision. You're not obligated to build a community around your project.

5. ""Only developers can contribute to open-source""

Many projects actually struggle with user interfaces, design, documentation, and community support. Whatever your skills are, you can likely contribute meaningfully to open-source projects.

6. ""Open-source is all about code""

Open-source is fundamentally about sharing, not just code. For example, projects like [undraw.co](http://undraw.co) demonstrate how designers can contribute to the open-source community.

Remember: Open-source is a development philosophy and licensing approach that promotes transparency and collaboration. It doesn't mean giving up control, losing commercial opportunities, or limiting contributions to just code.",leonidbugaev,1hepxuq,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hepxuq/common_misconceptions_about_opensource/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hepxuq/common_misconceptions_about_opensource/,2024-12-15 10:31:02,5,0.69,5,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hepxuq

It has documents of text that are associated with results from an already existing search engine that creates uniqueIDs for each result. So I just need to save the uniqueID to the document and it should be easy to get from the database. 


Each text document is broken into paragraphs, in the future users should be able to comment on each paragraph, which will be visible to other users.  


There will also be multiple translations of each document. 


I would like to be able to search by key phrases and words, which seems doable. In the future I would also like to be able to search by grammatical structures, verb tenses, etc. I think this will require pre-analyzing the text and adding tags to it and then searching the tags.  


Users should be able to access these text documents and then create new versions of them into a new document (while preserving the original) and saving that to a personal library + to a public directory if they desire. 


It may at some point become more of a social app where users can message and add friends, etc. but that is extremely far off.

learnprogramming,How to get better at designing your systems and splitting up functionality in clean ways?,"Hi! I've been a professional developer for 3 years but I find myself running into this pretty often. Any time I need to make a new system, I find myself struggling to decide where to draw the line inside how the program functions, to split things up ""correctly"". 

I'm familiar with design principles like single use and DRY and ""orthogonality"", but I tend to struggle to put it into real use. For example, I'm making a sort of Oregon Trail text game for fun right now, and I'm always asking myself when trying to insert a new function to the program ""where should this go?"". If I have a class that handles text (dealing with flow of dialogue, moving in the correct order, pausing where needed, inserting variables like player names and player inventory) and a class that handles the game flow (starting, exiting, saving, loading, etc) which one should get the ability to prompt the player for an option? Should they *both* have this ability, and should I make another class that handles all forms of user input? The menu to choose dialogue and the menu to exit the game may be pretty different, or they could be very similar. 

And then I end up in a seemingly endless loop of trying to rearrange things, only to stumble into a different weakness of the design. Anytime I add something new, it's a major question of ""where does this fit?"", which tends to change a lot of other things, which I know is a big sign that I'm doing some things pretty wrong with designing my programs. 

It's honestly possible I'm just overthinking (maybe I'm too early in the program because it's not at any kind of functional state at the moment, so all these ARE major design decisions that SHOULD be hard), or maybe I'm underthinking (should I graph this out instead?) or something else. I'd just love some tips on tackling this in the future.

I'm creating a Python-based mail merge tool that uses Apple Mail drafts as templates. The goal is to duplicate the drafts, replace placeholders like \[Name\] with data from an Excel file, and retain the original formatting (bold, italics, etc.).

What’s going wrong:

The issue is that when the draft is duplicated and modified using AppleScript, the formatting of the original draft is lost. Instead, the new drafts appear in plain text.

When I run the script, the generated drafts do not contain the formatted text.

thank you very much in advance for your help

learnprogramming,"Authorization header not sent in fetch request, resulting in undefined token and 401 error","I'm working on a Node.js and Express project with frontend and backend using vanilla JavaScript. My goal is to fetch orders from a protected backend API route `/admin/orders`, but I'm running into issues with the `Authorization` header. Even though I'm retrieving the token from `localStorage` and including it in the `Authorization` header when I check the `req.headers` in my backend, the `Authorization` header is missing, and the token is undefined.

* Here's the output from my backend logs when trying to fetch orders:
* Token: undefined GET /admin/orders 401
* **What I've Tried:**
   * I've confirmed the token is correctly stored in `localStorage` using: `console.log(localStorage.getItem('token');`
   * The token is included in the headers for the `fetch` request: `const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/admin/orders', { method: 'GET', headers: { 'Authorization': \Bearer ${token}\`,         'Content-Type': 'application/json',     }, });\`\`
   * But the backend logs show the `Authorization` header is missing when navigating to `/admin/orders`.
* **What I Need Help With:**
   * Why isn't the `Authorization` header being sent when I fetch the orders?
   * How can I ensure the header is included, especially when navigating to `/admin/orders`?
* **Additional Context:**
   * The frontend and backend are running on separate ports:
      * Frontend: `localhost:3001`
      * Backend: `localhost:3000`
   * I'm using vanilla JavaScript on the frontend and `fetch` for API calls.

learnprogramming,Would appreciate some advice on structuring my 6-month period.,"I'm in a situation and I would really appreciate some advice.

Over the past couple months I've built the habit of working deeply for long hours and I want to translate that into learning programming- specifically C.

I have no experience programming and I've gone through this sub for a while to learn what mistakes people usually make when starting to learn. Unrealistic expectations, underestimating the workload or the time it takes to be good and not being patient. Overall, I found it usually boiled down to these factors.

Before I get started I want to make sure that I'm doing it right. And I don't mean looking for the perfect resource but making sure the way I'm going about it is not the worst.

I’ll lay out some important points regarding my situation-

\- I'm in no rush to get good at programming. I'm currently 17 years old and starting next summer i would get approximately 6 months to do whatever i want and i really want to learn the absolute basics of programming and how computers work. This of course doesn't mean I'll stop after 6 months but  I’d be joining university and i wouldn't be able to provide my undivided attention to programming. 

\- In terms of my career, I'm not really interested in being a software developer or a professional programmer. I'm interested in Data Science but it's not concrete. Either way, I think what I spend these couple months learning would help me a great deal. According to what I've read, understanding how a computer works on the most basic level- dealing with memory and storage and energy, is an important part of being a data scientist, and having a complete root fundamental understanding of how a computer works is extremely important.

\-As mentioned, over the last couple months I’ve built the habit of working consistently  everyday and as of now I'm able to dedicate around 6-7 hours of focus into whatever I'm doing. I plan to keep this up for the 6 month duration.

\- I've chosen C as being one of the first true languages, it's extremely basic (in its working not in complexity) and it gives one a pretty good understanding of how things actually go down in a computer.

\- I’m not particularly interested in learning as quickly as possible, as long as I'm understanding what I'm doing. I could for example spend weeks on a fundamental concept  that's extremely important but often gets overlooked. I don't want to take shortcuts as I'm doing this for the long run.

\- I don't particularly want to ask for the best resource , but I do appreciate recommendations of resources that specialize on the basic understanding aspect, rather than getting me job ready as fast as possible. Currently I'm finding K&amp;R to be the best option but I'm open to suggestions.

\-I have experienced tutorial hell in other spheres and it absolutely drained the life out of me. I have no intention of going through that again. I want to get committed to only a couple resources which are great that I can rely on throughout the period. I shouldn’t be switching resources and I don't want to. As a side note-  What’s the right balance between sticking to figuring out a problem yourself even if it takes a long time, to knowing when to give up and just google it?

\-I’d like to preface that all of the above is tentative and subject to change, keeping my ultimate goal of being knowledgeable about the inner workings of a computer system in mind (and eventually a data scientist/analyst), is there anything specific i should really focus on early in the process? Maybe a soft skill or a mindset shift while learning. Maybe I should focus more on hands-on stuff like breaking down an old laptop and building physical things which use code.

\- I'm aware that my entire approach could be wrong so I'm open to suggestions regarding how I should go about learning this. What is the right balance between understanding everything fundamentally from the get go and just keep messing around until you understand it eventually?

\-Although it's not a priority, i’d prefer having something tangible to show for at the end of the 6 months because this entire thing is also a way for me to show my parents that im capable and i can handle studying on my own (I eventually want to leave the country for my education but it's a hard sell. I do NOT want to study in my home country for obvious-to-everyone reasons but my parents only listen to proof of capabilities. They need external validation from a third party telling them I can actually do something). So maybe something like partaking in a competition or contributing to a project? I'm not sure how to go about it.

\-Considering I have complete control over my time,there's room for basically any routine, habit or schedule. If you have advice that might seem niche and very prerequisite-y, I would still ask for it as there's a good chance I might be able to implement it(assuming it's useful.) It doesn't even have to be directly related to programming, but a habit which would indirectly help me with my goals.

All of this has been on my mind for quite some time now, and I'm very excited at its prospect. As you could probably guess, it's not exactly set in stone. I really do believe that I can accomplish a significant amount within this time period and I'm proud of myself for that.

learnprogramming,Is CS50x Right for Me? (Need Advice Based on My Situation),"Hi everyone,

I’m considering diving into CS50x to improve my programming skills, but I wanted to get some advice to see if it’s the right fit for my situation. Here’s a bit about me:

* **Background:** I’m a 20-year-old university student majoring in Informatics, but I currently know little about programming. While I’ve taken some classes in the past, I’ve forgotten most of the content and relied heavily on AI tools for assignments, so I feel like I’m starting from scratch.
* **Current Goal:** I want to give programming one final attempt, committing fully to it with the aim of securing an internship quickly. I plan to dedicate about 6 hours a day during my winter break (Dec 15–Jan 5) to learning and building my skills.
* **Concerns:**
   1. I’m not sure if CS50x is too basic or too advanced for someone in my position.
   2. Since I’m under a time crunch, I’m wondering if CS50x is the best way to build foundational skills quickly or if I should explore other resources (e.g., The Odin Project, LeetCode, or specific internship prep courses).

learnprogramming,Is IT just not for me? [Ranting],"TL;DR: I feel miserable studying IT. Should I quit it and do something else? What can I pursue?

Howdie!

I'm a 16 years old guy living in Russia (becoming 17 yo in 5 days). I'm in my 10'th year of school (out of 11) and in the 10'th year of school in my city (just the city, not the country), a student must pick what they want to study in order to do specialized preparation for state exams and university enrollment. The choice is: medicine, engineering, IT, business/economics, media and psychology/teaching. There is no middle ground for those who can't decide; to add more, our schools don't have any kind of guidance counselling, nor any sort of career guidance at all! We must just know what we want to do in the future already.

I knew about this system since I was 10 and I've been desperately trying to figure out what I'm good at for more than 6 years already. I had been reading tons of articles for years, tried learning natural sciences, game developing, writing literature (fictional and non fictional), learning languages, translating and localizing, drawing, composing music, 3D modeling, video editing and so many other things I can't even remember all of them. That's how I found Reddit, by the way. I learned English mostly by reading the discussions here.

However, instead of finding something I want to do as a career, I gained even more doubts because what I liked and became passionate about (reading and writing, composing music, translating and localizing) are either low-paying or dying careers.

The only things I became certain about are:

1. I have bad spatial reasoning. I have tough time imagining and visualing even basic figures in 3D.
2. I work better with abstract, non-visual concepts and information (texts, maths outside of geometry, tables, theoretical informatics)
3. I do everything slowly, but carefully. If someone rushes me, I become even slower and my work becomes way worse due to the stress. I've been rushed by my teachers and classmates through my whole school life.
4. The subjects at school I do the best and enjoy the most are english, russian, literature, algebra and informatics (we didn't study programming, only abstract theory about how information works, not even in computers).

I picked IT because I enjoyed informatics and it could lead to a better career than, say, media. It's been the 4'th month and I'm devastated.

First of all, we're already expected to know how to programm in C++ with Arduino and in Python with libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyQT and Flask). Nobody's teaching us programming at school at all, but whenever we're failing, the teachers reply 'But you're programmers! You must know it already!' and refuse to help. I'm using ChatGPT to complete the tasks and I feel very guilty for it. I wanted to learn how to programm, but instead of explaining a bit, we're just thrown to practice immediately.

Second of all, we're studying in person for 48 hours a week (from monday to friday). We must attend a college every tuesday and university every wednesday.

Moreover, we have loads of homework from the school, university, college, and we must make 2 individual projects with a deadline in a month. The projects must be complex, absolutely new and demanded, they should contain at least a thousand of lines of code in Python without any empty lines. We must also watch and read online lectures from school and university and complete tests after them. We do a lot of statics, dynamics and 3D mechanical drawing besides the main curriculum and I suck at it (bad spatial reasoning).

That's definetely not what I expected and including the fact I'm not burning with a passion for computers and programming in general, this led me to a miserable life. I just had some sort of interest, but it's not enough to bear all of the pressure from school. I experience insane amounts of stress, having mental breakdowns and weeping in horror every week, my head and spine constantly hurt, even though I was in great health just half a year ago. I started forgetting things after several minutes (my memory's been good throughout my life). I feel how I'm going insane and it terrifies me. My grades at maths, informatics and physics are getting worse and worse.

My classmates, on the other hand, are mostly chill and enjoy doing what we're told to do. A lot of them are really passionate about programming and computers. Some were taking programming courses and made personal projects before. They're not only able to keep up with the pace, they're even asking for more tasks and lessons.

This has brought me to think if I should quit studying IT if I'm not passionate about it. Should I do it? If so, what else could I study, considering my self-assessment?

My end goal is to become a software engineer at a FAANG company or any high-paying corporation and hopefully make my own startup. However, CS is 1. Way too hard to transfer into for these college as it is only a 5% acceptance rate, and 2. I struggle with learning physics and I am not good with the hardware aspects of CS.

I know that the CS market right now is hard for new grads, especially with finding internships, so going to a boot camp after college is not out of the realm for me, in order to obtain more practical skills and apply for mid-senior level positions. However, I have heard that going to a boot camp kills your ability to understand a lot of the theoretical knowledge for CS that may not always be used, but is important for some positions and for making your own company.

learnprogramming,Struggling with Math for Algorithms,"Hey everyone, I’m 24 and heading back to school next semester after not touching math seriously for over six years. I’ve done about 90% of CS50x and nearly finished CS50 Python, plus some background in C and Python. I’m really enjoying Python lately, but I’m noticing that a lot of algorithm courses assume a strong math background—especially for complex problems, induction proofs, and more advanced techniques.

I picked up “Everything You Need to Ace Pre-Algebra and Algebra 1” but feel overwhelmed. I learn best through videos and hands-on practice, and while “Grokking Algorithms” is a great, simplified start, it’s not digging into the deeper math or theory. The most complex data structure I’ve handled was a linked list in C (which felt more tangible with malloc and all), but in Python it’s straightforward to just use lists without understanding the lower-level details. I really want to build a solid foundation so I can confidently tackle more complex algorithmic challenges, but my weak math background is holding me back.

learnprogramming,Being different from the programming stereotype: is it possible to be successful in the field? ,"I'm a 17-year-old girl who's going to graduate soon and really wants to pursue a career in technology and programming. My big dilemma is that my profile doesn't match the image that people have of people who work in technology (in fact, I'd say I'm the opposite). 

I didn't grow up playing video games, watching anime or immersed in geek culture. I was never that student who excelled in exact sciences at school, I even had a lot of difficulty in some subjects, despite never having to recover or anything like that.

Even so, every day I become more interested, I bought books, took courses (Gustavo Guanabara was a great find in my life) and I participate in groups of programmers and students, which helps a lot, in fact, there they talk about their daily lives and their experience. in programming, on the other hand, I even feel embarrassed to join these groups because of the huge number of men, and even the girls, I haven't seen any that really look like me, they also follow a pattern.

 I tried to read a lot and research about all the difficulties and challenges, and I really believe that it really is my dream, not because of the false illusions of absurd salaries, I really love the idea of ​​working with this.

What makes me so fearful and fearful, in fact, is that the impression is becoming stronger and stronger that those who are successful have always had a natural talent for technology and exact sciences, something that I don't have even remotely, I barely know how to use it. I disagree to this day. 

This makes me wonder if I can really fit into a college (I want a federal one), for example. I would probably be overwhelmed both by the subjects I tried to learn at school and by the students and teachers who wouldn't take me seriously. Everyone I talk to about my desire takes a long time to believe, they say it “doesn't suit me” or that I should look for something else, but it's something I truly believe I love.

Anyone who has experience in the area, have you ever seen someone with a more “non-standard” profile in the area still do well? Sometimes I wonder if actually following this stereotype would make that much of a difference, but I also feel like I would be chopped into little pieces when entering a federal college, for example (I'm from Brasília, so on top of that it would be UNB). I wanted to better understand how things work in practice, I definitely don't want to be the type of person who gives up in the first semester. Does anyone know what they would do in my place?",MissLovelyMess,1heroa4,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1heroa4/being_different_from_the_programming_stereotype/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1heroa4/being_different_from_the_programming_stereotype/,2024-12-15 12:33:29,0,0.44,0,0,52,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1heroa4
