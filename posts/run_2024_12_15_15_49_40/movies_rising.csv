movies,Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in Les Miserables,"I always loved Hugh Jackman as an actor since I was young, but really only just from playing Wolverine for a while. Now that I’ve seen a lot of his other roles, I’ve realized just how versatile and talented he really is.

I haven’t seen the musical, but I really enjoyed the film version of Les Mis, and it has a pretty incredible performance from Jackman. All the performances were great (I even enjoyed Russell Crowe as Javert) but he really stands out as Jean Valjean, particularly in the scene early on where he decides to turn his life around after being touched by the man’s kindness",Odd_Advance_6438,1heunkv,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heunkv/hugh_jackman_is_phenomenal_in_les_miserables/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heunkv/hugh_jackman_is_phenomenal_in_les_miserables/,2024-12-15 15:17:53,51,0.79,51,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heunkv
movies,"I have a soft spot for ""Die Hard 2"" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three ""Die Hard"" entries.","There's no way, of course, that ""2"" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by ""Vengeance"" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.

But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.

I'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest ""Die Hard"" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",Mst3Kgf,1hetrq0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,2024-12-15 14:33:34,73,0.86,73,0,75,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hetrq0

The HDR and de-aging tricks they're playing make it feel even more artificial.

movies,Smile 2 (2024) My expectations where tripled what I expected! What did you think of the film?  ,"WARNING! Naturally, spoilers. If you haven't seen the film, do not proceed. 



&gt;!Ever since the first film, I jumped on reddit almost as fast as did with the sequel now, giving it heavy praise. I was shocked a good portion thought it was kind of laughable. The scares are important sure, but what Smile 2 provides is just unsettling anxiety. Thankfully the ammount of jump scares were JUST enough but not too much, which I admit the first film might of had just a little too much of. For example, when Skye (Naomi Scott) looked in her closet there was a dozen of people she knew smiling at her. I thought ""ok any moment they will rush and the movie goes on"" They rushed alright. But they just got closer. The scene which was less than a minute felt like a eternity. I was so uncomfortable (in a good movie way) I was just thinking common man what what WHATS gonna happen"". Then they get even closer but stacked on top each other. Honestly that made me smile in real life and giggle for a slight moment. The acting in this movie is superb. Naomi Scott was brilliant. I couldn't help thinking how hard it must of been to act it all out, but she brilliantly executed her performance. She made it feel so realistic. There was two jaw dropping (and i mean literally) moments in the film where i stood still silent in awe. The very beginning when Joel got hit by the car in the beginning. But better yet, the f&amp;$%ing ending! The moment I realized reality set in realizing 7,000+ people are about to all get the curse, DUDE I just instantly imagined a sequel for a world apocalypses movie lol. !&lt;

&gt;!Honestly, idk why but I loved both films. I never get excited for a sequel as much as I did this. As a matter of fact, I'm going to create a SCP dedicated to this ""demon"" or ""curse"". If you don't know what SCP is, you'll just have to look it up. I'm more curious what you guys thought of the movie. Happy, disappointed doesn't matter.

movies,What Horror Movie Sub-Genres you’re not a Fan of and Why?,"Horror Movie Sub-Genres I’m not a Fan of and Why are:

Found Footage - Because of the shaky camera and a completely saturated market.

Just way too many low-effort movies in this genre. Similar plots, shakey cameras that doesn't really add anything (except in good ones), and such. The (sub)genre is just filled with too much of garbage, while it's still possible to find a gem

Body Horror 

Demon Possession - Because it’s the exact same movie. And I think a lot of them forget what's actually scary about the idea of demonic possession, which is the thought of not being able to control your own body and the threat of damnation, not just weird contortions and little girls shouting blasphemy with the voice of several grown men.

It's just getting overdone now with little to no innovation in the subgenre. Every single one pretty much feels the same and has a very similar story to tell. 

It always feels predictable, and the religious allusions made in the film are just annoying. It's one of the few horror sub-genres that I can't take seriously.

Initial encounter. Slow build up of strange behavior. Eventual blow up. Speaking in tongues and obscene language unusual for that person. Gets tied down in exorcism. Holy water. Screaming, writhing and contorting. Faith breaks through at the last minute and they're saved! Rinse, repeat. The possessed person always acts the same and the arc of the struggle always feels the same.

Home Invasion - Because a character usually has to do something beyond stupid to let the home invasion happen or they have the upper hand over the invader and don't kill them off until it's too late.",Amber_Flowers_133,1heuh6m,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,2024-12-15 15:09:25,0,0.33,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heuh6m

From there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn’t think 5 was that bad.

William Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.

But much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the  sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207

Characters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.

It is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.

And it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it. And Freeman is as reliable as ever as the soft spoken Ned.",LoneWolfIndia,1hduhu8,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hduhu8/unforgiven_is_one_of_clint_eastwoods_best_movies/,2024-12-14 03:59:59,2384,0.92,2384,0,212,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hduhu8
