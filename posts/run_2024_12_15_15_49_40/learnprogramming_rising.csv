learnprogramming,Giving up programming after 5 years trying it.,"This is more of a vent than anything else, and maybe it will be useful to someone as to not give up too late as I did.

You see, Programming is an ability that much like a Soccer Player, an Artist, etc, you either can do it or you can't. You see some people simply sit in front of the keyboard, and in less than 10 seconds they write 30 lines of code, whereas others like me, even trying so hard to dig in deep into the subject, couldn't even get past my 5th line. To have that level of understanding, in less than one year some people may do what you took 3 or 4 to make.

Programming is an exceptional and amazing ability, maybe professional programmers don't see it as outsiders like me do, but if you can code, you do HAVE a really valuable ability that sooooo many people wish they had, so try not to stress that much over non important things, because you are amazing.

Unfortunately, I won't be there with you guys. The competition is harsh, and I can no longer keep being left behind in a market I can't compete. Just wanted to let it all out.

It's no shame if you're in doubt if you should quit or not. To lose a battle is natural, but as long as you can keep standing. I will still stand, but somewhere else that fits me more. It's not healthy either to keep doing something that clearly isn't giving results. It was a good (and LONG, long long) journey.

learnprogramming,Common Misconceptions About Open-Source,"I work in OSS based company, have my own popular OSS projects, and contribute to OSS, for last 15 years. So no BS.

1\. ""If I share my code, someone will steal my idea""

The success of a project depends on people, not just the code. You can also protect yourself legally by choosing the right license.

2. ""Open-source equals free""

Open-sourcing simply means sharing your work with the public. It doesn't dictate anything about the commercial aspects of your project.

3. ""If I open-source my product, no one will buy it""

There are many ways to legally protect your product from unauthorized use. Companies take licensing seriously because violating licenses can create significant problems during audits, investments, or certifications. The risks of abusing licenses aren't worth it.

In fact, being open-source can be a major selling point, as it reduces vendor lock-in risks and helps with security audit processes.

4. ""Open-sourcing means giving away control to the community""

It's perfectly acceptable to reject community contributions that don't align with your vision. You're not obligated to build a community around your project.

5. ""Only developers can contribute to open-source""

Many projects actually struggle with user interfaces, design, documentation, and community support. Whatever your skills are, you can likely contribute meaningfully to open-source projects.

6. ""Open-source is all about code""

Open-source is fundamentally about sharing, not just code. For example, projects like [undraw.co](http://undraw.co) demonstrate how designers can contribute to the open-source community.

Remember: Open-source is a development philosophy and licensing approach that promotes transparency and collaboration. It doesn't mean giving up control, losing commercial opportunities, or limiting contributions to just code.",leonidbugaev,1hepxuq,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hepxuq/common_misconceptions_about_opensource/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hepxuq/common_misconceptions_about_opensource/,2024-12-15 10:31:02,6,0.75,6,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hepxuq

learnprogramming,How to get better at designing your systems and splitting up functionality in clean ways?,"Hi! I've been a professional developer for 3 years but I find myself running into this pretty often. Any time I need to make a new system, I find myself struggling to decide where to draw the line inside how the program functions, to split things up ""correctly"". 

I'm familiar with design principles like single use and DRY and ""orthogonality"", but I tend to struggle to put it into real use. For example, I'm making a sort of Oregon Trail text game for fun right now, and I'm always asking myself when trying to insert a new function to the program ""where should this go?"". If I have a class that handles text (dealing with flow of dialogue, moving in the correct order, pausing where needed, inserting variables like player names and player inventory) and a class that handles the game flow (starting, exiting, saving, loading, etc) which one should get the ability to prompt the player for an option? Should they *both* have this ability, and should I make another class that handles all forms of user input? The menu to choose dialogue and the menu to exit the game may be pretty different, or they could be very similar. 

And then I end up in a seemingly endless loop of trying to rearrange things, only to stumble into a different weakness of the design. Anytime I add something new, it's a major question of ""where does this fit?"", which tends to change a lot of other things, which I know is a big sign that I'm doing some things pretty wrong with designing my programs. 

It's honestly possible I'm just overthinking (maybe I'm too early in the program because it's not at any kind of functional state at the moment, so all these ARE major design decisions that SHOULD be hard), or maybe I'm underthinking (should I graph this out instead?) or something else. I'd just love some tips on tackling this in the future.

It has documents of text that are associated with results from an already existing search engine that creates uniqueIDs for each result. So I just need to save the uniqueID to the document and it should be easy to get from the database. 


Each text document is broken into paragraphs, in the future users should be able to comment on each paragraph, which will be visible to other users.  


There will also be multiple translations of each document. 


I would like to be able to search by key phrases and words, which seems doable. In the future I would also like to be able to search by grammatical structures, verb tenses, etc. I think this will require pre-analyzing the text and adding tags to it and then searching the tags.  


Users should be able to access these text documents and then create new versions of them into a new document (while preserving the original) and saving that to a personal library + to a public directory if they desire. 


It may at some point become more of a social app where users can message and add friends, etc. but that is extremely far off.

learnprogramming,"During my winter break off work, how should I spend it learning programming more efficiently? I'm really struggling imo","I have a little bit of programming knowledge, like I know how to assign variables in languages such as VB, Python, JS, but that's about it really. I can write simple logic code for say a basic calculator and that's about it sadly, list's and for &amp; if loops also I almost have them down but yeah, very basic.

I've been trying to learn for a little while now and I don't really have much to show for it which is really annoying. I have just under 2 weeks off of work now for the christmas break and I was wondering, how should I spend this time to 'get' programming down, so that I can actually start outputting something.. I'm considering learning C# so I can finally understand object orientated programming (OOP), but also I'd really love to learn how to solve leetcode problems.. 

  
There just seems like so much I need to do / learn and it's overwhelming me and I can't focus on just one thing.. I really want to make some leaps in my programming this winter break so does anyone have any advice on how I should spend this time?

  
Say for example I spend x hours / days learning this, y learning that etc etc, anything any advice please! Haha, cheers :) ",greatmeaning,1hermhp,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hermhp/during_my_winter_break_off_work_how_should_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hermhp/during_my_winter_break_off_work_how_should_i/,2024-12-15 12:30:19,1,1.0,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hermhp
learnprogramming,"Authorization header not sent in fetch request, resulting in undefined token and 401 error","I'm working on a Node.js and Express project with frontend and backend using vanilla JavaScript. My goal is to fetch orders from a protected backend API route `/admin/orders`, but I'm running into issues with the `Authorization` header. Even though I'm retrieving the token from `localStorage` and including it in the `Authorization` header when I check the `req.headers` in my backend, the `Authorization` header is missing, and the token is undefined.

* Here's the output from my backend logs when trying to fetch orders:
* Token: undefined GET /admin/orders 401
* **What I've Tried:**
   * I've confirmed the token is correctly stored in `localStorage` using: `console.log(localStorage.getItem('token');`
   * The token is included in the headers for the `fetch` request: `const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/admin/orders', { method: 'GET', headers: { 'Authorization': \Bearer ${token}\`,         'Content-Type': 'application/json',     }, });\`\`
   * But the backend logs show the `Authorization` header is missing when navigating to `/admin/orders`.
* **What I Need Help With:**
   * Why isn't the `Authorization` header being sent when I fetch the orders?
   * How can I ensure the header is included, especially when navigating to `/admin/orders`?
* **Additional Context:**
   * The frontend and backend are running on separate ports:
      * Frontend: `localhost:3001`
      * Backend: `localhost:3000`
   * I'm using vanilla JavaScript on the frontend and `fetch` for API calls.
