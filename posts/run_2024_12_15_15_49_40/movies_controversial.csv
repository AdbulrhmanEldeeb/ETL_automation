movies,Movies as perfect as Se7en,"Se7en has to be the most perfect movie ever made.  Every line of dialogue is important. The character dynamic is brilliant. The amount of foreshadowing and symbolism is outstanding.  The tension in the last scene with the reveal of what's in the box is unmatched.  I don't think I've ever watched another movie that checks all these boxes and also inspires such a huge range of emotions and intensity.  Its just so intelligent.  I would love some recommendations for movies that come close to this.  Just smart writing, emotional tension, great character dynamics.  Specifically that last scene in the car when Morgan freeman is acting his ass off watching the interaction between mills and John doe without even saying a word.  Just observing.  There are not enough words to express how perfect this is.  I would love to watch something that comes close.

movies,I can’t take Netflix movies seriously,"I’ve yet to be impressed or even moved by a movie on Netflix. They all seem to follow this formulaic template based on classic movies and the writing is usually just mediocre with plot holes and lots of room for improvement.

I have developed these low expectations going into it that I’m just watching the equivalent of the old $5 dvd bin at Walmart.

Netflix is best enjoyed while shoveling popcorn in my mouth and doing something else with my time, like scrolling on my phone or playing a video game. … or even “chilling”. They just don’t hold my attention well.

I’m typing this while watching *Carry On*

Meanwhile I can go to the theater and even do a double feature with full attention, I’m respecting the presentation and effort of a big screen release. It has more impact. Don’t get me wrong my home theater still has a punch but Netflix quality is still below par.

Netflix is basically the old “straight to dvd“ but now it’s straight to streaming, which I guess makes sense given the climate of entertainment these days…. But most of the memorable movies for me have premiered in theaters or get a justified release…

I have to follow my favorite directors, screenwriters and studios these days to even find anything worth consuming.

Maybe I’m just finding out I like films, not movies.

movies,Are there any documented examples of movies Intended to sabotage other productions/sales?,"My current tinfoil hat theory, is that Sony is intentionally releasing terrible films in the superhero genre, to try and break the hold that Marvel/Disney has over the genre. It just doesn't make sense that a major company can be THAT out of touch with its audience that they keep releasing flop after flop. Other than intentionally releasing bad products that will dilute audience attention. 

Disney has also done this to themselves by accident, with the Star  Wars franchise - released too many sub-par products that devalued the brand (although this seemed to be an overreach from Disney) - Disney publicly identified this and promised slow releases after audience fatigue. 

I know I've seen this done in other industries - Coke did this to derail Pepsi's momentum with Pepsi Crystal, they intentionally flooded the market with poorly made knockoffs to kill the interest.

Why don't more animated adaptations get made as opposed to live action? Whether it's Batman, The Avengers, or whomever else.

movies,I just finished watching all the Rocky movies ,"Holy shit man. These are some of the greatest movies I ever watched. 

The first movie is good, but it is pretty boring I can’t lie. It doesn’t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight. But man, something about that fight made it all worth it. I can’t describe it, just watching that iconic montage and fight made it feel like I didn’t waste my time. 

From there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn’t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I’m glad they gave Rocky’s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.

this is the fourth (or third, depends on what status you grant Northern Ireland) time I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a country in the country called UK. After England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's now **Wales**' turn before the grand finale. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

one of my favorite parts of the movie is when the train arrives at the north pole. they made the very smart decision to have the polar express theme play at that part. it's a really good song with great lyrics and a fast pace that mirrors the fast pace of the titular train.

when you listen to the soundtrack on a CD or a vinyl or on Spotify or however you listen to it, the version of the song on the soundtrack is different. in the soundtrack version, they have tom hanks as the conductor randomly interjecting. and to me, this ruins the song.

for starters, as talented as he is, tom hanks cannot sing. or maybe he can. i don't really know because he isn't so much singing as he is sing talking. also, like i said, he randomly interjects and i feel that it ruins things.

movies,Anyone else suspect that Elf One was reviewed so poorly because critics are kinda tired of The Rock?,"This is a total hot take, and I'll admit that I'm pretty much done with Dwayne Johnson's recurring vanity character (a larger-than-life pile of muscle and ego), but what got me thinking about this is the disparity on Rotten between the critics (roughly 35%) and the audience (about 95%).

So I'm wondering if the critics may have been a little more kind had another actor played his part, and if the general movie going audience also thinks this a possibility. Even if youre a fan, you gotta admitt . . . he's pretty much taken over the 'family-friendly tough guy' role.

And I understand why, I was even into it at first, but now I'm just kinda bored.

movies,logistics in get out ,"to start out this is not a complaint post or me trying to get some super clear logic from a fictional movie. there's no way of knowing the answer to my question but I'm curious about others thoughts 

what do folks think that the people who stole black peoples bodies in get out generally did after they had their new body? do we think the community/cult who was in on this had rules on what you did afterwards? clearly they would have to be pronounced as dead otherwise they'd be missing and being white (and wealthy) there would have actually been serious efforts made to find them.

then there's the fact that they'd be seen as black by those who were outwith the group and would therefore have people treat them differently. my theory was that they saw this as an opportunity to sort of retire from society sort of how rose's grandparents were living with their family and posing as staff in the house when others were visiting. I know some people will think it illogical that they'd want to be in black bodies due to the racism in society but personally I think the types of people that were doing this probably held a respectability politics sort of mindset where they'd assume that because they'd act 'proper' they would be fine.

i also wonder if the people in the sunken place could communicate with the person piloting their body

movies,Get out,"I’m rewatching get out. Jesus. I know we’ve decided already that this movie set the bar too high, which is part of the reason some people feel Jordan’s subsequent movies don’t hold up. But rewatching it only for the second time makes me cold. 
The story presented touches on a topic in racism that always bothered me. The coveting and use of the strengths and abilities black people possess while simultaneously looking at them at no more human than those we aren’t. It’s trippy as fuck to think that they’d believe their mindset in the body of what they believe to be superior genetically would make a better person. It literally speaks to the inability to see the value in our consciousness and that disturbssss me. Roses grandfather losing to Jessie Owens. People at the auction describing how they used to be. The abilities they used to have and comparing them to his. Ugh. 
Roses obsessive need to be on Chris’s side whenever he felt uncomfortable by the weird shit was triggering. Using it as a method to hide his identity and lure him into that false sense of security that he never even really felt was crazy. I never felt more anxious than watching her bring him back into the house once the auction was over. 
And let’s talk about that fucking auction. I think what bothers me most is how sealed Chris fate is at that point . What appears like ignorance to Chris is really also lack of need to hide their true intentions. The way rose brings him around the event to introduce him to everyone , most auctions people move through. Seeing Chris being dragged from group to group, touched and questioned was disturbing to say the least . 
When Chris is having the procedure explained to him I could cry. The sunken place in its entirety is the opposite of what I fear in death. Which is the lack of consciousness. I can’t imagine playing back seat in your own body. I’m not sure how comparative to a vegetative state it is but the trauma in being moved and speaking without your own permission had to be greater than one can imagine. Seeing the color return to the eyes of Andre supports this. While I wish he managed more words lmao it took the rewatch for me to realize he has been essentially raped and used all 
with his knowledge and had no ability to stop it. 
  Rose having a real bedroom with the photos of the people she kidnapped was a choice. I can’t decide  if I appreciated the change in her character upon the reveal but I can say it was entertaining ? The conversation between she and rod and the fact that she had been Chris’s biggest ally during this ordeal. How she went from I love you to smiling during what was supposed to be her death. 
 One thing that always confused me was grandpas  ability to rationalize coming out of the sunken place quick enough to shoot rose and know there’s no way to prevent going back and kill himself. Also rose’s stupidity in not realizing the flash would take grandpa out the sunken place as it had done to Logan hours before. Handing over her gun was .. a choice 😭. Overall I really loved the movie. It was as entertaining as heartbreaking and moving &amp; thought provoking. I choose to believe since the other ending wasn’t the Final Cut it just doesn’t exist.

movies,With AI restorations on the rise in recent years I am becoming worried about the future of movie preservation.,"I will preface this post with something positive before I discuss my concerns. The truth is that as long as there are fans of art there will be people who will properly preserve it. If you want a movie in a particular form/ cut, with the original theatrical audio mix, with every special feature ever released for that movie, and in the best/ least compressed presentation possible then there are many places online where you can access it. This post isn't referring to crazy people like me that will seek out that material. This post is aimed at people that I refer to as “casuals” or the people that aren't as crazy as me about this sort of stuff. The people that just want to watch a movie with the click of a button rather than buying a physical disc or searching for an obscure torrent. 



I want to start my concerns about this phenomenon by stating that I am not a gloomy type of person. I see some of the benefits of AI technology when it comes to movie restorations, but my perspective changed after December 12th, 2024. That day I went with a friend to see a one night only screening of Interstella 5555 (2003). That presentation of the movie is the worst my friend and I have ever seen, which is saying something because that movie is cursed with sub par home media releases. The version that my friend and I saw that day was AI upscaled. It ruined all of the details in the image. Every shot in the movie looked like someone rubbed Vaseline on random parts of the screen. It was pretty much unwatchable. (Here are some examples of what my friend and I saw that night: [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1gfqxge/interstella_ai_remaster/), [Example #2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b_sL6bSRhWw), [Example #3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pX_Ss4BrepE)).



I knew this sort of stuff had happened before like with the recent Blu-ray release of [I Love Lucy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdhJMOTPVw) and the [4Ks that James Cameron has released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxOqWYytypg&amp;pp=ygUXamFtZXMgY2FtZXJvbiA0ayBpc3N1ZXM%3D), however the difference with those is that most of them (except The Abyss) have some other decent release while Interstella 5555 is stuck with a sub par DVD and Blu-ray releases.



Then there is the issue of movies staying in circulation. If this version of Interstella 5555 is the only one available on streaming or a new Blu-ray release then what will “casuals” who have never watched this movie think. Will they think that the movie shouldn't look like that or will they think that the movie is supposed to look like a Vaseline smeared mess?



AI is a very helpful technology for movie restoration but it has become very obvious to me that studios are not using this technology properly and are getting extremely lazy with it. I will put it to you this way, you use a hammer to strike nails and you use a wrench to screw bolts. You can use a wrench to strike nails and you can use a hammer to screw bolts but the tools will do those tasks horribly if used in this manner. Use the right tool for the job and everything will be fine. After that night, I realized that these studios aren't doing that for whatever reason and that it is up to us to keep the art that we love alive.

Not everyone grew up watching British film and television and saw Hugh Laurie in his earlier roles—and even then, depending on your generation, you may not have recognised him when he became popular in American media (I didn't, at least). If your first exposure was his role as Stuart Little's dad in the movie of the same name; or as House, MD in the popular hospital drama; you might be forgiven for thinking he was an American actor.

2. Gary Oldman

A man of many faces (and voices), Gary Oldman has been in so many blockbuster movies—and is often touted as an example of characters who looked familiar but you just couldn't quite put your finger on who was playing the part... From Zorg in The Fifth Element to Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman trilogy, it may have come as a shock to some people to see (and hear) him as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter franchise.

3. Gillian Anderson

I'm a huge X-files fan. In fact, for the last year or two I have been doing a\[nother\] rewatch! Growing up, I had no idea that Gillian Anderson was a British actor. She played the part of Dana Scully so well (in my opinion), I am sure many were hoodwinked into thinking she was another fantastic American television actor.

4. Henry Cavill

Before he played Geralt of Rivia, Henry Cavill showed up in all sorts of places; but his notable role was Clark Kent / Kal-El in the mid 2010s movie, Man of Steel. At the time, I had no idea he was British. Henry's a real nerd (self-proclaimed, like many of us), and I look forward to his upcoming involvement in Warhammer 40K. :)

5. Tom Holland

This man. He's becoming quite legendary. If you haven't seen The Crowded Room, I highly recommend that you check it out. Bursting onto the screen\* as Peter Parker in Captain America: Civil War (and then of course the Spiderman movies which followed), I would hazard a guess that many fans were oblivious to the fact that Tom's a Brit. He nailed the part of Nathan Drake in 2022's Uncharted.

\* Before anyone comments that ""bursting onto the screen"" implies an actor's debut, I am aware that Tom Holland played roles prior to Peter Parker. But it wasn't until then that by all accounts his popularity began taking hold. There's no arguing it was pretty bursty, right?

Bonus: Kaya Scodelario

I sat down recently and started watching Guy Ritchie's Netflix show, The Gentlemen. If you haven't seen it, stop reading Reddit and go fire it up. It borders on hilarious, with all the Guy Ritchie grit and wit you would expect. Anyway, there is a ""businesswoman"" called Susie Glass (rhymes with arse, not ass). It took me a minute to figure out where I'd seen her before—except she didn't have a British accent. If you've seen the Maze Runner movie trilogy, you'll know what I'm talking about: Kaya played Teresa, a major part in all three films, and it was a real trip to realise that she's actually British.

I hope you enjoyed my breakdown of five (plus one bonus) British actors that when you first saw them you may not have realised they were not American.

movies,I honestly like the other Terminator films after T2 because the likeness of Judgement Day but in different formats is a part of the Terminator franchise.,"I am thinking that I am one of the few people here who acknowledges this but I feel that every Terminator film, even after the ones of T2, bring something new to the concept of Judgement Day.

Sure, every single one brings the same concept of T2 over and over again (Dark Fate does not have John but it is still the same concept with the new character) but I think that this is intentional.

Since the very beginning with T1, there has been the concept about the debate between free will and determinism where the Kyle Reese goes back in time to save Sarah but he impregnates her with John and the result is the photo that she gets in the future. 

Because of this, Judgement Day still happens but it was delayed.

The same goes for T2 with the concept of 'No Fate' which apparently shows the dilemma between free will and the determined future where the characters still are able to prevent Judgement Day but it is delayed until a new Terminator comes.

This eerily reminds of the game Bioschock Infinite which shows the concept of Infinite universes and the idea behind constants and variables which basically says that even though the timing of the event did not come, it will still come in different forms and it is still a constant - hence, the determined need to bring  Judgement Day.

So in a way, T3 is still the same like the previous films except Judgement Day still happened meaning that not even John could escape his fate.

In Genysis, I liked the idea of trying to blend a little bit of the butterfly effect where even though Judgement Day was prevented, Skynet took a new format and I liked the parallel where we have become so dependent on technology that we have become slaves to it.

So that concept of technology being a literal threat and a literal idea that is possible was a good concept.

Same goes for Dark Fate.
Sure, the writing could have been handled better instead of just killing John at the very beginning

But I think I understood the idea behind Legion because it is still Skynet but with a different name.

From my perspective, it was just another manner of the butterfly effect. Skynet still exists and will exist in the future but somehow, the butterfly effect makes it have a different name but the intention is still determined.

The only thing that I really did not like it how the Terminator that killed John somehow developed empathy towards humanity without the proper programming and has basically maintained a relationship for years without his family never questioning his literal existence.

I just do not understand when people criticise when they expect something different than T2 because from my understanding, T2 is bound to happen over and over again in different formats.

Or the fact that people want something different because the other films are indeed different but are still the same story with different details and chapters but still telling the same story overall.",sammyjamez,1heq335,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,2024-12-15 10:42:00,0,0.24,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heq335

movies,Smile 2 (2024) My expectations where tripled what I expected! What did you think of the film?  ,"WARNING! Naturally, spoilers. If you haven't seen the film, do not proceed. 



&gt;!Ever since the first film, I jumped on reddit almost as fast as did with the sequel now, giving it heavy praise. I was shocked a good portion thought it was kind of laughable. The scares are important sure, but what Smile 2 provides is just unsettling anxiety. Thankfully the ammount of jump scares were JUST enough but not too much, which I admit the first film might of had just a little too much of. For example, when Skye (Naomi Scott) looked in her closet there was a dozen of people she knew smiling at her. I thought ""ok any moment they will rush and the movie goes on"" They rushed alright. But they just got closer. The scene which was less than a minute felt like a eternity. I was so uncomfortable (in a good movie way) I was just thinking common man what what WHATS gonna happen"". Then they get even closer but stacked on top each other. Honestly that made me smile in real life and giggle for a slight moment. The acting in this movie is superb. Naomi Scott was brilliant. I couldn't help thinking how hard it must of been to act it all out, but she brilliantly executed her performance. She made it feel so realistic. There was two jaw dropping (and i mean literally) moments in the film where i stood still silent in awe. The very beginning when Joel got hit by the car in the beginning. But better yet, the f&amp;$%ing ending! The moment I realized reality set in realizing 7,000+ people are about to all get the curse, DUDE I just instantly imagined a sequel for a world apocalypses movie lol. !&lt;

&gt;!Honestly, idk why but I loved both films. I never get excited for a sequel as much as I did this. As a matter of fact, I'm going to create a SCP dedicated to this ""demon"" or ""curse"".

movies,"I have a soft spot for ""Die Hard 2"" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three ""Die Hard"" entries.","There's no way, of course, that ""2"" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by ""Vengeance"" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.

But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.

I'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest ""Die Hard"" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",Mst3Kgf,1hetrq0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hetrq0/i_have_a_soft_spot_for_die_hard_2_even_though_i/,2024-12-15 14:33:34,73,0.86,73,0,75,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hetrq0

movies,Are We Supposed to Believe the Actor Is the Character?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about acting and how we experience it as an audience. When I watch a movie, am I supposed to believe the person playing the part is the character they’re portraying? Or is it enough to just see the actor doing their job—sometimes really well—but never fully disappearing into the role?

Take Timothée Chalamet, for example. I haven’t seen his Bob Dylan portayal yet, but when I do, am I supposed to feel like I’m watching Bob Dylan? Or will it just be Timothée doing a solid impression of Dylan? Similarly, with Adam Driver, I really like the guy and his work, but I’m always aware it’s Adam Driver. Whether he’s yelling about the Rebellion in Star Wars or breaking down in Marriage Story, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s him delivering a great performance, not me being fully immersed in the world of the character. DDL became Daniel Plainview for example. I know I know DDL is like fucking insane but shit, he raises the bar. 

Shouldn’t great acting make me forget the actor entirely? Shouldn’t I feel transported—like I’m in a dark IMAX theater, alone, completely immersed in the story and the character? Or is that asking too much? Maybe it’s enough to just appreciate the craft, even if I never fully lose sight of the actor behind it.

I’d love to hear how others feel about this. Do you find yourself believing in the character, or are you always aware of the actor? Is there a specific performance where you did feel like the actor completely disappeared?

And there is one thing that bugs me, which is the actual ending of the movie. Like how Susan was going to explain to Wallace why Henry died is because she let Henry fall to his death? Wallace never believed any word Mark said about Henry being really evil. This movie really needed this storyline but it was missed out.

Hey r/movies!

Writer's block has hit hard, and I'm hoping a good movie can help spark some creativity. I recently loved *The Fault in Our Stars*, *Then Came You*, and *Dead Poets Society* – all deeply emotional, thought-provoking, and heartwarming in their own ways.

So, I'm turning to you movie gurus! What films should I watch next that offer a similar blend of emotional depth, thought-provoking elements, and heartwarming moments? Any genre is welcome, as long as it's well-made and emotionally resonant. Something to really get those creative juices flowing!

movies,Can you name this movie?,"It’s an action movie that people watch near Christmas because it happens around that time of year. 

It’s about the relationship between a white cop and a black cop that become friends over the course of the movie. 

The white cop’s character is largely driven by issues stemming from his wife, while the black cop is just a normal street cop that unexpectedly gets mixed up in something bigger. 

They are going up against an international criminal gang led by a charismatic, well-spoken, suit-wearing sophisticate of a bad guy. 

The bad guy’s main henchman is a physically imposing mercenary who is very blonde. 

The very blonde henchman is seemingly defeated in an epic one-on-one physical brawl with the white cop, but actually pops back up again at the very end to be shot simultaneously by both the white cop and black cop, killing him. 

The movie came out in the 80’s.
