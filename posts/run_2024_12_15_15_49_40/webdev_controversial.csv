webdev,I think we should do a subreddit-wide hackathon! (If mods allow it),"I noticed a ton of cool stuff posted here yesterday on showoff saturday and I think it would be really cool to do a week/month long hackathon and show off what we built on a showoff saturday.

I for one would like the challenge, there are almost 3m members here and I think some pretty cool stuff would come out of it.

I don't think a prize is even necessary, but maybe as a prize top 3 winner's projects could be stickied on a post for about a week or so. Again, there are almost 3m members, the attention those projects would get from the stickied post would worth at least a few hundred bucks.

We can track the legitimacy of the projects by creating date and progress of the projects' GitHub repos so there won't be people showing something they've built before.

webdev,Why doesn't JavaScript implement an optional type system like PHP and Python?,"I've worked at multiple companies, and every single one of them uses TypeScript or some kind of type-documentation library for JavaScript. So, it makes me wonder: why hasn't JavaScript just added an optional type system, similar to what PHP or Python have done?

In PHP, you can choose to use types for all your code, some of your code, or none at all. It's fully compatible. Even if you're using an un-typed library (which has become rare), you can still add ""type hints"" as doc comments.

    function add(int $a, int $b): int {
        return $a + $b;
    }
    
    function getData(): mixed {
        return json_decode('{""key"": ""value""}', true);
    }
    
    /** @var $userCounts array&lt;string, int&gt; */  // Lets the IDE know $userCounts is type of array&lt;string, int&gt;
    $userCounts = getUserCounts(); 

I really like this system because it's flexible and never gets in the way. Since type support is built into the language by default, almost everyone uses it, and it's now considered best practice to type your code as much as possible.

Meanwhile, in the JavaScript ecosystem, there's still a huge gap. Most React or framework/library tutorials teach JavaScript first, and people only transition to TypeScript later—if they do at all. This feels odd, especially considering that browsers still don't support TypeScript natively.

An optional type system in JavaScript itself could make the developer experience smoother and reduce the reliance on external tools like TypeScript.  Is there a technical reason why JavaScript hasn't gone this route?",Representative-Dog-5,1heplzn,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1heplzn/why_doesnt_javascript_implement_an_optional_type/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1heplzn/why_doesnt_javascript_implement_an_optional_type/,2024-12-15 10:05:49,0,0.33,0,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heplzn
webdev,We Built an Environment That Annoys Salty Web Devs: The Shelbula CDE (Conversational Development Environment),"Our small team of long-time devs (aka old devs / gasp: millennials!) have been working on it for a few months now. [Shelbula.dev](http://Shelbula.dev) gives the best of AI coding assistants in a dedicated environment, free from your IDE. Just bring your own OpenAI or Anthropic key. We call it the Conversational Development Environment (CDE).

With that, we can do a lot more. Work with multiple bots at once, give bots your entire project context instead of one file at a time (like in IDE editors tend to do), save snippets as you go, quick copy code blocks from the built-in code blocks, drag and drop files with any model, and most importantly adjust context windows on the fly. Chat getting too long? Trim the whole chat or prune specific messages to keep context alive. Multiple tab friendly for multiple chats at once. 

**Will it code for you? Absolutely not. It's not a substitute for knowledge. It's a productivity tool for those WITH knowledge.**

As any good developer knows, AI gives the wrong answer 50% of the time, but when you're able to provide full project context and micro manage conversations, your ability to get the right code on the first try improves dramatically. Additionally, our structuring allows models to return FULL blocks of code (up to 1000 lines on Claude 3.5 for example) vs the ""insert here"" kind of placeholders AI just loves.

It's free while our beta period finishes up the end of this month. There are several new bots being tested over the next week that come with Pro plans. (React Mockups, Documentation Bot, Multi-step flows) Gemini 2 support coming in January as well.

We know there's a huge divide of ""AI is useless for coding"" and ""AI is incredible for coding"" but through our teams 40+ years of combined programming experience we think it's a game changer when your dev brain can focus on architecture while the bots do the boring syntax. Time is money in this game, and Shelbula is all about saving you time.

webdev,Question: Same backend for both mobile and web app,"Hi,

I have a question for the same backend design for both mobile and web app:

https://preview.redd.it/cd5ki8srzw6e1.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be0df63885df95a99d1662001bed6b5e07fa11b7

API usually sends back ***JSON*** response. While, as can be seen from the picture above, mobile app has the view on the frontend so it only requests the json data and it knows how to render the data in the app. While for web app, the browser doesn't know the view, therefore the backend need to send back the **HTML view** along with the dynamic data.

After searching, I come up with 2 feasible solutions:

https://preview.redd.it/25zq9pu50x6e1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b798f27c8588be8cff137780f6bc2b78eb5f182

So:

1. **First approach**: Having another **helper class** to help query from the model, which returns JSON data format. Then it depends on the controller route class to return JSON/HTML. This means the controller route class for API and Web will be different
2. **Second Approach**: Web page still send a static new page, but **on load**, there will be a JS to request dynamic data from the same API from the Backend. But for HTML Form post, I am not sure how the 2nd page knows what data was sent by the 1st page.

Since, I am new, I would like to hear more input/advice from the people here of which approach is better or is there another best practice approach?

In case this matter:

Mobile frontend framework: **Flutter**

Backend framework: **Laravel**

Web frontend framework: *not decided yet*

I tried setting the z-index up to fix it but it won't work.  I tried consulting the GPT AI, it basically said the same thing, to set the z-index but it's recommendation made no change either.

I stripped the site down and put it up at [https://test.nazarickonline.com](https://test.nazarickonline.com) to show the markup.  Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?  How can I make the dropdowns not slide under the main content area?

[Link to demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmZAew8MZ-Q&amp;lc=UgwCs7TRIIKJUwdgtih4AaABAg)

This is a first pass at a Rust driven audio looper with FX. I plan on iterating on and rewriting much of this application, and once I am happy with it, I would love to get some contributions.

The main issue right now stems from having to use crossbeam to send samples to a DSP library, which gives worse performance and can cause audio pops, especially when recording or using heavyweight software in the background. I have another backend repo that uses iterators, and a double buffer for recording that performs much better, but the reverb algorithm is not as nice as the one in FunDSP. I plan on maybe porting that over to a more lightweight solution.

I also ran into some nastiness with the audiograph, as the library I used needs a lot of this information at compile time, and I didn't want to use macros, so there is some repeated code. I think there may be an alternative way to set this up, but I did some pretty hacky stuff there for the time being.

My goal would be to get this performant enough to run on a RaspberryPi, although I may have overestimated the Pi's ability to render WebView performantly.

webdev,Best way to test mobile sites (cache issues)?,"Hi.  

I'm working on a website and I need it to behave differently on mobile; larger inputs for easier touch use, changing horizontal stuff to vertical, etc.  So I setup my media rules and loaded it on Chrome on my Android Galaxy Note9.  Looks good, just needed a little tweak.  Change the CSS, reload.  No difference.  I think, ahh cache.  So I hit the hamburger, scroll down, settings, privacy, delete browsing data, delete data, confirm, back, back, back, hamburger, reload.  

Twelve !@##$% steps.  Is there an easier way to do this?  Plus while that usually works, for some reason I'm having trouble today.  To test, I set a media rule:

    @media (max-device-width: 805px) {
      INPUT[type=text] {
        border: 2px solid #F00 !important;
      }
    }

I figured that'll make it glaringly obvious when the media rule takes effect.  Cleared cache, but still not going red.  Now this site's DNS is served through Cloudflare's proxy, so I suppose CF may also be introducing some caching; dunno.  On my PC, I go to the site and leave full screen then drag the right side of the window in and eventually when it's small enough, bam, I get red borders.  So the rule is working.  I run dual DNS for my domains; [www.mysite.com](http://www.mysite.com) on the phone *(external network)* is getting [50.77.xxx.xxx](http://50.77.xxx.xxx) whilst on my browser on the PC *(internal network)* it's 10.0.10.100.  Ergo, no CF.  

I can temporarily disable the proxy for my testing but I was curious how other people deal with this.  I'm sure exposing your IP temporarily is not a typical debug routine, lol.   I'm not even 100% CF is the culprit either, I'm just guessing.

One of the projects I featured is actually a flashy gamified 3D Arcade experience, but I kept the main portfolio more understated and clean - I hope I’m not shooting myself in a foot with that choice?

Would greatly appreciate any feedback/advice on the portfolio! Do you think it is competitive enough to be applying for junior positions/freelancing or is there something I should add?

You can check the portfolio here: www.byilya.com Thank you!

webdev,Is there a good repo I can clone to learn from?,"I’m an experienced dev but I mostly work at the C/C++ level. I learn a lot from reading other people’s code as a first step and then iterating on that. 

I’m curious if there’s a good repo out there that I can clone and then play around with to learn from. Mostly trying to get rock solid on JavaScript/React and also see a ton of CSS at play. If there’s backend stuff that’s cool too. 

Edit: I already know css and html. Mostly want to get really good at JavaScript and its integration with the other two technologies.

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] FlagDraw.IO: A flag coloring game,"I just made [FlagDraw.IO](http://FlagDraw.IO), a game to challenge your flag knowledge.

Right now, there are only two game modes: Timed and Classic. In Timed, you have 1 minute to correctly color as many flags as possible, and in Classic, you have five lives.

[Images](https://imgur.com/a/C4gR32F)

In total, there are 269 flags in the game. ^(Nice)

**How I made it:**

* Designed in Figma
* Built with SvelteKit
* Hosted on Vercel
* Flag Source: [lipis/flag-icons](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons) (Would have lost my sanity without them)

Initially I tried building it in Defold and Flutter. But with SVG support in browsers, it was much easier this way.

Let me know how you like it, and I'd love your feedback to make the game better!",wirklich1,1he4vnu,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1he4vnu/showoff_saturday_flagdrawio_a_flag_coloring_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1he4vnu/showoff_saturday_flagdrawio_a_flag_coloring_game/,2024-12-14 15:10:59,3,1.0,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_wbCDNGePL51h4lxg50ZhjTwfCbXKc9h_sI6o5np3RI.jpg,t3_1he4vnu
webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I invented an original word puzzle concept and made a web based game out of it.,"WordGlyph - Build letters stick by stick to find the hidden word using the least amount of sticks.

No libraries.  css and JS. I tried to use AI to bootstrap the game from pictures of the board game version I made. It couldn't do it. I tried to describe the game in detail but it failed to make the matrices. So I had to get the basic matrices working myself and once I showed AI my code then it finally understood what I was doing and it helped out. Claude was certainly better than openai. I will also say that currently there is no way someone who does not know how to code could have made this game just with AI. So many times it got itself stuck it a pit. So many times I'd have to figure out the issue and tell AI why and then it'd  say ""I see the issue now."" Often times it would try to solve a bug in a convoluted way. And I'd see what really was going and say why not just do this and it would always reply ""Your right the simpler approach is much better!""",Atvenice,1he4q46,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1he4q46/showoff_saturday_i_invented_an_original_word/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1he4q46/showoff_saturday_i_invented_an_original_word/,2024-12-14 15:03:40,2,1.0,2,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1he4q46
