books,which book made you DNF at page 1?,"not out of boredom, but something that makes you go nope!

i was really looking forward to reading the brief and wondrous life of oscar wao, because I saw so many vague reviews claiming it's the best book they have ever read.

on page 1, while describing the (real) dictator and his crimes against women - as something trivial or worse a flex, 
even humourously by a man.

books,"I forget the books after I read them, and it makes me a bit frustrated","When someone brings this matter up, usually the following quote is posted: 

&gt;I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

While I understand how perfectly natural and reasonable this phenomenon is, it still irks me from time to time. Isn't it quite irritable that, say, eight month after finishing a novel, I can recall only some vague details and general atmosphere, maybe one or two motifs? 

For example, the books I read about 2 years ago, that captivated me for weeks after I had finished them - *Les Miserables* by Victor Hugo, *The Idiot* by Dostoyevsky or *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem - are now almost vanished from my memory, for I recount only their outline, some random impressions. I bet I couldn't speak about them for more than ten minutes if I were forbidden to make vague statements like 'the writing was amazing', 'the characters were multi-dimensional', etc. Theoretically I even lack the proof that I ever opened them. 

And the matter is worse! This summer I have read, among others, two magnificent novels that produced on me the most profound impression - *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck and *Joke* by Milan Kundera. I was so excited that I hastened to write some (flawed) reviews here on Reddit. And now I feel that they are fading away from my memory, the same novels that I reckoned the height of literature, among the finest masterpieces I have ever read! 

This week I finished two novellas of Steinbeck that held me engrossed from first page to last, and I can't help thinking that in six months time, I won't even remember the characters' names. 

Once again, I perfectly understand that this all natural and intrinsical. I can only hope that in the end there is *something* indefinite that persists from every book, remaining somewhere in my subconsciousness.

books,How did you get into your favorite genre?,"I read a lot of fantasy.  I was just thinking about how I got into fantasy.  Some 30 years ago in my early high school years I was reading Stephen King.   I read Tommyknockers and Needful Things,  then I stumbled across The Eyes of the Dragon and LOVED it.  While reading it, my uncle bought me the first book in the Dragon King trilogy by Stephen R. Law Lawhead which I devoured and then followed it with his Pendragon Cycle.  Taliesin (Pendragon book 1) was the first books that really evoked an emotional response from me.

books,The Long Walk by Stephen King ,"Now, first I want to say the book is pretty good BUT I have one major, glaring issue with the book. The whole premise of the book is that these boys are walking for miles and miles and if they drop below a certain pace they get a warning. After three warnings the boy is shot and killed. Okay, that’s a great premise and I loved the execution of the story! Here’s my one issue….the walking pace is set to 4mph. For anyone who has been on a treadmill would soon find out, four miles per hour is a breakneck walk. In the book I am often picturing boys just barely shuffling along at the minimum speed, and some boys end up crawling for a time at the right speed!! I’m on a treadmill as I write this walking at a reasonable 3mph and the guy next to me is jogging at 4mph. I just remembered this main plot point in that book and how much it bothered me and apparently still bothers me. Unless Stephen King has an amazing walking pace, I don’t think he ever stepped on a treadmill to see if his main plot point even made sense…",DanielGaff,1he8orv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he8orv/the_long_walk_by_stephen_king/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he8orv/the_long_walk_by_stephen_king/,2024-12-14 18:10:12,117,0.84,117,0,78,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1he8orv
books,"Just finished Let the Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist, some questions","As the title says. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride but had a few things that stood out to me as either I missed something, or that were a wrinkle for me in the story's consistency. A lot can be left up to imagination, certainly, but some things felt unintentionally missing. 

&gt;!1: Elias has to ""turn off"" Jocke after biting him. Those he does not disconnect this way become infected, indicating that saliva as well as blood transmits the disease. Though the wound is made with a razor, Elias drinks directly from Tommy. How was Tommy not infected?!&lt;

&gt;!2: Elias sleeping in a bathtub full of blood raised a lot of questions. Where did the blood come from and what was it's purpose? Elias needed to consume relatively fresh blood, and there was nothing I found indicating either Hakan or Elias getting hold of so much, certainly not in a short time span as to be ""fresh"". So then was it Elias' from the wound in his back, or something similar to how he began emptying out when not invited into Oskar's apartment - like he rests in his own blood that seeps out of him? If that was the case, it was all lost when Lacke ran it down the drain which seems would have left Elias severely weakened. And, did the wound in the back come from the fight with zombie Hakan? The other damage suffered in that scene seemed to be mostly correcting itself before Elias had even left the basement.!&lt;

&gt;!3: Probably the biggest, as it's a sizeable element of the story, why was Elias acting as a girl? What's more, how did he even come to be infected? The initial vampire - the royal pervert - had Elias castrated and bled from the wound into a bowl, drinking from that. How then was Elias infected? And, more complicated because I get the idea that, *should anyone look down there* it might be an easier explanation to start from the premise of being a girl. But given what Elias is capable of, who is going to be inspecting him to find out? And, anyone who was allowed/able to inspect would find exactly what Oskar saw, a flat nothing space with a scar. So then, what's the value of acting as though he's a girl, unless as a means of manipulation - which really doesn't work because Hakan liked little boys.!&lt;

Thoughts? Opinions? I do try to be attentive in my reading, though can be distracted at times and able to miss details. Are any of these easily explained or am I raising similar questions now for others who read the book also?",dl00lIl00lb,1helwf3,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1helwf3/just_finished_let_the_right_one_in_by_john_ajvide/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1helwf3/just_finished_let_the_right_one_in_by_john_ajvide/,2024-12-15 05:32:25,12,0.85,12,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1helwf3

books,How to step outside your book comfort zone more?,"So I’ll step outside it a little but not usually and while obviously if it’s my comfort zone that means I love it but still I need to branch out I feel.

My book comfort zone is Romantsy, found family trope, and enemies to lovers. 

It’s to the point where like every book I open has the same layout of young woman who is strong but deep down is broken by her traumatic past and there’s magic and a training arc and oh wow she has magic now and the guy who seemed so tough on the outside who she hated but now theres some feelings there. And ofc a whole found family that is just like her with traumatic passes and magic and are so badass and hot and cool in a laid back way and would do anything for each other. I mean I just eat it up every time! 

It’s the adult version of the type of books I devoured as a child. It’s magic but also there’s sex and trauma and the stakes are way higher lol.

Oh and how can I forget I also love Gods and different mythology elements and just all that.

But I do think it’s time to maybe branch out a little bit more than I do. I think I could be convinced to take a leap into horror, probably not regular romance, and I’m ok with historical fiction (it’s still better with magic though). We can’t scare me away here though ok nothing too modern and calm ok no romcoms.

You know I just how do y’all stop reading practically the same book every time?

Not every book needs to be 500+ pages of magic and fighting and love and break my heart! I say as I just ordered another of that exact type…",MooMooTheDummy,1hekfy9,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hekfy9/how_to_step_outside_your_book_comfort_zone_more/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hekfy9/how_to_step_outside_your_book_comfort_zone_more/,2024-12-15 04:01:10,9,0.67,9,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hekfy9
books,A Year of Reading to a 5 Year Old,"My son turned 6 this fall and this is the first really consistent year I've spent reading chapter books with him. I've looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I'd look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old's perspective.

**The BFG** by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it's fun.

**Charlie and the Chocolate Factory** by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We've been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)

**Fantastic Mr. Fox** by Roald Dahl - A lot shorter than I was expecting and probably my kid's least favorite Dahl.

**James and the Giant Peach** by Roald Dahl - Kid liked it fine, it was my least favorite Dahl and there are a lot of voices to do if you do that.

**The Wild Robot Trilogy** by Peter Brown - We finished the 3rd one about a week before the movie came out by coincidence. The first 2 are really good and my son was constantly asking if we could read just one more chapter since the chapters are short. The 3rd one is fine but it's not as connected as the first 2 are. It felt more like an afterthought.

**Stuart Little** by E.B. White - I thought this was a pleasure to read as an adult. The kid enjoyed it although he was startled by the abrupt ending.

**The Horse and His Boy** and **The Silver Chair** by C.S. Lewis - This concluded Narnia for us, I think. We've read everything but The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. I loved Narnia as a kid but it's rough for this age. There are some very talky and slow parts that my kid just didn't get. He really like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which we read last year but otherwise, Narnia is maybe better left for an older kid.

**The Wizard of Oz** by Frank Baum - This seems like a perfect book for this age group.  It's very episodic in it's structure.  The language was a little old fashioned (which isn't surprising), but the kid really liked it.  The tornado scene was very memorable and he really liked the color coding that happens in the book.  The biggest surprise here was that the movie was likewise a huge hit.

We're currently reading **Phantom Tollbooth** by Norton Juster and while I don't dislike it,  I wish we weren't.  There is a lot of word play that is missed by reading out loud (witch vs. which, weather vs. whether).  But he seems to be enjoying it.

For this age, what is working for us is shorter chapters, not too talky, some pictures, and a touch of silliness.  I don't think we need all those ticked off for a successful ""read aloud to a 5/6 year old but it helps.  Reading a lot of older books means explaining somethings that just aren't a part of my kid's life like porcelain and corporal punishment.",CliffDiverLemming,1hdsiyd,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,2024-12-14 02:08:52,925,0.97,925,0,167,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdsiyd
books,"Paradise Lost (John Milton, 1608-1674)","So, I have been reading Paradise Lost by John Milton again for a while now, and I can fully say that I am enamored with this book. Ever since reading Milton a couple of years ago I have been captivated by his sheer prose and poetic works. Two years ago I bought Paradise Lost, a Poem that I've grown to love and to place in the literary Parnassus along with Dante, Virgil, Ovid, Shakespeare and other major works of ancient and modern literature.

Paradise Lost was written during a time of political and literary upheval in Britain (Civil War, execution of Charles I, rule of Lord Protector Cromwell over Britain until his death in 1658, the Restoration of King Charles II), and so many themes about Monarchy and Republicanism can be found in it. Milton composed this work when he was already blind (he became blind in 1652) with the help of friends and amanuenses, and he sold the rights of the poem in 1667 for only 10£ (Milton was severely impoverished by the time he concluded the poem in 1665). Either way, this Poem placed him in the Parnassus of English poets and went on to place him on the pedestal of many romantic writers in the 1800's (most notably William Blake, Lord Byron, John Keats, etc...). 

Paradise Lost describes the struggle of Satan (show in comparison with Achilles, Aeneas, Odysseus, etc.), following the Epic tradition of Homer and other Greek Poets. The Poem begins with an invocation to a muse (but Milton skilfully puts Urania, the Muse of Astronomy and Divine Wisdom, instead of the classical muses), and the poem begins with the fall of Satan and all of the other rebel angels after the angelic war in Heaven. Satan resolves to cause chaos on God's new creation (Earth) and on God's newfound race: Humanity. He sneaks inside the Garden of Eden and whispers into Eve's ear when she is sleeping, but he gets caught by Michael and other celestial angels. 

The plan is slowly set in motion: Eve, frightened, searchs for comfort in Adam's arms; Raphael, one of God's Archangels, describes the dangers of Satan to Adam and the celestial war that was fought in Heaven to save Heaven from the yoke of the terrible apostate angel. Eve, meanwhile, is approached by Satan (in the guise of a snake) and is tempted into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge, causing the original sin and the fall of man from Eden. Adam, seeing Eve eat the fruit, decides to share the guilt of the sin togheter with his wife (which he himself had requested as a ""consort""), ultimately getting condemned by God to work the fields, for they will never give Adam the fruits that he had freely enjoyed in the Garden of Eden; Eve is condemened to suffer through the pains of childbirth. The poem ends on a soft note though, as Adam can find a ""Paradise within thee, happier far"". 

This is honestly one of the best works in English literature that I have ever read, and I want to know more from people who live in the United Kingdom themselves. What do you think about this Epic Poem? Is it good? Is it bad?",Justanotheryankee-12,1heb6e5,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1heb6e5/paradise_lost_john_milton_16081674/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1heb6e5/paradise_lost_john_milton_16081674/,2024-12-14 20:04:01,27,0.83,27,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heb6e5
