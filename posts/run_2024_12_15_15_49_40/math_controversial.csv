math,What is the logic behind matrices and determinants?,"I'm having trouble trying to imagine the operations of a matrix and determinants. It's easy to imagine what + or - does. One adds while the other substracts, one can imagine with the help of real world objects. it is even easy to imagine for integration and differentiation as well. But the problem is, what the hell is a matrix? what is the logic behind it? We can represent a system of linear equations through it, find their solutions through it, but what is the logic behind it? How are we being able to do that? Why are we allowed to do that? Why are we allowed use determinants while finding the cross products of two vectors?

I think a big part of my success was internalizing the topological versions of definitions for things like convergence. If I were to give one piece of advice to future analysis students who don’t like using quantifiers all that much, it would be to think about things in terms of ε-neighborhoods, which either your professor or textbook will likely mention.

Doron Zeilberger's Opinion 124 can be summarized based on its title by the sentence ""A Database is Worth a Thousand Mathematical Articles"".  I think that this is a fair assessment, since a good mathematical database can distill the essence of many thousands of mathematical articles. OEIS (On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) is the best example of a good mathematical database.

If you go to the main page of OEIS you can see the Year-end donation appeal. The link at the top of the post however, goes to the OEIS donation page  (it has useful info and links). 

Somebody already made a post on this subreddit that mentions that OEIS is looking for a part-time or full-time Managing Editor (paid position).  The salary of the managing editor will probably be the biggest expense of the organization, especially if it's a full time position. Maybe, if enough math enthusiasts donate , OEIS can have the budged to hire a full-time managing editor for 5 or more years. More top candidates would want the position if it's full time, stable and long term.

It teachs the basics through a narrative-discussion way between the two authors.It completely changed the way I see Algebra. It has transformed it into a game.

So, all that said.
*I discovered that there is a book about calculus for the same two authors. It really clicked in time as I've started pre-calculus this semester.
So, I've searched for it , but unfortunately can't seem to find it .

math,Is there any kind of typology of (infinite) fields? How many types are the most relevant?,"Hi everyone! When studying algebra about fields, I remember noticing that compared to groups or rings, there is quite a limited number of fields that is closely looked on. If groups are plenty of any structure, ""size, shape"", fields seem to be pretty limited. In the basic course we usually have Q, R, C, and finite fields GF(p^k). In p-adic course one can also know of the (infinite) Q_p field.

For finite fields we know that all of them are encompassed by GF(p^k) and we can't make up anything that isn't isomorphic to one of GF(p^k). But what about infinite fields?

I think about ways to construct new fields. R and Q_p are the only variants that we can get from Q by completing it with respect to some norm. C is an algebraic extension of R that happens to be its algebraic closure. There should be some beast that is the algebragraic closure of a finite field GF(p) (which I can't imagine how it would be constructed and work). Also, having some field F, we can construct a field of rational functions with coefficients of F, that way we can construct an infinite field of the finite characteristic, if we take some GF(p^n) as our F. This rational function construction is basically an expansion by inserting some element x to the field.

So, my question is, can we categorise the infinite fields somehow regarding their structure and how many fields and field types are actually useful for mayh practise. Is it just our friends Q, R, C mostly or some exotic fields are useful as well?",kamalist,1he5jgp,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1he5jgp/is_there_any_kind_of_typology_of_infinite_fields/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1he5jgp/is_there_any_kind_of_typology_of_infinite_fields/,2024-12-14 15:42:48,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1he5jgp
