gaming,Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - PS5 vs PC comparison,"Lighting and Shadows
The PC version significantly improves lighting. Characters’ faces appear more lifelike with balanced illumination, and the shadows are sharper with better depth, making scenes with Aerith and Cloud stand out even more.

Background Details
The environments look much clearer and more refined. Effects like the glowing bokeh in Aerith’s scene appear smoother, while Cloud’s surroundings benefit from sharper textures and greater detail.

Texture Quality
The PC version enhances textures across the board. Aerith’s hair shows individual strands, and Cloud’s outfit looks crisper and more detailed, making the characters feel even more realistic.

Color Grading
Colors on PC are richer and more vibrant, with improved contrast. It avoids the slightly washed-out look seen on PS5, resulting in a more visually dynamic presentation.

Ambient Occlusion &amp; Effects
Small details, like shading in clothing folds and subtle creases, are much more refined. Additionally, effects like glowing particles are smoother and more polished, adding to the overall visual depth.",Tomozuki,1heis71,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heis71/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth_ps5_vs_pc_comparison/,https://i.redd.it/bmlpq3tbax6e1.jpeg,2024-12-15 02:23:00,0,0.48,0,0,45,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NoHXWvNKIZbN4D4sFBWeJK-thQEE6PHoIasXgjAoSfk.jpg,t3_1heis71

gaming,Extraction shooter most similar to CoD DMZ (on PS5)? ,"I know that extraction shooters are the current battle royales, but I really only played DMZ so that's my only reference for the genre. I enjoyed squadding up, completing the missions against NPCs, helping others complete their missions, progressing through the missions/rewards, and the occasional PVP battle. It's one of the few games where the randoms you squad with are generally pro-team and want to help each other get things checked off. 

What Playstation extraction shooter is the most similar to the DMZ experience? I'm not sure if they all have the dual PVE/PVP aspects of DMZ or if most are mainly PVP? For me DMZ was 75% PVE and 25% PVP how I played it and that was cool for me. I know some people played it exclusively to go PVP hunting but that's not my style and the toxic proximity chat was crazy at times. Is there another game that plays the same with missions, etc. ?

gaming,(Discussion) A hilarious roast of GameInformer Magazine I emailed to them in 2012 regarding a ZombiU review and zombie games in general. (I love both). What does Reddit think of ZombiU now?,"Your reveiw of zombie U I thought was quite generally wrong. Because of this I assumed it was horrible. 

But First off, the environment hasn't played so well in a game for me since Bioshock. Sure I've played dead space, left4dead and even dayZ, warZ and even Amnesia, but I thought the sounds around you and the amount of detail going into each environment really sells the zombie apocalypse, better than anything I've seen before. And it wasn't intentionally throwing stupid scripted events at you like FEAR or dead space either

You said everything is blurry and too dark too see? First off, there are settings for brightness, and also I feel like you must have been playing on a small non HD TV in your gameinformer office somewhere. I am like 6 hours in, and I don't feel like I've played the same zombie twice, and thats been a big problem for me in every zombie game. It takes away from the moment when you see two coming at you that look exactly the same, and that hasn't happened in this yet. 

I just think you are not one to like this sort of game. The ""gimmick"" of scanning for items and doing other things with the WiiU's pro controller really worked well for me and it really isn't hard to raise up the controller, and this is coming from a guy who can only use ONE HAND for most things due to a brain tumor. And I didnt die for the first few hours, I got use to the controls very fast, and started playing right after plugging in my wiiU. Maybe you just aren't a very good apocalypse survivor ;). Left4dead is more action-oriented, and I really liked it for that, and you can take out 5-10 zombies in one hit.

Another bone I have to pick with zombie games in general is the fact that you hit a zombie once with a melee weapon, and it goes down. Is the human skull made out of pudding? No! Remember the first two kills in Shaun of the Dead? They bashed that thing like 15 times! So I like that it's more realistic and less like left4dead. Left4dead is more action oriented and I really liked it for that, and you can take out 5-10 zombies in one hit. ZombiiU is a single player experience, it can have action, but also has more of a stealthy side to it, you can't just run around like a headless chimpanzee and wack anything in site and expect to live or have a fun time. That was pretty clear to me. It sounds weird to say, but maybe you just played the game wrong. The controls seemed fine and after getting new items you just have to rearrange your immediate inventory and backpack items, and just be smart about it. Also the swinging of the bat is REALISTIC. if you pay attention while facing an enemy, the first swing is quick, and with every swing after it gets a tad slower with fatigue.

Then you said ""the useless quest tracker"" and ""confusing map system"". Are you mentally handicap? Because that was a higher point for the game to me. Its a simple freaking map! Everything is square and you can see your arrow in real time! And if you have a mission objective, you know what direction to go. In the beginning when I cleared out all the zombies in a few areas, I used the map and the arrow (you) to walk around ALONE just looking at the controller screen. 

And the audio was great! Like I said every zombie feels unique and I'm still hearing new screeching noises escape from them when I fight. And the only noise i notice coming out of the pro controller is when the British guy talks to you, which is rare, or I go in my backpack.

I have been angered by reviews before, but never enough to write in to gameinformer.  it honestly feels like you were paid off by someone to give it a horrible reputation. 

I do, however, agree with you that they needed to include online support for their multiplayer. You failed to mention though that there are spray paint cans you can find, and leave messages on walls for others to see when they play through single player, and I thought this was a brilliant idea. 

And I am not a ""fanboy"". I own the 3 biggest systems now and never wanted the original Wii. The wiiU was a christmas present

I usually really like gameinformer's reveiws....but Seeing reviews like this makes me feel happy in a way. Because I feel like I could do a better job.

\*\*\*

""On this day the 11th of October 2024, we announce SUMMER ETERNAL.

  
We recognize we are writing the opening words of our story at a time of apocalyptic material conditions for game creators across the world.

Our art has been dressed down into an industry,and this industry has been pilfered by corrupt executives, by the vulgar profiteering of corporate bodies moving like leviathans in the dark, burning human fuel in their insatiable lust for money.

It is not pencil-pushers and moneylenders who make games. It is the relentless passion of the workers that creates an art form capable of saying something true.

  
As creators and game makers, we have too long been led away from the truth, away from the right to define ourselves as artists in service of the definitive art form of the future, one that has made us dream since we were children.

Instead, the disposability culture operating at the ruthless core of this industry wants us to think of ourselves as cogs in the machine: rudimentary craftsmen, disposable career workers, inert producers of made-to-order marketing-driven ""content"" — empty calories leaving the soul hungry.

The Profiteer knows that by keeping your dignity low, he will keep you crawling on the treadmill of passion until he lays you off for the sake of the red number in his book.

We make games because we have to. It is our calling. Because we have no choice but to see the transformative potential of this youngest medium of human interaction. You can't turn away once you've seen the light,Or it will always feel like everyone else in the world is doing something without you, there in the light you try to abandon but can't, because — oh, the horror — it comes from inside you.

All art is communication — dialogue across time, space and thought. In its rawest, it is one mind’s ability to provoke emotion in another.Large language models— simulacra, cold comfort, real-doll pocket-pussy, cyberspace freezer of an abandoned IM-chat — which are today passed off for “artificial intelligence”,will never be able to offer a dialogue with the vision of another human being.

Machine-generated works will never satisfy or substitute the human desire for art, as our desire for art is in its core a desire for communication with another,with a talent who speaks to us across worlds and ages to remind us of our all-encompassing human universality. There is no one to connect to in a large language model. The phone line is open but there’s no one on the other side.

The peddlers who aim to get rich quick from this scheme will always PLAY THE FOOL to any ethical or artistic argument. This is why we must push back against Big Tech's encroachment on the territory of our art,against increasing corporatization and alienation of game creators from their work, against the robbery of rights from workers, performers, artists and all contributors to this complicated and MULTI-FACETED medium.

Our mission is to unite world-class artists and creatives in a truly independent game studio which will always prioritize artistic integrity over personal comfort, profit margin, short term interests and Big Tech profit-bubbles.

There we will be able to embark on that treacherous road of building a cultural megaproject, a Role Playing Game with complexity and ambition worthy to rival our wretched and wonderful world.

In this we are committed to pursue the highest caliber of literary quality.

Here we stand, bound by our love for games and devotion to our craft, ready to bleed and weep and ride the cavalry into machine gun fire one more time.

For this we will need all the support and help from you, our readers, colleagues and future visionaries. Come walk the desert with us.

We will not take any of your support for granted.We have seen the suffering wrought by the hunger for power, the terror of greed and envy, the complicity of the averted eye. We have also seen the triumph of the human spirit, of solidarity in the striving, of making something never before seen and seeing its miracle unfold in the world. We have seen poverty, and we have seen plenty. We will make mistakes, we will win and we will fail, but we will never forget what we are doing this for.  
  
Yours in every season,

gaming,Microsoft's $100B Acquisitions: Apparently the New-Original IPs are staying Xbox-Exclusive (for now),"**Note:** As of now I only own PS5 and may setup (budget issues, lol) a PC in next couple of years if non-PS games really become attractive to me. Even though I'll get downvoted but I personally feel that there should be some exclusives attached to a brand if a brand is targeting a platform/hardware system. Since MS has spent 100B on acquiring studios, its simply not possible to keep everything exclusive as PS is the moneymaker in software as well. But I observed a very cool thing. I've seen that apart from few exceptions (Hellblade 2 &amp; Licensed IPs), Xbox hasn't announced new-owned IPs for Playstation, YET. Yes, lots of games 1st party games are announced for PS but those were already the games which had their previous parts released on PS and weren't closely associated with Xbox brand. Saying that, following is what I've observed. \[*I'm excluding PC and Nintendo from this discussion as Nintendo seems to be on another plane while PC has been adopted by even Sony*\]

* **New Original IPs:** Exclusive to Xbox for now
   1. Starfield
   2. Avowed
   3. Perfect Dark
   4. South of Midnight
   5. Clockwork Revolution
   6. Everwild
   7. Redfall
* **Signature IPs:** Have always been associated with Xbox (or MS in case of Flight Simulator)
   1. Halo Infinite
   2. Forza Horizon 5
   3. Forza Motorsport 2023
   4. State of Decay 3
   5. Fable 2025
   6. Gears E-Day
   7. MS Flight Simulator 2020 &amp; 2024
* **Owned IPs:** Announced or released for PS
   * COD: Black Ops 6
   * Diablo 4
   * Doom: The Dark Ages
   * The Outer Worlds 2
   * Sea of Thieves
   * Deathloop
   * Ghostwire: Tokyo
* Exceptions
   * Hellblade 2 - Still seems to be exclusive even though part 1 was released on PS, so it's a bit difficult to associate this brand with Xbox. May become multi platform
   * Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle - Licensed IP. Would have been nice for a good xbox game to be exclusive but since branding is the main thing so it may not have much of an impact.
   * Blade - May become multi-platform. It's a Marvel brand so no point of pushing it to become Xbox's brand
* State of Xbox - Rumors/Confirmations/Observations
   * GamePass seems to be the core brand for MS Gaming and future
   * Pushing for everything to be ""This is an Xbox"".
   * There's still one more console that they'll release as per Sarah Bond

I think having these 14-15 big exclusive IPs can still be realistic to manage and will also add prestige to xbox brand just like PS has God of War, Uncharted, LOU, Intergalactic, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, Infamous, Astrobot, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Resistance, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Returnal, Days Gone and many others.",blinkyretard,1heqz2v,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,2024-12-15 11:46:20,0,0.23,0,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heqz2v

gaming,"6 Decades of gaming, 6 Decades of Male Main Characters","Gaming as a whole has been oddly male oriented for decades, even after the gaming census a couple years ago and all data collected showing nearly 48% of ""gamers"" are women, men still seem to be the vocal majority. Recently during the game awards and this year, we've seen a bunch of trailers with females as the main protagonist (which i have absolutely no issue with, considering Lora Croft paved the way for some badass characters).

The vocal minority of social media trolls immediately jumping on the 30 second-5 minute trailers as "" woke "" or "" agenda driven "" has really made me wonder why are we so oddly angry about this now?  Take Witcher 4 for an idea, all i see is comments about people being angry that the STORY DRIVEN narrative is now Cersi's perspective even though that's the only direction it should have went. 

Some incredible games have came with female leads

Tomb Raider

Horizon Zero Dawn

The Last of Us

Cyberpunk 2077 (V is canonically female)

Bayonetta

Yet the gaming community is so wrapped up in this toxic understanding that gaming companies are pushing any sort of agenda. Of course companies have the right to produce anything they like, and the fact that most of these misogynistic apelike men masturbated to Lora Croft growing up in their miserable bedrooms, and most likely still do, what is it about now that makes you so unnecessarily loud. We pride companies on following their own values.

Just irritated how video games have fallen into this absolutely abysmal state because everyone is sucked into the abyss of politics they have NO idea about. 

Get excited for games again, give games a chance, and stop immedietly jumping on the bandwagon of "" this game sucks."" without even a second of gameplay available.

gaming,"Synduality Echo of Ada has offline modes planned for end of service, ahead of the game's release","Also there's an open network test for this game until Dec 20

[https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27096](https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27096)

[https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/](https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/)

From Famitsu:

**--Even though there is an online main mode, why did you include the single mode ""Old Amasia Investigation""?**

**Futami**　I didn't want to make a game that would become unplayable if online play were to become unavailable in the future, so I prepared a single mode. Of course, we intend to continue the service, and I don't want it to be taken in a negative sense, but I wanted players to feel reassured that this is not a game that they will no longer be able to play. I also wanted to draw a contrast as a story. In the main story, the player and their own Magus will depict the drama of each player. However, it is not conveyed from within the game how the player interacts with other Magus. So, by looking at the relationship between Alba and Ada, I wanted players to be aware of the relationship between themselves and their own Magus.

**--It has increased a little recently, but most online games cannot be played again once the service ends, so that is a nice consideration.**

**Futami**　Of course, we want to continue the service, but we wanted to get rid of the feeling that the game would become unplayable once the service ends.

**--Will it be possible to play the game completely offline from the beginning?**

**Futami**　No, the introduction to online play is absolutely necessary, and it is unlocked once you have progressed to a certain extent. It is a mode that can be played even after the service ends, but it is not set to be playable completely offline from the time of release.

　Of course, we are considering how to deal with that situation, but we are only making it possible to deal with it, and we do not want to change our stance that it is basically a ""mode that is useful for online play,"" so at this time online play is also required.

From GamerNE:

\--This game is an online-only title, but I think it's quite rare for an online-only title to be sold as a one-time purchase.

Futami: That's right... I think what everyone is worried about on that point is, ""Will I no longer be able to play the game once the service ends?""

However, I would like to make it clear that even if the online service ends, the game will still be playable.

\--What do you mean?

Futami: It's true that currently, online play is required to play this game, but we've already prepared a way to make it possible to play offline. The reason it's required to be online is because we don't want to store data locally to prevent so-called cheating.

Of course, since the game is primarily online, there will be limitations to what you can play, but please rest assured that the packages and games you purchase will not be completely wasted.",JaSonic2199,1heahcu,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,2024-12-14 19:32:43,37,0.78,37,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heahcu
