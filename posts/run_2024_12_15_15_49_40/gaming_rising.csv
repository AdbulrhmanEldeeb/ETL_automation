gaming,(Discussion) A hilarious roast of GameInformer Magazine I emailed to them in 2012 regarding a ZombiU review and zombie games in general. (I love both). What does Reddit think of ZombiU now?,"Your reveiw of zombie U I thought was quite generally wrong. Because of this I assumed it was horrible. 

But First off, the environment hasn't played so well in a game for me since Bioshock. Sure I've played dead space, left4dead and even dayZ, warZ and even Amnesia, but I thought the sounds around you and the amount of detail going into each environment really sells the zombie apocalypse, better than anything I've seen before. And it wasn't intentionally throwing stupid scripted events at you like FEAR or dead space either

You said everything is blurry and too dark too see? First off, there are settings for brightness, and also I feel like you must have been playing on a small non HD TV in your gameinformer office somewhere. I am like 6 hours in, and I don't feel like I've played the same zombie twice, and thats been a big problem for me in every zombie game. It takes away from the moment when you see two coming at you that look exactly the same, and that hasn't happened in this yet. 

I just think you are not one to like this sort of game. The ""gimmick"" of scanning for items and doing other things with the WiiU's pro controller really worked well for me and it really isn't hard to raise up the controller, and this is coming from a guy who can only use ONE HAND for most things due to a brain tumor. And I didnt die for the first few hours, I got use to the controls very fast, and started playing right after plugging in my wiiU. Maybe you just aren't a very good apocalypse survivor ;). Left4dead is more action-oriented, and I really liked it for that, and you can take out 5-10 zombies in one hit.

Another bone I have to pick with zombie games in general is the fact that you hit a zombie once with a melee weapon, and it goes down. Is the human skull made out of pudding? No! Remember the first two kills in Shaun of the Dead? They bashed that thing like 15 times! So I like that it's more realistic and less like left4dead. Left4dead is more action oriented and I really liked it for that, and you can take out 5-10 zombies in one hit. ZombiiU is a single player experience, it can have action, but also has more of a stealthy side to it, you can't just run around like a headless chimpanzee and wack anything in site and expect to live or have a fun time. That was pretty clear to me. It sounds weird to say, but maybe you just played the game wrong. The controls seemed fine and after getting new items you just have to rearrange your immediate inventory and backpack items, and just be smart about it. Also the swinging of the bat is REALISTIC. if you pay attention while facing an enemy, the first swing is quick, and with every swing after it gets a tad slower with fatigue.

Then you said ""the useless quest tracker"" and ""confusing map system"". Are you mentally handicap? Because that was a higher point for the game to me. Its a simple freaking map! Everything is square and you can see your arrow in real time! And if you have a mission objective, you know what direction to go. In the beginning when I cleared out all the zombies in a few areas, I used the map and the arrow (you) to walk around ALONE just looking at the controller screen. 

And the audio was great! Like I said every zombie feels unique and I'm still hearing new screeching noises escape from them when I fight. And the only noise i notice coming out of the pro controller is when the British guy talks to you, which is rare, or I go in my backpack.

I have been angered by reviews before, but never enough to write in to gameinformer.  it honestly feels like you were paid off by someone to give it a horrible reputation. 

I do, however, agree with you that they needed to include online support for their multiplayer. You failed to mention though that there are spray paint cans you can find, and leave messages on walls for others to see when they play through single player, and I thought this was a brilliant idea. 

And I am not a ""fanboy"". I own the 3 biggest systems now and never wanted the original Wii. The wiiU was a christmas present

I usually really like gameinformer's reveiws....but Seeing reviews like this makes me feel happy in a way. Because I feel like I could do a better job.

I absolutely don't see the problem as long as it's well integrated, for example I didn't like the Monster product placement in Death Stranding, I found it silly and forced, but for Porsche in the trailer I find it just perfect, same for the Sony sound console or the pair of Adidas.

If it can help the studio lighten its budget and offer us well-known brands in our video games, it's just a win-win for me.
