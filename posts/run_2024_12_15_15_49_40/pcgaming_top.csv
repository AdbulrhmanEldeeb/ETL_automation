pcgaming,"PC gaming in 2024: Revenue numbers closing in on matching Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo combined ","https://www.statista.com/statistics/278181/global-gaming-market-revenue-device/

PC gaming revenue in 2024 is 43.2 billion compared to combined console revenue of 51.9, only about a 20 percent difference.

 https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/2023-pc-games-revenue-increase-newzoo/

PC gaming is also growing much faster than console gaming. Consoles are almost stagnant in revenue while PC grows. 

In 5-10 years, it's easy to see how PC will be bigger than all the consoles combined.

pcgaming,Car / Driving Game,"Greetings strangers!

Wondering whether such a car driving game exists on the market (pc platform only):

- featuring a large open world instead of track to track / map to map

- just driving a car around chilling and relaxing; exploring and enjoying beautiful sceneries; no competition with other players; not doing illegal street racing / breaking traffic laws as gangsters or mafia and having cops on your heels 

- a roster of just normal day to day cars as opposed to super cars / sports cars / performance cars / racing cars / muscle cars / luxury cars is a plus but not a deal breaker

- preferably the map is wilderness / nature oriented that features landscapes such as rivers, oceans (roads beside sea), forests, jungles, mountains, hills, driving through tunnels in caves; by this i do not mean off-road using four wheel drives but still driving past scenery on the actual road 

- seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), day / night cycle, weather (raining, sunny, cloudy and windy, snowy, misty, foggy) will be appreciated ",Fiora_Atoria_Asamiya,1hes4pz,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hes4pz/car_driving_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hes4pz/car_driving_game/,2024-12-15 13:01:56,0,0.49,0,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hes4pz
