books,Reading culture pre-1980s,"I am on the younger side, and I have noticed how most literature conversations are based on ""classic novels"" or books that became famous after the 1980s. 

My question for the older readers, what was reading culture like before the days of Tom Clancy, Stephen King, and Harry Potter? 

From the people I've asked about this irl. The big difference is the lack of YA genre. Sci-fi and fantasy where for a niche audience that was somewhat looked down upon. Larger focus on singular books rather than book series. 

Also alot more people read treasure Island back in the day compared to now. I'm wondering what books where ubiquitous in the 40s- 70s that have become largely forgotten today?

books,Niger Wife Review ,"I wonder if anyone else has read the Niger Wife (i think it was renamed the Lagos Wife) ?

I thought it was good, in terms of walking the reader through the scenario of what it must feel like to marry someone from Nigeria and confront the many cultural differences, but of course it's dealing with a wealthy Nigerian husband there so it doesn't reflect everyday life for most people. Of course the British wife goes missing (sarcastic tone here) which plays in the fears of anyone or their loved ones who would go to Africa.

books,The Grapes of Wrath,"I just finished *The Grapes of Wrath* by John Steinbeck. It was my first time reading the novel, though I’ve read some of his other work like *Of Mice and Men* in high school and *Cannery Row* just last year. He’s probably my favorite American author (so far). 

I found myself a little disappointed by all the loose ends. Where did Noah go? Why did he think his family didn’t love him? What will Rose of Sharon do after being abandoned by her husband? Did they do divorce in absentia back then? Of course, those questions are small potatoes in the face of starvation and death, but my satiated type A brain hones in on that sort of stuff. And the more I think about it, the luckier I feel.

I’m also kind of sad that we started the story with Tom Joad but he was gone by the end.

Rose of Sharon’s pregnancy was interesting. In the beginning, it was her great hope, and it strengthened her union with Connie. I’m guessing as she got further along he realized there was almost no work, and no way to perform the kind of labor necessary to their survival while also fulfilling their dreams of an ideal life. Shit got real. Even before they left for California, it was stated that ROS was no longer the “hoyden” he married but more settled. I took that to mean their connection was a little dubious from then on. 

Long story short: ROS spends a lot of time being tired and worrying about the health of the baby, but the baby is stillborn despite their best efforts. Uncle John sending off the corpse was interesting, given the wife and unborn child he lost so long ago. Maybe it was symbolic for him, letting go of the unknown and unfulfilled potential of the past and looking toward a better future. ROS ends the story by breastfeeding the man in the barn and smiling. That reminded me of the story of Roman Charity, or Cimon and Pero, though the two characters in this case don’t know each other. No idea how to interpret it, but it does seem fitting somehow.",BrieflyBlue,1h32tt7,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h32tt7/the_grapes_of_wrath/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h32tt7/the_grapes_of_wrath/,2024-11-30 02:51:29,51,0.83,51,0,53,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h32tt7
books,Do you think understanding is necessary for enjoyment of literature?,"I have tried reading Ulysses but just can't get through it. Here's a paragraph from the second chapter.

&gt;It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Sainte Geneviève where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.

Some chapters get easier but then we're back to more literary experimentations and Joyce basically showing off his amazing knowledge of things.

I was having trouble and someone who said he was reading through the classics in his free time said just read through it. And that he had read Ulysses in just a week, which I found astonishing. Did  he read it carefully, I wondered? He said he didn't get a lot of stuff but it doesn't matter, he still enjoyed it.

Anyhow, I said I I can't read what I don't understand. like I first need to learn more about philosophy, history, religion, Ireland, etc. Or at least need to have a few books and webpages open to look up each reference Joyce makes (and he makes plenty). And that is assuming I can understand his stream-of-consciousness style which I often can't. So it will definitely take me way longer than a week or two.

Some other people also report difficulties with Joyce but also passages or books from other writers, like Faulkner, Woolf, Pynchon, and so on. Yet there are many people who would tell you they enjoyed the work and had no issues. Yet, when you ask them more questions, you realize they did not necessarily understand what they read.

So where do you stand? Do you think one should take the same approach to literature as we often do to poetry, to accept there will always remain some mystery and we will never know certain things for sure? And that perhaps we don't even need to know them. Or do you think that unless one really understands a book they are reading, they are not putting in the effort the type of book demands and perhaps they can't claim to have really read the book?

books,Ender's Game Empathy?,"I teach Language and Literature to middle school students and we have an upcoming unit around the book *Ender's Game*. I last read it when I was about their age and really enjoyed it, but going through it again with a more analytical perspective there are some things I'm left really wondering about. The main thing is the idea of empathy being Ender's key to defeating his opponents. We're told this several times throughout the book, and we definitely see some scenes of him being highly empathetic, but I don't really see it come into play in terms of him being able to defeat his enemies.

&gt;!In the fights he has with Stilson and Bonzo he's able to goad them into fighting one on one, and a case could be made that he needs a degree of empathy in order to be able to successfully do that, but the entire rest of the time he's at the Battle School does he use empathy at all to win his battles? It seems to me that he just outthinks everyone else and comes up with better strategies while they all run the same basic patterns.!&lt;

&gt;!And of course, the biggest, most important battles are the ones against the Buggers. He's explicitly told by Mazer and Graff after defeating them that they needed someone who could empathize with them in order to understand and defeat them, but where does that actually happen? He knows next to nothing about them other than what Graff and Mazer tell him about their communication and the way they act as units of a whole rather than individuals. In fact, Ender doesn't even realize that he's actually fighting them at any point. He believes he's playing a computer simulation directed by Mazer, so if he's actually empathizing with an opponent in order to defeat them, wouldn't he be trying to do so with Mazer?!&lt;

&gt;!Am I missing something with this book? I think it's a good example of sci-fi for middle school students, which is what we're using it to teach, but I'm really not seeing empathy being central to Ender's success so much as just his intelligence.!&lt;",Heck_Tate,1h3381y,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3381y/enders_game_empathy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3381y/enders_game_empathy/,2024-11-30 03:13:30,46,0.81,46,0,55,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3381y
books,"Swimming in the Dark by Tomasz Jedrowski broke me apart, this is such a brilliant book.","Oh lord, it's been minutes since I have finished this book, and perhaps I should've waited some time before giving a review, but oh well, the thoughts and the torment I am facing at this exact moment will be forever lost to time. I loved this book, it's an understatement, ofcourse. This book tore through my heart and ripped my soul apart, is this also an understatement? Probably. Swimming in the Dark is a tale of daring homosexual first love in the complicated and conservative times of the 1980s, I am speechless, I don't know what to say or even how to say for a matter of fact.    
  
The first half of this book felt so real, so painful and so joyous, this book portrays the torment of gay love and relationships in such profound and intense depths; societal pressures and the corrupted bigoted world that we currently live in, suppressing our true self for the sake of survival, not being able to display our love and our true identity. The torment and the pain that run through ourselves, the agony and utter melancholy of being a homosexual in this world of prejudice. As a gay male, having faced similar experiences, this made my insides coil up and burst into flames. This is perhaps the most realest book I've read, to me atleast.

This book meticulously dwells into the joy of having a place to be yourself, to have a place where you no longer have to wear that mask and finally display your raw and true identity, a place where you could be yourself, moments where you are true to yourself, be true and real to your lover. I don't know man, even writing this review, my heart is beating like a cheetah, I dont know. We follow the life of Ludwik our narrator and his experience after he met Janusz, the love of his life in the military camp after graduation. Their begins the quest of them finding each other, falling in each others embraces and finding true love. The societal homophobic and bigoted views at that time is masterfully portrayed, how you have to always act, how you can never be yourself and always put the mask on that the society thinks is ""normal"", how homosexuality is perceived as abnormality in those times and how it was severely looked down upon. You can't even show feminine attitude, you have to be a rigid masculine figure like all others, always concealing the true self behind.

What I even could relate and adored was the portrayal of self hatred and resentment of oneself, the shame that eats you up for being gay, for not being ""normal"" according to others, the pain, the torment and the underlying fear of what will happen if others know? How should you act if others know? The never ending uncertainty and fear that always will linger within your mind, not leaving at all. Janusz and Ludwik, the book masterfully builds up their relationship and the intimacy that bloomed between them as it pushed on, showing that what true love is and how daring and fierceful it is. The prose is excellent, wow, simple words and simple sentences but arranged and crafted so beautifully and realistically that made me love the book even more, I was almost at the verge of tears because how beautiful and heart-shattering the language was, how moments displayed were so vivid and so full of life.

But they couldn't be together, not in this lifetime, their different views on politics and their own country separated the courses of their lives, dashed and divided into a million stars long gone in the midnight. Context I guess, please consider me as I am not really that knowledgeable regarding the post WW2 Cold War (The Soviet Period) and the impact faced by Poland in that time. To get free from the totalitarian authority and gain freedom was Ludwiks lurking goal, he never protested, but he always wanted a true and free Poland, he wanted to leave the country with Janusz to find a place where they could be together and be their own, but life isn't a checklist or black and white. Janusz was along the side of The Party from the beginning and, for him you must remain true to The Party to get a stable job and secure a stable life, but he knew, he wasn't blind, he knew about the prejudice and the torment that this authority laid over Polish people and its utter cruelty, but you have to be true to The Party to lead a stable life. His mentality circled around the concept of not leaving the country, because what can you do and will you have when you leave the country? This was the thread that started their separation, while we might not be able to understand it first, but this created the domino effect.

To conceal yourself and wearing a mask, being so true to the mask takes upon your identity and hides your true self underneath, you completely being oblivious to what it does to the one you love, Janusz completely being oblivious to what it did to Ludwik, I still believe Janusz loved no one other than Ludwik, but to play the act, he reached depths from which Ludwik would never pull him up. Having sex and being intimate with Hania, even if all this is foolery, how can you be true to your lover then? Janusz? He couldn't be true to him, he never could, a mask that eats away your life and the thing that matters the most to you. This is heartbreaking, my heart is still racing by the way, this book left me in a desolate state of despair and pain from the moment I turned over the last page, wow, just wow. This is what I consider a masterpiece, peeled layers and layers of my soul and made me feel all emotions ranging from joy and happiness to sorrow and dread, they could never be together, in this cursed life, couldn't even get the chance of saying proper goodbyes, regrets and shame, and to live an identity of not one's own. Their last moments together were heartbreaking, smoking cigarettes and staring into the dark, Oh God, I might cry. To even think of that part, the part where Ludwik reaches to Janusz to tell him he'll be leaving, leaving everything behind, leaving them and their love behind, leaving them, their moments and their life behind, fuck, I will cry. Gosh, this is so painful.

Friendship, and being together for your friends, a section which was also beautifully displayed in this book, supporting and being there for your own people, people who mean alot to you, reminded me of my own true friends and their significance in my life. Helplessness and depravity, living falsely to yourself are strong themes that lurked throughout the book and left it's impact with every passing page

I felt the narrators (Ludwik's) pain and suffereing in my own veins and felt his joys and moments of happiness in my own soul, this is such a brilliant book that displays alot about the world we live in and the melancholic fates of Homosexual back in those time periods. I loved it and this book will forever remain within myself.  I will quote alot of paragraphs and texts now, so please bear with me haha. This is a literary masterpiece, I don't know if I will ever heal from this. Strong feelings similar Lie With Me by Phillipe Besson (Another literary masterpiece, highly recommended). Giovanni's Room is referenced multiple times in significant depths throughout this book and I must read it now, while it was already high in my reading list of books, it just got much more significant. I shall reread this after finishing Giovanni's Room to connect more with the segments where it was mentioned, HOLY HELL. Gosh, I'm sorry for tweaking so much. No matter what I say, and how much I say, I can't put to words how much this book means to me and how much it truly affected me. Absolutely wounded me to the core, I doubt whether I can ever recover. I am genuinely blessed to have the chance of reading it, I rarely say this but I mean it.

  


***""This is how I lived back then—through books. I locked myself into their stories, dreamt of their characters at night, pretended to be them. They were my armor against the hard edges of reality. I carried them with me wherever I went, like a talisman in my pocket, thinking of them as almost more real than the people around me, who spoke and lived in denial, destined, I thought, to never do anything worth recounting.""***

***""My body moved in your direction, and you looked at me, suddenly calmed too. With your arms outstretched to the sides, you were like a ballet dancer hovering in flight. Under the surface of the water something warm rattled in my belly. I approached, until I could see the drops of water on your forehead and on the tip of your nose and in the corners of your mouth. We didn’t say a thing. We looked at each other, already beyond words. You were there, and I was there, close, breathing. And I moved into your circle. All the way to your waiting body and your calm, open face and the drops on your lips. Your arms closed around me. Hard. And then we were one single body floating in the lake, weightless, never touching the ground.""***

(This is so beautiful oh my god)

***""I felt your chest underneath your shirt, retraced the swing of your collarbones, the hardness of your shoulders. You tasted the same, warm and earthy. I pulled off your clothes in the dim light. Your tan was still visible, and around us the house was alive—feet shuffled below, water pipes gurgled, taps were turned on and off, accompanying our struggles. Later, when night had fallen and we had exhausted ourselves, we lay facing each other, the tip of your nose on the bridge of mine. Nothing else mattered in the dark.""***

***""I sat in the hallway and tried not to cry. I wanted to cease existing. I wanted to un-be. I sat in the hallway and tried not to think of you and me. I tried not to think of us, under the covers of your bed. I tried not to think of your arms or your hands or your eyes. I tried not to think of all the things I had imagined we’d do together—return to our lake next summer, move in together someday. I tried not to think of Hania, and your fingers on her sequined dress. I tried not to think of Maksio or his eyes when he saw us in the forest. I tried not to think of Granny or Professor Mielewicz.""***

(This quote nearly made me cry)

***""We searched for words, each one of us, trying to say something that meant anything. In the end, we just said goodbye. We said it casually, like we would see each other again soon or maybe like people who had never been much more than acquaintances. You two walked off, arm in arm, and I watched you, the burning cigarette still in my hand, the last thing you’d ever given me.""***

(There last moments together, fuck me Ill cry)

***""Not one example of a happy couple made up of boys. How were we supposed to know what to do? Did we even believe that we deserved to get away with happiness?""***

***""I’ve held on to the idea of us, scanning faces for a scrap of something known, searching for the familiar in the alien. When really, the familiar had already turned alien, and home had ceased being home. Both have gone on living and changing without me.""***

books,Napoleon Bonaparte's 'On Suicide': A Teenager's Emo Moment with a Side of Anti-French Sentiment,"I recently read Napoleon's essay 'On Suicide,' written when he was 17. In this essay, Napoleon contemplates death and expresses deep despair, feeling isolated and unable to find meaning in life. He reflects on his alienation from his homeland and his growing frustration with the world around him. He even goes as far as to contemplate suicide as an escape from his misery. At this time, young Napoleon harbored strong anti-French sentiments, influenced by his identity as a Corsican and his resentment towards the French government, which he viewed as an oppressor. This anti-French outlook, combined with his personal anguish, shaped much of his early writings.

But, honestly, I don't think Bonaparte was seriously contemplating suicide. It’s more likely that he was dealing with sexual repression. Shortly after writing this essay, he met his first love, and—surprise—his mood seemed to lift. The depression and suicidal thoughts vanished. (probably because the sexual repression was resolved. Sorry just for a joke.)

At the time, Bonaparte often used exaggerated expressions of anger and frustration. For example, in 'The New Corsica,' he describes Corsicans slaughtering the French in a bloodbath, and in 'On Suicide,' he writes of his deep sorrow and desire to end it all. But we shouldn’t take these youthful outbursts literally. Just because he once wrote about killing the French doesn’t mean he spent his whole life plotting their demise. Later, his sense of identity shifted from being a Corsican to a 'French Corsican,' and instead of focusing on the French, he turned his attention to Austria and England.

I have carefully read the original French version and also created a Chinese translation. However, since English is more commonly used in Reddit communities, I will share the English version here:

# On Suicide - Napoleon Bonaparte

*Valence, May 3rd 1786*

Always alone in the midst of men, I return home to dream alone and abandon myself to all the intensity of my melancholy. Where did it lead today? Towards death.

At the dawn of my days I can still hope to live long. I have been absent from my fatherland for six or seven years. Which pleasures will I not feel in four months to see my compatriots and my parents! From the tender sensations which awaken the sweet memories of childhood, could I not conclude that my happiness will be complete?

What fury then leads me to want my destruction? No doubt, what to do in this world? If I must die, is it not better to kill myself? If I had already passed sixty years, I would respect the prejudice of my contemporaries and patiently wait for nature to achieve its course; but since I begin to feel misfortune, that nothing pleases me, why should I endure days in which nothing succeeds?

How far men are from nature! How cowardly, vile, and crawling they are! What spectacle will I see in my country? My compatriots heavy with chains, and who trembling kiss the hand which oppresses them! They are no longer these brave Corsicans which a hero animated of his virtues, enemy of tyrants, of the luxury of vile courtisans. Proud, full of the noble sentiment of his own importance, a Corsican lived happily if he had spent the day tending to public affairs. The night spent in the tender arms of a dear wife?

Reason and his enthusiasm erased all the troubles of the day. Tenderness, nature, rendered his nights comparable to that of the Gods. But, with freedom, those happy days vanished like dreams! Frenchmen, not content with having taken from us everything we cherished, you have also corrupted our mores.

The current condition of my fatherland and my powerlessness to change it, are thus yet another reason to flee a land where I am obligated by duty to praise men whom I ought by virtue to hate. When I will arrive in my fatherland, how must I act, which language should I hold?

When the fatherland is no more, a good patriot should die. If I had only one man to destroy to deliver my compatriots, I would leave this instant and plunge in the breast of the tyrants the vengeful sword of the fatherland and of violated laws.

Life is a burden to me because I taste no pleasure and everything is sorrow. It is a burden because the men with whom I live and will probably always live with have mores as far from mine as moonlight differs from that of the sun. I can therefore not follow the only manner of living which could make me endure life, from which follows disgust for everything.",Illustrious-Most6097,1h36f2r,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h36f2r/napoleon_bonapartes_on_suicide_a_teenagers_emo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h36f2r/napoleon_bonapartes_on_suicide_a_teenagers_emo/,2024-11-30 06:22:21,39,0.75,39,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h36f2r

books,"Can someone explain ""The Silence"" by Don DeLillo to me?","I just DNF'd it at about 70% (which is saying something because the audiobook is only two hours long) because I could not make heads or tails of *anything* that was happening.  I've also never read a Don DeLillo novel, and I'm gathering that this was not the place to start.

Am I not smart enough for this book, or is it just pretentious nonsense??

&gt;!I don't understand the logistic timeline - how does one survive a plane crash, receive treatment at a temporary trauma shelter with no power, have to walk everywhere, and STILL get to a Superbowl party?!&lt;

&gt;!I don't understand the woman at the trauma shelter freaking out about \*specifically\* losing facial recognition abilities. - This was set in 2020, in 2024 I don't use facial recognition technology beyond opening my phone, and as a glasses wearer, that's dicey at best. Ma'am, I don't think that's your biggest loss.  !&lt;

&gt;!I don't understand the physics teacher who seems to barely grasp the concept of ""football"" AT A SUPERBOWL PARTY and constantly talks about the Theory of Relativity. ( The audiobook did him a disservice in that his voice was so monotone and quiet compared to the others that it was difficult to hear what he was saying and he sounded ... inhunman? Like I wondered if there was something wrong with him. Or maybe he was an ai robot and malfunctioning after *the event*.!&lt;

I don't think I've ever been so genuinely bewildered by what happened in a book that I just stopped reading/listening. 

Does it come together in any meaningful way at the end? If it's just &gt;!""Without technology, humans can't communicate cognitively""!&lt; that's pretty annoying.

books,Playground - Richard Powers gets any better?,"I was devouring the first hundred pages, even thinking that it would be my best read of 2024. But now as i’m continuing toward 2/3 of the book, i start to get lost and am not really sure if it has a point. 

I love the ocean so reading the part about diving, and the cameo of Dr. Sylvia Earle is wonderful. And the Go-game is definitely a nod to AlphaGo and Demis Hassabis. But would be a pity if it continues to drag on pointless like this. Does it get any better?",miiomii,1h3aw67,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3aw67/playground_richard_powers_gets_any_better/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3aw67/playground_richard_powers_gets_any_better/,2024-11-30 11:44:03,3,0.63,3,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3aw67
