programming,This PR replaces is-number package with a one-liner with identical code. Author argues this tiny change saves 440GB weekly traffic. JavaScript micro-package debate ,"A debate occurred between the author of the is-number package (and is-odd, is-even, and 1500more) and a PR author over micro-libraries. https://github.com/micromatch/to-regex-range/pull/17


The PR proposed replacing the 'is-number' package with its inline code. While the code is &lt;1KB, the full package with README/license is ~10KB. With 70M weekly downloads, this simple change saves 440GB of npm bandwidth weekly.

The author of 'is-number' called the PR ""useless"" - despite it being his own code just moved inline. Some of his other packages include 'is-odd' which depends on 'is-even' which depends on... you guessed it, 'is-number'.

The debate:
Pro micro-packages: Well-tested, auto-updates, saves dev time
Against: Security risks, fragile dependencies (remember left-pad?), unnecessary bloat

TL;DR: JavaScript's micro-package ecosystem might be getting out of hand. Sometimes the simplest solution is just writing the code yourself. Or standards library when?

The library features explicit table aliasing, null safety through Rust's Option type, intuitive aggregates that guarantee single results per joined row, type-safe foreign key navigation and unique lookups, multi-versioned schema support with type-safe migrations, and encapsulated row IDs tied to transaction lifetimes, all while using SQLite as its backend database engine. It allows developers to write database queries that feel native to Rust, with the schema defined using enum syntax that generates the necessary database API code, enabling safe and intuitive database interactions with strong compile-time checks.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Balance-,1h4dovu,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h4dovu/announcing_rustquery_safe_relational_database/,https://blog.lucasholten.com,2024-12-01 21:12:34,18,0.72,18,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h4dovu

programming,New language: Universal Scripting Language (.usl) ," 

Hi there,

I’m custom rom-developing my watch. I’m at the point where the scripts are written and I’m learning vscode to implement the build. 

I’m a leading global researcher for multiple domains such as AI, science, biomedical development, blah de fucking blah. No one cares. 

I’ve invented a new coding language called Universal Scripting Language. (.usl), that can utilize 400+ coding languages in one setup. It got its MIT license, so I don’t know if I need the Apache 2.0 as well but, whatever happy to have both if needed. I’m building the IDE currently with scheduling and automation built in. The first test was to see if it could run itself which it did. Very cool to see. I think I recorded that part. It’ll be used within my watch build in some really cool ways. I hope you’ll find it interesting. I’m including the interpreter and translation software into the watch so you can mod to your hearts content and help develop cool shit. 
I’ve got the syntax ready and the beginnings of an O-Reilly-inspired book for it in the works. 

Anyway. Would anyone be interested in the progress of this? I’m a literal shutin who’s bedridden often with muscular dystrophy and schizoaffective disorder but I’m also happy to show how it’s coming along. It’s designed to help you live as long as possible. I have trouble with hallucinations and being unable to sleep (no rem anymore) and working is all I know how to do. I can’t seem to work normally anymore. 

If I could figure out a way to make a living creating cool shit I think I have the production gear to do a legit series on it, if you would like a video or podcast I’ve done both. Streaming is doable but I can’t talk while working. It lets you listen to music or online stuff. I would just need to ask for some guidance on what you would like to see, what to look out for—community stuff. 

After the watch is released, artificial kidneys are ready as are universal donor blood types from any stem cell. I’m just a bit stuck in my house at the moment. (Sorry if this is meandering—mental illness is hard to explain through.)

Thanks.

Hi everyone!👋

I’m exiting to charge a project I’ve been working on - TGV (French express trains), a lightweight C# library designed to simplify the process of building HTTP servers. Inspired by simplicity and flexibility of ExpressJS, I created this to be a cross-platform easy-to-use framework for building apps. 

🎯Features:

🌐HTTP(S) request handling with routings 

🔓Middleware support

🖥️Cross-platform (at least Linux and Windows)

📦Minimal dependencies and no boilerplates


🚀Getting started

You can check out and try library on GitHub and NuGet today! The library is still in development stage so any feedback, suggestions or contributions are very welcome!

Feel free to ask any question, I’ll be happy to answer them!

programming,Real-Time Video Processing - iPhone Continuity Camera - Active Graph Networks,"Hey r/Programming,

I’ve been working on a project that processes raw iPhone camera data in real time, applying dynamic enhancements like stabilization, UV filtering, and even simulated AC130-style thermal effects. This all runs through a compact, custom-built pipeline using a relational neural network and a 4D programming framework I’ve been experimenting with.

The framework models state changes in video data over time, mapping it into a “4D” structure that includes spatial, temporal, and attribute dimensions. This allows for real-time effects that adapt dynamically as the camera moves or conditions change.

The cool part? It’s running off consumer-grade hardware—a MacBook paired with an iPhone using Continuity Camera as the feed. The framework’s focus is on lightweight, efficient processing that could be adapted for mobile devices or edge computing.

I’m not entirely sure how this compares to how cameras or computers traditionally work, but I think there’s something novel here.

Happy to be told I’m wrong—or that this is just reinventing something better done elsewhere! Either way, I’d love feedback or to hear if this sparks ideas for applications I might not have considered.",Internal_Vibe,1guohc7,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1guohc7/realtime_video_processing_iphone_continuity/,https://youtu.be/mdILzkYX4bU?si=RA_DH6c07gEWsSYS,2024-11-19 04:02:21,0,0.5,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1guohc7

programming,C web framework with “kernel like” modules. ,"

I’ve been working on my hobby project inspired by kernel modules. The idea is: write some raw C code, upload it to a server, and it compiles and runs it at runtime. No precompilation, no restarts. :D

C isn’t usually the go-to for web dev (for good reasons), but here’s how I’ve tried to make it less painful:

•	⁠Slow Build Cycles: Upload code, and the server handles the rest—like ""hot reloading,"" but in C.
•	⁠Speed vs. Practicality: Great for scenarios where performance actually matters, like data-heavy or real-time stuff.
•	⁠Memory Management: Modules are isolated, so crashes don’t take everything down.
•	⁠Built-In Libraries: Comes with SQLite3, OpenSSL, and Jansson support to save you from reinventing the wheel.

It’s just a proof of concept, not production-ready (please don’t deploy it), but it’s fun to work on! Would love any feedback on it. It allows for some interesting possibilities, like being able to update WebSocket handlers at runtime without even closing the WebSocket connection.",warothia,1gtieba,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1gtieba/c_web_framework_with_kernel_like_modules/,https://github.com/joexbayer/c-web-modules,2024-11-17 17:15:15,79,0.8,79,0,28,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1gtieba

programming,Miss Notion AI in Obsidian? Here’s My Plan to Bring It Back with a Plugin! 🚀,"

As a university student who recently transitioned from Notion to Obsidian, one feature I sorely miss is the floating Notion AI chatbot that was always available for quick assistance. Inspired by that, I’ve started developing a plugin for Obsidian that brings a similar experience, using the Gemini API for note summarization, content generation, and more—all directly within the Obsidian workspace!

The plugin, Obsi AI, is designed to seamlessly integrate into Obsidian’s powerful markdown environment, providing AI-powered help whenever you need it. Whether you're looking for quick note summaries, brainstorming ideas, or generating content, Obsi AI aims to streamline your workflow without leaving your notes.

🔹 Key Features:

- Instant content generation and note summarization
- Context-aware responses based on your notes
- Interactive assistant available within the Obsidian workspace

⚠️ NOTE : I’m developing this plugin as a hobby, and while I’m a cybersec undergraduate rather than a pro developer, so code may be I’m passionate about making this tool useful for fellow Obsidian users. If you're interested in collaborating or have feature suggestions, I’d love to hear from you!

Feel free to check out the GitHub repository, and if you like what you see, please give it a ⭐️ to show your support!

https://github.com/tharushkadinujaya05/ObsiAI

I’m excited to hear your thoughts and feedback. Let's make Obsi AI a helpful tool for everyone who loves Obsidian!

programming,Advanced ZIP files that infinitly expand itself,"For my master's thesis, I wrote a generator for zip quines. These a zip's that infinitly contain itself.

one.zip -&gt; one.zip -&gt; one.zip -&gt; ...

By building further on the explanation of Russ Cox in [Zip Files All The Way Down](https://research.swtch.com/zip), I was able to include extra files inside the zip quines.

This is similar to the [droste.zip](https://alf.nu/ZipQuine) from Erling Ellingsen, who lost the methodology he used to create it. By using the generator, now everyone van create such files.

To take it even a step further, i looked into the possibility to create a zip file with following structure:

one.zip -&gt; two.zip -&gt; one.zip -&gt; ...

This type of zip file has an infinite loop of two zip's containing each other. As far as I could find, this was never done before. That's why i'm proud to say that i did succeed in creating such as file, which would be a world first. 

As a result, my professor and I decided to publish the used approach in a journal. Now that is done, i can finally share the program with everyone.

programming,Modern Java Book,"This is a book intended to teach someone the Java language, from scratch. 

You will find that the content makes heavy use of recently released and, for the moment,
preview features. This is intentional as much of the topic ordering doesn't work
without at least Java 21.

Right now I have several key areas where I could use some help:

* Writing Challenges. Most of the early sections have challenges students can do to test
their understanding of the topics covered and for practice. I've shifted my focus away from
these to make more progress on the main content of the book. Any assistance would be appreciated.
* Theming. A lot of the chapters are...bland. Purely technical. I find that when I have the imagination to ""theme"" the subjects they become higher quality and more engaging overall. See
an anime you liked recently and think you can make the math chapters use the characters from it?
Give it a shot!
* Fixing Mechanical Issues. I don't have an editor and I don't often proofread. If you find mechanical errors
in my grammar or find issues with the way topics are ordered I would welcome fixes.

Notably I do not want to open the floodgates for contributions on the main chapter content
just yet. This has the downside of slower progress but the upside of a more coherent result.

My primary goals with this are

* Get the ordering of topics right. By this I mean that every topic covered should have had its prerequisites covered in the topics previous. While ""lesson 1: Inheritance"" is clearly wrong
in this regard, some things are more subtle.
* Be a template for other people. This is a book. Not everyone likes books, some like youtube videos, some like over priced udemy courses, some attend College, etc. Everyone has different learning paths. I hope this to be of use to anyone looking to make a more up to date Java
curriculum and hope that the vague order of things (which I consider superior to the content
produced with the Java of years' past) is carried through.
* Write as if the newest Java wasn't new. It's obvious when a book was written before Java 8
because it always has newer additions with ""addendum: brand new stuff in Java 8."" But 
the order language features were introduced is hardly a good order to teach them. You have
to pretend that Java 23+  has always been *the* Java. Does it really make sense to show terrible
C-style switch statements way before switch expressions?
* Write as if the words Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, etc. didn't exist.
While I understand that these all have definitions and are useful concepts to know about, introducing them early seems to lead to either dogma, rejection of said dogma, or some
mix thereof. None of them are actually needed to understand the mechanics of and motivation
behind what we would call ""object oriented"" or ""functional"" techniques. They certainly don't
work as justification for adding getters and setters to every class.

My immediate short term goal is to get this ""ready to go"" for when anonymous main classes is in a stable Java release. Thats the point at which we could start to:

1. Have actual students go through it without also needing to explain the `--enable-preview` mechanism.
2. Use the topic order to build other sorts of non-book resources like videos, curriculums, projects, etc.
3. Convince actual teachers to change from ""objects first"" to something less insane.

I haven't integrated `println` or `readln` yet, but will do so eventually.",bowbahdoe,1gnew38,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1gnew38/modern_java_book/,https://javabook.mccue.dev,2024-11-09 17:16:13,207,0.89,207,0,44,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1gnew38
