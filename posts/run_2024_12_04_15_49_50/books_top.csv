books,How to approach TBR list and buying books,"I admit I'm very impulsive when it comes to books- when I see interesting series I buy everything or at least add it to my neverending TBR list.

The result is two bookcases of books and countless titles shipped to local hospital unopened because I felt overhelmed by the mess. I got complete paralysis when it comes to deciding what to read so often I just give up. I borrow piles of books that I have to return to library because I can't extend it endlessly.   
  
In new year I want to be more deliberate and actually curate my reading to get something reminding a steady reading streak. 



Any tips? Tricks?

books,Literature of Lebanon: December 2024,"'ahlaan bik readers,

This is our monthly discussion of the literature of the world!  Every Wednesday, we'll post a new country or culture for you to recommend literature from, with the caveat that it must have been written by someone from that there (i.e. Shogun by James Clavell is a great book but wouldn't be included in Japanese literature). 

Today is [Eid il-Burbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_il-Burbara) and to celebrate we're discussing Lebanese literature!  Please use this thread to discuss your favorite Lebanese books and authors.

books,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time - Thoughts after reading,"Initially, I was enjoying the book a lot. I liked the way Christopher thought - it was, in some ways, like a fresh breath of air. There was a point when I thought the book would get 5 stars from me...

Then I learned that Christopher's mother cheated, and that's bad. (I know it's not so black-and-white, but even after finishing the book, I couldn't find the mother redeemable.) A few pages later we learn the mother is actually still alive and the father hid her letters. I might be able to see where he was coming from, but that's just plain wrong. And killing a dog because your neighbor loves the dog more than you? Unforgiveable.

Yet it was obvious that the dad loved Christopher, so it was very frustrating to see him just shut his father out. And when Christopher ran away from home...I lost my sympathy towards him. (It was especially frustrating when he needed to catch a tube but was too terrified and kept missing them.)

I guess we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards the narrator, but I couldn't. I did feel bad for the father though (which may be contrasting to how I called his actions 'unforgiveable', but it is what it is). It's just funny (and frustrating) that what I thought would be a 5-star read ended up being a 2-star read.

At the end of the day, I do not get the hype around the book. Maybe I'm looking for someone in the comments to tell me that I'm wrong and the book is great because of xyz. So, what did I get wrong/miss/misunderstand?",WaywardWarrior13,1h6d0ai,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h6d0ai/the_curious_incident_of_the_dog_in_the_nighttime/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h6d0ai/the_curious_incident_of_the_dog_in_the_nighttime/,2024-12-04 10:29:15,0,0.4,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h6d0ai
