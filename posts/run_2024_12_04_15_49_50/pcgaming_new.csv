pcgaming,Found this absolut gem today - don't miss out on this classical FF/DQ homage :-),"I'm a huge fan of classic turn-bases RPGs and happily payed/played the FF 2D Pixel R. games.

2 days ago I stumbled upon **8-Bit Adventures 2** (don't let the 2 in the title confuse you, you need no prior knowledge, the game provides you with everything) and I'm having a blast right now. I'd even go so far and say that I vastly prefer this game over most 2D FF games?! Combat is great, NES graphics and sounds are VERY charming and authentic, the writing is witty and the game comes with all of the more modern features that just save time (f.e. no random battles, enemies are visible on the map).

Have fun :-)",Get_Schwifty111,1h6j8uw,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6j8uw/found_this_absolut_gem_today_dont_miss_out_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6j8uw/found_this_absolut_gem_today_dont_miss_out_on/,2024-12-04 15:49:42,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6j8uw

pcgaming,"Announcing ""Do No Harm"" - A Lovecraftian ""Papers, Please""-like Medical Simulator","Earlier this year we decided to make a game that would be about a Spooky Doctor in a Spooky Town. I just got verified, so I wanted to share with gamers in here. If you like *Papers, Please* or *Strange Horticulture*, I think you'll like my game too!  
  
*Do No Harm* is a Lovecraftian medical simulator where you play as a 19th-century doctor using Galenic medicine (think Four Humours theory) to heal patients on an eerie island village.

* Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do\_No\_Harm/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming)
* YouTube: [https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE](https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE)

The gameplay revolves around patients coming to you with symptoms—some they’ll describe, while others you’ll notice visually or diagnose using tools. You’ll consult your Book of Medicine, which offers hints and narrows down potential treatments, but ultimately, you’ll need to experiment with different medicines to see what works. Sometimes, your patients get better; other times… they don’t make it.

All the while, a Lovecraftian story unfolds in the background, mixed with eerie events and subtle resource management elements.

**What makes** ***Do No Harm*** **unique?**

* **Doctor Simulator with Galenic Medicine**: Immerse yourself in medieval medical practices as you analyze symptoms and treat patients.
* **A Lovecraftian Twist**: Unravel a chilling narrative where reality blurs and cosmic horrors creep into your everyday life.
* **Moral Choices**: In this cultist ridden island village, you'll have to decide whom to trust, heal or maybe even kill. Each choice leads to a different ending.

If you’re intrigued, you can [Wishlist the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming) to support us and stay updated on its release.

pcgaming,"BOWLOUT: A wacky first-person bowling shooter by 2 indie devs | Releases on Steam January 7th, 2025","Hi PCGaming! Next year a friend and I will release our first ever game on Steam, and we would like to share it with as many people as possible!

* Release date trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9\_\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9__U)

As you'll see in the attached trailer video, in BOWLOUT you'll throw lots of bowling balls or use pins as weapons to proceed through a pin-infested bowling centre and eliminate the source of the attack. It's a relatively short game with a simple gameplay loop - perfect to blow off some steam without getting attached to a long story. There's also achievements, unlockable ball colors and controller support!

Hopefully you'll enjoy this trailer and share/wishlist the game - it helps us with the algorithm, increasing the chances of the fabled 'front page' slot! If you have any questions about the game or would like to create content/articles on it, I would gladly help! Comment here or message me directly.

pcgaming,"Star Wars Outlaws - Some really good bones, but I have to put it down for a while.","Weird crashing and broken saves, along with some strange tech hiccups.

Bought the game for $25 so I’m not upset, they just need to do a lot more patching.

Overall, I really like the game. 

As a Star Wars guy, the open world is pretty amazing, and REALY stunning to look at.

The faction system is great. The blaster combat is fine and the stealth kind of sucks.

I’m even starting to like the story; I think they’ve nailed the “Outlaw” aspect of the characters and numerous interactions and choices the game presents.

Looking forward to returning to it once everything gets patched up a bit more.

pcgaming,"Star Wars Jedi Survivor &amp; Fallen Order are still broken on PC, do not let the dark side tempt you with sales","In light of the all the sales now til the end of the year, here's a little reminder or notice if you're unfamiliar:

Jedi Survivor and Fallen Order infamously suffer from shader and traversal stutters. These occur on *every* PC, regardless of hardware or whether you're able to notice them. There are other bugs too, like white flashing when turning corners/the camera, flickering lights, and even basic things like menu settings not engaging. Is DLSS on or is your PC just that bad? Who knows! 

To get you caught up, here's Digital Foundry's analysis of the most recent [Jedi Survivor Patch 9 - Improved but still very poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw) by Alex Battaglia, preeminent expert on PC game performance and leader in the #StutterStruggle. 

So, while Patch 9 improved shader comp and shader stutter, **both Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor *still* to this day suffer from shader compilation and travel stutter.** **Everyone** on PC will encounter several types of stuttering, *regardless of how good the hardware.* There's also **[animation stutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw&amp;t=573)**, which affects camera movement and character animations. A triple threat stutterer!

I can also vouch that the issues occur on the current fastest CPU for gaming, the 9800x3D, which I use OC'd to 5.7Ghz and run with 48gb DDR5-8000 CL40 EXPO, Crosshair X870 Hero, and RTX 4090; all stability tested &gt;24hrs, latest drivers, no issues like this with any other games that aren't also known and common.

Oh, and [even the PS5 Pro version of Survivor is having issues right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8?si=wYfe9swwp0dpR98K). EA is aware and investigating, patch is assumed/confirmed to come soon, but it's just another example of their poor standards.

I don't think it's appropriate to continue rewarding EA's and Respawn's repeated lack of respect for paying customers by spending more money or playtime on these lackluster products. Just means they will continue to reward you with the same or lower standards next time. If as many of us as possible opt not to purchase them, even at a steep discount, they might find our collective lack of faith disturbing enough to fix these issues in the next game, if not the previous.",FractaLTacticS,1h4gog6,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,2024-12-01 23:22:05,1062,0.76,1062,0,406,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4gog6

pcgaming,"Introducing my chill, story-driven survival-crafting game, AETHUS.","Hey PC gamers!

I wanted to introduce my solo-dev project, a sci-fi survival-crafter/base-builder, [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming).

**[Check out the trailer here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwB0r5f6T80)**

**AETHUS is a story-driven survival game, meaning there's always a narrative-driven reason to go on your next expedition into the underground open world!** 

You'll mine and gather resources in a physics-driven world rendered with Lumen and Nanite in UE5, while building up your mining outpost on the surface with easy to use yet extremely powerful building and decoration tools.

I've spent a lot of time making these tools as simple to use as possible and the whole game is **packed with quality-of-life features** like building/crafting/cooking from storage automatically, the ability to disable collisions when building so you can position things JUST right, and much more.

I left my AAA job after 7 years in the industry back in 2023 to go indie on my own and make this game, with **no AAA bullshit** - no AI, no microtransactions or cosmetics, no predatory development, no releasing a half-done bug-filled product in Early Access, just good old-fashioned gamedev.

[I'd love to get your thoughts on the game, so there's a demo you can try out right now on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming)

A [Wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming) would be super appreciated if you like the look of the game, single every one helps a solo indie dev like me!

pcgaming,Anyone out there still like written video game reviews/articles?,"Just curious if anyone out there still enjoys reading video game articles/reviews? Like - oldschool style - longform text + screenshots.

I myself tend to just skim down to the review score (not that these really mean much these days in the world of sponsored reviews) - but once upon a time, I used to really enjoy a good, longform review.

I myself wrote them freelance for a while, for a local gaming site and the small amount of money I made from it coupled with review copies of various games was always pretty exciting.

But I've been thinking a lot lately - possibly because I'm getting on in age these days, if anyone actually reads the reviews / articles rather than just skim them? Reading for the enjoyment of reading.

pcgaming,Are classic games overrated?,"TLDR: are older games getting an advantage in rating because there were fewer games back then?

I’ve been thinking about this from time to time. There are good and solid games now for sure but a common consensus is that old games were made with more passion, with more focus on it being fun instead of selling well, with simpler but more fun design, thus resulting in being just, better. However a good analogy would be being seated at a table with almost everything you can think of, then you get to be more picky about which food tastes good. The same food that you hate right now may be the best tasting thing if you’re stuck in a desert for several days. It may not be that extreme but the point is, our perception can sometimes be influenced by the context and become deceiving/subjective.

From another angle, almost everything in game developing is considerably complex and requires years of experience to master (things like level designs, quests, gameplay, character progression, story, sound, what have you). How can it get worse over time? If you put me 20 years back I definitely wouldn’t predict that the games are going to become worse in the future right? It is true that with the inflated economy, increasing competition, developer/publisher separation, things can get complicated and out of control, still I would have thought things will become better in general.

I’m currently still in school so I wanted to wait to get a full on pc until after I graduated so I wouldn’t have to transport it as much. I’ve been getting a lot of emails from Best Buy about their Black Friday deals and they have some nice pcs for not too bad of a price so I just wanted to see if anyone had some input on whether I should just go for it now or maybe wait until next Black Friday when I’m graduated? It’s probably just a preference thing anyway but I’m just curious if anyone’s had some similar thought processes :) thanks!",haykay417,1h0wvmm,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h0wvmm/get_a_pc_now_or_later/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h0wvmm/get_a_pc_now_or_later/,2024-11-27 05:16:40,0,0.17,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h0wvmm
pcgaming,"Windows 11 - turn ""Automatic Colour Management"" off","!!!This only tip works if you have a screen that is able to display colours beyond the sRGB range - those are 10+ bit IPS/OLED panels.

Simply go to display -&gt; Color and you'll see it as the toggable setting. Switch it off and all colours will look a bit more vibrant.

You can test this by looking at an image of something bright and red - such as a fire hydrant. The image will be a bit more vivid with ACM off.

What ACM essentially does is, it analyses the display's native Color profile and tone-maps the image sent to the display in such a way as to ""emulate"" the sRBG colour space in an attempt to ""trick"" the display - that is by compressing the brightest and darkest colors, and by reducing Color vibrancy to fit the standard colour range for internet pages, etc. This would be great if the monitor itself weren't doing a double-conversion back into its native Color space unless it's specifically set to ""sRGB mode"" in its OSD menu - and as you'll quickly notice sRBG mode just looks bad. This double conversion results in dull colors, reduced contrast and crushed blacks. Turn it off and forget about it.",Kalatapie,1h0w2h0,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h0w2h0/windows_11_turn_automatic_colour_management_off/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h0w2h0/windows_11_turn_automatic_colour_management_off/,2024-11-27 04:30:06,0,0.37,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h0w2h0

pcgaming,BACKROOMS 0 - Announcement Trailer - A psychological horror walking simulator set in an abandoned office complex. No monsters. No jumpscares.,"Hello everyone,

I've been working on creating a **psychological horror game that focuses purely on atmosphere** \- a vast abandoned office complex with repeating yellow corridors, humming fluorescent lights, and your camcorder. This is my take on the Backrooms.

The Backrooms represents one of the internet's most fascinating horror concepts - **a vast maze of empty office rooms** that exists just outside our reality, where people can accidentally 'noclip' into and find themselves trapped. Something about these empty spaces gets under everyone's skin.

**No monsters, no jumpscares** \- just pure environmental horror where the very absence of threat becomes unsettling. The game creates tension through architecture, sound design, and the feeling of being lost in a vast abandoned building.

[Watch the Announcement Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpZZE41i4U)

pcgaming,Has gaming gotten less social?,"Has gaming gotten less social?

I remember playing games like Halo, COD and other online games. There would always be people in game chat and you’d talk crap, make friends etc.

These days when playing multiplayer games, lobbies are dead quiet. Add to the fact that with things like SBMM lobbies pretty much always disbanded after every match so there’s less opportunity for online games to be social.

Though when I started to notice this, it was around the time that I moved over to PC from console. So does anyone else think games have gotten less social? Or is it possibly the difference in platform? As in could it be that most people on PC are just using discord and don’t use the in game chat?

Now there are many dragon games like Day of Dragons, ARK and so on. But I think we need a massive open world game where we have a detailed campaign as long as a coop/multiplayer.  Ability to find dragon eggs around the map and then waiting for them to hatch and train the dragon and so on. Have the ability to ride the dragon and just fly around in a detailed and nice open world 🌍.  Now ik there is a game of thrones game but tbh I hate it and it’s not good.  Need a modern graphic game made 🔥🔥

Would be cool to even have game of thrones dragons in the game as well, even house of dragons as well.

pcgaming,"To the older crowd, how do you guys go about making friends in games now a days?","I come from the days of community servers on CS, TFC and TF2.

Some have died, some have grown apart, some dont play multiplayer games much, some quit playing all together. I miss those days though, made a lot of good friends over the years.

pcgaming,I'm very impressed with how good remote play has become,"When Resident Evil 7 came out, I bought a Steam Link with the plans to stream it to a TV and despite the PC being 10ft line-of-sight from router, and then the router 6ft wired to the Steam Link, it was a nonstarter and I shelved the Steam Link. It could not maintain any smoothness at all, and it was a crashfest.

I revisited remote play with the Deck and I was surprised how consistent it could be. Pulling out my Steam Link again, I set it up in the living room and honestly? Not as good as a couple feet from my PC monitor, but 12ft back on a couch looks great besides some loss of dynamic range. And this is with a good 40ft, a floor, and a concrete wall between Link and router.

I beat a few games this year this way and I had a great time. No noise from fans, no worry about thermals, I can even use a lower resolution because I'm not so close to the display that it would matter = better performance. Besides sometimes a connection being lost and needing to manually reconnect to the session, I've had zero issues.

pcgaming,"[Blackwell Update] Historical analysis of NVIDIA GPUs relative performance, core count and die sizes across product classes and generations","Hello there!

Some 9 months ago I posted here and in some other subs about some discoveries and overall analysis I did over NVIDIA GPUs and their performance and core count across their generations (from Maxwell 2.0 (9xx) up to Ada (4xxx)). You can check out the complete comprehensive original post [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1b0ln9d/historical_analysis_of_nvidia_gpus_relative/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). It gained a fair bit of traction back then.

&amp;#x200B;

With the new leaks and rumors (sources below, not unfounded), I just grabbed the rumored SM/CUDA core count for the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and 5070 cards and plotted them against the previous generations up until Maxwell 2.0.

If you haven't read the original post, here's what matters to understand this chart:

* The X-axis in the chart (named ""Generation Name"") plots all released, rumored to release (4090 Ti, back when Ada wasn't EOL) and the new leaked Blackwell (marked with two asterisks) GPU SKUs for each generation.
* The Y-axis in the chart plots each of these cards according to the maximum CUDA core amount possible for each generation. This maximum value is derived by the most powerful GPU die each generation. Quoting from the original post: in Pascal (GTX 10 series), the TITAN Xp is the fully enabled top die (GP102), with 3840 CUDA cores, so it is at 100% relative core count. In the other hand, the 1060 6GB (GP106) has 1280 CUDA cores, which is exactly 33.3% as many cores as the TITAN Xp, thus, it has 33% relative core count.

Effectively, this means that when buying a 1060GB you're getting 33% of the most powerful GPU compute technology available at the time for the gaming cards (considering how advanced the manufacturing, nodes and processes were available at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

The results speak for themselves. I'll leave you with the initial chart and I'll give some insight afterwards:

[(Can't post images directly in this subreddit, here's a link)](https://i.imgur.com/B4sqraS.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The results are... depressing? I've sourced the data from leaked, but not unfounded information from minimally reputable sources such as [VideoCardz](https://videocardz.com/newz/geforce-rtx-5090-5080-5070ti-and-5070-to-launch-in-q1-rtx-5070-expected-to-feature-6400-cores) and [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/?generation=GeForce+50&amp;sort=generation). Let's dive into some thoughts:

* For Ada, the fully unlocked AD102 die never released (I put a fake 4090 Ti in the charts in both posts to give some perspective), but yeah. The 4090 was cut down to \~89% of the full AD102, and the full leaks suggest that the 5090 might also be \~88.5% of the full GB202. Seems fair and leaves room for a TITAN BLACKWELL or 5090 Ti, which might or might not release. **I don't see competition from AMD so I find it difficult to believe in a 5090 Ti**. That die makes more money as an AI card.
* In my original post I highlighted the **MASSIVE** abyss between the 4090 core count and the 4080/4080S core count. Never did we get such a small fraction of the top die for so much money. The base 4080 had 52.8% of the cores of the full AD102 die, and the 4080S had 55.6%. For comparison, in Ampere (RTX 3xxx), the 3080 had 81% of the cores of the full die used in the 3090 Ti. In all honesty, that was an outlier, because the trend up until then (Maxwell 2.0, Pascal and Turing) all had their xx80 cards hovering at the 66.6% relative core count. Well... If you thought that the gap between 4080 and 4090 was massive, **then the rumored gap between 5080 and 5090 is EVEN LARGER. The 5080 is rumored to have 10752 cores, which is only 43.8% of the cores of the top die.** This puts the 5080 at the same ""cut down level"", or to say, it is as cut down as a 4070 Ti was when compared to its top die. **If we go back to Ampere, the 5080 is as cut down as a 3060 Ti was compared to the top Ampere die (!!!!!).**
* **The 5070 Ti has 36.5% of the cores of the top Blackwell die.** In past generations, getting roughly 33-36% of the top die was something that the 960 (33.3%), 1060 6GB (also 33.3%) and 3060 (also 33.3%) cards achieved. **This means that the 5070 Ti is almost as cut down as previous generations xx60 cards.**
* **The RTX 5070 is 26% of the full die**, putting it in the range of previous generations RTX 4060 Ti (which was already a big disappointment as per my original post, at 23.6% of its top die) and brace for it... **the 5070 seems to be almost as cut down as an RTX 3050 (23.8%).**

&amp;#x200B;

So, it seems despite the newer generations increasing the total amount of raw CUDA cores that are possible to manufacture and put on a chip, we're getting less and less of a fraction of these node/tech advancements.

Here's the chart with some guiding lines to try and show some trend. I've been liberal in placing xx80 Ti cards as replacement for xx90 cards in past generations because there never was a 990, 1090 or 2090 card, despite there being TITANs, they would be the modern equivalent of a xx90 Ti. In case there are base and SUPER versions of the same card, I tried putting the trendline in the middle between them.

&amp;#x200B;

Unless Blackwell proves to be a revolutionary architecture generation (difficult, it is on the same node as Ada), then I can see really meh performance gains for the lower end. Pricing will dictate everything, and also, consumer feedback. We actually do have SOME power (remember the unreleased 4080 12GB?) in regards to product segmentation!

I'll update these charts with the Relative Performance database once these cards are out as TechPowerUp provides raw data.

Today, gaming has truly becoming a mainstream force with tons of marketing money, production money, and all the good and bad things that come with it.

* Elden Ring DLC in all its AAA glory, CP2077 too.
* I love roguelikes - Hades I and II are amazing.  I also play 2-3 clones which are amazing too.
* What the hell are all these Truck, farming, and life simulators?  I'm not into them, but wow!
* Path of Exile 2 etc etc..

This is our first ever released game so we are super excited (and nervous!) and greatly appreciate you checking it out.

pcgaming,Stop Destroying Games plans to eliminate digital planned obsolescence and bolster consumer rights,"There's a European Citizens' Initiative going around to stop publishers from intentionally bricking video games they have already sold to customers, a practice that may well violate EU consumer law. If passed by gaining 1 million EU signatures before July 31, it would address the legally untested practice of whether publishers can design games and digital content so that they can expire after an arbitrary length of time. This would also act as a bolster for digital consumer rights and ownership and stop online-only dependency spreading to other industries (extra citations)

Anyone of voting age in the EU and an EU country citizen can sign regardless of where they live. Sign directly here (and get friends, family, etc. to sign and spread too!): [https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home](https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home)

pcgaming,hogwarts legacy is actually REALLY good,"honestly, this is one of those games that i see in the store, think ""oh cool, looks like a nice game to play"", and then after playing it i start to realize ""HOLY SHIT, this is actually a REALLY REALLY good game, wow. holy fuck""

there's many reasons why it's such a good game in my opinion

first of all, if you like harry potter and wizardry/magic themed stuff, you will definitely like this game

you essentially get to create your own character and name them, this is your avatar that you play with throughout the game

then you find yourself enrolled as a student in hogwarts

yes, you are a wizard that is attending the school of hogwarts, to fine tune your skills in wizardry

part of the challenge of the game is that you SHOULD be a good student

if you want to be a reckless student that fucks off in the back of the class, doesn't learn anything, causes trouble, you can certainly play the game that way

but if you want to actually learn something, then you should be a good student

you should go to class, listen to the professors, etc

once you're no longer in class, you have the opportunity to do other quests. either within the castle of hogwarts or outside of the castle

that's another thing, hogwarts is very BIG, so just walking through the halls of the castle makes you feel like an important student of wizardry

you also get to see other students walking through the halls as well, talking and discussing about unimportant matters or what have you

you as a higher level student have more important matters to attend to so you go about your business accordingly

you also develop a bond with your professors and get to know them well

in particular, the herbology professor is very nice. she reminds me of some of my professors i had when i was in university in real life

she is a very nice lady that teaches you very good information on herbology

for you to cross these professors and make them disappointed in you would be very bad. it depends though, at least for me i find the herbology professor to be a very nice professor, so i wouldn't want her to be disappointed with me as a student

overall the point i'm trying to make is that the way i like to play the game is i take my magic studies seriously

the world is very whacky, all sorts of things can happen. it's the harry potter world, so people can make objects disappear, there are spells that set you on fire, cause you to fly, and cause objects to phase into and out of existence

this is a very incredible world that you are in and you have to be aware of the different things that can go wrong or go in your favor as you are exploring and doing quests

in short, there is really a lot to do in this game

hogwarts is huge, there's always new things you will run into as you are walking through the halls

i will say that this is a pretty good game

once i graduate from hogwarts i will feel very satisfied

another thing i like to do is dress for the occasion

so if i'm attending classes for the day i make sure my clothing is a proper school cloak and uniform

once class is over for the day and i am exploring outside of the castle or going to Hogsmeade, i change into more casual attire, maybe even put on a sorcerer's hat

it's all about dressing for the proper environment

you wouldn't go to class in real life wearing a trench coat and a top hat would you? probably not. so why would you do that in this game? exactly, that's how you should think about it

and one last thing i will say is that if this game were possible to play in a full dive virtual reality setting, it would be pretty epic

walking outside the castle really produces some cool sights that would pretty epic to see if you were physically standing there

it would be a scary situation though, given that in a world like that, someone could cause you to vanish into thin air or light you on fire with magic

just something to think about",nervomelbye,1gxkybx,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,2024-11-22 23:02:01,0,0.28,0,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gxkybx

pcgaming,So how did Quantic Dream create the amazing character models in Detroit?,"Probably the only game that has gotten closest to realism as far as character designs go.

Senua's Saga looked good but it still looked akward at times especially the expressions.

Tiny facial movements and emotions can actually be read in the game and I find it truly remarkable that the developers are able to render all of that in real time. 

Is it because of the linearity?

I was thinking why can't every dev go with the same design when it comes to rendering human characters.

Pretty amazing what they did with the game.

pcgaming,Handheld gaming PC comparison table I made to compare Steam Deck and 35+ alternatives on their specs and features,"Hi, I did a deep dive into handheld gaming PC's, and created a pretty comprehensive comparison table that I hope some of you might find useful:

[https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/)

It's got every handheld gaming PC available right now (that I could find), and allows you to compare all of them on their specifications and features; from display specs, CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD, built in sensors, connectivity, ports, battery, available buttons and inputs, physical specs like size/weight/available colors, and more.

There's options to filter the table on specs or features, too. So you can for instance filter on screen size, resolution, refresh rate, whether it's got a trackpad, gyro controls, detachable controllers, or a built-in keyboard, etc.

You can also sort columns. So for instance, to easily find the cheapest handheld that has the specs you're filtering for, you can sort the table on the price (MSRP) column.

Also, if you want to compare aby two models side-by-side, there's a separate tool available for that. So for instance, if you want to compare the Zotac Zone vs the Asus ROG Ally X: [https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs) \- and you can use the checkbox for 'Differences only' to only show the specs/features with differences.

Other than that, I've made sure to apply conditional formatting to most specs, to make it visually clear what the pros and cons of each model are.

There's also a size comparison image of some of the most popular options if you scroll past the table.

Let me know if you have any feedback! It's totally possible I've made a mistake somewhere, or missed a product or spec that could be interesting to add. I'm considering adding benchmarks to the table as well, but am not sure which ones would be best to use in this case - and if there's data for all or most of these handhelds? If anyone has thoughts on that, let me know!",CookieDelivery,1gv5y1x,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,2024-11-19 19:41:27,124,0.91,124,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gv5y1x

pcgaming,Detroit: Become Human on PC,"Just bought it at $11.99 and I have to say it's quite a steal.

The short episode format is perfect and it definitely promotes replayability.

The acting and character renders are one of the best I've seen in a video game.

Visuals are stunning at 4k with the image resolution doubled (so basically 8k?).

Performance is pretty steady keeping the framerates close to 60fps most of the time.

It's like playing an interactive dystopian scifi novel.

No wonder the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews.

I kind of find a sense of fulfillment when missing on these types of games and eventually finding it.

Just wanted to share and I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

When I saw the announcement last week that ""Episode 1 and 2 are now included with the base game on Steam"" I thought - what the hell? Wasn't it like this the whole time? 

No. HL2 is standalone, and Episode 1 and 2 are extra content.

I legit thought for nearly 15 years that Episode 1 was the first segment of the game, kinda like Life is Strange or other episodic games, and when you buy HL2 on Steam you get all the episodes released. I thought it was the reason people were pissed about Episode 3, because the game was never actually finished.

pcgaming,8 Years on and 0 lessons learned. Another swing and a miss for Frontier with Planet Coaster 2 - and barely anyone is talking about the broken state of the game.,"Frontier has once again excelled at creating a pretty Sandbox. Unfortunately, there's supposed to be a Theme-Park management game behind this and it's hard to believe that they learned zero lessons from their failures with Planet Coaster back in 2016.  

With a meaty update coming in December that promises to fix only some of the most egregious concerns, I really can't see how this game will maintain any kind of longevity, but with that little preamble let's start tearing apart this carcass for the juicy, gossipy flesh.  

---  

**As a game, it is completely and utterly broken.** We all know these games, right? Put rides down, put shops down, connect them all together with paths and scenery to balance your guests needs and hire a roster of staff to keep everything running. A simple enough premise.  

Planet Coaster 2 falls completely flat on its face. Both the guest *and* staff systems are utterly broken, but scandalously, they work *just well enough* to pass the sniff test with the Play Testers &amp; reviewers before release.  

**How is it broken?** You might ask, shall we start with the staff? 

* Rides will degrade less than an hour after placing them.
* Janitors ignore overflowing bins
* Mechanics ignore broken down rides
* Mechanics ignore ride and facilities maintenance 
* Rides degrade *minutes* after placing them down and need maintenance, but the Mechanics are too busy wandering around ""looking for work"".
* Ride operators and shop vendors leave to go on break without waiting for the person who's supposed to relieve them to even show up, suddenly leaving gaps in operations.  

**What about the guests?** The logic for these guys is completely busted. 

* If a coaster has a capacity of 32 guests, when the queue has 31 guests in it, nobody else will queue up, thinking ""That queue is too long"". They will walk up to the queue and do a 180 and walk away.
* Guests will be dying to use a toilet, and walk to the opposite end of the park, even though there's a toilet next to them. 
* If you open the park and place one tiny teacups ride down, it will attract thousands of guests.
* If you have a mix of water park slides and rollercoasters in your park, every guest will flip-flop into all wanting to go on one, or the other. But they'll all buy pool-passes despite not needing them.  
* Guests will drop trash on the floor even if there's an available trash bin nearby.  
* If there's too many rides, guests just won't use pools and flumes at all.  
* Still no guest wandering mechanics. They just move in a straight beeline from A to B.
* Major guest congestion issues. It's not uncommon to see 300 guests all mashing against each other in a mosh-pit  
* They added weather but it appears to be cosmetic and doesn't affect guest riding decisions.  
* They added picnic benches but guests won't sit down and eat. In fact, I've not seen any guests sitting down and eating on anything.  

---  

So yes, you can build rides, spend an hour creating the perfect station, filling in all the scenery, adding shops and weaving paths around. *But the actual, core aspect of the game just doesn't work*. There's no management here, it is just a glorified sandbox with a piss-poor campaign and completely broken staff and guest system.  

Avoid, and even then think twice if/when they fix it, because releasing a game as broken as this should not be rewarded with sales.",Chaoslava,1gu48ts,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,2024-11-18 13:05:20,442,0.89,442,0,148,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gu48ts

pcgaming,How is no developer making a Bethesda-Equivalent RPG (a la Skyrim) but updated/less buggy/less complacent?,"Skyrim was a great (although flawed) game but it's been so long since it was released that it's incredibly dated, and the intervening releases from Bethesda across its IPs have depleted a lot of the trust in the fan base. So it seems that the first person, sword and magic (or sneak and bow) open world RPG genre would be ripe for competition. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't really see any alternatives in the offing.

Conversely, there seems to be an insane amount of competition in the Soulslike genre (the very name of the genre gives away how many titles have attempted to supplant Fromsoft). Why would you attempt to follow up one of the sharpest developers with an imitation that almost certainly won't measure up to the Souls games or Elden Ring (in my opinion one of the greatest games ever made, and I'm not really a Soulslike fan)? Where's all this effort in the Skyslike arena?

I really just wish there were an updated, cutting edge open world fantasy RPG that would be the next generational timesink, having the added benefit of forcing Bethesda to not just phone it in with their own IPs.",lakadazakal,1gtla4a,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gtla4a/how_is_no_developer_making_a_bethesdaequivalent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gtla4a/how_is_no_developer_making_a_bethesdaequivalent/,2024-11-17 19:20:55,0,0.49,0,0,218,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gtla4a
pcgaming,"Hi folks!  I'm making Kitchen Sync: Aloha!, a cooking strategy RPG, inspired by a mashup of Overcooked and Fire Emblem.  There's a free demo update on Steam for Cooking Fest!","Hi r/pcgaming! I'm the developer for Kitchen Sync: Aloha!, a cozy cooking RPG set in Hawaii.  My game is currently featured in the Steam Cooking Fest with a free demo and wanted to make sure fans of cooking games and quirky strategy games know about it!

Steam Page, Trailer, and Demo: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333930/Kitchen\_Sync\_Aloha/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333930/Kitchen_Sync_Aloha/)

I've always been a fan of cooking games and tactical RPGs, and wanted to try mashing up my favorite parts of each genre.

* 🍳 Take on the role of head chef of your family's pop-up restaurant. Rather than cooking everything yourself, issue orders to your team of chefs in your kitchen.  Deliver food tasty enough to clear your customer's Hunger Points (HP) and satisfy all your guests before running out of time. The game automatically pauses whenever your chefs need direction, giving the game a laid back, turn based tactics feel.
* 🌟 Kitchen planning with strategic depth.  Fine tune your chefs' builds with ability trees and learnable skills, and combine them with specialized menus, kitchen layouts, and team skills to make your restaurant the best around.  Optimize for certain flavors, build in synergies between your chefs, go all in on a powerful special ability, or keep it casual and randomize it all.  It's up to you!
* 💞 Chefs build relationships when paired together - whether or not they're the player's character! Each pairing leads to friendships or even romantic endings, unlocking a ton of unique dialogue scenes, side quests, and special abilities for your favorite characters.  If you're familiar with the support system from Fire Emblem/Unicorn overlord and other tactical RPGs this will feel familiar!
* 🗺️ Master dozens of different kitchen layouts around the Hawaiian Island of Maikai. Beaches, backyards, resorts, malls, and more, each with different challenges.  Like Overcooked or Plate Up, even small changes in layout or menu mean a big difference when efficiently moving around the kitchen and wasting as little time as possible.
* 🐟 Take a break between levels with minigames like fishing and hiking.

Kitchen Sync's demo was previously featured this year in the Wholesome Games Festival, the PixElated Festival, and the Seattle Indie Expo, and player feedback has been incorporated along the way to make the game even better. For this event, the game's gotten an entire UI overhaul and new tutorials to make getting started as easy as possible.

If you're a fan of cooking games and/or strategy RPGs, I'd love for you to give the demo a try and let me know what you think either here or on our discord! Wishlist are also always helpful!

The game will be skipping early access and go straight to a full launch, planned next year.

pcgaming,Games that need a remaster,"I’ve been playing **Warcraft 1 Remastered** and having a blast. It’s a lot more difficult than I remember (probably because I used cheats all the time as a kid) but being able to select more than four guys at once, change zoom settings (now I can actually see catapults coming!), and the introduction of control groups is a godsend.

It got me thinking: What other old PC games, classic or otherwise, could use a remaster?

Playing this has me thinking that **Dune 2** would be a great game to have a similar remaster. If it was essentially the exact same game but more zoomed out and with control groups and larger selections of units, I’d be totally on board! That music and the “wormsign” sound byte live rent free in my head…

Another more obscure one that I doubt too many will remember or recognize is **Blood and Magic**. It’s a super cool but super slow RTS game with an official DnD license that they took more than a few liberties with. I’d love a remaster that pumps the game speed up and adds similar features to what we received in the Warcraft 1 remaster. It’ll probably never happen though. The game was a commercial failure and doesn’t really even have much of a cult following.

I think **Lord of the Rings: Conquest** would be amazing as well, especially since we got a remaster of Star Wars Battlefront. I would particularly love it on the Switch, split-screen, but since this is a PC gaming sub I’d play the hell out of it on PC as well.

Finally I’d love a near 1:1 remaster of **Master of Magic**. I know there was a recent remake, but when I looked into it I felt like a lot of the personality of the original game was lost. What I *really* want is the exact same game, graphics and music and all, but upscaled and with some quality of life improvements. In my mind the original was a nearly perfect game and even its imbalances were part of its flavour.

pcgaming,Forgotten Valor is an upcoming RPG being released on December 6th!,"Forgotten Valor takes place in 2091 and revolves around a time of war where the nation of Vivica in secret produced mass amounts of weapons that utilize around AI. With this new power, they were able to quickly sweep over the smaller nations of Arcadia along with its neighboring nations.  
  
Within a matter of months, Arcadia falls and becomes a puppet state to the seemingly unstoppable Vivica. With this, camps are built throughout the nation, where mass productions of these AI, formally known as 'Metalgeists', are being created to help pursue the war.

Almost 2 years have passed now and we assume the role of a former Arcadian solider who Vivicans refer to as ""The Reaper"". With the war still raging on as Vivica invades the bigger nation of Dorfrine, Reaper tries to find out more about himself whilst also trying to free the nation he abandoned. Or at least that's what he likes to believe.  
  
Through his journey he will run into many companions, people who are battling their own demons as they struggle to find light in all the chaos that is happening in this war. Will Reaper be able to unite with them to end the seemingly endless waves of Metalgeists, or will he potentially fall victim to them himself?

pcgaming,Why aren't games published in a universal format?,"I'm sorry this turned into more of a rant.. but the TLDR is I'm wondering why we can't own games anymore, and why can't we play them where we want after buying the game?

~~It's 1997, your mom just took you to K Mart and you convinced her to buy you that new CD. On the drive home you pop the CD into the car stereo made by Sony, and when you get home you start listening to it on the boombox in your room that was made by Toshiba. A few years later, you rip the songs from that CD and play them on your iPod. You owned those songs for good, and only had to pay for them once. If you wanted to listen to them today, you can.

The same goes for VHS, DVD, etc. The formats for audio and video were (close to) universal, and it was up to the owner to determine how they used and consumed the media.

When you look at games, it's the total opposite.
PC games used to be on the cusp of this, but that's almost completely gone now as well. I don't even know where you can buy an actual copy of a PC game now..

Let's say I buy Cyberpunk on Steam for $60. I can play it on any PC, as long as I have Steam installed. Cool. But if I move to the living room and boot up my Xbox, I can't just load my copy there - I have to pay $60 again to have the Xbox version. Want to play that on your handheld Switch? That'll be another $60... But oops, despite buying 3 copies of the same exact game for $180, you can't play, because there is no Internet on this 8 hr flight. Finally, once you get a connection, have fun starting from the beginning because your save data won't even load from the other platform.

It seems pretty criminal to me lol. What are we actually buying when we ""buy"" a game? What happens if steam or Xbox shuts down? Why the hell can't I have a subpar experience trying to run my games on a 20 year old PC with no internet if I want?

Is there any movement to protect the consumer in 2024? Am I overlooking something?",glooppoop,1gr5ple,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gr5ple/why_arent_games_published_in_a_universal_format/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gr5ple/why_arent_games_published_in_a_universal_format/,2024-11-14 14:15:47,0,0.18,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gr5ple

Over time, scientists have mastered the process of synthesizing energy crystals on space stations, opening up new horizons for research and technology development in the country and beyond. So the settlers began a new chapter in the history of space exploration, leaving a mark on every tiny star system they explored.

During the long-forgotten and lost centuries, when people went to the far reaches of space in search of new worlds, each colony sought to increase its population. To explore minerals and the suitability of planets for exploration, geological expeditions were sent to unexplored territories - desperate researchers who were ready to risk everything for the sake of what they wanted. One day, a young girl, Zlata, who has completed an internship on Mars and won the hearts of the scientific community with her knowledge, is sent on one of these daring outings.

Such expeditions were sent on small spaceships without weapons. The team consisted of a geologist pilot and a mechanized exoskeleton.

And so, in the very heart of the abode of ancient forces, where darkness is woven from timeless years, she hears the echoes of the SOS signal coming from the planet Manoan. This signal strikes her imagination, because the planet has been abandoned and uninhabited for fifty years according to all known archives. Having decided to take an amazing step into the unknown, Zlata is faced with mysteries that can turn all her beliefs and ideas about the cosmos upside down.

GAME FEATURES:

A distinctive feature of the game is its character leveling system, which allows players to experiment with different strategies and game styles. The combat system is based on the use of various types of weapons and magic, as well as on the competent use of the character's skills and abilities.

TYPE OF GAME:

When scrolling the mouse wheel, you can switch between three different views: first-person, third-person, and top view.

This allows players to choose the most convenient angle for passing the game and viewing the game environment.

CHARACTER SELECTION:

Two modes: ""MECH Warrior"" and ""MECH Pilot"".

In the ""MECH Warrior"" mode, the player controls a huge and powerful robot combat mech. The mech is equipped with weapons, armor and special abilities that allow it to fight enemies and complete various tasks. The player controls the movement of the mech, its attacks and special abilities.

In the ""MECh Pilot"" mode, the player can use his robot as a companion that helps in battles. The robot can attack enemies, protect its pilot and help him in various tasks. The ability to play as a pilot without being inside the robot. In this case, the player becomes a full-fledged participant in the fighting on earth and can use his weapons and abilities to destroy enemies.

An incredible adventure awaits you on the planet Manoan, where every step is filled with danger and mysteries. Your first task is to turn a geological exoskeleton into a powerful combat robot suit capable of protecting you from all threats.

After studying many types of weapons, from firearms to magic, you will be able to choose the right tool for each type of enemy. Magic crystals will surround you with magic, giving you the opportunity to use unique abilities in the fight against enemies.

Every riddle, every puzzle on your way will be a test of your intelligence and resourcefulness. By solving them, you will come closer to understanding the mysteries of the planet Manoan and its amazing secrets.

Faced with a difficult choice that will affect the outcome of the entire operation, you will have to weigh your decisions and take responsibility for every step of this dangerous journey. Your courage and ability to think on the move will become your main weapons in the fight for survival and victory.

I have released a demo version of the game, and you have the opportunity to evaluate my work on the game.

Man time sure flies as I just realized that by November 2024, Half Life 2, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, and World of Warcraft will all be turning 20 years old as that’s kind of scary if one thinks about it.

pcgaming,DIGESTED,"***Digested is a horror survival game where you try to escape a giant snake!***

Years ago, I learned how to control my dreams but simultaneously developed a fear of snakes. One night, while dreaming, I saw a huge snake trying to eat me. This recurring nightmare didn't go away, and it inspired me to create a horror game called ""Digested.""  
**Announcement Trailer**: [http://youtu.be/lwgdsHYB4HM](http://youtu.be/lwgdsHYB4HM)  
**Nightmare mode**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9Fg5AxDXw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9Fg5AxDXw)

This was my way to fix this absurd situation and make my personal horror less scary for myself. I recreated a real-life island that I have visited many times before. Its filled with dense forest and abandoned buildings. Added a big snake that tries to hunt you so it can digest you and the main protagonist, who is a slow, stumbling human wearing an anti-digestion suit.  
Survival is more than just dodging a giant snake. It’s about making smart decisions and managing your resources effectively. You need to find navigation points scattered across the island to figure out where your escape pod is located. Each time you find and deactivate a navigation point, you'll gain a power-up that helps you outsmart the snake. But these power-ups are temporary, lasting only 20–30 seconds, so you have to use them wisely and strategically.  
**Wishlist now on Steam**: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605900/DIGESTED/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605900/DIGESTED/)

Running around aimlessly won't help you either. The snake can sense vibrations, so every footstep and noise you make could give away your position. And it’s not just slithering on the ground—it can climb trees too, making the threat even more omnipresent. You have to be constantly on the lookout, planning each move carefully to avoid detection.  
**Reddit profile:** [**https://www.reddit.com/user/digestedgame/**](https://www.reddit.com/user/digestedgame/)  
**Discord server:** [**https://discord.gg/**](https://discord.gg/)

The island’s layout changes every time you play—new starting points, different power-up locations, and a correct escape pod. This keeps the game fresh and challenging, forcing you to adapt your strategy each time. It's not just about avoiding the snake; it's about mastering the environment, outsmarting your predator, and ultimately escaping alive.

pcgaming,Next Age of empires titles could be in UNREAL Engine 5,"

https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1781800/Principal-Build-Lead-Engineer---World’s-Edge

It’ s my personal opinion but i think that all World’s Edge Is moving on Unreal Engine because It’s a very know Engine into Xbox studios with mastera of development (coalition) which could help a lot with It.

Unreal Engine Is the most supported Engine in the world and the most spectular, allowing developers to implement excelent graphic and very good performance with DLSS.

Now, AOE4 graphic has been one of the most critized aspect of the game in every community (from reddit to steam, to the ageofempires forum) and also in many professionale review (included Digital foundry).

The main problem Is the Essence Engine by RELIC Entertainment that It has been implemented for different type of RTS (Company of Heroes and Warhammer) and It doesn’t support DLSS.

Artistic choices of Relic art directory (Sclappy, if i Remember well) to make a game too much coloured with exagerered weapons, low textures on units (this Is the reason why you can’t zoom in on them too see battles more close. You are able to zoom in only With a “free camera mod” that’s a Total mess) and bad animations (destructions of siege weapons or chickens and horses in the stables) alienated the most of fans. After the launch and After One year of critics the most of threads on often community are related to e-sport. Basically the only players who are actually playing the game are multiplayer gamers.

Unfortunately and despite of what streamers wanna share, the multiplayer fans are the Little percent of the base of AOE. The most of fans (where developers gain) are casual Who play only With campaigns, skirmish, scenarios and co-op and It has been confirmed by Forgotten Empires in the lastest interview about the upcoming “Battle of Greece” DLC for Aoe2de. For casual gamers graphic Is really important too because It helps a lot with immersion.

This Is the reason why the Sultan’s Ascend has been the most sold DLC in the history of AOE: new campaign (made by Forgotten Empires), new graphic improvements (water reflections) and Better stories to told.

In the lastest AOE survey (july or August) ther were many questions about graphic (realistic or stylized, High detailed textures, realistic weapons impact, wheater effects, Natural disaster and more).


Age of Empires Forum – 20 Jun 24

New survey!
Age of Empires IV
IV - Discussion
There is a new survey in Steam about Age of Empires IV. Folks, please take it. The devs take into account our feedback and make the necessary changes (most of the time).

Reading time: 11 mins 🕑Likes: 47 ❤

So It seems also Developers listened all critics about graphic and they are looking for really improvents.

Unreal Engine seems the right choice for all of these reasons and also because Relic Entertainment, After the lastest layoffs and the sold by Sega, are not involved on AOE4 anymore or in very Little percent. I think the upcoming and confirmed DLC in 2025 there Will be the latest for the AOE4 or World’s Edge with Forgotten Empires could redone all Aoe4 in Unreal Engine.

But what It seems Is that next titles Will probably run on Unreal Engine.

pcgaming,Recent SegaSammy Financial Report pays close attention to Total War: Warhammer III Steam User Reviews,"Just a friendly semi-regular reminder that even multi-billion dollar corps, contrary to ""popular"" belief, do very much pay attention to Steam user reviews. As stated in [page 33 of the report](https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20241108_q2_presentation_e.pdf),  the recovery and turn around of TW:WH3 was directly tied to the intense ""reviewbomb"" the game and its DLC received last year driven by customer dissatisfaction.

Not unlike what the [Take-Two](https://www.gamefile.news/p/take-two-review-bombs-gta-nfl-2k) stated earlier this year about the effect negative user reviews on profits as well.

pcgaming,I wanted to shoutout a game that's not popular enough: Cosmoteer,"I'm no affiliated with the dev or anything i'm just someone desperate for less known indie game gems to get the attention (in my opinion) they deserve. 

Cosmoteer is a 2D scifi ship manager. Imagine FTL + Starsector (if you don't know starsector shame on you). 

What made me fell in love with it is that it doesn't have frustrating mechanics for a ""manger"" game. You don't need to gather fuel to keep going, your crew will constantly produce energy cells to power your components. 

What makes it stand out is that at ANY point you can stop and redesign your entire ship on the spot. You destroy an enemy ship? Get the crew to work and disassemble it, gather materials and attach new pieces to yours. 

Or just repair the enemy ship, send some of your crew in and have a second ship that follows you. I love bringing smalls ships with me to work as defense platforms when i'm in a fight, or as factories since you can mine asteroids and build small refineries for each material. 

Progression is simply tied to the number of crew you can have and ships can get ridiculously large.  

What it's missing is simply more to do outside of combat. You could trade but there's no trade economy, just sell what you don't need. More different quests, encounters, things to do. 

Also i would argue some mods i find essential.

It has coop, pvp, mod support, editor, i mean...

**Tips to get the best suggestions**

* Be detailed! If you're looking for a roguelike, say that. If your game must include zombies, you should probably mention that. The more detailed you are the better the recommendations will be.
* Are you limited by PC specifications or a budget? That's all good stuff to include.

pcgaming,'New Game+' - Anyone else never play it?,"I always strive to get there, as it's motivating, but once I do, I just have no desire to run through the same game, though mobs are harder, without experiencing the upgrades along the way.

For me, the things you earn along the way, and the fact you have so little to begin with, are what draws me in.

I'd rather start over on a harder level, if not already maxed, from scratch.

pcgaming,Why do some games have region-locked specific features despite the game existing worldwide in all store fronts on steam? ,"I've noticed this when I looked at *The Last of Us: Part 1* &amp; *Days Gone*, as in both cases there's a notice that Japanese dubbing &amp; UI localization is only available for Japanese players (which I have access to as I own a Japanese account), but when my friend who lives in the US wanted to enable JP dubbing in their copy, it does not exist at all despite listing Japanese as one of the official supported languages.

However, I did notice differences between Western &amp; Japanese versions of *Days Gone* in regards to censorship as the JPN one redacted most of the gore during cutscenes, while in other versions the game is uncensored. (My assumption is that Japan has strict rules about the intensity of violence in video games while Japanese games that are H3N741-like or Ecchi are censored or outright banned in some Western nations.)",[deleted],1glocwt,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1glocwt/why_do_some_games_have_regionlocked_specific/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1glocwt/why_do_some_games_have_regionlocked_specific/,2024-11-07 11:33:09,15,0.64,15,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1glocwt

pcgaming,Starcraft on Steam?,"So, Starcraft Remastered and Starcraft 2 have launched on GamePass. But where are the Steam versions of these games? I am not asking for the games to be free on Steam but I don’t understand why the games are not available for purchase on Steam.

Remember when Phil Spencer said ""If we are shipping a first-party game it's coming to PC. If we are shipping a first-party game on PC it's coming to Steam and our own store”. He may have forgotten this promise but I remember. 

They also promised the same when they wanted to buy Activision - “we want to make games as playable by as many people as possible."" 

So why aren’t they on Steam? 

Why are those GamePass exclusives? 

I thought they did not want to do exclusives anymore? 

Why can’t I just buy the games on Steam, like they promised?

I first saw this while watching a horror streamer play it in a batch of random games (separate recording from that YT video) and then went to YT to confirm in a separate recording that it wasn't the streamer playing it in the background or something.

It's blatant theft of a Silent Hill 2 OST track, is it not? I reported it to Steam, and to Konami's legal team with ample evidence. Haven't heard a peep. What's the message here? You can just steal things and sell anything on steam, apparently? Is there no recourse for this type of situation?

Edit: Should have added, this was reported over 3 months ago. I put 15 minutes into a report and forgot about it until I saw the product title on another site just now which prompted me to go check on it. So to you mr.

pcgaming,On Wizardry,"Forgive me, brothers, for I have sinned. I have played PC games you people wouldn't believe: attack ships sinking in the Aegean Sea. I've watched a fluff sequence initiated near the Powerizer, picked up a Vorticon HyperPistol, and gone bravely to the rescue of Sandy Pantz. And it has not always been easy.

Over the years, I have been tempted, and I've faltered. I shamefully admit that I took up the controller in '93 for 37 levels in support of a friend. Four years later, I succumbed again to the split-screen madness, only to be saved by a priest mere months later. The coup de grâce was nearly delivered by the siren song of an ocarina when I found myself on a forklift stuck in an elevator, reaching lightspeed. Remember the Turbo button and what it was for? I had no such button, but the memory of one allowed me to solve the puzzle.

By far, the best memories I've got are of us huddling over a keyboard with friends when the weather was bad enough - thank god - for not being told to go outside. The joy of building pillow forts increased tenfold as it became necessary to drown out the noise of the dreaded dial-up handshake. Building forts wasn't possible in-game, but MMOs allowed for crafting weapons and friendships. These friendships were augmented by everyone sharing the same hardships of dodging scammers and griefers. However difficult, it was nothing compared to the questions about the phone bills.

The hobby's heyday (at least for me) was when these groups of friends united in real life. Hobbling together ""degraded polymer chain"" -yellow (my favorite yellow) Jenga towers of CRTs, cases, and miscellaneous accessories with duct tape was exhilarating - and not least because of the monetary value of broken equipment if everything came crumbling down - but because it meant seeing those wizards in real life.

When I say wizards, I'm not talking about people who can cast a fireball -anyone can do that. I'm referring to the conjurers who can modify your crossover into a straight cable or sort out that nasty double NAT to save the party. And don't get me started on the netrunners with their corp equipment setting up the rest of the ICE and other connectivity for the whole guild.

Those are but a fraction of the moments that turned every DOA hardware piece, failed hard drive, BSOD, connection drop, and lag spike into reminders of the joy that lay beyond the struggle. Each loading screen held a certain beauty of the unexpected, and every buggy launch glistened with possibility.

Alas, with age, the wizards have taken on more responsibilities. While everyone understands that a wizard arrives precisely when they mean to,  that principle tends to work better with solo content. Don't get me wrong - I love solo questing, but I prefer the kind where, at the end of a ray-traced rainbow, I don't have to donate another leather jacket.

As I've grown older and have spent considerable time on the computer not just for enjoyment but to earn a living, I look back fondly on the time when the pain I knew had a silly face instead of being a superlative prefix.

So, it is with a heavy heart that I share having bought a console - not just one but two - of Japanese origin. Having pondered everything shared in this post, I thought now would be a good time to catch up on all the exclusives I have missed. As I embark on this new journey, I already feel a particular breath of fresh air, a reminder that the magic of gaming never truly fades.

If you read this far, thank you. May you judge me harshly but fairly - video games forever!",argtus,1gk852r,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gk852r/on_wizardry/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gk852r/on_wizardry/,2024-11-05 14:37:28,0,0.23,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gk852r

I know most of those game are not exactly ""set in"" in any real locations, but rather inspired by certain place in North America, and with some game developers aren't even American they may even romatisize those places but still since I am not American I wish to know which they were inspired because... this is my vibe and wish to look more.   
Games I talk about are

Life is Strange  
DREDGE  
Oxenfree   
Night in the woods. 

Night in the woods is supposly inspired by Rust Belt

Life is strange in suppose to be in Oregon. But pics I have found so far don't look like something  I look for.

But what I look for is :

\- Stone coastline  
\-Cold sea

\- Forests

\-Cold islands.

\- Fishing and Whale Hunting small towns.

I think that Dredge and Oxenfree are actually inspired by East Coast like New England? Or Maine? 

I am not American and wish to find lovely places which could remind me of those games.

10,91% comes from AMD by adding everything below RX 6700XT and 50,35% comes from Nvidia by adding everything below 2070 SUPER and since they also posted 4060 as rec GPU, I assume, that from the 30XX everything below 3060TI is also not enough for the rec specs.

I also just assumed for practical reasons, that any Intel GPU is within the spec range, since there wasn't any guideline for them on the rec specs. So if somebody wants to compare each Intel GPU to the rec GPUs, to determine, which of those don't reach the rec specs, the percentage can increase by up to 7,65%.

**CPU**

I would have liked to check also on the CPUs, since I think, that they are even a bigger problem, but unfortunately the survey wasn't so clear about the surveyed CPUs, since unlike in the GPU list, there isn't a list with specifically named CPUs and the CPU clock speed and amount of cores are 2 separate lists.

So if someone has any ideas and/or other reliable sources about figuring out the used CPUs, I would like to know.

**Notes**

I know, that not every steam user is also part of those surveys, but I also don't think, it's like a niche amount. I think those numbers are representable.

Also, if I made any mistake and/or grossly overlooked, simplified or estimated anything, I would appreciate any comment pointing them out, if possible with sources and/or explanation, since I don't aim to spread misinformation.

**Personal conclusion**

Now, you can ofc do what ever you like with that that number, but IMO, alienating around 61% or more Steam users (and with how many ppl use steam, we could basically say ""PC users"" at this point) doesn't sound like a good thing, especially if that rec spec is only aiming at 60FPS with frame gen @1080p and only even at medium settings.",Borando96,1gjqoc0,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gjqoc0/more_than_61_of_all_steam_surveyed_gpus_cant/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gjqoc0/more_than_61_of_all_steam_surveyed_gpus_cant/,2024-11-04 22:04:24,0,0.41,0,0,97,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gjqoc0

pcgaming,DA: The Veilguard held back by its bland and safe writing direction,"
i tried playing it, and honestly those two cringe cut scenes are the least should be concerned of. The writing for the whole game just felt too safe, a big departure from previous DA. Even DA:I is not this safe.

The criticism ""feels like there's a HR in the room."" is absolutely legit and fair. Heck, even Varric manner of speech and behaviour are toned down. Most of cut scenes interaction felt like I'm watching conversations between corporate employees. There are moments some characters tried to be snarky, but it didn't deliver because it sounded like insults to jab at work colleagues.. which weird for a medieval fantasy. 

But, the character creation deserves respect, particularly face sliders. Super fun to mess around with. I spent hours on character creation menu.

Combat, well, it tried to be ME3 but ends up clunky because it combines DA:I action/strategy combat mechanics with ME3 fast-paced shooter feel. The dodging mech is particularly clunky if you're playing as a mage. Also, it feels too Fortnite-ish---the characters movements in particular when they executing combos or casting spells...it has that typical battle royale game feel to it.

pcgaming,Tailside: Launch of first fundraiser for my first game (And it's going great!),"**Hi there!** You might not know me, but you may have seen me around as **Coffee Beans Dev.** Let me briefly introduce myself. I have been a digital artists for year that, the past year, decided to learn pixel art and to learn how to make a game. I have done tons of hours of research through out best genres to start with, best practices, marketing tips, fundraiser ideas and so on.

I went with a cozy cafe sim idea as I'm a fan of cute cozy games such as animal crossing, stardew valley, a short hike and similar so as a cozy community member, I thought something that I'm most familiar with would be the best to start.

I started posting very rough ideas of the game around a year ago since I learned that starting to market the game would be the best as early as possible and any visual image/draft/sketch can be turned into marketing material. I created the most popular social medias, memorable name (Coffee Beans Dev) and started interacting with a bunch of people around.

A bit after, I made a Steam page for the game which gained 1.000 wishlists within a day, over 10k within a month and is currently sitting at 28.000+ wishlists. Again, I wanted to start collecting wishlists ASAP so my initial page was a complete draft, with little images, text and no trailer. The current Steam page still needs some improvements but is currently [in this state.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside/)

The game is called **Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim** and has just recently launched a fundraiser page (I was so busy I forgot to post the launch post of it here, so hopefully it's fine if I still do it now!)

The community that has been built around Tailside made sure of a great head start with the fundraiser, quickly reaching a few stretch goals and other achiemevents. And since I'm trying my best to reach more of the goals to be able to add all the other fun ideas I got in mind, I would love for anyone who might be interested to check it out as well (or check it for reference on how I set it up):

[Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim Fundraiser](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/coffee-beans-dev/tailside-cozy-fox-cafe-indie-game#top)

I haven't been able lately to compile and share too much of numbers and summary on what is working and what is not for me during all these preparations, launching etc. but I hope to do it as soon as I get more free time!

Thank you so much for checking out, and **I hope I can give a bit of motivation to others who might be creating their first game like me!** And a big thank you to all the developers that have been sharing their experiences in gaming communities, without them I definitely wouldn't have made it this far. 🧡",coffeebeansdev,1gj1m0v,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gj1m0v/tailside_launch_of_first_fundraiser_for_my_first/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gj1m0v/tailside_launch_of_first_fundraiser_for_my_first/,2024-11-04 00:23:13,27,0.64,27,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gj1m0v

pcgaming,PCSX2 v2.2.0 has been released - October 31st 2024,"Head over to [PCSX2 site](https://pcsx2.net/downloads) for download.

3 months later after the initial 2.0.0 release, 2.2.0 has finally been released as the next stable build of PCSX2!

This release includes a whole flurry of new features, performance improvements and bug fixes! Which includes new debugger symbol importer, DEV9 fixes, a new controller types and so much more!

Here is a few highlight of the changes:

* New emulated controller types (Negcon, Jogcon, Trance Vibrator, Gametrak, Densha De Go! Train controller, and more!)
* Discord Rich Presence now shows your game icon and status! (RetroAchievements and its supported game are required.)
* Audio support for EyeToy.
* New savestate compression type and ratio option.
* Cheats section now has a search bar for easier cheat lookups especially if you have a lot of entries
* The Debugger can now reads `.mdebug` and `.sndata` section from the game's executable binary if it has them included. if said `.mdebug` section is available, the debugger can now display information about global variables, local variables and parameter variables, with data types. That means you can explore data structures in memory in a structured tree. (Pac-Man World 2 for example.)
* Many DEV9 fixes which should benefits homebrews.

NOTE:

We are currently working to get our Flathub integration back up. As of now it is stuck at v2.1.226. You will need to manually download the Flatpak from [our GitHub release](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/releases/tag/v2.2.0) to update until further notice.

pcgaming,Improbability Control Bureau - Full Release on Steam! 🎉,"Hey everyone,

We're thrilled to announce the **1.0 release of** ***Improbability Control Bureau***! ICB is a spot-the-difference horror game where you’ll be tasked with monitoring live surveillance cameras, identifying eerie anomalies—like shifting furniture or unexpected intrusions—and reporting them to survive.

👉 **Steam Page:** [Improbability Control Bureau](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530060/Improbability_Control_Bureau/)

This game is a labor of love from a two-person team: my girlfriend and I. She handled most of the level design and art direction, while I focused on developing the Improbability Engine. We've poured time and passion into creating this experience, with a single meticulously designed level. While there's only one level, we've limited and randomized room selection to keep the experience fresh and enhance re-playability.

Earlier this year, we were honored to be accepted into **TinyTeams2024**! We have a replay from that event on loop on the Steam page if you’re interested in seeing more. Plus, there’s a limited DEMO available for anyone who wants to try before diving in.

pcgaming,After 5 years of solo dev I'm real happy to have my roguelike/strategy game Rogues Don't Cry out right now on Steam!,"Hello r/PCGAMING!

Very proud to announce Rogues Don't Cry is out on Steam now!  

My name is Olivier, I'm a solo dev from Canada. Been working on my passion project which is inspired by games like Age of Wonders and tons of roguelikes like Crawl Soup and some RTS thrown in there. 

The result is maybe a new genre, a quick pace roguelike with army building and real time combat. This is really an experimental game and I took a lot of risks making it! Especially since the difficulty is a bit high and it's aimed at experienced gamers.

Hope you try it and definitely leave feedback!

Oh yeah, it has the best graphics in the history of gaming, just so you know.

Steam page:  [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352820/Rogues\_Dont\_Cry/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352820/Rogues_Dont_Cry/)

⚔Features⚔

🗡 Total control of your units for pulling off some cheese tactics, with smart automation when needed

The game is in development since late 2019 and is getting close to completion now; we’re excited to be part of the official *Steam Scream Fest 2024*.

As part of the Fest we have a playable demo covering the 1st three chapters of the game (\~3 hours of content) where you’ll define your backstory and skills via an interactive fiction, and then play the first few days after you return home to the Adriatic coastal city of Marns and your father’s funeral in 1733. This begins your transition into the Realm of the Dead.

pcgaming,Cleared Hot - Some nostalgic bait I will actually bite into. ,"When I was kid the Strike Series (Desert, Jungle, Urban) had to be some of the best time I ever spent on an old Nintendo console. I really never thought they were popular enough to warrant some sort of remake (or tribute I guess) but here we are. I love the way the pilot talks like he is the same guy from decades ago.
