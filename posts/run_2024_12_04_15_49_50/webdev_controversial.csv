I created a **free and open-source** **plugin** called **AutoSave on Typing** for **all JetBrains/IntelliJ IDEs**.

As a front-end developer who moved from VSCode to Webstorm, I missed the **autosave feature** and got tired of constantly pressing **Cmd/Ctrl+S** to see UI changes. So, I built this plugin, especially for front-end/full-stack developers like me.

If you have the same motivation, you can also use it to automate your tiresome saving process.

Since then I‚Äôve been trying to find a problem to fix but it isn‚Äôt easy. When I was struggling at my lowest during that hackathon the solution LITERALLY walked through the door and gave me the problem to solve. That doesn‚Äôt happen too often.

webdev,Can anyone explain how scrollbars  determine which element they get attached to? Mine is getting attached to the body for whatever reason and don't really understand it...,"I have encountered the worst problem in my web dev project. **SCROLLBARS**

Imagine implementing a *simple* chat system and you know nothing about websockets and broadcasting yet the **worst roadblock** is getting the scrollbar to go down in a react app.. I can get it to go down when I set `h-[some value]` but it won't go down otherwise...

So I throw in some `overflow` magic. Nah uh, the scrollbar ain't moving an inch.. I do all my scrollbar effecting witchcraft (looking at you **tailwind**) on the element that I think is managing the scrollbar. It did not move one inch. Then I change the potions, seems like `useEffect` ain't cutting it, so my truth sayer (**chat gpt**) recommended `useLayoutEffect`  and it still did not work. Then I go on a hunt for the element which the scroll bar is getting attached to.

Turns out it is getting attached to the body element. I was able to confirm this by adding overflow-hidden to the parent components one by one and it only worked on the body element!!

Now the realization hit me, I know nothing of scrollbars. I can't seem to find a resource to actually learn what it is relevant to my current **context**. I have spent hours on this problem and can't seem to figure it out.

EDIT: Did not add code because idk if it is allowed here

EDIT: Further context: In a chat app, the scrollbar should be at the bottom coz you want to see the latest message not the oldest.

I am trying to learn css by creating a general custom css that works for all website in the nord theme. I took the solarized-everything project and tried to add a generic nord theme for all site.

In some websites, e.g. reddit, this bit from the pictures for replies don't seem to get recolored.

Other things in reddit that doesn't get recolored is the markdown editor box for post. Home popular, explore tabs when they are highlighted etc. Others relatively blend in but the subsequent thread line for replies and hide replies area are very jarring to see.

How do I fix this?

\[SOLUTION\]

It was taking a global variable `--color-neutral-background`

However setting the variable in `:root` didn't work but setting it to `*` worked

\[[Here](https://github.com/jojowakaki/dots/blob/main/config/qutebrowser/solarized-everything-css/css/nord-dark-all-sites.css)\] is the css just in case somone is interested.

webdev,Best Practices for Synchronizing Supabase Auth and Local Database in a NestJS App,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I‚Äôm working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What‚Äôs the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?
* Any tips for optimizing this flow for scalability and maintaining clean code?",Aymsep,1h6f2g6,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6f2g6/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6f2g6/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,2024-12-04 12:41:55,1,0.6,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h6f2g6

webdev,Simpliest tool to send a few HTML emails,"Hi!

We are in the need of sending a few HTML emails every now and then, to send the instructions of workshops to previously registered attendants.

My client is already using ActiveCampaign, but it doesn't suit us since people can unsubscribe. And it seems that Mautic and PHPLists are too complex (I'm still fighting with the hosting company to see if they allow to use them). Also tested a couple of Wordpress plugins, but the basic stuff costs too much clicks and are packed with useless functions.

Is there a simple tool (online or self-hosted, PHP if possible) that can help my client to send a few HTML mails once a month, and maybe probably see a preview of them?

webdev,"How do server-sent event ""streams"" work on a lower level?","Hi, and sorry for the lack of a tl;dr; - I'm not sure how to get away from providing the context. Basically I'm interested in connecting to a web server and consuming [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) using a lower level HTTP API and am hoping somebody can explain how the push vs pull of these events might work at a lower level.

I'm working on a hardware project (ESP32-S3 / espressif ESP-IDF based) where I'm writing C with a bit of higher level abstraction to support HTTP interactions. For example, the methods I might call are:

* `esp_http_client_open()`: Open the HTTP connection with write_len parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set write_len=0 for read-only connection.
* `esp_http_client_fetch_headers()`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). 
* `esp_http_client_read()`: Read the HTTP stream
* `esp_http_client_close()`: Close the connection.

([more examples / docs are here if you're currious](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client.html#http-stream))

Now what I'm trying to figure out is what `esp_http_client_read()` actually is doing in terms of the server to client communication. When I connect to a server over HTTP, and assuming `keep-alive`, I can call `esp_http_client_read()` every millisecond, or I can wait 100 milliseconds and call it. Both ""work"" in that if there is no data being sent from the server, nothing will happen, and if there is data, I'll read it and be able to do something with it. _edit: for clarity because it may be non-obvious, my intention is to have my hardware device connect to a server and stay connected to it indefinitely, waiting for the server to send data using server-sent events - so picture a while(true) loop, but I'm responsible myself for checking when new data comes in_

But I don't have a good sense of what it means to ""read data"" in an already open HTTP stream. As far as I'm aware, for this type of connection (which is similar as far as I understand to a chunked response), nothing is communicated to the server asking for more data for example, it's certainly not like an additional HTTP request is being made. I'm guessing ""read data"" just checks some sort of lower level buffer handled by the WiFi chip or some lower subsystem. I'm guessing if I chose to ""read data"" from an HTTP connection the server is none the wiser. 

That said, I also might 100% wrong, and perhaps (like other forms of communication) part of the underlying protocol is a message to the server that you've read data. This might not be important to the server, but perhaps it acts as a sort of heartbeat. 

My end goal here is to understand how often I should call ""read data"" in my code optimizing for quickly getting updates from the server but also not having any negative impact on the server or taking up needless CPU cycles by reading data every millisecond when once every 50ms would suffice for my needs. 

I'm hoping somebody in the web dev community who perhaps has more experience or a better understanding of lower level HTTP ""stuff"" might be able to understand the spirit of what I'm asking and help me understand.

1. **Purchased a Standard SSL** from GoDaddy.
2. Installed the certificate manually via **cPanel**.
3. I saw that my certificate is self-signed in cPanel.

1. **Am I missing something?** Should AutoSSL be available by default, or is it something that needs to be enabled by GoDaddy?
2. **How do I get AutoSSL working for my domain?** Do I need to enable it manually, or does GoDaddy handle that?
