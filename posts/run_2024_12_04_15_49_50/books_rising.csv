books,Literature of Lebanon: December 2024,"'ahlaan bik readers,

This is our monthly discussion of the literature of the world!  Every Wednesday, we'll post a new country or culture for you to recommend literature from, with the caveat that it must have been written by someone from that there (i.e. Shogun by James Clavell is a great book but wouldn't be included in Japanese literature). 

Today is [Eid il-Burbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_il-Burbara) and to celebrate we're discussing Lebanese literature!  Please use this thread to discuss your favorite Lebanese books and authors.      
                
If you'd like to read our previous discussions of the literature of the world please visit the [literature of the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/literatureof) section of our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/index).

books,How to approach TBR list and buying books,"I admit I'm very impulsive when it comes to books- when I see interesting series I buy everything or at least add it to my neverending TBR list.

The result is two bookcases of books and countless titles shipped to local hospital unopened because I felt overhelmed by the mess. I got complete paralysis when it comes to deciding what to read so often I just give up. I borrow piles of books that I have to return to library because I can't extend it endlessly.   
  
In new year I want to be more deliberate and actually curate my reading to get something reminding a steady reading streak. 



Any tips? Tricks?
