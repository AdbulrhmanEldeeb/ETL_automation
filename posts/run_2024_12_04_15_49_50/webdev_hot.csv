webdev,Looking for 8 developers who wanna expand their network,"Hey everyone,

We built a network/platform where professionals meet with fellows via scheduled video calls. We as a community believe that this is a better way as an initial contact than follows and direct messages.  
Our platform is **open for free, invite-only access**, currently.

How to Join?

Please share your LinkedIn or any other professional social media URL of yours via comment or pm (if you don't wanna reveal it publicly). I am going to drop an invitation code to you via dm.  
Feel free to ask your questions publicly in a comment below.

Whom is it best for?

It's perfect for entrepreneurs, indie hackers, developers, designers, social media marketers, and more. The common point of our community is an **entrepreneurial mindset** and **business focus**.

What would be the gain?

A strong network is our need as a member of the community. We need an audience for our products, clients for our services, and professionals to hire them or make them hire us. First-time meeting people in need would work much less than asking people already in our network that we build via more than just following each other or direct messages.

webdev,"How do server-sent event ""streams"" work on a lower level?","Hi, and sorry for the lack of a tl;dr; - I'm not sure how to get away from providing the context. Basically I'm interested in connecting to a web server and consuming [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) using a lower level HTTP API and am hoping somebody can explain how the push vs pull of these events might work at a lower level.

I'm working on a hardware project (ESP32-S3 / espressif ESP-IDF based) where I'm writing C with a bit of higher level abstraction to support HTTP interactions. For example, the methods I might call are:

* `esp_http_client_open()`: Open the HTTP connection with write_len parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set write_len=0 for read-only connection.
* `esp_http_client_fetch_headers()`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). 
* `esp_http_client_read()`: Read the HTTP stream
* `esp_http_client_close()`: Close the connection.

([more examples / docs are here if you're currious](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client.html#http-stream))

Now what I'm trying to figure out is what `esp_http_client_read()` actually is doing in terms of the server to client communication. When I connect to a server over HTTP, and assuming `keep-alive`, I can call `esp_http_client_read()` every millisecond, or I can wait 100 milliseconds and call it. Both ""work"" in that if there is no data being sent from the server, nothing will happen, and if there is data, I'll read it and be able to do something with it. _edit: for clarity because it may be non-obvious, my intention is to have my hardware device connect to a server and stay connected to it indefinitely, waiting for the server to send data using server-sent events - so picture a while(true) loop, but I'm responsible myself for checking when new data comes in_

But I don't have a good sense of what it means to ""read data"" in an already open HTTP stream. As far as I'm aware, for this type of connection (which is similar as far as I understand to a chunked response), nothing is communicated to the server asking for more data for example, it's certainly not like an additional HTTP request is being made. I'm guessing ""read data"" just checks some sort of lower level buffer handled by the WiFi chip or some lower subsystem. I'm guessing if I chose to ""read data"" from an HTTP connection the server is none the wiser. 

That said, I also might 100% wrong, and perhaps (like other forms of communication) part of the underlying protocol is a message to the server that you've read data. This might not be important to the server, but perhaps it acts as a sort of heartbeat. 

My end goal here is to understand how often I should call ""read data"" in my code optimizing for quickly getting updates from the server but also not having any negative impact on the server or taking up needless CPU cycles by reading data every millisecond when once every 50ms would suffice for my needs. 

I'm hoping somebody in the web dev community who perhaps has more experience or a better understanding of lower level HTTP ""stuff"" might be able to understand the spirit of what I'm asking and help me understand.

webdev,Best Practices for Synchronizing Supabase Auth and Local Database in a NestJS App,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I’m working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

webdev,Recommendations for User-Friendly Data Analytics Tools Compatible with Google Cloud SQL,"Hello everyone,I'm looking for recommendations on data analytics tools or online platforms that can support Google Cloud SQL. My primary requirement is that these tools should be user-friendly, as I have non-technical users who need to visualize and analyze data easily.

# Here are the specific requirements I have in mind:

1. **Support Writing Code**: I want to write code(SQL/other programming languages) to transform the data and then use it in data visualization
2. **Data Visualization**: It should allow the creation of interactive charts and graphs (like line graphs and bar charts) to represent the data effectively.
3. **Data Source Integration**: The tool must support connecting to Google Cloud SQL as a data source.
4. **Interactive Features**: Users should be able to filter data by date ranges or other dimensions and explore the data interactively.
5. **Calculation Features**: The ability to perform calculations (like daily volume or volume within specific periods) without requiring coding skills.

If you have any suggestions or experiences with tools that meet these criteria, I would greatly appreciate your input!",More-Ad-5258,1h6631p,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6631p/recommendations_for_userfriendly_data_analytics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6631p/recommendations_for_userfriendly_data_analytics/,2024-12-04 03:02:40,6,0.88,6,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6631p

webdev,Standard SSL to AutoSSL in cPanel?,"  
i decided to go with godaddy for webhosting (already regretting this after scrolling through this sub) and i got standard SSL and my website wont work (im getting the connection is not private message). I chatgpt'd it and its saying i need **AutoSSL**. I recently purchased a **Standard SSL certificate** from GoDaddy,  and i called the help desk and they told me to switch to **AutoSSL** because it automatically handles SSL installations and renewals, and I’d rather not manage SSL certificates manually.... 

Here's what I've done so far:

1. **Purchased a Standard SSL** from GoDaddy.
2. Installed the certificate manually via **cPanel**.
3. I saw that my certificate is self-signed in cPanel.

# What I want to do:

  
Make my website work.

I want **AutoSSL** to take over and automatically install and renew my SSL certificates. I’ve checked my cPanel, but I **don’t see an option for AutoSSL** anywhere in the **SSL/TLS Manager** or **SSL/TLS Status** sections. I also don’t see an option to **enable AutoSSL** in cPanel.

# Questions:

1. **Am I missing something?** Should AutoSSL be available by default, or is it something that needs to be enabled by GoDaddy?
2. **How do I get AutoSSL working for my domain?** Do I need to enable it manually, or does GoDaddy handle that?
3. **Is AutoSSL only available on specific hosting plans?** I'm on a basic hosting plan, so I’m wondering if AutoSSL is available for my plan.

If anyone has had similar issues with GoDaddy and cPanel, I’d really appreciate any advice on how to get AutoSSL up and running.

Thank you so much for the help. ",computer21,1h6324w,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6324w/standard_ssl_to_autossl_in_cpanel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6324w/standard_ssl_to_autossl_in_cpanel/,2024-12-04 00:35:05,4,0.84,4,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6324w

webdev,Genuinely do you need a JS framework?,"Genuinely do you need a JS framework?

I was just talking with some coworkers, and one of them brought up that they think the bell curve meme around the use of JS frameworks would be low IQ - use framework, mid IQ - just use base HTML CSS JS, high IQ - you must use a JS framework.

Personally I am of the opinion that JS frameworks have their place but for the vast majority of websites you don't need anything other than a templating language and vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

I've certainly written webapps that required the use a JS framework, but I would hardly call those websites they were more extremely complicated web apps that simply could not have been made without the use of a framework.

But that's the exception and 99% of all websites on the internet don't need anything more than HTML + a templating language for format, CSS for layout and prettiness, and JavaScript for interactivity (frankly HTML and CSS get you 90% of your interactivity), server requests, and content reactivity. There's a reason 80% of the internet is PHP, and why libraries like HTMX, and frameworks like Astro are becoming so popular - because they just get out of your way.

I sort of responded that for work and for personal projects I mainly build websites using no framework, and I asked why does he think that's the shape of the bell curve. But he didn't seem open to having a dialogue about it, and just kept responding ""it's just what it is"" with a really smug smile. And I didn't want to push it further / potentially start any conflict with a coworker so I dropped it.

I just feel like frameworks add so much complexity and overhead to development (unless your app truly absolutely needs it), that it's really unnecessary and creates so much work compared to using no framework and at the end of the day your user won't notice a difference. 

Runtimes, CSS modules, picking/learning a package, package specific JS, npm packages, typescript, webpack, docker, build tools, hosting... Homie this is a static page that fetches content on load and sends basic CRUD requests to the server, I could have it finished and hosted before you have your environment set up and project initiated. And mine will be functional with JS disabled and for users with 3G connections.

But I'm really curious, is the use a framework (JS or other) really the big brain move, and every website no matter what should use one.

webdev,How do you find problems to solve?,"A common phrase has been repeated to me whenever I ask the questions “how did you learn to do thing X” or “how did thing Y become successful”. That phrase is: *solve a problem*. 

I entered into a hackathon and my team and I tried to assist with a wide range of problems teachers and students face in classrooms. Our solution was deemed very broad during the elevator pitch and that we needed to focus on solving a specific problem. My team and I were very discouraged until we spoke to a teacher who gave us a specific problem they wish was fixed so we focused on that and we won the hackathon. 

Since then I’ve been trying to find a problem to fix but it isn’t easy. When I was struggling at my lowest during that hackathon the solution LITERALLY walked through the door and gave me the problem to solve. That doesn’t happen too often. 

So my question to you all is, how do you find your problems to solve?

recently I have been feeling pretty shit. I work at a big office corporation as a software engineer. Work is not that exciting. I am definitelly burning out and starting to hate sitting in front of a monitor in order to pay rent. 

So I've been trying to manage this feeling by doing something tactile after work, like knitting and fixing stuff around the house. One evening it dawned on me that I could get like another 'fallback' skill just in case I decide to ditch my developer career. 

I am looking for suggestions on what I could currently handle in my situation and what I could develop as a skill that could maybe one day be my fulltime gig. For contex - I'm male, living in eastern europe, mid twenties.   
  
The limitations are:

* it must be something I could get good at just by learning/practicing at home; 
* preferably not involving staring at a screen;
* is paid fairly well; 
* will not be redundant in 5-10 years; 
* doesn't cost a lot of financial investment immediately; 

So far I've considered, tufting custom rugs, working with silver jewelry, woodworking handyman (shelves, cutting boards ect), bathroom tiling, nail technitian, massagist and aromatherapy.

webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,129,0.81,129,0,180,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

I am trying to learn css by creating a general custom css that works for all website in the nord theme. I took the solarized-everything project and tried to add a generic nord theme for all site.

In some websites, e.g. reddit, this bit from the pictures for replies don't seem to get recolored.

Other things in reddit that doesn't get recolored is the markdown editor box for post. Home popular, explore tabs when they are highlighted etc. Others relatively blend in but the subsequent thread line for replies and hide replies area are very jarring to see.

How do I fix this?

\[SOLUTION\]

It was taking a global variable `--color-neutral-background`

However setting the variable in `:root` didn't work but setting it to `*` worked

\[[Here](https://github.com/jojowakaki/dots/blob/main/config/qutebrowser/solarized-everything-css/css/nord-dark-all-sites.css)\] is the css just in case somone is interested.

webdev,Monorepo architecture and scopes,"Monorepo architecture

Hi there! I’m using NX with Angular for a monorepo (but I don’t think this issue is specific to Angular nor NX) (4 projects, multiple libraries). As the repo is growing, the current library structure feels unsustainable, and responsibilities between modules are becoming unclear. Here's the current setup:

# Current Library Structure

1. `libs/features`
   * Each ""screen"" (micro-frontend) gets its own library.
   * **Problem:** Shared logic across screens creates overlapping responsibilities.
2. `libs/services`
   * Libraries aligned with backend microservices, split into subcategories:
      * **UI:** Frontend-specific logic/components for an ""entity"" such as order-card.
      * **Feature:** Core functionality (but sometimes imports across services, which feels wrong). Could be a smart search screen for orders, an oder dialog etc.
      * **Data-access:** Backend-specific data handling logic. Like order-rest/websockets
   * **Problem:** The ""feature"" sub-lib crosses boundaries and doesn’t align with service isolation. And it doesnt seem to make sense since its generally more defined by the wanted frontend functionality.
3. `libs/shared`
   * Shared functionality, including:
      * Config
      * Notifications handling
      * Shared UI components not tied to entities

# Questions

1. **UI Libraries**
   * Should all UI components be consolidated under `libs/shared/ui` and divided into sub-libraries/categories (e.g., `shared/ui/&lt;category&gt;`)?
2. **Backend vs. Frontend Domains**
   * Should backend-related libraries only include `data-access` and avoid mixing in UI or feature logic?
   * Should the frontend code be reorganized into ""frontend domains,"" where each domain encapsulates:
      * Shared business logic
      * Specific screens (which could eventually become micro-frontends)?

# Goals

* **Clear separation of concerns**
* **Sustainable structure as the repo grows**
* **Logical boundaries between backend services and frontend domains**

# How should I reorganize my libraries to achieve this?

  
Really grateful for any inputs or direction. Im feeling a bit lost at how to best structure this. I think the way to go is splitting things up more by front-end domains. But what sort of library types would be suitable, and which scopes and types should be limited from importing what?

webdev,Is This Login/Signup System Secure and Efficient? Looking for Feedback,"Hi, I’ve built a login/signup system for my website and would love your feedback. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sign-Up Flow**

* User fills out name, email, password (validated for strength) and completes hCaptcha.
* Frontend sends a POST request to /api/auth/register with user data and hCaptcha token.
* Server validates data, verifies hCaptcha, and creates a ""pending user"" with:
   * Hashed password, 6-digit OTP (valid 5 mins), and expiration (30 mins).
* OTP is emailed to the user for verification.
* On valid OTP, a user account is created, and the pending entry is removed.

**2. Sign-In Flow**

* User enters email/password.
* Server verifies credentials and creates a session via NextAuth.
* On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

**3. Additional Security**

* Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
* Failed logins tracked for account lockout.
* Background task clears expired pending users every 5 minutes.
* Password resets use the same OTP process as registration.

**4. Session Management**

* Handled by NextAuth with token storage in cookies.

**Questions:**

* Is this secure enough?
* Any improvements to the email verification or overall flow?
* Other tips for a better user experience or security?

webdev,Is it overkill to learn this tech stack for an MVP?,"I'm new to web dev, with a couple simple projects under my belt, but my next project is aiming to be more ambitious creating a social media / blogging platform.

I've done some research and the tech stack that seems to make most sense is:

Backend: Node.js (Express), Supabase (as includes auth)  
Frontend: React (+ React Query), Tailwind CSS  
Hosting: Railway (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), S3 (Images)

However I have no experience with React, Tailwind, Vercel or Supabase (just vanilla CSS + JS, HTML/EJS, PostrgreSQL, hosting on Railway)

So really I want some help understanding:

1. Over the next 3 months, am I likely to have saved more time by learning React + Tailwind + Supabase or is it better to stick with my vanilla stack if I'm aiming to maximise progress in 3 months?
2. If I were to create my MVP using my current ""vanilla"" stack and hire a software dev in 3 months, would there likely be lots of technical debt to overcome or would converting to the new stack be relatively easy?

React seems to be the really big one to learn, so I'm also considering just learning tailwind + supabase, and leaving React for later.

webdev,Can anyone explain how scrollbars  determine which element they get attached to? Mine is getting attached to the body for whatever reason and don't really understand it...,"I have encountered the worst problem in my web dev project. **SCROLLBARS**

Imagine implementing a *simple* chat system and you know nothing about websockets and broadcasting yet the **worst roadblock** is getting the scrollbar to go down in a react app.. I can get it to go down when I set `h-[some value]` but it won't go down otherwise...

So I throw in some `overflow` magic. Nah uh, the scrollbar ain't moving an inch.. I do all my scrollbar effecting witchcraft (looking at you **tailwind**) on the element that I think is managing the scrollbar. It did not move one inch. Then I change the potions, seems like `useEffect` ain't cutting it, so my truth sayer (**chat gpt**) recommended `useLayoutEffect`  and it still did not work. Then I go on a hunt for the element which the scroll bar is getting attached to.

Turns out it is getting attached to the body element. I was able to confirm this by adding overflow-hidden to the parent components one by one and it only worked on the body element!!

Now the realization hit me, I know nothing of scrollbars. I can't seem to find a resource to actually learn what it is relevant to my current **context**. I have spent hours on this problem and can't seem to figure it out.

EDIT: Did not add code because idk if it is allowed here

EDIT: Further context: In a chat app, the scrollbar should be at the bottom coz you want to see the latest message not the oldest.

A lot of news websites (paywalled or otherwise) still load the article content, sometimes hidden, in the HTML with JavaScript disabled. I've noticed lots don't. 

Is this because Google has gotten better at loading the articles when it crawls so gating it behind a paywall doesn't matter anymore for SEO?

webdev,Managing High-Volume Notifications with Digest (Batching) Strategies,"I'm implementing a notification system using [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) that needs to handle high message volumes without overwhelming users. 

I'd like to share my current approach and get feedback on potential improvements.

**Context:**

* Building a collaborative app with frequent updates (comments, file changes, tags)
* Using Novu as the notification infrastructure
* Need to prevent notification fatigue while ensuring important updates reach users
* Currently implementing in Node.js with PostgreSQL backend

**Current Implementation:** I've developed two digest strategies in Novu:

1. **Time-Window Digest / Batching:** 

&amp;#8203;

     // Using Novu to collect events in a 3-day digest window  
    const digestResult = await novu.digest(""digest-3-days"", {
      backoffUnit: 'days',
      backoffAmount: 3,
      digestKey: 'userId',
      events: notifications
    });  
    
    // Send digest via Novu
    await novu.trigger('digest-notification', {
      to: {
        subscriberId: userId,
      },
      payload: {
        events: digestResult.events,
        totalCount: digestResult.events.length
      }
    });

2. **Look-Back Pattern:**

    const shouldDigest = async (userId, eventType) =&gt; {
      const recentNotification = await novu.getNotificationHistory({
        subscriberId: userId,
        type: eventType
      });
      return Date.now() - recentNotification.timestamp &lt; ONE_DAY;
    };

Here is a visual representation I'm referring to - but with much smaller batching time window:

[Digest \/ Event Aggregation ](https://preview.redd.it/qozoe9akbf4e1.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301cfb85c68526175d084b86374fa8f3c29a3c21)

**Interesting Discovery -** [OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/journeys#time-window)**'s Time Window Approach:** While researching this, I found OneSignal's implementation of time windows interesting.   
  
They use a different approach where you can:

* Define specific allowed time periods (e.g., Tuesday 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST)
* Set intelligent delivery delays that randomly distribute notifications within allowed windows
* Handle out-of-window notifications by scheduling them for the next available window

For example, if you set a notification to trigger outside of Tuesday 1-6 PM PST, their system automatically schedules it for a random time within next Tuesday's window. This helps prevent notification clustering at window boundaries.

**Technical Challenges I'm Working Through:**

1. Race conditions when multiple events occur simultaneously
2. Handling failed notification deliveries within digest groups
3. Database schema optimization for efficient event aggregation
4. Coordinating time windows across multiple time zones
5. Implementing similar time-window functionality as OneSignal within Novu

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. What indexing strategies work best for quick digest compilation in Novu?
2. How do you handle digest delivery failures and retries?
3. Has anyone implemented custom time window logic similar to OneSignal's approach in Novu?
4. What's your approach to testing digest timing across different time zones?

If you've implemented similar systems with Novu or other notification services, I'd appreciate insights on handling these technical aspects efficiently.",Sudden_Profit_2840,1h4t9jv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,2024-12-02 11:53:39,37,0.97,37,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/S_ZmR_1cU5aKbwzfea80L7OQ7oKBdb43DuJDAxM8-xM.jpg,t3_1h4t9jv

webdev,Best WYSIWYG website editor with full website control? (Leaving Squarespace),"I’m migrating my photography website away from Squarespace because it’s too limiting. I can’t manage my web pages and other media files directly (no FTP or local mounting), making it impossible for me to automate webpage creation amongst other things. 

This makes managing the many photo galleries I have, and something as simple as linking full-res images to every photo a huge pain. The latter is not even possible on Squarespace—when you upload a 12 MP photo to a gallery, it gets downsampled to 1-2 MP and there's no way to view the original-resolution file. Nor can I link the original resolution file to that gallery preview. 

I need a platform where I can control the entire website structure (individual HTML pages and media), ideally with local file system access via FTP or similar. My goal is to use Python scripts to automate tasks like generating new galleries/web pages, uploading images, and linking previews inside a gallery to full-resolution files (Squarespace forcibly downsamples images and the full-res versions are inaccessible to the end user).

What platforms would you recommend for this level of customization? Note that I do prefer a WYSIWYG editor so that I'm not spending hours setting stuff up from scratch, but when I need to do more powerful things like change sections across all my photo galleries, I want the option for stuff like multi-file regex replacements across all my galleries' HTML files.

EDIT2: The endpoint can't be used to not render/disable the button since it would be too costly to check if each item in the crud can be deleted.  
It would be too costly because the crud can have hundreds of items AND the check if it can be deleted or not is depends on if that entity is related to other entities in the database.",Aydnir,1h4th1p,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4th1p/use_for_a_can_be_deleted_method/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4th1p/use_for_a_can_be_deleted_method/,2024-12-02 12:06:01,8,0.75,8,0,22,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4th1p

webdev,Would you use this app for resizing iOS/Android images instantly?,"Hi, fellow developers!  
I’m building a macOS app aimed at developers who need to generate images (like app icons or splash screens) in multiple sizes for iOS, Androud, Flutter etc.  
The app lets you drag and drop a single image and instantly get resized images in all the required formats and dimensions without hitting the web.

Features:

* Drag-and-drop simplicity.
* Automatic folder organization for iOS (`Assets.xcassets`) and Android (`drawable`).
* Customizable sizes for additional use cases.

Would you use this? What features would make this indispensable for your workflow?  
Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Yes I know you can export with Figma, use a bunch of line tools etc. But i would like something really simple.

webdev,"I can not gain traction, short shory","Hi, 

I just wanted to share my not-short but not-long journey. I have been doing freelancing on the side as a full-time developer for some time. I noticed that the competition is too high to get jobs on Upwork and make money. So, I slowly transitioned to indie hacker, solopreneur, entrepreneur, CEO, founder, or whatever you would like to call it because I wanted to scale. With the speed of AI, it is very easy to do small projects; with Vercel, it is very easy to deploy them. But that is it.

Building does not mean anything. If I were to build a website/app that does quantum calculations. It will remain as a hidden gem. It will be useless. Marketing is hard. It is much harder than software development. If I don’t stay active on social media and don’t comment on everything literally, everything. All the graphs goes to zero immediately. 

Like, I am not saying I built the quantum computer. That’s also the other thing. I am making these stupid projects. So that at some point  I would get the inspiration for the big thing, but that is also not happening. I don’t want to quit yet. But this is not just about just shipping it. It consumes more than a full-time job. It needs dedication, unfortunately, and most importantly, it needs luck.

webdev,I've created a sports competitions draw simulator,"Hey guys!

I'd like to introduce you to **DICEDRAW**, a web project that I've been developing with great pleasure recently. It's a website dedicated to **simulating draws for sports competitions**, currently focused on soccer. It already has draws for the Champions League, Europa League and, more recently, the new Club World Cup. The latter deserves a special mention because we're only a few days away from the official draw, and we can see how things might end up lining up.

The idea is that each draw respects the specific rules of each competition. In other words, nothing will be seen that goes against the rules of the entities. I've also included the new league stages of UEFA competitions, such as the Champions League, which has replaced the group stage.

If you have any suggestions or even ideas for other competitions you'd like to see there, let me know! I'm also accepting contributions to the project's repository, in case you want to get your hands on the code. And if you find it useful, leave a star there, it always gives you a boost of motivation.

I intend to continue evolving the project, and it would be great to have your feedback to make it even better!

Same goes for Microsoft copilot as well, and that one can generate unlimited images while chatgpt has a limit on free tier. And it's much better at image generation from what I've experienced so far. Response -wise, free tier chatgpt can still kick copilots ass though.

webdev,How would Google selling Chrome stop its monopoly?,"Might be off-topic to this sub, but I don't know what other sub would have redditors with enough knowledge about the web to answer this correctly.

My understanding is that Google has tried to maintain a monopoly over the search engine market by making other companies use Google as the main search engine for their browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).

If that's the case, what's the point of having Google sell Chrome, the browser? There are plenty of other browsers out there -- Google doesn't hold a monopoly over the browser market. Chromium is a thing, yes, but neither Firefox nor Safari is Chromium based, and Chromium is open source anyway. The problem here is the ubiquity of 'Google' the search engine, not Chrome the browser.

The issue seems to be with literally any other browser, even a separate instance of Brave on my laptop doesn't display the same. 

What I'm attempting to do is have a music player at the top of my screen that doesn't use the standard webkit or moz appearances--hence why I'm styling it with CSS. It looks great on my instance and is exactly what I want it to be, but it seems like every other instance is being replaced with ""user agent stylesheet"" because the ::webkit pseudo-elements aren't functioning properly. I will provide all the relevant code and screenshots if someone is willing to help out.

Here's what I've tried:  
\- Using a CSS reset  
\- Using a CSS normalize  
\- Using the !important tag to make sure it takes precedent  
\- Using specificity like body, html, and #musicplayer  
\- Overwriting the default stylings through developer tools  
\- Checked for overwritten lines using dev tools (which has shown very different results across browsers)

At first I was going to do the front end and she was going to to the back, but it just made way more sense for her to do full stack.  They did React on the frontend with an Express/JS backend.

Edit - I have a price in mind, but it’s negotiable for anyone doing me

Edit - here is the last post I made 8 months ago that attracted my previous developer:

So I thought myself front end development…


I’ve had this idea for a job board for forever.  But everyone was way too expensive to hire. So I started teaching myself coding at the middle of last year.   The journey had been up and down, but now I’m at a point where I’m comfortable with front end development.  The problem is, now I need to learn the back end, and I am very burnt out after spending all my nights and some weekends to get to where I’m at now.  So I’ve been looking at different options, here they are:

1. Pay $10,000 for someone to start my project and hopefully have a mvp by the end of it.  I have a better job now, so I can save the money in probably a few months
2. Continue to learn, whether it be self learning or taking a class.  Self learning is cool, but I have no one to ask questions to.  And taking a class would take far too long.  

Those both are a little far away for my liking.  So, I thought of a new idea today!  I thought about just hiring a backend developer.  I could build the front, which would save me lots of money, and someone could do the backend.  The only issue is, I have no idea on how to hire a backend developer.  Do I hire a company?  Do I try and get a freelancer?  If so from where?  I’ve looked at fivver and that option doesn’t work for me because I need someone I can have a conversation with and I don’t understand accents very well in learning environments.  Upwork seems promising, but I have my doubts.

webdev,Looking for better ways to use redirect domains to make my Github.io website more accessible and faster.,"Hi, I am having trouble getting my website to properly load through some redirect domains I'm trying to set up. Sometimes it takes about a minute to load, sometimes it gives an error page. I am using Namecheap domains, and this is what the redirect widget looks like:

The reason for the last one is a recurring problem where different browsers will add the ""https://"" automatically.

Is there an easy way to link an easy URL like ""bongable.cc"" to the Github.io address so that it loads faster and has less errors?

Also, I'm testing out the website on different browsers in their respective ""Private"" modes to avoid loading from the cache. Is this method of testing flawed? I might be tripping a little, but I foresee some customers quitting if the site doesn't load quick enough :/

Do I have to buy actual webhosting to get this to load correctly? All I'm really trying for right now is a simple site with a discord link and links to some documents that are also on Github.io.

webdev,Optimal Oauth flow?,"My web app has react frontend and java backend.
Will be using keycloak on the backend eventually.

Here's how the oauth flow would go: 
1. On the frontend user clicks authenticate which calls an auth endpoint on backend.

2. On the backend, a random state param is generated and what not. 
Then auth url is formed (with query params: state, clientId etc, and sent to auth provider for authentication code.
Redirection url is set as a backend endpoint.
The backend sends/redirects this url to the front end.

3. On the frontend the resource owner would be on the auth provider's auth page to either allow or decline the requested scopes.

4. Assuming the resource owner accepts, the auth code would be sent as query params with the backend redirect url. 

5. The backend endpoint verifies state param, auth code and obtains an auth token. Stores the auth token in db.

At this point, what does the frontend do to check if step 5 has been successfully executed since at step 4, the redirect url calls the backend endpoint and not the frontend endpoint.

webdev,Authentication with jwt,"Im learning about authentication with jwt on a nest backend and next front end.

Im a bit confused though and looking for guidance:

Example will be user logging in

1). User inputs credentials and submits post req to backend

3). Backend sends token to frontend via response 
4). Front end stores token in cookies for authenticating with backend for future requests / private route access
5).  Front end decodes jwt for user ID at what point and why???

I've also read you shouldn't pass username and info through jwt because it's a security risk, but I also read so is passing it through the response object.... So how exactly does one securely move user data from DB to frontend without exposing it unnecessarily???

webdev,When does automation stop in web development?,"Lately, I’ve been using some tools that automate work and processes, and it got me thinking about where we’re headed.   
  
On the surface, it’s amazing—tech keeps getting smarter, and makes us faster.  
  
But there’s a weird tension between “streamlining everything” and creating systems that make us *more* dependent on them.

For example, I stumbled on this [site](https://www.polipo.io/) that promises to make creating web apps super fast. It’s efficient, sure, but at what point are we automating creativity itself? Are we making people obsolete, or are we just pushing the limits of efficiency?

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

* Where should the line be between what we automate and what we keep human?

Few days ago I had a talk with my dad; He asked me what happens with all the things I host once I am gone.

It's not a stupid question at all, I am young but anything can happen whether it's an accident or illness. I host several websites, a big app for a few companies and few other things which add up to a pretty big set. I have a VPS, and all the code is on my private github account. 

How do you folks make sure that everything can keep going smoothly if something were to happen to you?

Recently I found out that there are Procfile and overmind, which allow to conveniently run several services at once with one command without virtualization. But logs are shown in a single console and it is not convenient to see what is going on (my application has a large business logic and a lot of communication back and forth, so a lot of logs).

Combining [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) (Procfile launcher) and [logdy](https://logdy.dev/) (logs viewer from pipe to browser) can be working

`wp acorn bonsai:init`

`wp acorn bonsai:generate bonsai`

webdev,How I solved common Prisma ORM errors,"I have been using Prisma ORM for the last 2 years, and I have experience with troubleshooting different types of error.

In this post, I want to share it with you, so you don’t have to spend hours figuring out what I’ve already learned.

**Why Prisma?**

I have been using Prisma to interact with the database for all my SaaS products. So far, I’ve built six SaaS products, and I hope to build more in the future (some of them are [BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app), [Wuf](https://usewuf.com), [Userdesk](https://userdesk.io), [Inboxs](https://inboxs.io), [Hivoe](https://hivoe.com)).

I've used Prisma in Next.js web apps, node.js servers, and cron jobs.

The key goals of using Prisma are:

* keep under control your database schema
   * define tables and types
   * apply migrations
   * query your database with type safety
   * avoid typing errors
* protect from SQL injection
* leverage pooling

**Common issues**

Despite being a stable product, sometimes you can encounter some issues.

Below I describe two common errors:

* migration errors
* query errors

Let’s start with the first one.

**Error with data migrations**

Sometimes your migrations emit an error, that’s not very simple to debug, like this one.

    Error: ERROR: prepared statement ""s2"" does not exist

You usually get this error when you run `npx prisma db push` (apply your schema changes to the database) or `npx prisma generate` (generate the types from your schema).

But what does this mean?

This error happens when using a relational database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (one of the most popular, and advanced open-source SQL databases on the market).

Specifically, a prepared statement in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows you to execute a query plan that is prepared and stored by the database server for reuse. It improves performance and security, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values.

Prisma ORM leverages the prepared statements as part of its database query execution process, under the hood (but you don’t have to know or master prepared statements to use Prisma).

The main issues arise with the confusion between the different database connections string configurations, pooling and PgBouncer.

Let me go straight to the solution, then I explain you the different parts.

The main solution I’ve found is to use two connection strings, one to run the migrations and the second for the execution of your web application / node.js server.

First, identify the correct connection strings for your database.

The connection string to run the migrations is the direct access to the database (no pooling or PgBouncer), like for instance

    postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

Save this connection string as an environment variable called `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.

    DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=""postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

Secondly, get the connection string with the pool, for instance:

    postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName

Get this connection string from your database hosting provider, the parameters might be different.

Save this connection string as an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL`.

    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

The second step is to update the Prisma configuration to use these two environment variables.

Open the file `schema.prisma` and update the section `datasource db` to include this:

    datasource db {
      provider  = ""postgresql""
      url       = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
      directUrl = env(""DATABASE_DIRECT_URL"")
    }

Now, run the usual commands like `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate` locally to ensure that everything is working correctly, and run your application locally.

If all is good, push the modifications to your hosting service and trigger a new deployment for the modifications to take effect.

Prisma is now correctly configured and you should not have the same issue again.

**Query performance issues**

Recently, I got the ""stack depth limit exceeded"" error message.

    PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid `prisma.table.findMany()` invocation: Error occurred during query execution: ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: ""54001"", message: ""stack depth limit exceeded"", severity: ""ERROR"", detail: None, column: None, hint: Some(""Increase the configuration parameter \""max_stack_depth\"" (currently 2048kB), after ensuring the platform's stack depth limit is adequate."") }), transient: false })

This means that the usage of memory exceeds the database configuration for a specific query.

I ran this SQL command on my database and found this value:

    SHOW max_stack_depth;
    ---
    2MB

I had a query that was returning 1900+ records to aggregate some values.

For each record I have to recalculate the sum of certain values.

When this happens you have two options:

* increase the `max_stack_depth` value in your database
* refactor the logic in the code to avoid to run that big query
* optimize the query

I tried to increase `max_stack_depth` because it was the quickest solution (not the best one), but my database is hosted on DigitalOcean and I didn’t have the permissions to run the `ALTER` command:

    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_stack_depth = '4MB';
    ---
    permission denied to set parameter ""max_stack_depth""

(I contacted DigitalOcean via a support ticket and they promptly provided a solution, I can alter the value using their web API).

Then, I started to analyze the problem.

The first thing I tried was to run the same query as plain SQL against the database using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and it perfectly worked.

This was suspicious, it means that probably Prisma was executing a query too complex and expensive.

Then, I refactored the code, using the Prisma method `$queryRaw` to run the same query, and it worked!

At this point, I didn’t want to manually define all the type for the values returned by the query, and I thought of using a new cool feature of Prisma called [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

This way I can run a Raw Query against the database with the types automatically generated by Prisma for me.

So, in the end, I refactored to code, and avoided to increase the value `max_stack_depth` that would have increased the memory consumption in general.

**Conclusion**

I hope that this post was useful, and it avoids you from spending hours on troubleshooting these kind of errors with Prisma.

Overall my experience with the tool has been very good and exciting, and I see how they are releasing new versions, features, and improvements.

You can find the [documentation of Prisma at this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs).

As a side note, I’m not affiliated with Prisma in any way, I’m just a happy user of the product.

   2. A list for roughly the first 200 words measured from the start of the first h1
   3. A list for all elements after the start of the first h1
5. I then return a dictionary to my keyword scraper which has all of the lists above plus the title, url and meta description

Then I run my langauge processing which is a combo of SciKit learn and SpaCy.

I have three methods currently working to extract keywords:

* TF-IDF -&gt; TfidfVectorizer from sklearn
* Noun-Phrase extraction -&gt; I'll post my matcher below but this is a custom pipeline for spaCy
* Named entity extraction -&gt; spaCy as well, super basic just collecting important types of named entities like person, product etc...

Here is my matcher:

    patterns = [
                # Optional Adverb(s) + Adjective(s) + Noun(s)
                [{'POS': 'ADV', 'OP': '*'},
                 {'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '+'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
               
                # Nouns joined by coordinating conjunction
                [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'},
                 {'POS': 'CCONJ'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
               
                # Gerund + Noun
                [{'POS': 'VERB', 'TAG': 'VBG'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
               
                # Noun + Preposition + Optional Adjective + Noun
                [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}},
                 {'POS': 'ADP'},
                 {'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '*'},
                 {'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
                #  Noun + Hyphen + Verb/Noun
                [{""POS"": ""NOUN""},
                 {""TEXT"": ""-""},
                 {""POS"": {""IN"": [""NOUN"", ""VERB""]}}]
     ]

This collects a decent amount of keywords but I feel like it could be improved. Has anyone else approached this problem and has any advice on new methods I can try I'd love to hear about.

webdev,PSA: You are good enough !,"I am not sure why I felt compelled to write this post.

Perhaps it is the long unemployment stint I have been on and the rough interview loops I've been enduring or maybe I just needed the cathartic release.

Either way, I want to take those who are interested down memory lane with me and reflect on a past experience of mine that helps me through tough times like these.

It all started many years ago when I worked at a company with another developer. Lets call him Robert. Robert was by no means a super star developer but he was an amazingly nice person and was a pleasure to work with.

However, he did not show qualities I would expect of a top developer.  No great understanding of CS. Not an algorithmic god. Minimal knowledge of craftmanship aspects in software. No extensive knowledge of building systems. He was just an everyday developer.

One day Robert gets called by a FANG adjacent recruiter telling him that a team is interested in hiring him.

What was different about this situation was the recruiter did not send him through the front door.  His interview loop consisted of 3 calls. 1 recruiter screen, 1 call with the hiring manager, 1 call with the wider team.

He did not have to endure a single technical round (I don't want to go into the circumstances of why as I don't want to dox myself)

He of course takes this offer and starts a month later. I was very happy for him and wished him the best and that was that.

Fast forward to today. I am sitting here going through the trenches. 6 round loops. OA, code, system design, behavioural. The whole sh\*t fest.

Occasionally, the doubts creep in. Am I good enough ? should I throw in the towel and go into the #trades ? is my experience worthless ?

Then I always think back to our boy Robert.

Roberts rare and unique story showed me that a vast number of developers can likely excel in any position given the chance (even big tech).

I just wanted to say that you are good enough.

The interview practices we endure are nothing more than a filter to whittle down the demand.

When you fail an interview you are doing just that, failing a filter. It has no bearing on you, your ability, or your identity. Like Robert, if you could jump past all the interview mess you would be just fine (As an aside, I believe that Robert would likely not have made it through the traditional interview loop for the same position.)

Anyways, I hope you liked my story and wish you all the best if you are going through it also.

Lastly, I realise this post comes across bitter and jealous. It is not my intention (although perhaps I am a little). I am just a beaten-down dev struggling through it. I wish Robert the best and hope he is happy and killing it.",Invisible_Wetface,1h3deuo,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,2024-11-30 14:13:55,50,0.79,50,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3deuo
webdev,I want to publish an Azure function from a Monorepo,"I am a long term Azure functions user and I have properly created, published, and maintained infrastructure that relied on Azure functions. My process is usually very similar.

I scaffold a basic Azure function (version 4, typescript, http trigger) from the Visual Studio Code Azure extension, I modify the default function with my code, build it with npm run build which is just a tsc command, run it with func start, test it by hitting the API with Postman, and then it's time to publish it to my Azure dashboard on my Azure account.

To publish this correctly functioning Azure function, I run a command like this that actually creates the function instance `az functionapp create --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --consumption-plan-location LOCATION_CODE --runtime node --name FUNCTION_AZURE_NAME --storage-account STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --os-type Linux` , then I run something like `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the root directory of the function repo to actually push up the function to my Azure account.

I recently decided that it would be more convenient to start putting all of my Azure functions into 1 monorepo. It was getting hard to keep track of all of the Github repos of single purpose Azure functions. I used NX to make this monorepo.

I found this project [https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure](https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure) , which allows you to scaffold Azure functions into an NX repo. I ran `npx create-nx-workspace@latest` to create the repo and followed the prompts to make a blank repo.

I made the Azure function in question with these commands:

    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:init FUNCTION_DIRECTORY
    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:new FUNCTION_NAME --project=FUNCTION_DIRECTORY --template=""HTTP trigger""

The function works great locally and I'm able to run it just fine with the NX supplied build and run commands. I can hit the APIs locally with Postman, just like when I scaffolded the functions with the Visual Studio Code extension. The problem is that when it comes time to publish the function to my Azure account, the NX supplied publish command does nothing. It doesn't even error, it succeeds with 0 functions uploaded to Azure.

My best theory on why this is happening lies in the build output structure for @ nxazure/func as opposed to the build structure of the Visual Studio Code extension. The Visual Studio Code build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    └───src
        │   index.js
        │   index.js.map
        │
        └───functions
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

But the @ nxazure/func build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\packages\MYFUNCTIONDIRECTORYNAME\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    │   tsconfig.base.json
    │   
    └───packages
        └───bTSOrdAddrsCreate
            │   _registerPaths.js
            │   _registerPaths.js.map        
            │   
            └───src
                └───functions
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js    
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

With the `func` command, you only need to run `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the same directory as the dist folder and the function will be automatically uploaded to your Azure dashboard/account. Maybe that command expects the `dist` folder to have an `index.js` file within the first level of the folder? I'm not quite sure what the publish command is actually doing under the hood.

In short, how do I successfully execute a publish command for a function build in an NX monorepo that was scaffolded with @ nxazure/func? If there is no way to do it via a simple command from the parent directory of the function or at the root of the monorepo, is there a roundabout way to compile the function to a zip and use some command to upload that to my Azure account/dashboard?",warpanomaly,1h3y2eb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,2024-12-01 07:31:58,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3y2eb

webdev,"Tried building a critical and complex home page using several AI autocomplete tools, and here are my findings","( i am hoping, this is useful for this group, and if its not , i am happy to take it down )

I used BlackBox AI, V0, and Claude simultaneously. I have paid subscriptions for V0, Claude, and ChatGPT, while BlackBox seems to use ChatGPT by default without linking it to my chat gpt account.

**Winner:** For me, Claude was the clear winner, though it’s missing a few features compared to the others.

**What I learned about time savings:** I’m not great at creative coding from scratch, so using these tools made things much easier. It would have taken me 3 workdays to achieve what I did in a 4-hour session split between the tools. Although AI-generated code still needs review—I wouldn't fully trust it—making things responsive using AI saved significant time compared to if I had written everything manually or cleaned up an HTML template. Going forward, I think I can be 3x more productive with Claude, especially now that it understands my project context.

**BlackBox AI:** The main reason to explore BlackBox AI was its VS Code integration, which the others don’t offer. I started generating code on the website, then moved to the VS Code extension. Unfortunately, even with the extension, the improvement process was slow, and ultimately it delivered about 1/10th of the results of Claude or V0.

**Advantages:** Easy code export, since everything’s already local.

**V0:** V0 feels like me—it gets overwhelmed and forgets past discussions. Fixing a bug at one step only to see it return after another adjustment was a common frustration. The interface is clean, and the ability to resize the screen was useful for comparing mobile vs. desktop views. However, some persistent issues included:

* Compilation errors were frequent, though reporting them usually led to fixes. Ideally, it should self-correct.
* Filters would sometimes render incorrectly after a few more feature additions.
* Exporting code is made unnecessarily difficult. It’s not much better in Claude, but with V0 it seems intentional.
* Deployment is easy but seems intended to lock users into the V0 ecosystem, which becomes problematic when scaling to 100-200 files, no more easy way to export except 1 file at a time.

**Claude:** Claude’s UI is cleaner, and it understands my requests better, making adjustments seamless. There were no compilation errors, and changes were stable. The output was visually clearer, and I'm starting to trust the quality of the changes it makes. Although export isn’t straightforward.

Overall, Claude’s consistency and quality make it my preferred tool. It’s stable, efficient, and I think I can use it to be significantly more productive moving forward.",HurryFormal7067,1h3webg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,2024-12-01 05:41:26,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3webg

webdev,Advice needed: Looking for a Freelancer to Build an AI-Powered LL.M.-Matching Website – What Should I Look For?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently planning a website that helps users find the perfect matching offer on my site. The idea is to provide general information on the landing page, and then users can input their preferences via an AI chatbot (the best example i can find is Fiverr Neo). Based on their answers, the bot will suggest matching offers from a database. The rest of the site will offer detailed information about the individual offers.

I've already set up a WordPress site on google cloud and have a rough idea of how this could work technically. Now, I’m looking to hire a freelancer to bring this project to life. Before I proceed, I need some advice as i have never worked with freelancer before.

What should I look for in a freelancer?

What skills should they have? (e.g., WordPress, Dialogflow/OpenAI API, database integration, UX/UI design)

Are there specific certifications or portfolios I should check?

Should I hire someone specialized in AI, or will a skilled web developer suffice?



Budget and Timeline:

What’s a realistic budget for a project like this?

How long would it typically take to build, assuming the requirements are clear?



# Communication and Collaboration:

How can I ensure the freelancer understands my vision?

Should I prepare a detailed question catalog and database structure beforehand, or can they help me with that?



Technology and Maintenance:

What should I set up technically to ensure the site is easy to maintain in the long run?

Should I plan for ongoing collaboration with the freelancer for updates and maintenance?

How to stay safe and handle rules or password? 

I plan to run the project on WordPress , hosted on google cloud and integrate the AI chatbot (Dialogflow or OpenAI API), but I’m open to better alternatives if suggested.

If anyone has experience working with freelancers for projects like this or can provide tips on how to approach it, I’d be super grateful",srin4,1h42755,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h42755/advice_needed_looking_for_a_freelancer_to_build/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h42755/advice_needed_looking_for_a_freelancer_to_build/,2024-12-01 12:25:59,0,0.14,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h42755

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I made a simple blindfold chess app,"Hi everyone, I'd like to share a side project I've been working on: [Blindfold Chess](http://playblindfoldchess.com).

**What is this app?**

It's a chess app that doesn't have a board! Play chess against the AI (driven by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)), but you must visualize the board in your head. The app provides menu-like inputs to select what pieces to move and where to move them, but it doesn't give any hints as to where the pieces are or what moves they can make. When the game's over, you can copy the moves to the clipboard and open them in an app that lets you visualize chess games.

**Why I made this app**

I learned how to play chess as a child, but I only started actually playing about two years ago. I studied a few openings back then and read two introductory books, but I've mainly just been playing casually. After a few months of playing, I challenged chat gpt to play a game of chess, and instead of showing a chessboard, it just said ""e4"". That was my first introduction to blindfold chess, and I found it highly challenging but not impossible to visualize the board, so I was interested in improving that skill. Unfortunately, chat gpt wasn't able to play coherent games and would inevitably begin making illegal moves as a game progresses.

I made my own chess AI a while back after and used that to play blindfold chess, but I've abandoned that project. Recently, after about a year or so since that last project, I began this. I'm a bit out of practice at the moment, but I expect that I'll improve over time so long as I play a game every day or so.

Surprisingly, I haven't found any apps that do what this does: provide a simple interface for playing blindfold chess. It's certainly niche, but I don't think it's so niche to the point that nobody would have made this simply for that reason. In any case, I'm curious to see if it actually gains adoption, or if I'm the only one who will actually use this on a regular basis.

**Future plans**

First and foremost, once the app has matured a bit, I'm going to make an Android app, then work to make an Android smartwatch app. I've done some preliminary performance tests and have determined that, if nothing else, a Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartwatch can handle the game in easy mode without taking too long to make moves.

After I improve my ability to play blindfold chess, I'd like to write up an article or two that discusses tactics and strategies to help you visualize the board. If there's interest, I might add a feature to play another human locally (i.e., you'd pass them the phone and they'd input their move). Technically, if two people are playing blindfold chess, they wouldn't need the phone at all, but if they disagree about where certain pieces are, the phone would provide an answer to that. I don't think I'll implement a capability to play online because of how easy it would be to cheat, but if people actually play on this app and request it, I'd consider adding it.

I'd also like to add a feature to speak moves and have the system recognize and execute them, but that's a lower priority.",brandon-quinn-author,1h3e04o,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,2024-11-30 14:44:15,3,0.8,3,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1h3e04o

webdev,Not another Slack Git integration,"While there are plenty of Slack-GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab integrations out there, many miss one important aspect.

They act as notification channels (like emails)—which is helpful for many teams—but they still leave a lot for teams to figure out themselves, such as fair code review distribution, back-and-forth communication (like I left new comments - I replied to your comments) and reminders.

This is what ReviewNudgeBot offers on top of very convenient and noise-free notifications:

* **Reminders for reviewers blocking PR progress**: When a PR is left without a review, reviewers’ comments are replied to, or a new commit is pushed to the PR, reviewers are reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Reminders for authors blocking PR progress**: When reviewers request changes, new comments are added to a PR, or a build fails, the author is reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Auto-assign reviewer**: After a few team reminders to review a PR, the bot selects specific reviewers and reminds them to review the PR. This helps resolve the bystander effect.
* **Escalate notification**: The bot can be configured to notify a manager if a PR sits for too long without reviews.

webdev,New company has clients point by nameserver instead of A record? There has to be a better way.,"Hey everyone, I recently started working at a website development company and ran into something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Here’s the situation:

When we build a website for a client, we ask them to point their domain to our **nameservers** so the website can go live. This means we end up managing their entire DNS, even though we’re just the website provider. It's an extra burden, especially when clients request changes for things like email or subdomains.

I asked why we don’t just have clients point their domain to our server using an **A record**, and here’s the explanation I got:

“If we ever need to change our server’s IP address (which has happened a couple of times), all clients would need to update their A record to the new IP. That’s impractical with thousands of clients. Nameservers avoid this issue because we can make IP changes behind the scenes without involving the client.”

Okay, that makes sense, but using nameservers feels inefficient for so many other reasons... I feel like there has to be a better way to solve this problem without the extra workload.

I’d love to hear your thoughts considering my role at the company isn't as technical but this workflow is hugely affecting my output and I want to offer them a better solution. What’s the most practical way to minimize client disruption while reducing our DNS management responsibilities?",ZeusBabylonski,1h2oz0r,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2oz0r/new_company_has_clients_point_by_nameserver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2oz0r/new_company_has_clients_point_by_nameserver/,2024-11-29 16:02:56,27,0.8,27,0,33,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2oz0r

I create a platform slatesource.com which allows users to create web pages easily by using modules.

webdev,New technology in prod fears,"I'm wondering if anyone else has fears of trying new tech in prod. I'm not just talking about trying out a new library. I'm talking about standing up stuff that you've never really used in prod before.

I feel like I can play around with new tech locally but I always fear that there must be some prod specific stuff that I'm missing. Extra load revealing issues, incorrect assumptions made, config stuff that I'm expected to know but don't, etc. I tend to use stuff I'm familiar with just because there are some bugs that have been really hard to figure out. Managers have asked before *how* a bug could ***possibly*** be introduced, and the thought of saying, ""eh, this is just my first time using it and I'm learning"" sounds like a good way to get on someone's shitty developer list. Most managers that I've had seem to think that any bug is just completely unacceptable, so the thought of admitting to incompetence or ignorance seems like out of the question.

Do most of you just stick with shit you know, or do you take the plunge if you think something might be better? Or go with something new that might work just as well but also save some paint points from existing tech? I'm not talking about going with new stuff just because it's new.

  
**Example**

I used to work at a place with multiple applications. I was talking to someone on another team in the enterprise one day about their architecture. This team literally didn't use a load balancer to load balance between different servers. They literally made separate URLs for the internal team to use. If one server went down, they would launch up the other and tell the internal customers to go the other URL. Load balancing is SO basic and it used to strike me as extremely weird that they wouldn't just add that in. I can imagine that it might be really scary for them though because of how critical the app was, and you could really screw up production if you messed up your session management setup. You might set up the load balancer and show that you're hitting the servers and that the website is working well, and then totally not do anything about session management. It hits production and then it's a disaster! Ok - you see errors and then you just shut down the other servers and you're pretty much back where you started. Not the end of the world but hopefully you see my point.",wannacommissionameme,1h35jrd,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,2024-11-30 05:28:34,2,0.58,2,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h35jrd

webdev,Common data fetching in a layout and a page in ReactJS,"I have been thinking about data fetching of front end. Suppose you have

\- Layout: it resource A to render a sidebar

\- Page: it is in the layout. It needs resource A and B

Resource is stored globally in an app (with whatever, Redux or Context). Resource A may be fetched again on a user event like when \`userId\` changes.  
Page A should not know what layout fetches, vice versa. They should care only data they need.

How is it possible to fetch resource A only once?

If you put this \`useEffect\` in a layout and a page, it fetches when \`userId\` changes. A problem is that they may race in a layout and a page. They may run simultaneously.

\`\`\`  
useEffect(() =&gt; {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}, \[dispatch, userId\]);

\`\`\`

Putting another \`useEffect \` does not seem to solve a problem. You will not know when \`useEffect\` runs, no matter it is in a layout or in a page. If only a page waits until layout finishes loading, it would work, but it does not.

\`\`\`

useEffect(() =&gt; {

if (resourceAStatus === 'idle') {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}

}, \[dispatch, resourceAStatus \]);

\`\`\`

One simple way is ""Fetch data in layout, not in page at all"", but it is not a good practice. You should fetch data when you need it.

Does anyone know a good data fetching design?

**Repost Story:**

Back in 2017, I was fresh out of highschool, not a dollar to my name. I had just signed up for the first semester of college as a CS student when disaster struck my family. Mom and dad both lost their jobs and became deathly sick to the point that they were unable to work. As a result, we became homeless and had to move in with some family friends.

I was working at a barista at Dunkin Doughnuts at the time, my day would consist of waking up at unglodly hours of the morning to catch the bus before the sun came up for my morning shift. After work I would study coding online and work on my college classes. 

One day I came home and got the call that my mom had been admitted to the hospital because she was minutes away from having a stroke and her lungs were filled with blood clots. I knew it was either make money or bust, so I started applying to hundreds of coding jobs while studying on sites like pluralsight to prepare. After hundreds of submissions, I finally got a callback for an interview.

I was nervous, stumbling my words, After an hour of coding, I got it to work. I went home, and recieved a callback the next day with an offer for the job.

There I was, a 19 year old homeless broke kid who had just landed his first real job in tech.

Since them I've mannaged to work for some big name companies like Hulu+, Disney, and Warner bros and launched a successful software business, I dropped out of college when I got the first job offer as a sophmore in college. I don't have a degree, or any special certifications, parents didn't give me any money.

I found that when I talk with people about my story in person they are very interested, so I figured I'd post online to see if my expereince can help anyone else learn from it so ask away.

webdev,Is it fine to find your own way of a ‘workaround’?,"Hey guys,

I am currently developing a next js website where it has some forms using shadcn/ui

So one of the form fields has countries list, which are over 170 elements in an array. While creating them with shadcn combobox or select, the website lags for a second because of the number of the html elements loaded for each country, but doesn’t lag on normal &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;, however I need to have custom styling for it.

I did some research and came across something called virtualization with tanstack or react-window, but applying them threw many errors and it was just a headache

So what I did is, stored the array in a state with a slice(0,10) and once opened, I set the state to fill all of the countries.

Now this method works well, the combobox doesn’t lag, and everything is smooth, but is this fine to do?

I mean definitely there are better practices than what I did, but is this fine to continue with or should I reconsider my approach?

webdev,Trying to break out of the field while simultaneously unemployed. Advise?,"I am a senior web dev (NodeJS, RoR) that has recently lost their job unexpectedly for the first time in forever. I live in the EU, in a country that does not have a lot of jobs, and what little can be found has a lot of competition, is underpaid, and you get worked to the bone. Up until this point I was working fully remote for other EU companies and was starting to make a decent living as an EM. When I lost my job I tried to keep that momentum going, but long story short, it's quite difficult and there is higher need for developers than there is for other roles.

I used my unemployment time to pick up Python which turned out great, successfully acing two different coding challenges and reaching the next stage in the pipeline. However, it seems that growing into Python further would involve delving into pretty specific and uninteresting libraries (django, or numpy or pandas).

Context over, now to the matter at hand. I am quite tired of web dev. It's why I ventured into Python in the first place. With time on my hands, I have it in me to pick up another language. To spare you the details, I believe these are the two avenues that might make sense:

\- Refresh in-demand, web only languages. This obviously snuffs out what little soul I have left. Refresh PHP. Or refresh NodeJS/TypeScript. Much better than PHP, but still quite boring. There are a lot of PHP, NodeJS, RoR jobs, but there are also a lot of candidates.

\- Try my hand at C#. Interesting, can think of very enticing projects! I am confident I could pick it up. Potentially moves me away from web dev. But my CV has no single a single speck of C#, so I would not be looked as a solid candidate.

webdev,Issue with vertically centered content shifting on wrap,"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm stuck and was hoping someone could help. Essentially, I have a splash/landing page with a logo. The logo is an SVG, it's vertically and horizontally centered. That all works great.

I have a little JavaScript that types in a byline type description under it. It's short. But on mobile screens, it wraps to the next line, which is fine. Only issue is that when it wraps, the element (H1) then shifts the logo above it upwards so the image, and now two lines of text are all vertically centered.

I'd like the text to just go downwards when wrapping without pushing the group of the content upwards.

Here's what I have currently. We're using Bootstrap 5.

Edit: I can see that putting the JS inside the section groups it with the logo to be centered, but we've tried it outside as well and same.

    &lt;section id=""landing"" class=""landing bg-light d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center vh-100""&gt;
            &lt;img class=""landing-logo"" src=""/images/logo.png"" alt=""Editing logo with ink pot and feather quill""&gt;
            &lt;h1 id=""typing-text"" class=""typing-text text-primary text-center pt-6 px-5 fw-light""&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;

The CSS:

    .landing .landing-logo {
      width: clamp(300px, 50%, 916px);
    }
    
    .typing-text {
      font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 2.5vw, 2.5rem);
    }
    
    .typing-content {
      margin-top: auto;
      padding: 1rem;
      text-align: center;
    }

The JS:

So, when releasing into Prod, you have to pick a Dev PR that was approved by QA... but then that build still could have items unapproved in it.

It was setup before I came. So whatever the reason, it's lost in time.

webdev,CMS or VPS,"Hello everyone! 

2 years ago I made a small website for a charity, they told me it would need to be a static site which would \*not\* change over time. Well, so far there's been plenty of changes which also contain temporary changes (like an event).

Currently I have written a custom, ugly and bad static site generator, but it works in this case. The demand for changes has grown (still not a lot), and there's a request to move some of those responsibilities towards them, so they can maintain some of the content.

So far I've been looking into some CMS systems, and I haven't found a single one that I like. None of them offer the structure that I need/want for something small, or come off as having a snake in the grass on the free tier.

I've looked into Supabase as well, which I think I'd like, but it pauses your project quite fast, and freezes it after 90 days of inactivity. This doesn't suit me at all since it'll probably only be around 2-3 times a year they'll need to update their content. So the project would become frozen every time on the free tier.

I've also looked into Firebase, which looks like something I'd like to learn, but it doesn't offer image hosting on the free tier. And the Blaze plan looks good on paper, but I'm really afraid of having bots/abuse ramp up the requests/usage costs.

I've also looked at (not in detail yet) VPS. This is something that I'd love to learn, since I'll get full control over everything. My main issue with most systems is the control being limited. The main drawback here is, I'm terrified of unauthorized access, leaks, hidden costs, file uploads being abused and wrecking havoc... basically, a LOT of variables I'm not familiar with that could go wrong, I think... is a VPS really a safe option? What are some decent (and okay-ishly priced) VPS options?

Digital ocean seems like an easy and straight forward option, but charging 15$/month for the db/cache container seems a bit steep.

   * Spring Boot
   * Postgres
   * Mongo
* Frontend:
   * React

I'm not going to start AI will make us homeless stuff, but the way is front end viewed is the problem.

I think it is a nail in the coffin for this field. imagine this. so, we have backend colleagues. they are getting paid more than us and more important than that, they have PRESTIGE. 

even if they write a simple SELECT query, the employer and others think that it is a rocket science or something, but for a front end developers... "" it is just a simple button bro "". 

it almost took me 2 months to optimize the prescription section of our medical web app. we've had heavy lists and extremely dynamic forms and technical challenges.. but we've done something extremely good. 

and now after 2 months the only thing I heard from my boss was "" this was the least you can do, it is just a simple button "" 

and I don't blame him to be fair. this is what most of the industry thinks. 

  
I feel like the blue collar part of the developer society. you took the most effort, get paid less and no one values your job. 

and even worse than that, compared to Java or C# (Scala or .NET Core), front end is just a shit party! no rules, no strong foundation and god forbid for example if Vercel rolls out a new update and changes the whole structure of the framework! 

on the other hand, from my personal experience, I really enjoy reading .NET core documents. everything is very well structured and you don't have to give blow job  for AI or Stackoverflow developers to get your answer.

just a great Microsoft community. 

  
so, my question is... is it worth it? really after 3 years and couple years of freelance, I just started to regret my choice.

These sources are specified in a configuration file, and they can change over time. I need the app to handle these changes with minimal maintenance.

Here’s my current approach: I separate a quantity/time bar chart into two components: quantity and time. Each component is tied to its own plugin for different data sources (SQL, API, IoT). This results in more than six plugins just to update a single bar chart  because the data updates often require mixing and matching different data sources (e.g., SQL + IoT or API + SQL), i need to create additional plugin to handle new combination of data sources

As the number of plugins grows, it’s becoming harder to maintain. How can I improve this approach to make the system more scalable and easier to manage, while still allowing flexibility in changing and mixing data sources from the config file for each component?

\- Data ownership. Bring your own database = Customizable data structure

\- Free and open-source

\- Familiar Tech stack  
   \&gt; NextJS (it's on my fav tech stack as well to build web apps)

\- Extensible  
\&gt; I can easily customize it such as instead of Google Cloud Storage I can use Cloudflare R2

\- Modern  
\&gt; Uses the latest React and Next features (eg: Server components, App router, live preview, etc)

webdev,Seasoned dev with decades of coding experience thrown into WordPress - what do I need to know? ,"Hi. 

I've picked up a new client who's hosted at GoDaddy using WordPress. I have several decades of web coding under my belt; I haven't touched WP in many years. 

Can you point me toward some resources for experienced coders who are inexperienced with WordPress? 

TIA. 

Blue


Edit:
I've been building websites mainly for a major public institution. Most of my experience is with php and JavaScript, and I've dabbled with many other languages and techniques. 

To clarify: I'm not coding WordPress (yet if ever). I'm just managing the site. Most of the tutorials I've come across are aimed at folks with no web experience at all, and I'm a bit underwhelmed. 

EDIT 2:
Wow, thanks everyone! There's some sound advice and useful wisdom here. I really appreciate your thoughtful and useful responses.

And thanks to everyone who validated that it's possible to have deep experience in the field and not having experience with one of the gazzillion tools and techniques that are out there.

As an aside: a few years after I got into this field, the browser wars happened. Things got really messy for awhile. We had to deal with variations in browsers that were pretty confusing. New tools were rising that were helpful. But it was a hard time to know whether any path was a good one. I assumed things would get simpler with time. But they didn't. Web development is much more complex now than ever. Not so much in terms of code, but in the vast array of tools, options, techniques, vendors and so on. It's an exciting time, but also one of peril and pressure. Burnout is real. It has specific symptoms. Take care of yourselves. Be kind to yourself. Get some rest. Hang in there.

Thanks again for your help, I appreciate it.

webdev,"Switching from BootstrapVue (Bootstrap v4): Suggestions for a Modern, Lightweight UI Library?","Hey everyone!

We're looking to replace our current component library, which is built with **BootstrapVue**. The main reasons for the switch are:

1. **Incompatibility with Vue3**
2. BootstrapVue uses **Bootstrap v4** under the hood which is very heavy-weight as it still uses jQuery.

We already use **TailwindCSS** and **SCSS** in our development, so we're considering **shadcn** as a potential replacement. One key requirement is that the new library must be **heavily customizable** to help us maintain the look and feel of the Bootstrap components we're currently using.

We also need it to support:

* Accessible components
* Responsive design
* Vue3 compatibility
* Interactive Components (Modals, Dropdowns, etc.)
* Animations and Transitions
* Comprehensive Documentation and Active Community
* Potentially Dark Mode Support

Does anyone have experience using shadcn in a Vue3 + Tailwind environment? Are there other UI libraries or frameworks you'd recommend that offer a good balance between performance, customization, and accessibility?

	•	Getting started with building something super simple like that.
	•	Whether WTTP or other decentralized options make sense here.

webdev,Question about GDPR and CCPA and cookie banners,"I'm making an startup that collects analytics and marketing data, [https://storyteller.so](https://storyteller.so)

The whole point of the app is to collect that data in-house, not using 3rd party tools or sending it to different providers.

From my understanding, the fact that the app is collecting information it requires to function, and isn't using 3rd party collection, it should be compliant to both laws without the need for a bunch of ""accept cookie"" banners.

It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.

I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in  California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.



EDIT::: So I asked chatGPT but I dont knwo if I can trust it's answer, but it seems reasonable.

If your site and app use cookies **only for essential purposes**, such as maintaining user sessions and tracking which A/B testing version a user is seeing, and you gather analytics directly on your own backend without setting additional cookies for these purposes, your GDPR and CCPA obligations may differ:

# GDPR Considerations

1. **Essential Cookies**: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations) are generally considered ""strictly necessary."" Under GDPR, **strictly necessary cookies do not require user consent**. However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.
2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:
   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).
   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.
   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.
3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).

# CCPA Considerations

1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:
   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.
   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.
2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.

# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?

* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.
* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:
   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).
   * The purposes for which the data is processed.
   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).

# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance

1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:
   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).
   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).
   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).
2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don’t use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.
3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.

By sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",IAmRules,1h21jfl,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,2024-11-28 17:49:14,0,0.5,0,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h21jfl

webdev,Which CMS to use?,"Hi, I'm seeking advice on which CMS to use.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Background**


I am a content creator and have limited knowledge on HTML and CSS.


&amp;nbsp;
 

I currently have a website built by myself from scratch using Wordpress. I wish to use other CMS as Wordpress seems too cluttered and messy with so many 3rd-party plugins being installed. There is lack of cohesiveness in design and operations.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Needs**


The website will be mainly an educational website with articles, videos and podcasts. Events will also be shown on the website for people to register.


&amp;nbsp;
 

Will be good if as many of the following items are built-in as possible instead of having to install plugin after plugin.


&amp;nbsp;
 

1) Native SEO


Don't want to wade through tons of SEO plugins, with each professing their way is the best way, just to get basic SEO done.


&amp;nbsp;
 

2) Forms


Built-in form functionality to collect feedback and to sign up for newsletters and memberships.


&amp;nbsp;
 

3) Memberships


I did not create memberships for the current website and would like to do so for the new website as I want to differentiate content between registered members and public.


&amp;nbsp;
 

4) Newsletters


For sending regular newsletters to members and people who sign up for them.


&amp;nbsp;
 

5) Integrations


Be able to integrate easily with other services like Nextcloud (for external storage, linking of videos, audio files &amp; images), Eventbrite (for booking of events created on Eventbrite) and social media platforms like Youtube, Instagram &amp; Tiktok (to showcase my videos and playlists posted on these platforms).

Able to have a multilingual website in English &amp; Chinese.

7) Mobile apps


Able to create mobile version of the website for Android &amp; iOS. Not going to do Native apps as they are too costly. So, I'm guessing I need to use headless CMS for this. However, I have read that Drupal can be Progressively Decoupled to allow for more Editoral needs and less Developer needs. Are there other CMS that can done this way? ([Source](https://medium.com/@opensenselabs/a-complete-guide-on-fully-decoupled-drupal-56fd283fcd60))

Any programming language is fine so long as the CMS can fulfill as many of the above items as possible.

webdev,Misleading salary offers in job opportunities,"I've been looking for a new job for the past month. I finally found the perfect match, but on the way there, I couldn't help but notice something that is increasingly used by firms/recruiters: huge salary offers, that lead nowhere.

A bit of context: I'm currently applying as a lead Dev in France/Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I saw a job offer in Paris, for an American company.

Remote 1 day/week. Fine by me, I like being onsite.

Salary ? 72k to 150k, based on experience.

Their stack is interesting, the product looks nice, I give it a go. 

It's a five step process, with 3 interviews, a peer coding session, and at-home assignment that took me roughly 5 hours. Last Friday, they came back to me: they want me on the team. So, 4th interview with my future manager and HR. Manager tells me that I aced the tests, and they'd like to start ASAP. 

Their offer ? 75K.

This is not the first time I see this kind of behaviour, so I asked frankly: I aced all tests, and showed interest in your product, and had a great human fit with everyone I talked to. We share the same values when it comes to both human and professional responsibilities. So, how comes I'm not getting the 150k salary ?

To which they answered that ""This salary is only for applicants who live in the bay area, since the cost of living is way higher there"". So, I turned down the job, because the offer they gave me was lower than my current salary. Plus, I felt like after showing so much investment in their process, this was basically a huge red flag.

Has anyone ever faced this ?

webdev,A Browser-Based Solution for Reusable Libraries and Frameworks?,"Hey, I’m no expert, but I think I’ve stumbled on a genius idea:

What if browsers offered to store commonly used libraries and frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) locally instead of downloading them repeatedly for each website?

Here’s the idea:

* The browser could cache reusable libraries, especially popular ones like CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries.
* If a website uses modified or custom classes, the browser could detect this and ensure they aren't overridden. (web devs should notify the browser in headers or something to not override)
* For JavaScript, core functions of libraries could be stored in the browser, while any additional custom code gets bundled and served as usual. ( again, devs should notify the browser, and split their code too for this purpose)

This could save tons of bandwidth and improve loading speeds, with only small updates needed for library changes, and I believe that this is the future of web dev speed.

What do you think? Could this work?

webdev,Address Validation (Radar.com),"Anybody here used radar.com for address validation/autocomplete? I'm not understanding the terms of service - theres is similar to Google (one of their named competitors). It says you can't pre-fetch, cache or store autocomplete addresses beyond 30 days. Does that apply to validated addresses as well?

How would a company, after a transaction (assuming that is the point of the 30 days), handle providing receipts to the end user beyond 30 days? I would assume an end user would still want to be able to verify what address a product was sent to beyond that time frame and a company probably would want to store that address longer to deal with incorrect sending/re-sending reppacements/etc. so how do they accomplish this?

Or are the storage terms there to prevent people from requesting all addresses in the platform and storing a copy of them all indefinitely (alleviating the need to use the platform) - more of a gotcha if needed?

I want to use this platform, it's the cheapest/least resteictive by far compared to Smarty, Loquate, Google (attribution), geoapify, USPS (mailing requirement) etc. but my address validation needs require storing the addresses a bit longer than 30 days (not indefinitely).",Unhappy_Trout,1h1vkzq,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,2024-11-28 13:08:11,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h1vkzq

webdev,Confused on which CMS to use,"I'm making a website for a family member. I have experience with web development(mostly front end but i know some back end as well) and ive already got the domain, hosting and set up Plesk.

The website will be mostly hosting articles and similar content. It will also be used for web radio (it will be hosted elsewhere and I'll just grab the audio source).

After some research, it seems that WordPress may be the best cms for such a site. Ive used WordPress before and i didn't really like its front end limitations and i dont know any PHP to make custom themes.
I've also researched headless WordPress but it seems kinda complicated. Should I invest time into it?

I was originally thinking of just making a pure html,css,js+ site and push to plesk through git but it doesn't look very update friendly.

Im a CS student and thinking of web development as a career so i dont mind learning new things (but i dont have a lot of time as well)

Can anyone with more experience give me some advice?

webdev,Why would somebody need a website when they can sell directly in social platforms?,"I'm kinda having hard time figuring it out exactly why somebody would need a website nowadays? Usually the website provides - 

- Brand image
- Product and business information
- Buying option

Nowadays, you can create videos about all of the information and can sell your stuff in social platforms. In my country, a huge number of businesses are operating through facebook ads and selling their products in DM's. 

They don't need a website for marketing, ads and videos does that it tiktok/fb/youtube. They don't need a site to sell, customers could talk to them via chat and order directly.

So your marketing effort does everything about building your brand image and awareness. You don't need a site to present your business informations. And you can sell through chat.

So it's making website unnecessary.

One risk factor we developers are selling is, social platforms could anytime ban you. But I don't think it would be financially logical for them to invest on a site.

webdev,"Quit to build WebDev freelancing, where is my actual value?","Apologies if you see my rant in different subreddits, I’ve cross checked and ensured that my post obey’s all guidelines. 

I’ll preface by saying I like to think I’m realistic not optimistic nor pessimistic and not coming on here to say some bs like time to make $5k a week off converting a client.



**Background:** 

(Pre) Background Summary: Boss made a comment so vulgar about my personal life I quit on the spot. Time to take a risk. 



Been scheming on starting freelance Web Design for 6 months now learning the ins and outs of Elementor and overall web design. Had a rude awakening realising that I’m essentially making life 6x as hard for me as I look now and my websites are Webflow websites created in Elementor when it comes to animation and overall feeling. Been researching and seems smart enough to switch over to Webflow and learning curve should be doable as I’ll be rebuilding a portfolio and own website in Webflow and taking Christmas period whilst businesses sleep to understand everything about where I need to be. Decided I don’t think I’ll be touching E-Commerce clients as that’s asking for trouble and in terms of restrictions for what I can provide with websites. Nothing with user accounts/logins and essentially just have a CTA and booking components. 



**Problem:** 

A pretty website doesn’t sell… I wouldn’t consider this endeavour if I didn’t currently work in corporate sales handling anywhere from $2000 to $50,000 deals from straight cold calling. My point is I understand you’re never in the business of selling a product to a company, you’re selling a tool that provides value and generates them new revenue.

So whether I like it or not I’m essentially selling a form of marketing. At the end of the day my passion is web design and I want to keep as close to that as possible as I can without locking myself out of the profit party filled with web designers that sell a website as part of a digital marketing package. 

I understand Webflow has SEO embedded but I can already see the clients face when they’ve heard SEO SEO SEO SEO SEO a dozen times and that is my only bullet for how investing in me building them a new website generates them more revenue. 



**Question:** 

My question is what angle for SMBs should I take to ensure I can confidently say they’re investment is going to pay itself off that isn’t shying too far away from designing on Webflow and entering the ‘aLL iN OnE DiGiTaL MaRkEtiNg sPeCiAl’ where I’m handling their google and meta ads etc. Just super intrigued as to how delusional I’m being or if there are people converting half decent clients essentially off straight web design as I more than understand the $500-1000 website motto is asking for trouble and headaches from cheapskate customers. 



Greatly appreciate any advice as I am as far as I can get in terms of throwing myself into the deep end and have no option but to go out and go get it. ",maxo6k,1h0yyro,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,2024-11-27 07:32:36,9,0.66,9,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0yyro

webdev,Asking for a webdev role sanity check,"I was hoping I could get some thoughts and observations about my current position and role. It doesn't make sense to me that my company is run this way, but here I am. 

We are an e-Commerce company (with a couple physical retail locations) that does about $15m a year through our Shopify website. We also do almost that much through Amazon. We have maybe 110 employees, most of which are in product development and fulfillment. 

I am the sole developer in the company. We have 1 IT guy, who helps run Netsuite as well as all IT functions. We have a Tech Manager who just started and is the 3rd one we've had in a year, who will mostly own Netsuite. I seldom speak with these people as our roles don't overlap.

I do *everything* regarding the website. I am a Front End Dev by training with 18 years experience (both in agencies and ecommerce). So, obviously I manage the functionality and look/feel of our site. I also build &amp; launch all of our products in Shopify (800+ SKUs), as well as maintain all of their information/images. I build all of the themes to swap for different site changes, promos or product launches. I build all of the discounts and promotions and upsells.  I own probably 25 of the 3rd party apps we have installed in our store to add functionality, meaning I am the point of contact if any of them have an issue. Search, cart, bundles, reviews, subscriptions, Klaviyo, etc. 

Our Shopify store was built by an agency 2 years ago, yet somehow I was not involved in that process. I was tasked with keeping our previous store running. The agency customized a ton of code because the our people involved *had* to have this or that functionality (most of which are no longer with the company anyway). There are no code comments or documentation of what they did or changed. This is my first Shopify experience, and I am trying to pick up Liquid as I go. 

Speaking of customized solutions... we are also running both a B2B and D2C solution off of the same platform that was NOT designed to do that natively. We have custom scripts running to calculate prices and shipping rules that don't play nice with other things we try to accomplish. 

I am also the point of contact for all of our employees for any issue with Shopify via Slack. I am 2nd layer support for any of our customers who have store issues our CS team cannot solve. 

I report to the marketing manager. She is not very technical. I make just over 90k. I work remote from home. Luckily, I don't touch anything order related, nor Amazon or Netsuite.

I have to ask... This isn't normal, right? 

I am barely keeping my head above water. I don't have any actual QA. I don't have any technical support (beyond Shopify support). I don't have any back up. I work on a non-technical marketing team. We are in the depths of holiday, and as you can imagine, it is unbelievably crazy. 

Do other $30m a year companies run like this? 

I often get approached from our VP of marketing with some idea that GAP or Sephora are doing on their website. Sure, that's a cool feature. I'm going to assume those places don't have a single developer who spends half his day context-switching. 

I've been here 6 years. When I started, we had 3 back end devs and myself. Slowly, they left and were never replaced. Which was why we went to Shopify. I guess this has been a 'slowly boil the frog' situation. 

I know I should probably find another job, but I live in a place that doesn't have a ton of jobs, and every remote job listing I see has 100+ applicants before I've even read it. I'm burnt out, looking for a sanity check.

webdev,How to Handle Currency Conversion and Rounding Issues on a Global Platform?,"`To Be fair i am not a native English speaker so took some help from chat gpt for rewirting my problem to make it less painfull for you guys to read. my apologies` 

  
Hi everyone,

I’m working on a platform where service providers can list their offerings, and users from around the world can book them. We support multiple currencies, but our backend stores everything in USD for consistency. I’m facing a few challenges with pricing, conversion, and rounding, and I’m curious how others handle similar issues.

Here’s the setup:

1. A service provider creates a package with an hourly rate in their local currency (e.g., 100 GBP).
2. The backend converts the price to USD using the current exchange rate (e.g., 100 GBP → 124.56 USD).
3. Users see the price in their local currency, rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 125 USD).

Now the issues:

1. **Rounding Discrepancies**:
   * If the user books a package for 3 hours, they see `125 * 3 = 375 USD`. But the backend calculates `124.56 * 3 = 373.68 USD`. This mismatch confuses users.
   * If I always round on the frontend, the service provider might receive less than they expected.
2. **Currency Volatility**:
   * Exchange rates change over time. Locking the rate at the time of booking solves this for transactions, but I’m unsure how to handle edge cases, like refunds after months of exchange rate changes.
3. **Adding New Currencies**:
   * Storing prices in every currency a user might use isn’t scalable. If we add a new currency later, recalculating and storing all previous package prices in the new currency seems impractical.

**Questions for the Community**:

1. How do platforms like Airbnb or Fiverr handle pricing and rounding across currencies?
2. Is there a better way to deal with rounding discrepancies without overpaying/underpaying either party?
3. Are there efficient ways to handle refunds in multi-currency setups when exchange rates fluctuate?
4. Any scalable strategies for introducing new currencies without recalculating older data?

Would love to hear how you’ve tackled similar issues or any creative ideas you might have!

webdev,I don't understand how they build apps with AI,"To keep it short. I am modifying an app that uses python flask for backend, and I used SQLAlchemy as an ORM layer to work with my database. I had a model that is already in the db and I needed to add new boolean not nullable field to it. I know how to do it, but decided to test chatGPT. Yes, it was great at correcting auto-migration, as you need to pupulate this new field somehow to create it not nullable. But then things got tricky. I needed to add this field to my admin panel, and I wanted it to be 'read-only', so when user can see it but cannot edit it. And it tried to do it, he added it to list view and edit view, disabled the field, removed it from create view, added logic to assign value when the model is created in admin panel, BUT it cannot solve the issue, that when I start editing sexisting model where this disabled field is equal to True and save it, it gets saved to the DB as false, as disabled fields are not part of the form and then ORM treats it like False value. I gave it a chance, tried different promts but it couldn't correct this behaviour. 

So my thought is, I don't know how people are able to develop somethig complex with it. Sure, it helps me with snippents (like with migration), but when you try to get some even simple looking functionality it may introduce bugs and you are lucky if it is you who catches them, not the end-user. Also I get more satisfaction by researching and writing code myself, not writing instructions for who knows how long to get what I need.

This means that default / recommended way of using library relies on `Math.random`:

I’m trying &amp; it just seems so complicated. There’s numerous endpoints with specific fields in each one.

Then there are games &amp; releases endpoints. games contains fields such as name, release_date, description, deck, an object of images for cover art etc, an array of genres etc. The releases endpoint seems to be the only one with platform, age rating, publishers &amp; developers fields. Each review &amp; release has its own id. There seems to be a game id in the game object within reviews that I can then access the same game in the games endpoint but that id won’t return the same game in the releases endpoint. I’m just finding it very challenging to get all of these fields which are spread out over numerous endpoints to align for the same game. There must be a simpler way.

I'm looking for a video or video series where someone builds a full-stack web app from scratch—preferably unscripted or live-streamed. I'd like to see the entire process from development to production, including testing, best practices, and more.

I’d love it if the project uses the PERN stack, but I'm more interested in the overall approach and problem-solving so any stack will do. Most of the videos I've found are polished tutorials, mainly for beginners where everything is cut and edited to perfection. I'm looking for something more raw and realistic.

webdev,How to reduce LCP,"Hello,

I am stuck at 92/100 performance score on mobile devices for my website [nextbestai.com](http://nextbestai.com)

To get to this score was rough, and I have done all I can think of in terms of cache and using lightweight builders like elementor and blocksy. 

Now from the pagespeed insights it seems the issue comes from LCP , more specifically the H1 which covers quite a big chunk of space over the fold. I have tried editing, simplifying it, but it still won't get my score higher / lower the LCP.

What am I missing? 

Any tips are appreciated.

webdev,"A question on canvas, bootstrap, and resizing","Hi all, I'm trying to make a page which loads an image into a canvas and then allows drawing on top of the image. The image itself is large, so I would like to be able to resize it by altering my window size.

Currently, the image is loaded into an &lt;img src&gt; and has Bootstrap's img-fluid class and that manages scaling nicely. However, I would like to add a canvas on top of the image to draw on it. If I change the &lt;img src&gt; to a &lt;canvas&gt; with the background specified as the image, I run into all sorts of problems. Either the image is tiny or the image is huge, depending on how I'm setting the background (use the style tag and the image is tiny, use javascript to perform a drawImage and it's huge), and in either case it does not scale with the page.

I am pretty stuck with Bootstrap but I'm not particularly stuck with canvas if there is a different or better way to do this. If anyone has any suggestions then please let me know.

Am I crazy to think that I could/should do the design and layout in HTML(+CSS)? I'm pretty skilled but have never done anything in HTML that is designed *primarily* for print. I'm sure there are gotchas, I just don't know what they are.

FWIW, it would be okay for me to target one specific browser engine (probably Blink) since the browser will only be used to generate the 8 1/2 x 11 PDF. 

On one hand I feel like HTML would give me lots of power to use graphing libraries, SVG's and other goodies. But on the other hand, I'm not sure that I can build it in a way so that it consistently generates a nice (single page) PDF without overflow or other layout issues.

Thoughts?

It gets to Dev to build and much of the project to date with scope, functionality etc is just not there.

Recently had a new landing page system requirement, these differer from the website. All ready to build.  
I sit with the project manager to go over it.

\- Design is done, ready to build!  
\- First off there are 3 enquire buttons in the top area next to the enquire form itself which made me laugh.  
\- I did not say anything but the flow of the page was all wrong, made no sense and to me did not seem to match what they said the goal was, but oh well  
\- They changed what the form did mid conversation to go to another page with more complete form and a part submission step... OK BUT - No idea what was on the page and what the other part of the form was going to be and no idea on what fields would come across pre-populate etc.

Few other things.  
I am the lead developer, I work with all the departments and managers and across everything. Rather than giving it to one of the team as it was a mess I took it on as I am also a designer so I could fill in a lot of the blanks there as well as it does not have a huge budget.

Did what I could and hand over with clear requirements on all the things still needed and missing.

1 week later and they have some back and forward with the client and I am asked to change a graphic (which should be the designers job) and some text changes.

4 days later I am being asked if it is live yet  
I just had to email all parties with the bullet list of the actual important stuff again.

It amazes  me that across several people including the client they have not mapped out the key flow and functionality of the project, want it live and STILL do not know what it is supposed to do and where the data goes and how they will use it.

webdev,"What's the hype around Cursor? I see so many people saying it's great, but it actually made me laugh out loud how bad it was. Are they shills or am I using it wrong?","I've used Claude and Chad Jupiter before, and I find them useful for a few specific things. 

1. If there's some algorithm I'm pretty sure exists, but I don't know what it's called. 

2. If I'm trying to do something that's way out of my element, like say I want to try to train a model to do something. I don't really know shit about ML beyond surface level stuff, and even though the AIs spit out code that doesn't quite work, I do find it more useful than opening a book to the first page, as I learn best by building something, and they can at least lay out some sort of path for me to follow even if it's not the optimal one. 

For everything else I think they're a waste of time, because it takes me more brain power to code review their code than to write it myself.

More than a few times I've seen the name ""Cursor"" come up as being the cream of the crop, so I downloaded it, tried the free trial, and it turned out the be the sloppiest of the slop.

Here's an example of a prompt I put in. 

    # I need some Elixir code that align characters or groups of characters in pairs of strings. 
    # Here's an example of what the data might look like.
    # 
    # Input:
    # ```
    # abc,LlmNN
    # ccb,NNNNm
    # ac,LlNN
    # bab,mim
    # ```
    # Output:
    # ```
    # a b c,Ll m NN
    # c c b,NN NN m
    # a c,Ll NN
    # b a b,m i m
    # ```
    # So it will look at all the lines to figure out how it can group the letters. 
    # As you can see from the last example, `a` in this case is no longer `Ll`, but we still can figure out where to split it because the `b`-`m` pairing is something we've seen before.

I didn't spend much time on writing the perfect prompt, and maybe it could be improved, but for comparison Claude spit out runnable code, however it didn't actually solve the task as requested. Chad Jupiter started to write code, but spazzed out at the end. I didn't bother reviewing the code to see if it was on the right track, but it at least made an attempt. Cursor? ...?

    I'm not sure how to approach this. Any ideas?

Do I have any ideas?! If I have to come up with all the ideas what are you here for? At one point while adjusting the formatting on the prompt it did spit out some code, but it was just a function that read from a file and split at new lines. Literally not even required based on the prompt. Is Cursor just this shit, or am I using it wrong?

[Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/UmopPBE)

Here's Claude's code. It doesn't solve the problem and just seems to zip each line of characters together, so still pretty useless, but at least it's ~150 lines of running code, which is still, ever so slightly better than asking me for ideas about what to do.

webdev,Is there a catch here? Why choose DigitalOcean when Hosting*r offers so much more?,"I’ve been comparing hosting options for the early stages of a social network project. I came across two options that seem wildly different in terms of the resources they offer:

|**Specification**|**DigitalOcean Basic (2 vCPUs, 2GB)**|Hosting\*r KVM8 (8 vCPUs, 32GB)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**vCPUs**|2|8|
|**RAM**|2 GB|32 GB|
|**Disk Space**|60 GB SSD|400 GB NVMe SSD|
|**Bandwidth**|3 TB/month|32 TB/month|
|**Cost**|$18/month|$20/month|

The resources offered by Hosting&amp;r are so much higher that it seems too good to be true. I get that there’s likely a difference in quality. For example, even if Hosting&amp;r’s 32GB RAM doesn’t reach its full capacity and performs more like 10GB in real-world scenarios, it’s still 5x the RAM DigitalOcean provides. The bandwidth difference is also insane - 32TB vs. just 3TB.

Given that I’m building a social network in its early stages with about 100 users initially, is there a major reason to stick with DigitalOcean? Are there hidden trade-offs in Hosting&amp;r’s offering that I might be overlooking? Or does the sheer quantity of resources compensate for any quality differences?

webdev,How to remove Laravel Routes case sensitivity?,"Hi all, I have a laravel app running locally using Herd and deployed in prod on DigitalOcean. It is working fine so far. But one issue I'm having is that routes are not case insensitive so \`&lt;host&gt;/hello\` works but \`&lt;host&gt;/hellO\` doesn't. I get a 404.

How can I fix this behavior? I'd like for all routes to be lower cased.

I tried creating a middleware and apply it at the route level, at a group level, and globally by adding it to the list of middleware applied to \`$middleware-&gt;api(append: \[NormalizeRouteCasing::class\]\` but none of these works. I added debug statements in the middleware and is as if the execution never even gets to the middleware. When I remove the capital letter form the route it does reach it and I see the debug statements. So even before the middleware layer the upper cased routes are being rejected

Appreciate the help. Thank you.

UPDATE:

I Just want to give an update and say that the only thing I have been able to do that actually works (but it's ugly) is this:

In the public/index.php file, right before `(require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php')-&gt;handleRequest(Request::capture());` is called I'm doing this:

$requestUri = $\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\];  
$parsedUrl = parse\_url($requestUri);  
$path = isset($parsedUrl\['path'\]) ? strtolower($parsedUrl\['path'\]) : '';  
$query = isset($parsedUrl\['query'\]) ? '?'.$parsedUrl\['query'\] : '';  
$lowercaseUri = $path.$query;  
$\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\] = $lowercaseUri;

But please let know if there is a better approach or if there would be any downsides with this approach.

webdev,Can't Get HTTPS Working on Netlify with GoDaddy DNS – Stuck and Need Help!,"Hey everyone,

I'm really struggling to get HTTPS set up for my site hosted on Netlify while my domain is registered on GoDaddy. I've been going back and forth switching nameservers, tweaking DNS settings, and retrying verification, but I just can't get Netlify to provision the SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.

Here's the situation:

Domain: Registered with GoDaddy.

Hosting: Netlify (pulling from GitHub).

Nameservers: Currently using GoDaddy's default (ns55.domaincontrol.com and ns56.domaincontrol.com), since they don’t seem deletable or changeable in the DNS zone.

DNS Records in GoDaddy:

A Records: Pointing to Netlify's IPs (75.2.60.5 and 99.83.229.76).

CNAME for www: Points to sitename.netlify.app.


Netlify Settings:

Custom domain added (sitename.com as primary, www.sitename.com redirects to it).



The problem is that Netlify keeps giving me a ""DNS verification failed"" error when I try to enable HTTPS. I’ve tried:

1. Switching to Netlify’s nameservers (but GoDaddy doesn’t allow me to remove its NS records within the DNS zone).


2. Sticking with GoDaddy’s default nameservers and ensuring A and CNAME records are configured as Netlify recommends.


3. Retrying DNS verification after waiting for propagation (24+ hours).



No matter what I try, I’m stuck in the same spot. It’s frustrating because I can’t seem to delete or override those default NS records in GoDaddy either.


---

Has anyone dealt with this before or has advice on how to fix it? Should I fully switch to Netlify’s DNS and manage everything there, or is there a workaround for the NS records in GoDaddy? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

It can also export PNG, JPG / JPEG into WEBP and AVIF. It's basically a free and open-source alternative to [Imgbot](https://imgbot.net/).

If you try it out. Would love to hear feedback.

webdev,An idea of costs? ,"I'm unsure if this is the right place however I need some help and I'm asking the experts I guess. 

This is by no means a solicitation I just need an idea' finger in the air price so i know I'm not going to be either ripped off or oversolf/under delivered I am UK based (which is only relevant to price I guess)

I'm currently setting up an e com via Ebay and amazon. 

The products I want to offer are basically foam, cut to any size. 

Now I can offer pre cut products which are fine, however alot of things are unique size wise and I want to offer replacement services. 

This would require around 20-30 pages I think. As each shape would need it's own page description and dedicated calculator. 

I've had a go on squarespace and built a decent concept, however I can't figure out how to link my code I made using ai (and it works haha which is a shock) to their checkout. Which I think is a limitation of Squarespace or me. 

I am also a factory worker who had an idea however as I'm just starting out I have no idea about any of this other than time in the evenings to try and learn,. I do not know what is good and what is not so don't want to be ripped off I guess, but also what is fair for both me and them. 

Do I find a local agency and go with them? Or do I go on fiverr and try to find someone on there? 

And what costs based on the jumble of words would I be looking at? 

Thankyou for reading this, if it's not the right place I do apologise, I'm just trying to get an idea of a budget so I can save for it. 

Thankyou.

Just like chatGPT.  
I was inspired to create it by a bunch of cases when you are trying to do something interesting, find a suitable library for it, but it doesn't have sufficient documentation.  
  
So here is a example with physics llibrary for Three.JS, its have no documentations at all, but provided with a few html files with code samples as a Example. Its enought for ai to analyze how it works and make a short explaination for me.

webdev,Image Hosting Approach for Small Web Site on Github Pages,"Hi all, I have a GitHub Pages site that I use for my portfolio and I'm working on expanding some of the functionality to support an online scorecard for a hobby league I'm part of. For context, the group paints Warhammer miniatures and submits a completion log to earn points based on certain submission criteria.

Thus far, this project is a fairly small repo (1.4mb because it has the entire Tabulator JS package in it) and I would like to keep it that way. However, I want to introduce an image gallery to the site and there are currently 45-50 images of varying sizes (not in the repo yet). I also expect that count to grow, especially after this site is released because I suspect participation will increase when users can see their submissions online alongside their friends'.

I know that hosting images on Github is bad practice, especially if those images change or change names over time, so I'd like to avoid doing so. Are there any recommended approaches to image hosting for a project like this?

Since this site is hosted freely on GitHub and I'm only paying for my domain, I'd like to keep it free *if* *possible*. I've seen CloudFlare suggested so that's first on my list to explore, but I'm curious if others have thoughts on image hosting for any similar smallish projects.

1. The **main idea** of the passage.
2. The **mood** the author is trying to convey.

The idea is that it would be easy for humans to identify the emotion or central theme, but much harder for bots to interpret the subtleties of human expression.

webdev,Trying to figure out how to better avoid this client situation,"**TL;DR: When to know when to cut your losses on a new ricocheting client?**

Someone I knew tangentially from a business transaction was struggling to make ends meet with her new business, so I offered to help with my skills and interests, some of which I was learning.

Things were progressing nicely, though she struggled understanding some necessary things with marketing and management. I can't call myself a pro with those things but I knew enough tangentially to make things work. I offered the services free to a certain point because I wanted the project on my portfolio and we got along well.

However, when it came down to images, I mentioned that I'm not a designer. She didn't like that answer, and said the previous team (which she said she couldn't afford) did that. I offered to do the free parts and they could send me the images. She didn't want separate entities working on the project. I later learned they also wrote all of the content, and a lot of it looked AI-generated. I generally don't write content, though AI makes things easier, which she at least understood.

Maybe this is the point where I should have cut ties: she said she has no money to spend, but insisted on a professional designer. Since I saw her just pay for something necessary for business management (not a big expense), I couldn't tell if she was being hyperbolic or not. I said, look, I don't know everything, but I'm offering you free marketing recommended by the hosting platform that the pros you paid didn't try. She kept going back and forth, eventually left on a ""let me talk to the other team"" note, and I figured why not see if I could just make the free marketing work.

She texted me some time later, saying she really needed bookings (she didn't have a scheduler set up, oddly), and I tried what I could, but after suggesting some shortcuts, she removed my access to the marketing page and ignored my texts.

So, while I learned some things about the tech/marketing stack, ultimately I couldn't even try what looked like would work quickly and cheaply for her situation.

**Anyway, is it better to be more skeptical than this with new clients?** I'm sort of new at consulting in the wild world myself, and I don't want to insult anyone or lose good leads, but the ping-ponging and apparent mixed messaging surprised me near the end.

please help me understand. i've been programming for a long time and I started with web dev, for any project I always used vanilla JS, and in the past maybe something like bootstrap. But today React is absolutely everywhere. I can't find a single modern UI library that isn't dependent on it in some way. Every web project guide involves NextJS or React in some way, it's everywhere. Does nobody teach vanilla anymore? When did this shift happen?

I'm not a hater but I'm so surprised that I can't find much discussion on it.

Awhile ago I participated in a hackathon, and the winning project was a single-page react app that displayed a number pulled from a rest api. The fact that the app needed to be built and bundled, before deploying on an overcomplicated cloud saas platform, was crazy to me. That app would need 10 lines of JS max! I don't understand the react-ification of everything and I rarely see discussion on it. I'm sure it's great for apps that need a component library to function, but I don't see why it's absolutely everywhere. Is it like the modern jQuery? Everywhere for a few years and suddenly gone?

webdev,Building Side-Projects &amp; Navigating ‘Perfectionism’,"TLDR: Unable to build projects as I have imposter syndrome and worry too much about perfecting the code.

I’ll start with the caveat that I know perfectionism and web dev don’t mix well, however hoping to explain the d conundrum I’m facing.

For context, I’m about 1.5 years into web development, mainly frontend. Stack is JS, Next and I’ve used a few CSS libraries such as MUI. I am currently working in a startup and due to start transitioning more to ‘full stack’ with more exposure to the backend.

I have never built a portfolio per se and was able to get the role by passing the tech tests and soft skills that were needed at the time (career changer, product management experience). The main reason why I never built a portfolio is because of the huge imposter syndrome and navigating the ‘perfectionism’ of trying to build something that’s production-level worthy.

By production-level worthy, I mean that building a codebase that could easily be used at enterprise level. I halt at this process because when I start building something, I worry about how the code looks or the patterns I’ve used or even the way the codebase is organised. From a code perspective, I worry about how clean the code is and how optimised it is (more for readability, less spaghetti). This ‘imposter syndrome’ has kept me in tutorial hell and I can’t seem to move forward. I think the one major issue is that I think just following a full tutorial blindly and copy+paste means I’ve not actually learned how to build something myself, but rather code monkey my solution. So, I try to build something from absolute scratch i.e read docs, read other codebases etc. but then when I get to a point that I know my solution is ‘hacky’, I stop completely and convince myself I’m not ready enough.

Yes, I know sometimes a solution is needed no matter how it works as I’ve experienced that at work. Many a times myself and my senior devs will put something together as quick as possible and just make it work to get a ticket across the line. Our codebase is far from perfect.

Not sure how to get myself from this rut and would really appreciate some advice. Maybe I’m overthinking here but would love to hear what you guys have done to get out of tutorial hell and just start hacking away enough that you improved every project.

Have you guys tested the impact of using `rem` layouts these days? It really doesn't have many cases where it matters. I tested the following scenarios:

* Browser zoom (Ctrl + scroll)
* OS interface zoom
* Microsoft Edge font-size configuration

Edge's font-size configuration was the only test where `rem` scaled. The final question is: do the small percentage of users who need accessibility tools use font-size configuration or simply interface zoom? If interface zoom doesn't trigger `rem` scaling, is there any point in using it?

Ok, ok, I lied. There's one more question: should I use `rem` only for fonts or for spacing as well?

webdev,Recommendations for a framework/architecture for an embedded application with maps and video,"I need some help with a web application stack/framework. The application is an autonomous ship, similar to a drone. The ship is the server and the application is the client. There may be multiple clients connected to the ship/server (probably fewer than a dozen clients per server). 

The ship/server will send GPS truth coordinates, weather data, and multiple video feeds. The client(s) will need to display all this data and have the ability to create routes for the ship, then upload those routes to the ship/server. The client needs to be extremely responsive (30 FPS, no lag kind of deal).

The client and server communicate over a closed network which may or may not have Internet access. Because of that and speed, I assume we must store the maps (nautical charts) locally to the client. The application/client hardware will likely be a commodity laptop, but may be as low-end as a Raspberry Pi for a remote control station (still a client). 

We're currently using websockets on the server side and the client uses pyside2 via Python. The existing application is very much an engineering GUI. We need to hire someone with real UI/UX experience and embedded web experience so that we have something more polished to show clients. But of course, I need to know what to write for the job description. 

Can anyone recommend a good framework/architecture with this in mind, and what you would write for the job description?

webdev,Need Advice: Integrating Stripe for SaaS Subscriptions with Supabase and Next.js,"Hi everyone!

I’m building a SaaS app where users can subscribe to plans that provide monthly credits (e.g., for generating content) and access to specific functionalities. Here’s the flow I’m aiming for:

1. Users subscribe to a plan via Stripe.
2. Based on their plan, they receive monthly credits and access to features.
3. Credits reset or roll over (depending on the plan) each month.
4. Users should be able to switch plans seamlessly.

I’m using **Supabase** for my database and **Next.js** for the front end. My app was built using **Cursor**, so I’m comfortable coding whatever is needed. However, I’d love to streamline this to speed up my time to market.

**Main Question:**  
Do I need to manually retrieve payment info for every user from Stripe each time to update the dashboard (e.g., plan details, payment status, etc.), or is there an easier integration method?

**What I’ve Considered:**

* Using Stripe’s **webhooks** for real-time updates.
* Storing subscription and plan info in Supabase and syncing it with Stripe as needed.
* Some libraries for Next.js (e.g., `stripe-node`), but not sure how well they integrate with Supabase.

If you’ve built a similar setup, I’d really appreciate any advice or resources to optimize this workflow.

TLDR: I miss flash websites. I want custom borders/custom animations that aren't available in WordPress. What's a good alternative similar to flash? (including 'hand-coded')

I have a clothing store, and I have used WordPress up to this point to create a basic store and I'm running into this issue where I want to express my brand in the most authentic way, but WordPress has its limitations regardless of theme, lack of custom product borders, animations for opening quick view product pages, background animation etc. I loved the flash sites of the early 2000s when I was a kid and would love to capture that feeling. I've heard great things about Adobe Animate and their export to HTML5 feature, still weighing my options.

If anyone knows any resources to send me to that they can vouch for I would appreciate it. Any advice on what I should learn to do is also appreciated.

webdev,TIL - Why is the terminal called that,"I was listening to lecture on linux -this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gojeTqXdBH0), but it's in Arabic- and the lecturer talked about the first time the terminal was used, which was interesting and worth sharing, so I asked Claude to talk about the point he mentioned in more details so I can share it here:

The term ""terminal"" in computing comes from its literal meaning as an ""endpoint,"" rooted in the Latin ""terminus"" (meaning boundary or end). In early computing, terminals were physical endpoints - devices with just a screen and keyboard that connected to massive mainframe computers. Unlike other input methods like punch cards (which were more like dropping off mail and waiting), terminals were special because they were interactive endpoints where users could have real-time, two-way conversations with the computer.

Picture a mainframe computer in a room with cables running out to multiple terminals - each terminal was literally at the ""end"" of a connection, where the computer system met the human user. When you typed on your terminal, your input would travel up to the mainframe, get processed, and the results would immediately come back to your screen. This was revolutionary compared to punch cards, which required you to submit your entire program at once and wait hours or days for results.

Today's ""terminal"" or command-line interface isn't a physical device anymore, but we keep the name because it serves the same purpose: it's your direct, interactive conversation point with the computer, where you can type commands and get immediate responses. Modern terminals are actually programs (like Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows) that simulate those old physical terminals, carrying on that legacy of being the ""endpoint"" where human and computer meet for direct communication.",Mohammed_MAn,1gzhqp7,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,2024-11-25 12:30:35,0,0.43,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gzhqp7

* Page 2 can then read the query string and the key 'someValue'

Page 2 have in java script array list of products ( name, description, image )

Page 2 access the array based on the parameter.

webdev,Instagram Content (Story Highlights) on Website,"Hi all, 

I work for an education federation. Most of our updates end up on our Instagram, so I thought it'd make sense to mount that on our federation website instead of reuploading everything manually. 

I've found a couple of decent widgets that display the Instagram's main content tiles, but I'd like to somehow implement the story highlights separately. We have different story highlights for certain areas of the federation - ""Enrichment"", ""Early Years"", ""Training"" etc - where content gets grouped. I'd like similar buttons to appear on our website so that when they're pressed, people can easily look through the images without being redirected to Instagram itself. 

I've tried a widget by SociableKIT, and it was nearly what we needed, but it didn't pull through the titles, on the circular buttons. 

Any thoughts about how this could be achieved? 

Many thanks!

This is how they appear on Instagram:

webdev,Is a good source for “traditional” web development?,"All my professional experience since college has been React SPAs and I’m interested in learning a more old school approach through a side project with server side rendered html. 

To give an idea of what I mean, I’m talking about things like using an html form with inputs and a submit button to send data back to the server as opposed to controlled react inputs and a POST request. Then redirecting after that form submission by returning a 303 response rather than reading the POST response and using whatever method the routing library wants you to use.

Basically I’m looking for ways that I can leverage the built in capabilities of the browser or http spec to accomplish things rather than doing it all in JavaScript like I learned through react. I can find these things in isolation, or through specific searches, but if there’s any resources for “proper” or “traditional” web development that aggregates these sorts of best practices I’d appreciate it.

webdev,PowerPages to host website?,"I work in a school and created a small report/web app to track students who are failing or in danger of failing courses. The app displays their attendance, grades, missing assignments, and what sports they play, if any.

Previously, I outputted the report as a giant PDF and stored it on OneDrive, sharing a link to disseminate it. However, the missing assignments feature is dynamic and can't be captured in a static PDF.

I've been searching for a way to host the web page while restricting access to certain users within our domain. I stumbled upon Power Pages and thought it might be a solution.

My goal is to upload the fully formed page and its assets, using Power Pages solely for secure storage behind an Azure AD login. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to achieve this. Ideally, there would be an FTP-like mechanism to simply upload the folder and be done.

Right now I can't even figure out how to upload the image assets, each student's attendance is represented by 2 graphs for YTD attendance and 5 day attendance.

I am mostly a backend developer and not great with JS. So, looking for some advice. 

I have a project where there is an API, written by me, that provides JSON description of a form. As well as an endpoint to submit the form. 

Currently, I have vanilla JS with jQuery and bootstrap. That based on an FormID and containerID will render the specified form in the container. After getting the JSON from the API. 

The JS itself is now over 1000 lines long and a bit unmanageable. Thanks to there being a function for each input type. 

 I want the JS to be portable so that we can reference the script on any site and call the render function to inject the form.

webdev,How to deal as a developer with large-ish json files embedded inside of an angular app?,"Context:

I have to maintain an angular 16 application, it is purely front-end.

The application has several large configuration files acting more like tables in a database which it gets it's data from.

Each file has an array of aprox 50 objects, which might not seem much but every object is very embedded with objects within objects within objects.

***I cannot change this, I tried asking, I tried offering other solutions (keep data on server in mongo or sql or etc and the FE app gets it via calls) it's not happening. The files are here to stay.***

A large part of my tasks ends up with me doing changes in these files by hand.

I know it doesn't sound like much but we're talking about large embedded objects without schemas, sometimes I need to only edit one sometimes I need to basically do a manual query to see some field from everything, sometimes I need to change in just 3 out of 50 objects.

My point is the work is very error prone because it's by hand and by me reading the files again and again to understand them.

***I cannot change this structure.***

As a developer what tools can I use to view/edit/manipulate these large json files in a sensible manner?

webdev,I Built a Simple Tool to Control YouTube Music Across Tabs While Working,"Hi there! I created **YT Remote** to enhance YouTube experience, allowing you to control YouTube playback and manage tabs from any website or tab. It’s a freemium Chrome extension aimed at helping users streamline their YouTube control across platforms, with features like ad skipping, video search from extension and more!

You can check it out here: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yt-remote/jodpnmokilccncpcgfjpmkhengjhligo?hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yt-remote/jodpnmokilccncpcgfjpmkhengjhligo?hl=en)

What started as a simple tool for managing YouTube tabs quickly evolved when I, as a developer, needed a way to control music across multiple YouTube tabs while working.I wanted something simple yet powerful — a sleek, intuitive tool that would let me play and pause music across YouTube tabs without interrupting my workflow.

That’s when **YT Remote** was born: a lightweight, easy-to-use extension designed to help you manage your YouTube experience seamlessly, whether you’re multitasking or simply listening to music while coding or working.

If you have any feedback, suggestions for new features, or know of other tools that do something similar, feel free to drop a comment!

webdev,Do I need to use a context provider if I'm storing JWTs in a cookie anyway?,"I'm trying to implement JWT for my react/node.js app, but there are some parts that I'm confused about.

From my understanding: Client makes request to the backend -&gt; backend generates a token -&gt; sends it to the frontend -&gt; frontend stores the token on the client side(eg. cookie) so that you don't need to make a request to the server every time you want to access content.

However, I see people using React context providers to handle authentication as well.

Isn't the point of a context provider to pass down information down to children components, in this case, the authentication status?

Or are you meant to store the JWT token itself in the cookie, and use the context state to store information like ""{userAuth: true, favoriteColor: blue}""?

webdev,Is this a good solution?,"So I have to write a function that basically accepts an object, then returns a link with the properties in the object as url params. The object can have from 2 to 5 properties. So let's say the object is 

`{`  
`type: ""someType"",`  
`colour: ""someColour,`  
`size: ""someSize""`  
`}`

It returns ""link?type=someType&amp;colour=&amp;someColour&amp;size=someSize.

But the object can have 2, 3, 4 0r 5 properties.

My tired ass brain initially thought of using conditionals but that would make for one big and horrid piece of code.

So I opted to loop and push to an array, like so:

    const
     makeLink = (
    obj
    ) 
    =&gt;
     {
        
    let
     baseLink = ""www.myfakeshop.com/promo"";
        
    let
     link;
        
    let
     params = [];
      
        for (
    const
     property in 
    obj
    ) {
            params.push(`${property}=${
    obj
    [property]}`)
          }
          link = `${baseLink}?${params.join('&amp;')}`
          return link
    }

It's working, for every object I pass through, I get the correct link.

webdev,Failed Web App (Can you share some thoughts on this or the AIGC/webapp markets?),"My Background:

My full-time job has been mainly a product designer, and I didn't program much, but I wanted to make a webapp by myself.

I thought about what product I could make myself, or with minimum paid help, and given my limited programming speed, I made a website: fanserviceai.com, which could generate images of specific anime characters etc.

The Market:

At the time, the AIGC market was already very saturated with the likes of Midjourney and many AI porn generators. However, few touches IP characters, - like none of them could generate Sakura Haruno well for example as the platforms avoid doing it. None of the debit card payment processors deal with such content either - thus for this website, I had to connect a crypto payment processor to the page, and thought that maybe there's a small, niche, grey market.

The Webiste:

Fanservice AI is a website that could generate anime characters, like the one piece, or naruto's characters etc closely resembling the original drawings. I thought that, as some generic AI porn generators could have subscribers, a generator that could generate specific characters would probably be better, and I made this MVP (searchable on Google) and tried to test it out with people. But that assumption was wrong, I posted on social media and then, nothing happens.

Question:

webdev,Migrating an old website to a new server,"I'm helping a friend with his client's request to move their website to a new server. I'm not a web dev, so please bear with my ignorance.

From what I can tell, it's five static HTML pages, but one is a ""contact us"" form, which presumably sends an email to the client with the data the user inputs on the form.

Presumably, because of this, I cannot just host this new site on something that serves just static HTML, and I will need some kind of server code to at least support this contact us form. Presumably, this would mean migrating to a server with a similar setup as the existing one.

From what I can tell, this old page was based off of CakePHP 2.0, so I assume that whatever is supporting this contact form is written under this framework. But I see that CakePHP 2.0 has long ago been deprecated.

What would be the best way to proceed here? Should I try to install CakePHP 2.0 on a new server, paste over all the files from the old server, and pray everything works?

webdev,Need Advice: Working with a Freelancer on WordPress + BricksBuilder,"Hey everyone,

I’m working on building my website and could really use some advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation. Here’s a bit of background:

* I’ve designed the site myself in Figma and provided the freelancer with all the on-page SEO details (like meta tags, alt text, and header structures).
* While I do have some experience with HTML and CSS, I’ve hired a freelancer to help with the development side because of personal time constraints.
* We’ve agreed to test and audit the site using tools like SEMrush, Google Search Console, and Google Analytics to make sure everything is running smoothly.

The website is being built on WordPress using **BricksBuilder**. The freelancer has a lifetime unlimited license for Bricks and plans to use it during development. My hosting is set up with SiteGround, and I’ve already got WordPress installed.

Here’s where I could use some advice:

1. **WordPress Access:** What’s the best way to give the freelancer access to my WordPress account? Should I make them an admin temporarily, or is there a more secure way to handle this?
2. **BricksBuilder License:** Since the freelancer has their own lifetime license for Bricks, I’m wondering how that works in terms of ownership. Can their license be transferred to my site after the project is done, or would it be better for me to buy my own Bricks license to ensure I have full control in the future (especially if I lose contact with them)?
3. **General Tips:** Are there any other precautions I should take or things I should keep in mind with regards to the above or any further advice you have? thanks. 

I want to make sure I approach this the right way, especially when it comes to access and ownership. Any insights or recommendations would be super helpful.

webdev,PDF Viewer for Android/iOS Web View,"I need a suggestion/advice on how to solve this. Currently I am building a Web application where users can upload PDF files and only users with certain roles have the ability to see them. This application is also available via Mobile Application, however my team decided that we will use Web View for the listing/displaying the pdf files in the Mobile Application. The Web Application are being built in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS. Also, to retrieve the file, the ""user with certain role"" must provide his JWT token for authentication before the system retrieve the file.

The way we plan to display the PDF file is that, the PDF file are embedded inside the WebView page. So far we have tried multiple methods:

1. iframe (Using direct path from storage)
2. iframe (Using Google Docs Viewer)
3. PDF.js (JS Library)

For the first method, the PDF didn't load for Android, however iOS can load it. For the second method, both Android and iOS managed to display it, however I have to risk putting the JWT in the URL because there are no other way to pass the JWT token for authentication. For the third method, the PDF didn't load at all for both Android and iOS.

I feel like I have reached a dead-end and this feature seems impossible to implement within WebView. For the Web Developers out there, have you created something similar to this? What method did you guys used to retrieve the PDF File so that it can be readable in WebView Page for both iOS and Android.
