Physics,"Even if a quantum computer that surpasses a classical computer is never successfully built, what are some useful research that has/will bear fruit along the way? ","This is similar to a previous question on [fusion energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/s/J4Ot4aPgq8), which I'm really curious about the answers for quantum computing too.

I believe there's always some nuance involved in these fields dedicated to building these technologies that're hailed as breakthroughs, it's not all or nothing.

With all this research going into it, there's bound to be at least some useful research done that could benefit other fields right?
