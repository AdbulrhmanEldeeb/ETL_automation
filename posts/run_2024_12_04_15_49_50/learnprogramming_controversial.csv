learnprogramming, I am failing horribly in CS in college. How do I get better?,"I am studying CS at a university ranked Top 10 for the major in the US. Right now I'm a sophomore and only switched into CS this year from another unrelated major, but I have already taken CS classes (python) before and done some Coursera classes. This past semester has been a complete disaster, C averages across the board and I'm pretty sure a D/F (depends on my final) in Java. 

I am able to understand the general logic in all the basics (loops, program flow, objects, conquer-divide algorithms...) during lecture, but when it's time to do the homework and actually write a program myself I get stuck very quickly and fail to apply the concepts. I just got to recursion, and I had to rely completely on my TAs to finish the HW. When I try to read documentation, the language completely escapes me, and I have a hard time understanding what it is talking about even for simple methods I already know like print(). I joined the robotics club to improve my skills but have not made much progress understanding the stack. When I ask for help, some people are very helpful, and others just say bunch of technical language way beyond my level. 

I am not naturally gifted like many of my peers who never study and ace exams with As. I am fine with this, but with amount of effort I have been putting in I haven't even been able to do just okay. I am aware that some of my anxiety is emotional, but I am horrified for the future since my classes right now are just the easy stuff. What can I do to level up? I think my problem is that I cannot think computationally and often make errors in logic. If I don't make some drastic changes I will actually fail out.

learnprogramming,Have a BS in Computer Science but never learned how to build a website,"I studied computer science for four years at university, and not one person ever decided to teach me how to build a website. The closest I got to taking a web development class was **Introduction to Web Development**, where we just reviewed development workflows like Agile and sketched out pictures of what we wanted a website to look like.

Now that I'm a full-on graduate, I’d like to make my own website, but I don’t even know where to begin. In the past, I’ve tried following tutorials or using AI to help me out, but now I actually want to understand what I’m doing. Making a responsive website feels especially intimidating—I have zero clue what the standards are for webpage layouts.

Currently, I’m working on a website that visualizes data recorded from multiple remote water monitors. These monitors fall into three categories, each recording different metrics: water detection, temperature, and turbidity. The data is sent to a relational database service running PostgreSQL on AWS.

The purpose of the website is to help environmental scientists understand and interpret the data recorded by these water monitors. Users should be able to log in securely, though I’m not exactly sure how to manage separating devices between different organizations. Right now, the remote water monitoring devices use ChirpStack and LoRaWAN to communicate with my AWS database. I use the ChirpStack network server web interface to add new monitors, but I’m not sure how I’d incorporate adding or removing monitors into the website itself.

For now, I’m focusing on creating a website that visualizes the data uploaded to my database. Handling organizational separation is a problem for another day because it’s just too much to think about, and I doubt anyone has a clear answer off the bat. I’ve probably lost most of you by now, so here’s a rough outline of what I *think* I want for this project:

# Goals for the Website:

1. **Secure login**: Users should be able to log in securely.
2. **Homepage with a dashboard**: This dashboard should display the following charts:
   * A graph showing water temperature over time.
   * A graph showing water turbidity over time.
   * A table indicating whether water was detected (T/F).
3. **Chart controls**: Users should be able to toggle between displaying data for all monitors or selecting data from a specific monitor.
4. **Data export**: Users should be able to download data as a CSV or Excel file. They should also be able to select the range of data they want to export.
5. **Statistical summaries**: I’d like users to see some key statistics, such as the highest average temperature per day across a week, month, or year. There are probably more useful statistics to include, but this is the only one I’ve thought of so far. I’m not sure where these stats should appear on the website, but they should be somewhere.
6. **Responsive design**: The website should look good and function well on any screen size (mobile, tablet, or desktop).

This post is both a cry for help and a way to dump all the thoughts I have about this project. I wish I had more knowledge about how to make a user-friendly website, but I’m so lost. This project might take me years to complete unless I get help from someone who knows what they’re doing. I’d love any suggestions on where to learn this stuff. I’m sure there are tons of resources out there, but I just don’t know where to begin.

so im in a 2 yr rotational program, my first year didn't really do much and was more on QA side. now, for the second year, i got an indian manager who gave me 2 weeks onboarding to learn .NET and expected me to complete my first 5 pt ticket in 2 days.

my senior dev who was mentoring me at the time when i mentioned... hey bla bla, he wants me to finish by tomorrow and they replied saying: oh... I thought this was a learning opportunity.

im also receiving low marks in every 1 on 1 and on my performance review after 2 months of being on the team, got the lowest rating

some other things that might be influencing my decision: 
no more monthly income, i make around 5.4k a month after tax and save around 4k a month.

my roommate is spawned from hell, i believe he was put on earth to ruin my life

my gf and family are both 6 hrs away

learnprogramming,help on coding,"Your task is to create a program that emulates a Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher was a documented cryptography technique used by the Romans that involved ""shifting"" the alphabet. In our modern alphabet we have 26 letters, so for example, if we were to ""shift"" the letters in a word forward by two places, ""cat"" would then become ""ecv"". An example of a word shifted forward by 5 places would be ""dinosaur"" becoming ""instxfzw"".
Your program must prompt the user for TWO pieces of input:
A word to be encoded in either upper or lower case;
A number of places that word should be shifted (positive values move forward in the alphabet and negative values move backwards in the alphabet)
Your program must then be able to manipulate this inputted word to correctly output the encoded word.
You should accomplish this by creating a Class to handle the calculations. This class must include:
Constructor(s)
Void Method(s) to perform the encryption
toString() return Method for the main file to print out
Things to consider:
The user could enter a negative number, meaning that the alphabet would need to shift backwards.
The user could enter the wrong case of letter accidentally... make sure to compensate for this.
The alphabet is 26 letters long - what happens when we try to shift the letter ""z"" forward by a number of places? How can we solve this problem? (HINT: a math operator is one way to solve this...)
Likewise with the letter ""a"" shifting backwards by a number of places? How can we solve this problem? (HINT: a math operator combined with a type of looping is one way to solve this...)

learnprogramming,Best Practices for Synchronizing Supabase Auth and Local Database in a NestJS App,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I’m working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What’s the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?
* Any tips for optimizing this flow for scalability and maintaining clean code?",Aymsep,1h6f3ix,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,2024-12-04 12:43:36,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6f3ix

I am starting to get a good sense of very common methods of solving problems in Python, and I feel like if I simply just grinded out leet code it would reinforce this methods into memory a lot quicker, as well as force me to research on certain topics that I have forgotten a little bit.

  
Advice on this? I am gonna do it anyway but I am just wondering what other experienced programmers think about leetcode in accelerating learning, thanks.",leiferikson250,1h61fum,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h61fum/programming_getting_good/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h61fum/programming_getting_good/,2024-12-03 23:23:12,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Topic,,t3_1h61fum
learnprogramming,Help for raspberry pi3,"Hey, I’m just getting started with programming and trying to write some automation scripts in Python. I’ve been using Selenium to automate tasks, so even when I go to bed, things keep running. The problem is, my desktop uses a lot of power for this, so I thought about getting a Raspberry Pi (but if there are any other alternatives, let me know). The prices for them seemed a bit high, though, especially since I’m not sure exactly how they work, what they can do, or what I really need. That’s why I thought about getting a Raspberry Pi Pico. But it turns out it can’t run Chrome (ChromeDriver doesn’t work because I can’t open it with user data, so I’d have to log in again every time, like with the WhatsApp QR code). So, I checked out the Pi 4 and Pi 5, but they’re also expensive.

learnprogramming,Question for non-QWERTY-like keyboard users (e.g. AZERTY / QWERTZ),"I'm developing a programming language specifically for people who will probably never do a lot of programming. I aim to have my target audience make as few changes as possible to their daily lives, and learn as few new things as possible, in order for them to get the benefit of programming that I want them to have. One factor of that is the symbols used in the language's syntax and their accessibility on various keyboard layouts.

After some research I found that about 15-20% of people who have daily personal access to a desktop or laptop computer do not have a standard QWERTY-like layout. On those non-standard layouts, the way to type certain symbols such as \~, \^ and \\ is quite hidden. Those I could quite easily not use in my syntax. But apparently the same holds for  \[, \], { and }, which I don't see nice alternatives for. I'm trying to find out if it's worth my time to find a solution, or to what degree I alienate 15-20% of my target audience if I don't.

So my question to those without a QWERTY-like layout. When you started learning programming in a language that uses \[, \], { and } quite often, how much of a hurdle was this to learn how to type, and after learning it, how much of an annoyance is it still to type them?

learnprogramming,Starting Over with a BSCS degree,"So I have my B.S. Computer Science degree in about 2 weeks, and honestly I do not like to say it, but I feel like my brain has been in a bit of a mush especially with regard to my CS degree. I know that while I have coded extensively in the past, as well as the first 2 years of my college career essentially being focused on coding at the more fundamental levels, the higher level courses for my last 2 has mainly been theory and mathematics based, and while I enjoy certain aspect of it, I also have taken two minors in addition that may have adjusted courses in my brain, and now I don't really know where I can start. I haven't coded much of any substantial especially in the past 24 months, as majority of my time has been spent on interview, essays, work, and so forth. 

Now starting in 2025, I want to get back and dip my toe into programming again. I have built a 3D printer that is not working for some reason and I also want to splurge on a few new hardwares starting in 2025 specifically to focus on streaming, video editing, blender rendering, and of course coding. I do plan on buying a leetcode subscription and I already have a Neetcode subscription as well. 

I also want to venture out and do actual projects, and not the cookie cutter ReactJS stuffs but actual projects that can generate me some viable users. I do know that there are several avenues I could take with this route, but I primarily want to focus on video game development.

I also am aware that I need to hold myself accountable, but I don't really know how other than to meet certain metrics (get this X part of Y done by next week, get the game engine functioning in 4 weeks, etc). I don't really know how else to venture this topic, but I do plan on also interviewing and hopefully visiting the city I want to live in as well as continue my current part-time job and turn it into full-time as well if nothing else goes right, but it really comes down to what I can do at the moment, which is 5 whole days of free time usually.

learnprogramming,Writing a text editor. what's best solution to syntax parser/lexer nowadays?,"First, some word definitions (correct me if i'm wrong)
- lexer: tokenizes text for syntax highlighting but does not analyze syntax structure.
- syntax parser / parser: parses code into a syntax tree (AST). basically, lexer + structure

So far, i've found 3+1 viable solutions:
- Tree sitter (parser)
- Scintilla (lexer)
- Clang
- Custom parser/lexer

So, my assumptions/observations is that:

    1. tree sitter generates an accurate AST (abstract syntax tree), 
        - is advertised to run asynchronously and parse ""incrementally""
        - Seems to takes more cpu/ram
    
    2. scintilla parses flat list of tokens, 
    e.g. recognizes if the token is type, variable, data, function declaration, etc. 
        - is NOT advertised to run asynchronously, but i see no reason why it couldn't do that. 
        - i don't know if it parses ""incrementally"". 
        - Seems to take less cpu/ram.

    3. Clang bascially is supposed to be more acurate tree sitter, it's litteraly the compiler.
        - Only c/c++
        - The api will probably be complex &amp; hard to use.

Another note: one feature I like from editor called ""Geany"" - it uses information prased by lexer to do syntax highlighting (obviously), as well as code navigation.

I don't understand why so many editors do tedious task of syntax highlighting a document, only for an lsp to do the SAME TASK again. it does parsing the same document TWICE. That's one of the reason why i'm writing a text editor btw.",dirty-sock-coder-64,1h68jqd,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h68jqd/writing_a_text_editor_whats_best_solution_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h68jqd/writing_a_text_editor_whats_best_solution_to/,2024-12-04 05:15:12,2,0.75,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h68jqd

learnprogramming,Which Programming Languages Do LLMs Understand Best? ,"
I’ve been wondering if there’s any research or data about which programming languages large language models (LLMs) have the most context and understanding of.

It seems logical that LLMs would perform better with certain languages, likely because those languages are more widely used or have a larger amount of online data available for training. For example, if we compare Dart and Flutter (a relatively young language and framework, still evolving with frequent major updates) to Java and the Spring Framework (a long-standing and stable language and framework with extensive documentation and enterprise adoption), I’d expect LLMs to perform better with the latter.

This makes sense: Java and Spring have been around for decades, are widely adopted, and likely have more documentation, examples, and discussions available online. This probably means LLMs were trained on more comprehensive datasets for these technologies.

But how much does this actually affect the quality of the code generated by LLMs? Does it impact how well they can assist programmers in building projects or learning certain languages/frameworks?

I’m particularly curious about how this plays out for developers who rely on AI for daily coding tasks. Does the maturity and stability of a language or framework make a noticeable difference in the ease of use, or does AI bridge that gap? If anyone has insights, research, or anecdotes, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

learnprogramming,The gap between the learning environment and the real cases,"I'm really confused by the environment when learning programming. They are always command line, shell, console or whatever, with bulks of similar concepts come up like module, library, framework. And the only usage of it seems to be that you can see the output on the screen when run it.

However, what you actually use or see everyday is softwares in desktop or apps in smartphone that are much more vivid and touchable. There is **HUGE GAP** between the environment and the actual cases. And what's worse is that no one try to make it clear and the beginners have to keep the confusion unresolved by patience until they walk through the path nearly till the end, or they just give up which might the most cases.

As for me, I tried to learn programming at least 8 times in the past 20 years, ranging from BASIC, C, VB, VBA, Javascript, R, SQL, Python. All were abandoned(except for SQL as it has to be used in daily work) following the same route:  passionate, make a little progress, confused(no resolved), boring, give up, till the next passionate period come.

Sometimes I was thinking that if there were any method that could motivate the niwbie by bridging the gap when I was caught up in the confusion, I would have arrived the learning curve's final end safely in the first time.

I can still remember how disappointed and discouraged I was when I was taught to test my toy code in the Turbo-C blue screen when learning C language. At that time you had been already  surrounded by the fabulous and splendid websites and mulimedia, whereas you are still learning the basics in an ancient environment which makes the question always pops up: is this really the staff build the product?

Many years ago I've heard a solo developer of one popular music player said the player was written by VC6(seems to be a quite old programming language). I was wondering 'How could that be?'. I mean, how could the boring text statements print, def, if else, for while ... become the final apps/softwares we've seen and used?

I had the confusion then, and it seems still the same for beginners now, because no lessons fill this confusion gap. All of them just teach how to print, how to define a variable/list/function, how to loop, etc., in front of a black text-based screen.

How much time is left to see the real power of programming to build real things?

As a beginner, particularly in web dev, you should know: 
- Basics of HTML and CSS 
- Basic JS syntax - variables, arrays, loops, data types, objects, operators, conditionals, functions, etc.
 - Also try to get a firm understanding of async/await and promises. This will be crucial for working on web apps.


After this, begin learning about the web. Get an overview to understand how the frontend, backend and databases interact with each other.


Learn about Git/Github and why source control (aka saving your code) is important and learn a few commands such as changing directory, listing files and making a new directory.


From here, choose a frontend framework such as React and/or Next.js, a backend framework such as Express and SQL for either Postgres or MySQL.

Now stop! 


Congratulations, you're now equipped to start building projects. Notice how I didn't tell you to spend hours upon hours watching YouTube tutorials. Or how I didn't tell you to learn all the advanced topics of each language and framework.


The main point is that you don’t need to know everything. You don't need to be an ""expert"". You can learn the rest along the way using Google, YouTube, Stack Overflow and AI. Building projects will speed up your learning x10. 


But now you're wondering what to even build?? My advice is to build something that might solve a problem for yourself or build a clone of an app you’re intrigued about.

learnprogramming,need help starting a budget tracking program for beginner programming project,"Hey,  

I’ve heard that the best way to learn programming is through real-world projects, so I decided that I want to create a budget tracking app to manage my personal finances (for now on PC/CLI project). I want to build it in Go since that’s the language I’m currently learning during my internship, but I’m still a beginner and not sure if it’s the best choice.  

I planned to make it a simple command-line app to focus on learning the basics, but I keep getting stuck, even at the start. For example:  
- How do I create a “test account”?  
- How do I handle a transaction?  
- How can I track income and expenses?  

I’ve tried Googling but never found clear answers. There are YouTube tutorials for similar projects, but I feel like just copying code wouldn’t really teach me anything.  

Does anyone have advice on how to approach a project like this? How do you break it into steps when you’re stuck even at the beginning?

I have a situation where i have lets say retail stores that have a location each (latitude, longitude) in my java spring API. 
And now im looking for a way to serve this points for a “search nearest” use case and a “map with locations” use case.

Now im having a difficult time finding a decent way to do this . I know that i could use a db function like ST_SPHERE_DISTANCE from a center point with range and filter by that . But this is pretty expensive on the DB as it has to calculate for all values . 

I also thought about bounding box wich is fine but still some heavy calculations when the range is large and we account for earths being round. 

I have done some research and found two other ideas .

One using a sort of a tilemap? But im kinda lost on how i would go about this . And another using z-order that i somewhat understand .
Id like to know if anyone has ever encountered this issue and has any ideia how to proceed here. Im having an hard time finding info on this online

I’d like to ask for your help.

I’m 15 years old and want to use these last two years of high school to start studying programming intensively, focusing on backend development with Java.

I recently bought and am currently reading Understanding Algorithms, and I’m enjoying it a lot. On my reading list, I still have:
	•	Code Complete 2
	•	SICP
	•	The Pragmatic Programmer
	•	Clean Agile
	•	Head First Java
	•	Java Concurrency in Practice

And once I gain more experience, Effective Java.

I also got some Udemy courses to learn other areas:

Algorithms and Logic of Programming – Nélio Alves
	
Front-End Development – HTML, CSS, JS, React (I got this one specifically to learn React)

Complete Java: Object-Oriented Programming – Nélio Alves

(They are brazilian courses, so i dont expect anyone to know their veracity, so count them as they arent here)
