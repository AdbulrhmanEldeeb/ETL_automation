learnprogramming,My life as a full stack developer is a joke and a waste of time ,"
I’m a full-stack developer with 3 years of experience. I have worked with frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), and backend (Java: springboot, Python: Flask, basic NLP/ML). The issue is that I constantly switch between stacks in my work. For the past 3–4 months, I have been working with Java, but now I can’t even remember the syntax for frontend technologies, not even basic HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. I feel like an idiot who has wasted 3 years. How can I have worked on something and not even remember it? I was embarrassed because, during an interview, I was asked a React question, and I couldn’t code. Then, I was asked a Java question, and I couldn’t code that either.

learnprogramming,What I wish I knew when so I could’ve escaped tutorial hell earlier.,"""Stop spending so much time watching tutorials and start building projects."" You've heard this advice a lot but you ask yourself, ""Am I ready?"" The answer is probably yes.


As a beginner, particularly in web dev, you should know: 
- Basics of HTML and CSS 
- Basic JS syntax - variables, arrays, loops, data types, objects, operators, conditionals, functions, etc.
 - Also try to get a firm understanding of async/await and promises. This will be crucial for working on web apps.


After this, begin learning about the web. Get an overview to understand how the frontend, backend and databases interact with each other.


Learn about Git/Github and why source control (aka saving your code) is important and learn a few commands such as changing directory, listing files and making a new directory.


From here, choose a frontend framework such as React and/or Next.js, a backend framework such as Express and SQL for either Postgres or MySQL.


Learn the basics of these, including how to build a page with basic interface on the frontend and make API calls, learn how to create an API endpoint/routes on the backend, how to connect to a database of your choice and how to query it.  


Now stop! 


Congratulations, you're now equipped to start building projects. Notice how I didn't tell you to spend hours upon hours watching YouTube tutorials. Or how I didn't tell you to learn all the advanced topics of each language and framework.


The main point is that you don’t need to know everything. You don't need to be an ""expert"". You can learn the rest along the way using Google, YouTube, Stack Overflow and AI. Building projects will speed up your learning x10. 


But now you're wondering what to even build?? My advice is to build something that might solve a problem for yourself or build a clone of an app you’re intrigued about.

Currently, I am a 9th grade student and a person of the beautiful country of Vietnam :)

My wish is to get into a top school in the city I live in, and of course with my passion for programming (IT), my wish is to pass this subject.

But recently, I feel like I am not doing well:

\- There are many problems that I cannot solve (thinking for a long time and have no solution). Even some of them when I know the answer are surprisingly simple!

\- I can do some problems, but the problem is that I cannot handle all the test cases, only a few of them. Some of the questions I know why I made mistakes and made mistakes, some I don't even know where I made mistakes (I even thought the test was wrong lol). This is also the most difficult thing for me because of course when taking the test I can only submit my questions once but most of the questions I don't get a full test.

\- That's the most frustrating thing for me, I feel like I'm not making any progress and just standing still, this makes me especially worried and almost lose confidence in myself.

Have any of you here gone through or are going through this stage? Have you ever felt a loss of confidence, doubted your abilities? Have you ever felt discouraged and wanted to give up?

learnprogramming,The gap between the learning environment and the real cases,"I'm really confused by the environment when learning programming. They are always command line, shell, console or whatever, with bulks of similar concepts come up like module, library, framework. And the only usage of it seems to be that you can see the output on the screen when run it.

However, what you actually use or see everyday is softwares in desktop or apps in smartphone that are much more vivid and touchable. There is **HUGE GAP** between the environment and the actual cases. And what's worse is that no one try to make it clear and the beginners have to keep the confusion unresolved by patience until they walk through the path nearly till the end, or they just give up which might the most cases.

As for me, I tried to learn programming at least 8 times in the past 20 years, ranging from BASIC, C, VB, VBA, Javascript, R, SQL, Python. All were abandoned(except for SQL as it has to be used in daily work) following the same route:  passionate, make a little progress, confused(no resolved), boring, give up, till the next passionate period come.

Sometimes I was thinking that if there were any method that could motivate the niwbie by bridging the gap when I was caught up in the confusion, I would have arrived the learning curve's final end safely in the first time.

I can still remember how disappointed and discouraged I was when I was taught to test my toy code in the Turbo-C blue screen when learning C language. At that time you had been already  surrounded by the fabulous and splendid websites and mulimedia, whereas you are still learning the basics in an ancient environment which makes the question always pops up: is this really the staff build the product?

Many years ago I've heard a solo developer of one popular music player said the player was written by VC6(seems to be a quite old programming language). I was wondering 'How could that be?'. I mean, how could the boring text statements print, def, if else, for while ... become the final apps/softwares we've seen and used?

I had the confusion then, and it seems still the same for beginners now, because no lessons fill this confusion gap. All of them just teach how to print, how to define a variable/list/function, how to loop, etc., in front of a black text-based screen.

How much time is left to see the real power of programming to build real things?

learnprogramming,help on coding,"Your task is to create a program that emulates a Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher was a documented cryptography technique used by the Romans that involved ""shifting"" the alphabet. In our modern alphabet we have 26 letters, so for example, if we were to ""shift"" the letters in a word forward by two places, ""cat"" would then become ""ecv"". An example of a word shifted forward by 5 places would be ""dinosaur"" becoming ""instxfzw"".
Your program must prompt the user for TWO pieces of input:
A word to be encoded in either upper or lower case;
A number of places that word should be shifted (positive values move forward in the alphabet and negative values move backwards in the alphabet)
Your program must then be able to manipulate this inputted word to correctly output the encoded word.
You should accomplish this by creating a Class to handle the calculations. This class must include:
Constructor(s)
Void Method(s) to perform the encryption
toString() return Method for the main file to print out
Things to consider:
The user could enter a negative number, meaning that the alphabet would need to shift backwards.
The user could enter the wrong case of letter accidentally... make sure to compensate for this.
The alphabet is 26 letters long - what happens when we try to shift the letter ""z"" forward by a number of places? How can we solve this problem? (HINT: a math operator is one way to solve this...)
Likewise with the letter ""a"" shifting backwards by a number of places? How can we solve this problem? (HINT: a math operator combined with a type of looping is one way to solve this...)

learnprogramming,Question for non-QWERTY-like keyboard users (e.g. AZERTY / QWERTZ),"I'm developing a programming language specifically for people who will probably never do a lot of programming. I aim to have my target audience make as few changes as possible to their daily lives, and learn as few new things as possible, in order for them to get the benefit of programming that I want them to have. One factor of that is the symbols used in the language's syntax and their accessibility on various keyboard layouts.

After some research I found that about 15-20% of people who have daily personal access to a desktop or laptop computer do not have a standard QWERTY-like layout. On those non-standard layouts, the way to type certain symbols such as \~, \^ and \\ is quite hidden. Those I could quite easily not use in my syntax. But apparently the same holds for  \[, \], { and }, which I don't see nice alternatives for. I'm trying to find out if it's worth my time to find a solution, or to what degree I alienate 15-20% of my target audience if I don't.

So my question to those without a QWERTY-like layout. When you started learning programming in a language that uses \[, \], { and } quite often, how much of a hurdle was this to learn how to type, and after learning it, how much of an annoyance is it still to type them? Secondarily, the same question but for \~, \^ and \\.",vuurdier,1h6glch,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6glch/question_for_nonqwertylike_keyboard_users_eg/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6glch/question_for_nonqwertylike_keyboard_users_eg/,2024-12-04 13:57:27,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6glch

learnprogramming,Configuration ,"I am learning React , in particular testing. 
I am amazed  at the amount of configuration that is necessary, is eye opening. It’s as if swimming through the things one has to do detracts from actually learning the principles . Js is the only ecosystem I have experienced. 
Are other ecosystems like this ? Is it possible to learn , to get to the heart of programming , unhindered by the distraction of seemingly endless configuration . Maybe it’s my lack of experience that is the problem .

learnprogramming,Best Practices for Synchronizing Supabase Auth and Local Database in a NestJS App,"Hey everyone,

I'm building a NestJS app and using **Supabase** for authentication, but I also want to save user data in my **local PostgreSQL database** for extended functionality and to keep full control over my app's data. Here's my current setup and the challenges I’m working through:

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What’s the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?
* How do you handle rollbacks or retries in case of partial failures?
* Any tips for optimizing this flow for scalability and maintaining clean code?",Aymsep,1h6f3ix,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6f3ix/best_practices_for_synchronizing_supabase_auth/,2024-12-04 12:43:36,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6f3ix
