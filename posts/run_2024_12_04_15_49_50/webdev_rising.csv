I'm not a dev by any stretch but I do dabble. Lately I've been working on a project and I'm testing on a dev. server. When I make changes to JS files or CSS files, the browser always shows me the cached version of the file!

While I'm comfortable translating designs (e.g. from Figma) into code, I'm struggling with the creative side of web design. Whenever I attempt to create designs from scratch, they end up looking flat, minimalistic (and not in the good way), or old school.

I'd love to improve my design skills - nothing fancy, just aiming to create clean, professional-looking sites for now.Â **What resources helped you level up your design game?**Â I'm interested in everything:

webdev,Looking for 8 developers who wanna expand their network,"Hey everyone,

We built a network/platform where professionals meet with fellows via scheduled video calls. We as a community believe that this is a better way as an initial contact than follows and direct messages.  
Our platform is **open for free, invite-only access**, currently.

How to Join?

Please share your LinkedIn or any other professional social media URL of yours via comment or pm (if you don't wanna reveal it publicly). I am going to drop an invitation code to you via dm.  
Feel free to ask your questions publicly in a comment below.

Whom is it best for?

It's perfect for entrepreneurs, indie hackers, developers, designers, social media marketers, and more. The common point of our community is an **entrepreneurial mindset** and **business focus**.

What would be the gain?

A strong network is our need as a member of the community. We need an audience for our products, clients for our services, and professionals to hire them or make them hire us. First-time meeting people in need would work much less than asking people already in our network that we build via more than just following each other or direct messages. And this is the network where you meet people face-to-face without immediate requests/needs.",yigitagcam,1h6jbo6,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6jbo6/looking_for_8_developers_who_wanna_expand_their/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6jbo6/looking_for_8_developers_who_wanna_expand_their/,2024-12-04 15:52:49,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6jbo6

webdev,"How do server-sent event ""streams"" work on a lower level?","Hi, and sorry for the lack of a tl;dr; - I'm not sure how to get away from providing the context. Basically I'm interested in connecting to a web server and consuming [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) using a lower level HTTP API and am hoping somebody can explain how the push vs pull of these events might work at a lower level.

I'm working on a hardware project (ESP32-S3 / espressif ESP-IDF based) where I'm writing C with a bit of higher level abstraction to support HTTP interactions. For example, the methods I might call are:

* `esp_http_client_open()`: Open the HTTP connection with write_len parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set write_len=0 for read-only connection.
* `esp_http_client_fetch_headers()`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). 
* `esp_http_client_read()`: Read the HTTP stream
* `esp_http_client_close()`: Close the connection.

([more examples / docs are here if you're currious](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client.html#http-stream))

Now what I'm trying to figure out is what `esp_http_client_read()` actually is doing in terms of the server to client communication. When I connect to a server over HTTP, and assuming `keep-alive`, I can call `esp_http_client_read()` every millisecond, or I can wait 100 milliseconds and call it. Both ""work"" in that if there is no data being sent from the server, nothing will happen, and if there is data, I'll read it and be able to do something with it. _edit: for clarity because it may be non-obvious, my intention is to have my hardware device connect to a server and stay connected to it indefinitely, waiting for the server to send data using server-sent events - so picture a while(true) loop, but I'm responsible myself for checking when new data comes in_

But I don't have a good sense of what it means to ""read data"" in an already open HTTP stream. As far as I'm aware, for this type of connection (which is similar as far as I understand to a chunked response), nothing is communicated to the server asking for more data for example, it's certainly not like an additional HTTP request is being made. I'm guessing ""read data"" just checks some sort of lower level buffer handled by the WiFi chip or some lower subsystem. I'm guessing if I chose to ""read data"" from an HTTP connection the server is none the wiser. 

That said, I also might 100% wrong, and perhaps (like other forms of communication) part of the underlying protocol is a message to the server that you've read data. This might not be important to the server, but perhaps it acts as a sort of heartbeat. 

My end goal here is to understand how often I should call ""read data"" in my code optimizing for quickly getting updates from the server but also not having any negative impact on the server or taking up needless CPU cycles by reading data every millisecond when once every 50ms would suffice for my needs. 

I'm hoping somebody in the web dev community who perhaps has more experience or a better understanding of lower level HTTP ""stuff"" might be able to understand the spirit of what I'm asking and help me understand.

webdev,Would you use this Prototype Tool,"Hi guys, I am building this online tool that is very similar to codepen and other like it, except I needed some features so I made my own clone.

Added festures:
- Built in AI chats with conversation history, branching, and support for local ollama integration 
- straightforward Versioning system
- dev and prod code deployment 
- ability to host single file (js or css) or complete build
- Notes sections to keep track of todos, write docs, or any other note tasks.
- multiple projects
- cdn management 
- ability to preview work as you code in a separate tab

I see a tool like this can be very useful, but I'm very biase since I made this baby.
