I know it's emotionally loaded, but I wanted to know if there's triggers in the movie (such as suicide and things like that?) It seems like there is but is it the kind of movie that leaves you suicidally depressed by the end? I've avoided reading critics about it as I wanted to have a spontaneous experience.

movies,Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before,"Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, ""But where's his brother?"", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.

- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.

- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. ""Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic."" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of ""There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!"" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.

- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (""I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box""). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the ""real"" prestige.

Great fucking movie.
