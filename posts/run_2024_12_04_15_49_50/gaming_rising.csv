gaming,I've never felt worse buying CoD.,"Been playing CoD since CoD3. I bought BO6 yesterday and played multiplayer for a few hours. Since the original MW2 I always bought every 3rd or so game in the series, because maybe after 2 to 4 ""new"" games they would have actually added one new feature. I still knew I was being charged $65 for what should be a patch I waited too long for, but I had fun. The last CoD I played was MW2019 (entry I played before that was BO3) and I had a great time with both.

I didn't even realize playing BO6 that its FIVE! (FIVE!!!!) games after MW19 and the only change was omni movement? Omni movement affects and helps my playstyle more than most and I still don't care. I've regretted buying games before, but this time I'm just pissed. Everyone please make fun of me for paying $75 so that I ""get"" to unlock the same acog scope for the same ak for the 20th time. I'm an idiot. Don't be like me.

gaming,How do I fill the hole that finishing Titanfall 2 left in me?,"After a lot of recommendations, I bought Titanfall 2 this steam sale. What I didn't know is how short this game is. As I started to become accustomed to it's gameplay and mechanics especially controlling the Titan, it ended and man i haven't been this disappointed in a while. I was really enjoying the mission design, the unique platforming, the dynamic between BT and pilot and ther overall badass feeling of controlling a giant mech.

Unfortunately for me though, I can really play online multiplayer as I don't think there are SEA servers for this game. 

Anyways I was hoping you guys could recommend me some games which offer the same unique gameplay as Titanfall 2.

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't have to buy weapons or armor. There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.
