movies,Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before,"Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, ""But where's his brother?"", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.

- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.

- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. ""Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic."" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of ""There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!"" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.

- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (""I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box""). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the ""real"" prestige.

Great fucking movie.

movies, Park Chan-wook's Decision to Leave and how it embraces modern tech ,"This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.

Decision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and ""smart"" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.

This is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.

1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices

* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.
* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.
* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners
* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app
* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)
* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to ""point"") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.
* The ""captain's log"" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app
* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up
* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.

1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.

* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.
* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband
* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband

1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices

* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.
* I like the ""switch"" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks
* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear
* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly

Overall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.

movies,Thriller fans should check out The Last Stop In Yuma County,"This is highly impressive debut by Francis Galluppi, who's set to direct the next Evil Dead movie. It's a single-locatio thriller that takes place in a diner in the middle of a desert highway. Two of the guests are bank robbers who are on the run but their car has run out of gas, and one of them is played by a truly menacing Richard Brake. It's similar to movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Hate, and The Standoff at Sparrow Creek in that it's only a matter of time until the tension erupts into violence, but Galluppi does a great job at squeezing tension out of the littlest moments until the poop hits the fan.

After seeing this, I'm interested to see what Galluppi brings to the Evil Dead franchise, as he knows how to build simmering tension, unleash violence, and sprinkle it with some dark humor.

movies,Modern tropes you're tired of,"I can't think of any recent movie where the grade school child isn't written like an adult who is more mature, insightful, and capable than the actual adults.

They almost never write kids like an actual kid.

movies,Horror films without omnipotent villains,"Hi all,

I watch a decent amount of horror films and a trope that I hate in the genre is when the villains are seemingly omnipotent by which I mean this like:

1. They win no matter what
2. Nothing they do ever fails in any way
3. Nothing the main characters do has any impact on the outcome
4. Even if the main characters destroy/win somehow the villain is just back at the end

This can look a lot of ways depending on the kind of villain in the film but the principal is similar. 

I personally find these kids of endings really boring I think because they feel totally unreal and not analogous to the real world as I perceive it. I once complained about this regarding a specific movie and a friend said she loved the ending because it was realistic (she's a very cynical person). 

I'm wondering what you guys think of this trope on general. Anyone else find it boring and tired like me?

Also do any of you have any suggestions for good horror films that somehow subvert this?

Films that I think subvert this and are good include:
The Orphanage (Spanish film)
Babadook
Alien
The mist (though holy hell that ending has it's own problems lol)

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nosferatu_2024) \- 93% (57 Reviews)
* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \- 83 (24 Reviews)

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):

&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director’s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):

&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):

&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.

[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):

&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):

&gt;Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):

&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.

[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):

&gt;It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):

&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):

&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.

The Independent (100):

&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.

Written and Directed by Robert Eggers:

&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.

Release Date: December 25

Cast:

* Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok
* Nicholas Hoult as Thomas Hutter

movies,Gone Baby Gone (2007) is the ultimate moral conundrum on film. Lots of spoilers.,"I first saw Gone Baby Gone the day it opened in theaters, mostly because I was more curious to see how Ben Affleck's directorial debut turned out after four years of him being the punchline of every Bennifer joke in existence throughout that weird period in pop culture. But also because I saw it was an adaptation of another Boston-set Dennis Lehane novel, and Mystic River became an instant favorite of mine in late 2003, and everything I'd read about the novel Gone Baby Gone convinced me this was gonna be another Lehane multi-layered mystery tragedy. I loved it after leaving the theater, but I didn't expect it to stick with me as long as it did. Patrick's decision to get Jack Doyle arrested once he figured out the entire conspiracy behind Amanda's kidnapping making all the other characters hate him for giving Amanda back to her mother is one of the reasons it stuck with me; I kept asking myself over and over if he made the right decision. Was doing the legally correct thing the morally correct choice?

When it was released on DVD and I got to rewatch it, it finally hit me why the ending stuck with me so much; other than Helene going right back to her old self now that Amanda was home safely, Amanda correcting Patrick on her doll's name hit me like a fucking Mack truck. Throughout the entire movie, Amanda being taken while in possession of her doll named Mirabelle is mentioned several times; Patrick, now on babysitting duty because Helene didn't think to hire one for her date with a ""fan"" of her talk show interviews, sees Amanda playing with her doll and asks, ""Is that Mirabelle?"" Little Amanda responds with ""Annabelle"". 

Now, it's entirely possible this was a new doll purchased for Amanda after Mirabelle took a dip in that quarry's lake, but the look on Patrick's face before it cuts to the credits tells me he realized in that moment that **no one,** not even Amanda's aunt who hired and then stiffed Patrick and Angie, knew the actual name of Amanda's doll, since the media reported multiple times that Amanda had her ""doll named Mirabelle"". Helene and Bea likely would've corrected the record that the doll's name was Annabelle since they were the only two characters who actually wanted the mystery of Amanda's kidnapping solved. But no one corrected the record, so ""Mirabelle"" was the name mentioned several times *until* Amanda corrected Patrick; it's that look on his face as [Alexi Murdoch's ""Through the Dark""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPng8o3zDqM) starts playing that made me realize why this movie stuck with me so much. Patrick put his life and relationship on the line to save this little girl for a woman whom everyone else saw as the drug addicted neglectful horror show of a mother she had been, and lost pretty much everything for doing it: Angie left him and hated him for ripping Amanda away from the nice police captain in the nice, safe home and giving her back to Helene and *didn't* even get paid for all the shit he and Angie went through.

Patrick is the ***only*** character who sees how much pain and torment Helene is experiencing, which explains his ultimate decision and why Angie hates him for it; Angie was never around to see how truly sorry Helene was for her actions leading to Amanda's kidnapping. While others, and the audience, may rightfully disagree with Patrick's decision, pay attention to the times when Helene breaks down on your next rewatch, and you'll better understand why Patrick chose the way he did; no one else saw that side of Helene, they just saw the drug addicted neglectful mother, which was used as the justification for a whole bunch of crimes. Also, I think Patrick's Catholic guilt over executing Corwin Earle was another big deciding factor in him trying to do what he saw as the morally and legally correct choice, and Remy's little motivational speech -- which got the ball rolling for Patrick to realize the truth behind Amanda's kidnapping -- outside the hospital did *nothing* to relieve Patrick's guilt, nor did Angie's pride in Patrick for it. And *goddamn* was Ed Harris a fucking powerhouse in that scene outside the hospital after Nick was shot. If 2007 hadn't been so stacked with amazing Supporting Acting nominations, including Casey Affleck himself as Robert Ford, I'm betting Harris would've been nominated, even if he had *zero* chance of beating Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh.

I also think it's interesting how the *major* mystery of the movie is seemingly solved an hour before the movie ends. But as this was yet another Dennis Lehane multi-layered crime mystery, it makes sense. Little Amanda running out that door and happily jumping into Doyle's arms was one of the biggest mind fucks in a movie since finding out that Dave Boyle was &gt;!entirely innocent of Katie Markum's murder, that he'd actually murdered a pedophile\*!&lt; in Mystic River, making [""The last time I saw Dave Boyle was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9k-uO50300) one of the most tragic movie quotes of this first quarter century. Doyle's entire justification speech to convince Patrick not to report this is the centerpiece of the story's main thesis on doing what's legally or morally correct, which is also apparently the main topic of the [novel's sequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_\(novel\)) Angie's tearful ""She's happy here. I saw her."" does nothing to help Patrick's difficult decision.

Fuck, I love this movie. It's a great addition to the New England Tragedy pentalogy dominated by the brothers Affleck: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Manchester by the Sea. Oh, and it needs to be said that Harry Gregson-Williams' scores for this and The Town are some of the most haunting film scores in the last 20 years.

And RIP to both Michael K. Williams -- still weird to see him in a police uniform after knowing him as Omar Little for so long -- and John Ashton, who just passed away in September.

A prequel of how Nicomund the Red came to be Santa. Seriously Hollywood, after the sequel you gotta get on this! :D

My idea could be it had something to do with the Norse Gods as it was Odin who bestowed Nicomund the Red with immortality as he became Santa Claus to atone for his sins, and his hammer skullcrusher having been forged by the dwarf brothers Brokkr and Eitri and they're actually amongst Santa's helpers who decided to take them in at the North Pole alongside his elves after Ragnarok occurred killing the Norse Gods.

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in San Marino. As expected, it wasn't easy to find any movie that fits to the criteria here, but I think, we've found a winner which in a way reflects the heart of this journey very well: ***Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino*** (engl.: *The Unknown Man of San Marino*) is absolutely one of those hidden gems I hoped to find during this project.

Today, I think, it will be easier again to find movies and to be honest, I think, that it's very easy to guess the winner that will take its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). We turn our attention to **Serbia** and, as always, have only two rules to follow:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

But I'm confused about its ending. Why did Ruby's husband want to kill Mary?

In my opinion, Mary did nothing wrong with Ruby. She just fulfilled Ruby's desire. Ruby would like to transform her body like a doll (transforming the private parts like a doll). Marry accepted to operate surgery because Ruby gave her a bunch of money for that. Then Rudy got doll-like body. Ruby's husband tried to kill Mary when he found out that his wife body is like a doll.

movies,Scenes that need to be freeze-framed because blink and you missed it.,"I don't mean movies that have freeze frames themselves, like Clark punching the air at the end of The Breakfast Club. More like you choosing to pause the movie at a particular scene because it's revealing in some way interesting or revelatory or funny. Basically scenes that contain details you may miss the first time viewing.

For example there is that famous head splitting scene from T2 that you need to freeze the frame to see. Guy's head splits before being shot at. [https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png](https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png)

But I prefer more focus on interesting details in scenes than ""mistakes.""

movies,They Live (1988) and it's concept ,"It was in my watchlist for such a long time, finally decided to watch it and blew me away completely. John Carpenter is a visionary! Has anyone of you saw it in the theatres? Or were you there when it was released?

Have you seen Men In Black or The Matrix or Fight Club? This movie felt like it had all of that! And maybe somewhat an inspiration for the movie I mentioned.

They Live dir. By *John Carpenter* is a story of a man, played by Roddy Piper who has come to City in search of a job, but is shocked when he sees the _*reality of this world*_. There are aliens living among us, and they are controlling everything.

Advertisements, News Channels, Politics, everything... everything is a LIE. They are controlling us with different mediums, changing our Subconscious mind and bending our reality, turning us into servants, into Livestock. 

_""We are Sleeping, They are living.""_

If you're someone who is into Illuminati, Secret Society, you'll love this film.

Though some moments felt janky in acting, but that's because the lead is probably the first WWF Turned Actor. Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.

This movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.

movies,Heat (1995)….Most beautiful movie line I’ve heard ,"In Heat… there’s 2 parts that stick out to me… many great scenes overall

But when Val Kilmer’s character tells DeNiro “for me the sun rises and sets with her” when talking about his wife and why he can’t leave her. Then at the end… they are both in a relationship where they fight a lot.. both have been unfaithful and she’s ready to turn him in. But when she sees his innocent genuine smile when he sees her, she can’t bring herself to go against him and realizes she still loves him despite all their issues and signals to him to run away. I loved that dynamic

Also the part where the Dennis Heybert’s character (the AllState commercial guy) is sitting with his gf and he feels like a failure. He tells her “why you rolling around with me for?” and starts crying. And she reassures him and tells him because she’s proud of him for trying. 

2 scenes/dynamics that are relatable and just hit deep. One is a relationship that has had many issues and in turmoil but deep down, the two still love eachother. The other is a man who feels like he can’t offer nothing and the woman is reassuring him that he is enough.",HeightsGringo180,1h4zhqt,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4zhqt/heat_1995most_beautiful_movie_line_ive_heard/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4zhqt/heat_1995most_beautiful_movie_line_ive_heard/,2024-12-02 16:51:32,298,0.9,298,0,180,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4zhqt

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

movies,"It’s about time we talk about LA Story (1991) written and starring Steve Martin, is this his best comedy? ","I remember watching this with my parents when I was younger, prob around 95. I was born 88 so I didn’t have any ability to pick up any of the satire but I remember enjoying it.

I have a bad habit of not rewatching movies I’ve seen since there’s so much out there, no matter how young I was when I first saw it, but my wife showed me a clip from the film off Instagram and we laughed and decided to give it a try and let me tell you it blew us away. We were crying laughing while totally engaged. 

It’s a perfect LA satire and probably the only American Magical Realism film I’ve ever seen (I’m more familiar with the genre coming from Mexico).  Everything is pitch perfect. It’s a tight 91 minutes, edited beautifully, perfect writing from Steve Martin, directed as only I could imagine it and the casting is insane. Every side character and bit part is an amazing character actor from the 90s. 

And the leads are played beautifully by Richard Grant who I know from his performance in Withnail and I. Victoria tennent plays the love interest who is a beautiful actress who got stuck with bad roles most her career, but honestly Sarah Jessica Parker steals the show with her pre-emptive manic pixie dream girl. 

I think this is a movie that although critically acclaimed went over most peoples heads and was forgotten. But I sit here now thinking it’s just leapt to my favorite comedy of all time. It’s so sharp and witty and well executed and magical and of it’s time. I don’t think anyone can argue that Steve Martin is a comedic writing force and it shows in this movie. 

If you haven’t seen it watch it as soon as you can, if you have what do you think about my analysis and how it’s held up and its legacy. I’d love to hear your thoughts.

movies,"Were the Detectives at the beginning of ""A Bronx Tale"" Paid off/Fake cops?","Just a thought i Had while rewatching A Bronx Tale at the part where the 2 detectives ask C who the shooter was. I thought it because It's just really strange, Firstly them knowing C was a witness, how would they know that? Did a witness tell them? And if so why didn't they ask THAT witness what they thought rather than the child, furthermore how did that witness know what C's name was? Secondly, they never bring C or Lorenzo to a police station or something that looks more formal, they just line some guys up on the street and ask C who did it, And Thirdly all the suspects were in the mafia. There's more, like how they're both Italian American And It's a very strange way to ask a witness what they thought. As to why the Mafia would do this, It's likely a way to see if they thought C was worthy of becoming a mobster later in life as they've seen him at the bar before looking at sonny, though Sonny wasn't the boss at this point so this might be unlikely, It's also possible this was just to determine if they should kill C or silence him somehow incase the Real police were to ask him. There's some parts that make me think otherwise, like how there is other cops there but they could easily be bribed/fake too, and that mainly, it makes sonny's character look way worse morally but then again he wouldn't be calling the shots at this point and that Mafia dressing up as police is a little silly but has happened before..

movies,Nutcrackers (2024) starring Ben Stiller ruined my day,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  
  
Nutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can’t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he’s ruined.
  
It’s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn’t exist. This is one of those times. The movie’s not entertaining, it’s not dramatic, it’s just pointless. I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  
  
Ben Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it’s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.
  
This movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.
  
Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time. You’ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs.

movies,I don't get Beau is Afraid. At all.,"Most of the time, even when I like/love a movie, I can tell why someone might disagree (I love Avatar 2, but I agree with like 90% of the criticism and see them as valid). And vice versa, even if I hate something, I can usually tell why someone might like it (Infinity Pool was hot garbage to me, but I can see where somebody can be enthralled by the premise). I cannot do that with Beau is Afraid. It's just pure ass to me. Spoilers ahead.

The plot boils down to ""A controlling mother orchestrates her son's (Beau's) journey back home, torturing him every step of the way, only to kill him in the end"". This movie is noted as an absurdist black comedy- on its Wikipedia, so this isn't my perspective-, but it's not funny. I've literally laughed more watching Saw movies. I get dark humor, but dark humor has to have a proper target. There's no rocket science. It's a two-step process: remove sympathy for the target, then hurt them in unexpected ways. Beau is Afraid seemed to have skipped step one, so it feels like watching someone drown a sack of puppies for two hours.

And the ""absurdist' angle doesn't work either. First off, all of the absurdity except for maybe the penis monster is mundane. The disparity between the scenes and reality are a light parody filter at-best. Characters weren't outrageous, they were just caricatures; I could easily see all of them in a GTA cutscene. Not old wacky GTA, but new, exaggerated-shitty-realistic GTA. Secondly, even that level of absurdity is watered down by the reveal that the mother's been orchestrating everything. Suddenly, the scenes like everything at the doctor's house and the time where everyone walked into his apartment complex become fully explained and there's no absurdity to it at all. I'll admit, the penis monster is a surprise, but it's a surprise 1:30 into the movie; it's a little late to try to establish the genre you claim to be. 

I'm not 100% hating 100% of its aspects. Visually, it has its moments, and the acting is fine, too, but good visuals and solid performances can't cover for shit writing and a hollow premise

That being said: I absolutely loved it. It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.

Why ""full circle""? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. 

The setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.

The characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.

The dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. 

And all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.

It's darkly comedic and sometimes tragic and it manages both emotions with ease.

movies,Krazy House (2024) is insane (for fans of Kevin Can F*** Himself),"Set in 1990, Krazy House starts as a typical late-80’s, early 90’s sitcom called The Christians that looks like an amalgamation of both Married with Children and King of Queens. Like those shows, it’s filmed in front of a live studio audience and starts out in a very light hearted, goofy way. Bernie Christian, the matriarch of the family, is juggling his faith and his family. He’s the stereotypical Kevin James kind of protagonist who means well, but continuously causes more problems than he’s solving. When he’s not falling down the stairs (much to the delight of the studio audience), he’s breaking everything that isn’t nailed down, much to the chagrin of his modern, breadwinning wife, Eva. His indifferent, gum smacking daughter Sarah and son Adam, a burgeoning scientist, are opportunities for life lessons about being good people and looking towards the lord. Sounds like the perfect setup for a religious TV show for those times; you know the type - a character walks through the front door and the crowd goes wild?

However, when a trio of Russian handymen show up at the door, things take a turn…and the studio audience doesn’t pop for them. See, Bernie has (as he usually does), caused a mess in the kitchen. His stew bubbles over and he messes up the sink, adding to the kitchen destruction he caused earlier when his arm caught on fire and he lit up the wall. After initially dismissing the Russians, he lets them in to fix the problem…but the problems at the Christian house have only just begun. Once the Russians are in, the show takes an insanely dark turn and it only gets more bonkers from there. While the film starts as a deconstruction of the nuclear family sitcom, it ends as a bloody mess where no one is safe.

This one is for fans of absurd horror/comedies or things skewering nostalgic TV (Late Night with the Devil, Kevin Can F\*\*\* Himself). The pacing isn't great in the second half, but it's still worth checking out.",forcefivepod,1h58ys0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h58ys0/krazy_house_2024_is_insane_for_fans_of_kevin_can/,2024-12-02 23:19:34,4,0.55,4,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,self,t3_1h58ys0

movies,Jim Carreys Grinch is the Definitive adaptation. Yeah I said it.,"Rewatched the Jim Carrey Grinch movie tonight. Idc what anyone says, this is the definitive version of the story. Don't get me wrong, the original animated short is a classic and always will be, but the Jim Carrey version will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the only Dr. Seuss film that updates the original story, while still sticking true to what the original book standed for, if not enhances it.

Not to mention the set design is absolutely phenomenal, and Jim Carrey as The Grinch is everything. Not just the makeup work, which is also phenomenal, but his performance as well. Unlike Mike Myers Cat in the Hat, who was just phoning it in to the point where it felt like he didn't even want to be there, Jim Carrey put 110% into his performance, he almost became one with the suit and captured the character perfect, while still adding his own energenic flair that Carrey is known for.

It's not perfect, not all the jokes land, I could do without seeing Grinch's face in....um......Melons, and while ""Where are you Christmas"" Is a beautiful song, in the context of the film, it feels out of place, especially since it's not a musical. But overall, I absolutely love this underrated classic, and I'm glad it's finally getting the recognition it deserves. Especially after the shit piece from Illumination.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: San Marino,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Russia. I'm not really sure, if I offended people here, but I did get quite a few downvotes for it. Fortunately, I also got some very good film suggestions (I would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants again) and we also have a winner: ***Сталкер*** (engl. Stalker), a movie by the legendary Andrei Tarkovsky, will receive the next entry in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Today, I know, that it will become much harder to just find a fitting movie, but following the alphabetical order, we move to the next letter - and this time, there are many countries waiting for us that start with an S - an S like **San Marino**, for example. And everytime there will be only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending","Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. 

Contact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. 

One of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical ""damsel in distress"" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.

I have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. 

Back to the ending: the plot holes. 

1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.

2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. 

3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a ""we'll never know"" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.

Those are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",PresentRevenue1347,1h4lwrm,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4lwrm/contact_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive_ever_seen/,2024-12-02 03:41:52,143,0.75,143,0,107,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4lwrm

movies,has joe biden ever commented on greg kinnear's portrayal of him in confirmation?,"in 2016, HBO aired the movie confirmation, a movie about the clarence thomas congressional hearings. although it's not among the most famous HBO original movies, the film was acclaimed when it was aired and was even nominated for a few awards. the film has also made several lists of the best HBO original films, which considering their filmography is no easy feat.

in my opinion, one of the best things about the movie is the performances. of course, you have kerry washington and wendell price as anita hill and clarence thomas respectively. however, another important character is joe biden since he's the one who oversaw the hearings. in the film, biden is portrayed by greg kinnear and he gives a really stellar performance in my opinion. not only is he a dead ringer for a young joe biden but he captures his mannerisms and voice perfectly. kinnear captures the essence of biden without dipping into parody and, as a result, gives one of his best performances in my opinion.

it is not uncommon for real life people who are still alive when biopics are made about them to comment on their portrayals. i'm kind of curious if joe biden himself had anything to say about kinnear's performance. does anyone know if biden has ever commented on kinnear's portrayal of him or the movie in general? i mean, the clarence thomas hearings are a pretty significant part of biden's legacy so there's no way that he isn't aware of the movie.",herequeerandgreat,1h5t9go,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,2024-12-03 17:46:31,0,0.17,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5t9go

Classics of the genre:

Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.

A Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).

The Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.

Honorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.

movies,Fracture (2007) SPOILERS,"Just seen 2007 Fracture starring Anthony Hopkins for the first time. Great movie until the ending which in my eyes completely ruined the brilliance of the film.

I cannot make sense of the ending and wonder if I am missing something?

1. Firstly, surely all the bullet in his wife's head does is proves Nunally's gun was the murder weapon. There is still nothing linking Crawford to Nunally's gun as it is mentioned in the film that the hotel camera footage has no face. 

2. Also, they switched the shells in the evidence locker so would the gun even match anymore? 

3. The double jeopardy also is very questionable. As I understand it, the case is still substantially the same so Crawford would still not be able to be tried again. 

4. Would any evidence collected in Crawford's house at the end not be void due to the restraining order? Beachum should not be there in the first place and it is essentially breaking and entering as he goes through Crawford's belongings to get the gun.

Great shame as I would have given the film a 9 up to the end which seems to completely ruin the rest of the film.

Unless ancient Mayans had the power by worship to physically cause or manifest the thing itself that was to be worshipped, then it's not a helpful explanation of its origin. 

The Creeper must have existed before or independently of the Mayans and therefore is not elementally a Mayan God.  Them possibly worshipping it explains nothing, much like any pagan civilization worshipping the sun in the sky does nothing to explain its formation. 

 When most people ask, what is the Creeper, we are looking for theories on how and when and why it came into existence. Was it naturally birthed? Intelligently designed? Is it of earthly origins? Extraterrestrial? Obviously, we don't have any answer, only guesses. But just saying it's a Mayan God is uninformative.

Before someone says it yes, i could understand it. It is not the great plot twist that it is made out to be, the plot twist is quite literally forced down your throat in the last 30 minutes. I get the first 2 hours is meant to be dream like and yes it did feel dream like, it also felt like complete wank. Every half an hour i’d tell myself “it’s going to get better” it didn’t. 
Obviously i’m in the minority with my dislike towards the film so i’m not going to act like i’m completely correct but i feel like most people force themselves to like the film because of its concept and because it’s meant to be confusing, when in reality it isn’t. 
It was all a dream. Okay? NICE, i’m pretty sure i utilised that plot twist when i was 11 and in primary school. 

Edit: 
I realised that i framed my entire dislike about the film around the fact i didn’t think the plot twist was stupendously confusing, i want it to be apparent that that’s not my main reason for disliking the film, it probably came out this way because the majority of praise i see for the film always surrounds this idea of confusion. This is ofcourse not my main reason for disliking the film, that’d be silly, i just couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it.

movies,The Three Musketeers/D’Artagnan,"This is the 2023 French production… I was interested because of Eva Green as “MiLady”.    The reliable Vincent Cassel is “Athos”.

They went for the dirty and gritty look for this one, no colorful costumes for our heroes.   Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  

We all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.
So I wonder… Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   

I can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale…. But I found this rather jarring.

movies,Everything Everywhere All At Once ending questions [SPOILERS],"I rewatched the movie again the other day and I was left with some questions about the ending that I don't know if there are implied answers, definitive answers, or ""idk it doesn't really matter"" answers.

1. Alpha Waymond said early on that you had to resist the temptation to have extended stays in other dimensions otherwise you introduce paradox. But doesn't the movie end with Evelyn in another dimension? Her original dimension is the one where she doesn't go home from the IRS, punches Deirdre, the IRS has been basically destroyed, there's a lot of murder, Waymond is aware of raccoon-Waymond and raccoon-Joy, and Eveyln pulls Alpha-Joy out of the bagel. As the movie ends, we transition to a dimension where she DID go home, she has the breakdown in the laundromat, Dierdre tells the police to let her go, they relate to each other because of the divorce papers, then she has that last emotional talk with Joy at the car. I can't tell if it is implying that Evelyn is staying in this alternative dimension, or if her original one is still ""active"" for her and she probably goes to jail after all the verse-jumpers (Alpha gong-gong, alpha-Joy, alpha diedre, etc) leave that dimension.

2. When Evelyn is having that talk reconcile with Joy at the car at the end of the movie, is it with HER Joy, or the Jobu Tupaki Alpha-Joy?

movies,Sonic vs Mufasa,"I keep seeing post (not on just reddit, other medias too) about how Sonic 3 is beating Mufasa, I get it trust me, 2d animation would have made this movie look way better than most people think of it right now. Im a Sonic glazer, I play Shadow Generations almost everyday, but I have a soft spot for the Lion King. Can't people get his could be the TRANSFORMERS ONE of the Lion king series, both have similar themes and ideas. Mufasa also has a original story, what most people wanted disney to do, movie could atleast be worth giving a chance. My best advice is,

1. Watch Sonic 3 first (better movie lol, will be worth it more)
2. Give Mufasa a chance and don't judge it if you have not seen it yet.
I think movie will be a solid 7-8 outta 10 but we have 2 weeks to know, what are your thoughts

Defending Lion King cause it means a lot to me, I like these characters and wish it had more fareness, Mufasa is made with more love and respect than the first movie (the remake, not original)

He only screens movies on film. A bit faded and a few cuts but I love that stuff. 

A few things I know of the Roger Moore bond movies is that they were a little sillier and they had the best songs... and I tend to like them a lot.  

* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. 
* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.
* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. 
* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head. 
* Feels like Austin Powers got a ton of their gags from this movie.

movies,Me Before You (2016) Discussion,"Watched for the first time last night

The real standout to me was that all the characters seemed extremely relatable and understandable

I got a really gross feeling when it was clear there was emotional cheating going on, yet I still found myself rooting for the main actors. Even until the end, I wished she had broken it off with her boyfriend before moving on, but I couldn't help but wish her and Will would spend their last moments together

It was nice to see a movie, especially knowing this was made in 2016 tackle assisted suicide so well in my opinion. Will had resigned his life, but still provided 6 months to his parents for things to turn around. His parents fought on both sides to help and stop him. Louisa's mum also was vehemtly against it and didn't want her daughter being involved as she knew this would upset her

My favourite scene overall was Louisa coming home to nod her head ""no"" towards her sister. I've had situation that resulted in a near identical scene and I knew how much that would've hurt

I really enjoyed all the characters and the few bits of humour sprinkled throughout. The scenes were all engaging that what was originally ""I'm juat gonna sit here, you watch what you want"", turned into me glued to the screen after the first minute

Overall, I don't think this movie has any real flaws and I'd consider it a 10/10. I was very surprised I had never heard of this one and even more surprised to see the bad reception regarding the assisted suicide topic. I do wonder how I would've felt had I watched it in 2016

movies,Most Fitting Movie for Each Month,"Haven’t seen a post like this, so I figured I’d make one.

What are the most fitting movies for each of the 12 months of the year? Which movies best fit the vibes and aesthetics of each month? Thought this might be an interesting discussion.

January: Something grim and desolate like Fargo would fit pretty good, wintery and cold and all

February: Equally as cold and miserable, but with the added benefit of Valentines Day. Some sort of romance movie with a wintery theme would fit here, especially if set on Valentines Day. Groundhog Day is also a strong contender.

March-April: No specific ideas, these blend together for me. Movies about spring would fit for all of both.

May: Still springtime, but also end-of-school and graduation, so any moviess about graduating or school letting out would fit.

June-Aug: These blend together for me. Plenty of summer movies, but not necessarily specific to a month. I will say, August also has back to school as a potential setting or theme, and I personally associate that month with dreary, overbearing heat and fatigue, the kind of visuals heavily present in the film Falling Down

September: School is fully back in swing, and I would lean towards placing a High School movie or something here.

October: There’s plenty of Halloween movies, but it would have to be one that celebrates fall and the month of October more so than just being scary. The miniseries Over the Garden Wall Would Fit, not sure of other examples 

November: Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be the easy choice for Thanksgiving, but I do wonder if there are any other films that would fire better.

December: There’s a litany of holiday movies of course, but out of all of them there’s have to be one that embodies the month as a whole and not just Christmas time. A plot incorporating the advent season might work, like Christmas Vacation, or a film that incorporates New Years.

I’m struggling with examples here, so I’d be excited to hear what others think",Bonobowl,1h4nfj0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4nfj0/most_fitting_movie_for_each_month/,2024-12-02 05:05:55,1,0.52,1,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4nfj0

I remember a fight scene between a woman and an intruder in her home, and as the camera did a pan shot, following the fighting couple around the room, there was a group of movie crew totally out in the open, and making no attempt to hide.  I remember shaking my head confused and wondering if I just saw what I thought I saw.  

I've done searches online over the years to see if anyone else has a memory of this and I've found nothing.  I don't even see what I thought I saw when I find YouTube clips, or even full streaming versions of the movie.  Is it possible that what I saw really happened, and re-edits were used for all the physical media reproductions of this movie?  This is the last mystery I have memory of in my stupid life.  I want to resolve this.

This analysis of American Psycho reveals something profound about human nature that most viewers have missed. Why would someone so desperate to fit in also be driven to such extreme violence? The answer isn't what you think. Beyond the surface narrative of materialism and madness lies a hidden pattern. Once you see it, you'll never watch the film the same way again. More importantly, you might never look at human behavior the same way either. For viewers familiar with American Psycho, prepare to see familiar scenes in an entirely new light.

movies,What do you think of the women characters in John McTiernan's films?,"Hi everyone,

John McTiernan is one of the legends of action cinema, known for iconic movies like *Die Hard*, *Predator*, and *Last action Hero*. His movies are packed with high-stakes tension, larger-than-life heroes, and explosive action, but what about the women in these stories? I’d love to hear your thoughts on how they’re portrayed!

Here are a few women in his films that stand out to me:

* **Holly Gennaro McClane (*****Die Hard*****)**: She’s a career-driven, no-nonsense woman who also happens to be at the heart of John McClane’s emotional journey. Her strength comes across in the way she handles Hans Gruber and leads the hostages, but do you think she’s given enough agency beyond being someone for John to save?
* **Anna (*****Predator*****)**: At first, Anna seems like a typical prisoner-of-war character, but she becomes a key figure in unraveling the Predator’s backstory. She provides a voice for her people and their legends. Does her role feel substantial, or does it fall into the trope of the ""exotic other""?
* **Virginia Baker (*****The Thomas Crown Affair*****)**: Rene Russo’s character is sharp, confident, and undeniably one of McTiernan’s most complex women. She’s Thomas Crown’s equal, which is rare in movies like this. Does she break the mold of how women are portrayed in action/thrillers?
* **Whitney and Irene (*****Last Action Hero*****)**: This movie pokes fun at action clichés, and it’s fun to see the ""screaming damsel"" and ""grounded working-class mom"" tropes being played for laughs. What do you think McTiernan was trying to say about female characters in action films here?

I know McTiernan’s films are heavily focused on their male leads, but I’m curious—do you think the women in his movies hold their own? Which characters stand out to you, and which feel underdeveloped?

Bad Examples: I did not like 'The Boy and The Beast' because it starts out with the kid full of anger expressing how much he hates everything and everyone. Not something I'd want my kid to watch. Poupelle of Chimney Town starts off with a terribly loud and annoying musical scene.

Good Examples:

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

Long Way North

April and the Extraordinary World

Sirocco and the Kingdom of Winds

Kensuke's Kingdom

Big Fish and Begonia

Wolfwalkers

The Secret of Kells

Song of the Sea

My Father's Dragon

The Magician's Elephant

Eleanor's Secret

Sea Beast


These classic animated films:

Treasure Planet

Atlantis

Road to El Dorado

Titan A.E.

The Iron Giant

Prince of Egypt

Films like Encanto, Moana, Rayaa, etc. are all very good but are not exactly underrated films.

I believe a more poignant ending would be to have her come in and hug him from behind, and then the movie cuts to credits, except: she has hair.

Timothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.

Also have to call out Elis best friend ""Matthew""... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next"" at the end

As soon as the movie reveals early on that he’s an identical twin I said “the twins switch, and the ‘dead’ one is the alive one,” and I ended up being spot on. For a mystery movie it was really quite lame because every time I see identical twins I’m going to think they switched and it’s part of, or maybe even the entire mystery. 

This got me thinking. Are there any movies that have Identical twins, but don’t actually use the identical twins trope, or maybe use it has a red herring?

It's a fun idea. 

My problem is at one point the species decides to show their power and prove to the world they are real. They do this by turning off the lights. Sun, stars, all poof. No light for humanity.   
  
So why not turn the lights off for a couple years and call it good when they get here? Plantlife would be gone, animals dependent on it, us included would be gone. Most species would not last years in darkness.

movies,Most realistic addiction movies you've seen? I find Requiem for a Dream is not it.,"The movie Requiem for a Dream is quite popular and often receives high ratings and praise from people who just saw it. And it is indeed a well done movie, but it's not a realistic movie about drugs.

I think of it more as a horror movie that uses drugs than a movie about people becoming addicted. It gets details wrong, like heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. That's just one example.

But it works great as anti-drug advertising for people who have never done drugs before. And like I said, it's a pretty good movie from the artistic point of view. Like the visuals are so powerful you can't forget certain scenes for a long time. Combined with the great score, you are left at the end of the film with that sense of horror, of powerlessness in face of terrible doom, of things unraveling rapidly for everyone. It's a nightmare visualized really.

movies,cujo from cujo is a tragic villain.,"in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.

for starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.

things get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. ""it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.""

there's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!

even though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",herequeerandgreat,1h3ltsb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,2024-11-30 20:40:45,35,0.72,35,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ltsb

movies,After rewatching Inception my opinion on the ending has now changed forever,"I always believed that Leo was actually awake at the end. Nolan just showed us the spinning top as it was about to topple over before cutting to black and ending the movie. 

After rewatching the movie for who knows how many times I fully believe now that Leo is still dreaming. 

1. Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but…

2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven’t aged at all. 

Anyway that’s where I’m leaning now - he’s still dreaming. 

Edit: I’m loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo’s kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. 

I’ve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. 

I will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I’m even more curious!

movies,Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo',"Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic ""stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen"" narrative. 

This is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. 

The film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. 

What I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.

The story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.

This is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate.

movies,How did you feel about Prisoners from Villeneuve?,"TONS of spoilers about the film:

Hi, let me tell you how it went for me first because I need to vent. 
Sunday night, I wanted a thriller that would keep me on the edge, fun as I could say. After one hour, I felt so helpless for the characters, just as they might feel. After the movie, I just feel like it was such a sad, cold, depressing tragedy about unhealed trauma. Keller need of being in absolute control and completely selling his soul in order to not being hurt more. The guy still trying to do the mazes from when he was kidnapped. Alex Jones who was kidnapped and tortured. And perhaps the most subtely tragic, Detective Loki whole past of being abused that might have kept him from suspecting the woman. I believe that’s how he was didn’t see Alex suffering or the guy with the maze lighting a candle or acting their deaths. 

All that to say, this film left me heartbroken for them. It’s a good thing with how these stories tend to be sensationalized through crime documentaries etc. But I would not say it’s a thriller, or a tragedy/drama with some real thriller mechanics.

movies,How many movies have you seen in your lifetime? ,"I've asked myself this and as an avid movie goer, I thought the number would be much higher and find others tend to overestimate. 

I sat down and over time, did my best to list out every movie I have ever seen. I tried to narrow it down to movies I know for a fact I have watched beginning to end. Not ""oh, I saw 70% of it on television once"" or ""eh, I think i watched it when I was a kid."" 

Especially for things like ubiquitous Disney films. Everyone is seemingly fimiliar with Bambi, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, etc, but I think the number of people who watched these movies in their entirety is lower. And while I myself couldnt exactly remember a time where I didnt know these characters, I also couldnt remember taking the time to watch them as a kid. So I didnt count them. Unless I knew 100% I watched it. 

I also tried not to count television specials unless they were feature length and billed as a movie. Does Channel Chasers from the Fairly OddParents count as a movie or is it a tv special? It sounds dumb but unless it was billed as a movie, I tried to avoid counting it. Kim Possible The Movie: So The Drama may only be like 70 minutes and aired straight to Disney Channel, but I counted it. 

So after counting movies I'd seen under the criteria and with a huge help from Letterboxd, I was able to pin down a rough estimate: 

At the age of 27, I have seen about **1000-1100 movies**. I definitely watch more movies I havent ever seen now than I did maybe a decade ago so I am wondering how that number will look in the next 25 years of my life.

In my college days, I'd see roughly 40-70 movies a year? While not much at all relative to most film lovers, I would say definitely a higher number than the average person. This year, the number is over 100, and will likely finish at about 115-120. The number of movies I watch per month tends to fluctuate greatly. Sometimes I get more into television or video games or too busy with social life to be watching movies. In March, for instance, I had only seen one movie and it was Dune 2. But back in September, I had managed to watch 25 movies.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Russia,"Hello there,

since more than a month, I ask you for ypur favorite movie set in a certain european country, and I know, I know, I'm very late, but I was on a trip and here in Germany, where I'm sitting, the next day has not yet started after I asked you about your movie set in Romania more than 24 hours ago, so technically, it was yesterday, that I did that. Today (and this “today” is valid no matter where you are, as long as you read it early enough), I can then also announce the winner: ***4 luni, 3 săptămâni și 2 zile*** (engl.: *4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days*) continues the trend of newer films tending to end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).

Once again, unfortunately I haven't seen the winning film yet - but that's exactly what makes this filmic journey so exciting for me. As far as I understand it, it's a relatively political movie - and the next country we turn to is certainly also a political subject for some people here: now we come to **Russia**. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,movies of 2025 that you may not be aware are being made,"night of the zoopocalypse

clive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.

grendel

john gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.

high and low

when it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.

the long walk

in addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.

the lost bus

""A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the 2018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history."" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. 

eddington

ari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.

the battle of baktan cross

when it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.

wildwoods

wildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.

the phoenician scheme

leave it to wes anderson to make espionage funny. his upcoming film the phoenician scheme is an espionage comedy drama that was written by anderson and roman coppola. though the plot is unknown at the moment, the film's cast is known and, par for the course for an anderson film, the cast is full of famous actors. benicio del toro, michael cera, bill murray, riz ahmed, tom hanks, benedict cumberbatch, scarlett johansson, rupert friend, willem dafoe, and bryan cranston. production began in march and ended in june.

wake up dead man a knives out mystery

knives out and glass onion were both very well recieved murder mystery stories and fans have been eager to see what benoit blanc would get up to next. well, next year, we may have our answer. the next film in the beniot blanc film series is entitled wake up dead man a knives out mystery. rian johnson will once again serve as writer and director with daniel craig once again playing everyone's favorite southern detective. and like the other films in the series, there is a stacked supporting cast. josh o connor, glenn close, josh brolin, mila kunis, jeremy renner, kerry washington, andrew scott, cailee spaeny, daryl mccormick, and thomas haden church. while the plot is unknown at the moment, if the previous two movies are anything to go by, it will be a compelling mystery that will inherently need to be rewatched.",herequeerandgreat,1h3eqe9,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3eqe9/movies_of_2025_that_you_may_not_be_aware_are/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3eqe9/movies_of_2025_that_you_may_not_be_aware_are/,2024-11-30 15:19:29,35,0.64,35,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h3eqe9

movies,Cerebral Palsy Blues ,"Having a disability doesn't mean you can't live a life full of creativity, adventure, and inspiration. Johan Öberg is a shining example of this. Despite living with a severe form of cerebral palsy, Johan has never let his condition define him or hold him back.

While he can't play the guitar in the traditional way, Johan has developed his own unique method of making music. For him, it’s not about perfection but about expressing himself and sharing his passion for sound in a way that’s entirely his own.

Johan also has a deep love for speed and the water. Though he needs assistance getting into a boat, once he’s seated, he takes full control. Steering the boat on his own, he experiences the thrill and freedom that come with gliding across the waves.
Beyond his personal hobbies, Johan has used his life experiences to inspire and connect with others. He’s authored several books that offer a glimpse into his world and the challenges he’s faced. Additionally, his online community of over 13,000 followers on Facebook has grown into a platform for encouragement, creativity, and resilience.

Johan’s story is proof that having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t push boundaries, inspire others, and live a life filled with purpose and joy.

movies,"The Prestige (2006) is a great magic trick, but once you know the secret, it impresses no one","I recently rewatched The Prestige after many years and although it is a completely different and exciting experience, the third act kinda doesn't make any logical sense.

# Obviously, big spoilers below as I will be discussing the ending so be forewarned...

First of all, I just want to say that I love this movie and I think it's among one of Nolan's best films. This is really nitpicky, so I hope you will read this more as a fan poking holes than a criticism.

There are 4 parts of the story that I either didn't see or overlooked in my first dozen viewings. But now that I've seen it again after many years, I can't ignore these illogical choices.

1. **Borden should have revealed their secret to save his own/brother's life.** I get that they have dedicated their lives to magic and withholding the secret but with the threat of a hanging, they should have said something if it gave them a chance at clemency. The surviving brother wouldn't have been able to keep performing magic anyways because the Alfred identity would also legally be dead; he'd have to start from scratch. And finally, by letting the trick die with one of the brothers, it makes Sarah's death even more meaningless. Taking the secret to the grave only makes thematic sense, but not logical sense.
2. **Cutter kinda kidnaps Jess and no one really cares**. After one of the Borden twins in hanged, the surviving Borden teams up with Cutter to get revenge on Angier. (So I guess he ends up revealing his secret anyways?) They show Cutter sneaking onto Lord Caldlow's estate and grabbing Jess during the day, but Lord Caldlow is murder by Borden at night. If Jess was kidnapped the same day as the murder, wouldn't Caldlow have be extra careful and maybe not go to his warehouse alone? And if Caldlow was murdered the night before the kidnapping, wouldn't the house be extra careful to guard over Jess? This was ignored just to give Borden a happy ending.
3. **Angier didn't need to keep killing this clones.** He literally could have made one clone and lived as twins, thus allowing him to perform the New Transported Man as Borden did. I get the initial shock of shooting the first clone, but to devise a plan to keep killing each sequential clone is illogical. In fact, I'm starting to believe that this was Tesla's initial design in the first place. Tesla doesn't strike me as someone who would build a cloning machine instead of a teleporting machine. I think he wanted to give Angier a perfect double so that he could perform the trick and enjoy the prestige half of the time. But story-wise, it would have been more poetic to drown night-after-night like his late-wife.
4. **Angier couldn't have pulled off the Real Transported Man as shown in the film.** We only see this trick performed twice and both times, you kinda have to turn your brain off.
   1. The first time is when Angier shows off the machine to Cutter and the talent manager. After he activates the machine, Prime-Angier just **disappears**. There was no trap door implemented yet; the talent manager is the one who suggests it. So at this point, there should be two Angiers and no way of killing either one of them.
   2. The second time is during one of the Great Danton's 100-show-run. Prime-Angier falls through the trap door and into the water tank and Borden is framed for supposedly killing him. But why doesn't Clone-Angier complete the trick and reappear for the Prestige? Clone-Angier is all the way up in the wings of the audience so how would he know that Borden would be under the stage? Realistically, Angier wouldn't know which show of the 100 shows should be the one when he needed to fake his own death and not reappear.

All in all, the film WORKS better without logic. I mean it's about magicians and there's a fucking cloning machine in the 1800s. But I mainly wanted to bring these up just to make sure I wasn't going insane. Thanks for taking the time to read. I can't wait for the backlash and downvotes!",DavyJonesRocker,1h4k6l0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4k6l0/the_prestige_2006_is_a_great_magic_trick_but_once/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h4k6l0/the_prestige_2006_is_a_great_magic_trick_but_once/,2024-12-02 02:11:05,0,0.18,0,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h4k6l0

I just watched it again and it was worth the time. Oldman and Kevin Bacon were both great, Bacon especially so. The movie is entertaining, but the acting is better than the script and the directing. The longer the movie goes on the more difficult it is to believe what you are seeing. Oldman struggles with his Boston accent a few times but overall he gives an above average performance in a movie I think you’ll enjoy. This is a few years after Sid and Nancy so he’s just starting to make a name for himself.

Bringing back the supporting actors from the Craig era would also be one of my personal hopes. Such as, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny.

Today, we skip Q in alphabetical order (no country starting with Q in Europe) and directly go to R... in this case, R like **Romania** for the start. As always, there are only two rules in the game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

","Recently rewatched Blue Thunder after not seeing it for 30+ years, have been on a bit of a tear for Dan O’bannon written films.  His work definitely has a juvenile, often sex-themed angle (Lifeforce, Alien) but I happen to be a huge fan of Return of the Living Dead, so he gets a lifetime pass for me personally.

But many of his films contain bizarre dialogue, and Blue Thunder might be the weirdest.  “I wouldn’t fly with Murphy for a bull that pissed Jack Daniels,” or “this baby fires four thousand rounds per minute, which is a shitstorm in anybody’s language.”  But the weirdest of all is when Captain Braddock (the great Warren Oates) calls Murphy back to duty and says they “just came up with a hot mince pie under each arm.”

Has any normal human ever spoken this line before?  What the Hell does it even mean?  I assume it’s bad, but I went so far as to look up the ingredients of mine pie – why mince?  Why is it hot?  Why under the armpits?

movies,What great classic films should definitely never have a sequel?,"
Which classic films would genuinely NOT benefit from a sequel, and WHY?   (Unless it’s obvious to all, might you tell us WHY you offer your answer?) 

These days, many (almost all) movies are made with a sequel or trilogy in mind. Even if the story ends with the destruction of the galaxy, there’s always room for that follow-up (and the potential for additional ca$h). 

In the past, movies were not created with this mindset.  Which movies are notably Not sequel ready?  In other words and in a roundabout way, how have sequels affected the quality of the movies being made today?

In my thinking, _Groundhog Day_ is a good example.  The story is completely wrapped up by the end.  No sequel necessary or wanted.

The story of the most famous sniper of the Winter War has never before been brought to the silver screen.

The Russians gave Häyhä the name ""White Death"" — and for good reason.

According to his personal notebook, Häyhä killed 542 Russian soldiers during the 98 days of the Winter War. This is more than any other sniper in the world has achieved in such a short time.

The movie is set during the winter of 1939-1940 on the Kollaa front, where a small group of Finns stood to stop an overwhelmingly superior enemy from invading Finland.

Häyhä was seriously wounded in the battles at Kollaa just a week before the end of the Winter War. He awoke from a coma on the day the war ended.

Due to his injuries, Häyhä was unable to take part in the Continuation War, though he would have wanted to.

Simo Häyhä was born in 1905 in Rautjärvi, Karelia, and passed away as a respected war hero in a veterans' care home in Hamina in 2002.

The film's consultant is Major (ret.) Tapio Saarelainen, who has authored several books about Häyhä.

movies,"I watched 365 movies this year, and here is what I learned. ","I decided back in January that I wanted to try to stop doom scrolling. And instead of scrolling for 2 hours I would watch a movie instead. Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. 

1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren’t even IN other movies. 

2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. 

3: If your movie isn’t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. 

Couple of facts: 

First movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube

Last movie: Planes trains and automobiles. 

Best movie: American Fiction 

Worst Movie: The Creeps.  

Movies I watched that I had seen before: 16

Most movies watched in a single day: 5


It’s been a long year and I’ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. 

Edit: sexually lol 

As requested Top 10: 

1: American Fiction

2: biosphere 

3: They Cloned Tyrone 

4: 1917

5: Maxxxine 

6: the Blackening

7: the vast of night 

8: The green knight 

9: bottoms 

10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)


Edit 2: people have a lot of opinions about movies, yet it seems mine are the only ones that are invalid? 

There are a ton of other things I learned from watching so many movies in such a short time. I, however, typically like to enjoy things more than shit on them (I.e. the beautiful madness that is Shadow in the Clouds). 

So allow me to clarify what in reverse:

3: In regards to run time, yes I agree, a story is as long as it needs to be, but streaming places like Netflix don’t usually care,  because they want a longer movie that keeps you watching. This can kill whatever story they were trying to tell. This is less a problem with Older movies, and more a modern issue and issue with a lot of horror movies (which is 80% what I watched).  It was my way of saying that movies could be tightened up to be more impactful and memorable.  For the “movies should be as long as they need to tell the story” people, we all know if movies needed to be as long as they need to be then there wouldn’t be a need for an editor nor “directors cuts.” Some stories don’t need the time and some stories need more. 

2: of course movies have different budgets, I am saying it is VERY noticeable when you go back to back and see a difference. It is amazing what people can do on a smaller budget to make it look good and how a larger budget production can blow the money and you don’t ever really see it on the screen.  

1: so many faces end up looking the same. Admittedly I come from an era where there were big names in the theaters and someone being in a movie meant something. Not something GOOD necessarily but something.  With this last year, I would see movies with an actor in it and still not know what sort of movie it is. You see “Justin Long” is in a horror movie and you know you are basically in for a good time. You see someone like Gerald Farlong in a movie and you just wanna know if you should know him from something (you shouldn’t. I made him up).  I do like that Square jaw man from the Hit Man tho. 

If I learned anything real, it’s that I love movies, and even if a movie is bad, as long as it’s fun, then it didn’t waste my time. 

Glad you all love American fiction and vast of night.  

Glad you all hate American fiction and the green knight. 

I’m gonna go watch “It’s a wonderful knife” now.

One of the characters (possibly named Rallie, Rally, or Wally) is suspected of having stolen, burned, or sold the painting. To launder the money, he supposedly created a business producing small cars for elderly people.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Portugal,"Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Poland - and I really would like to thank all the participants: We got around 50 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. Especially with this in mind, the final result is very close: ***Krótki film o zabijaniu*** (engl.: *A Short Film About Killing*) has won the race with just 12 upvotes (minus the given downvotes).

Today, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in Portugal. As always, the winner  will soon take its place in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And as always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,How to approach Salò (1975)?,"I have a problem with Salò that I'm struggling with and I would appreciate some advice.

I am a divorced man in my middle age with a son of seventeen. He's a smart kid and we have recently started bonding over our love of cinema. He is a junior of the local Multimedia and Graphic Technology Secondary School with a motion picture specialisation. He plans on studying motion picture directing at the academy in two years time.

With his course set he set upon expanding his film education and he recently approached me with a list of movies he'd like to see. His favorite movie is Metropolis and he enjoys watching and talking about expresionist films. Of course his list includes other movies such as M, and I also suggested The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. 

He also wants to see A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Z (by Kosta Gavras) and ""some other films that are not as interesting"". As I was intrigued, I asked which films he was thinking of he volountered Sátántangó (which at 439 minutes he doesn't expect me to watch with him) and, oh yes, Salò.

And I did not react well to news of Salò, as I don't think there is a benefit for a seventeen year old in seeing the movie. It was a deeply disturbing watch for me and I was in my forties, I don't really see how a kid his age would be equipped to even process the message of the film with sufficient life experience. I did not forbid him from seeing the movie, as that really doesn't achieve anything. I would like to help lay some ground work before he goes into it. I think that he should see Clockwork first. And I'd like some suggestions for other thematicaly similar films that would help him gradually ramp up the intensity for Salò. Should I hae him read someting beforehand? He is sufficiently aware of the Italian Social Republic, I am more concerned about psychological aspects of the story.

Or should I just let him watch it cold and have a discussion about the depravity of the human condition later? I also don't feel this is a movie suitable to a father/son movie night but I'm also uneasy of havng him watch it alone.",Panamaned,1h3nhor,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3nhor/how_to_approach_salò_1975/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3nhor/how_to_approach_salò_1975/,2024-11-30 21:58:13,0,0.39,0,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h3nhor

movies,A Different Take on The Notebook's Ending,"

Hi Everyone, 

I recently watched *The Notebook* and found myself grappling with some discomfort about the ending. So, I decided to write my own version, one that feels more poignant and bittersweet, yet complete. Here’s my version:

Instead of Noah reading the story, it would be Lon. In my version, Allie chooses Lon, but her life with him isn’t entirely fulfilling—at least, not in her heart. She keeps a diary where she writes about how things could have been if she had chosen Noah instead. Her imagined life, where she paints, with Noah becomes her escape, a parallel world where her heart resides.

Years later, as Allie begins to suffer from her illness, Lon finds the diary. Understanding how deeply she lived in her imagination, he decides to read her the diary—not as the story of their life, but as the life she dreamed of. Lon does this out of love, knowing it might bring her comfort and help her remember.

One day, as Lon reads, something shifts in Allie. She remembers her real life with Lon—their marriage, their children, and the life they built together. Overcome with guilt, she apologizes to him, admitting that while she always wanted to love him completely, part of her heart was always with Noah. Lon, being the loving and compassionate man he is, forgives her without hesitation.

Then, Allie asks Lon about Noah. Lon tells her that Noah built a successful life, never married, and now owns a large mill, but is gravely ill. Touched by her lingering feelings, Lon promises to take her to see Noah the next day.

But fate intervenes. The next morning, they hear that Noah passed away during the night. When Allie and Lon visit his home, she is overcome with memories of their time there. The weight of her emotions becomes too much, and she quietly passes away, never to wake again.",Chahes03,1h3laak,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,2024-11-30 20:16:01,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h3laak

movies,"With today’s appetite for legacy sequels and expanded universes, a Seth Gecko film would resonate with both longtime fans and a new generation eager to see Rodriguez revisit his gritty, blood-soaked roots.","It’s a real shame that Robert Rodriguez has mostly shifted to making kid-friendly movies lately. While Spy Kids and We Can Be Heroes are fun in their own way, they don’t really tap into the raw, edgy filmmaking talent that made Rodriguez stand out in the first place. He built his career on gritty, intense films like Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn, which pushed boundaries and brought something fresh to action and horror. A movie about Seth Gecko would be the perfect chance for him to return to those roots, creating a film that’s dark, thrilling, and full of that unique Rodriguez style that made his earlier work so unforgettable. It’s also undoubtedly George Clooney’s best work and he’s become so boring lately—a return to the character would be amazing . 


Title it “Gecko”, and the story follows Seth, who has spent the last 30 years living a quiet, low-profile life in a small seaside town in Mexico. His peace is shattered when Kate Fuller—channeling a Sarah Connor-like intensity—shows up at his door. She reveals that she’s planning to attack the labyrinth beneath the Titty Twister, connecting it to a series of mysterious child disappearances across the country.",Muted-Field4072,1h3ir0l,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ir0l/with_todays_appetite_for_legacy_sequels_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ir0l/with_todays_appetite_for_legacy_sequels_and/,2024-11-30 18:20:55,0,0.38,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ir0l

movies,My Fascination with Alfred Hitchcock and My Top 5 Hitchcock Films,"It was in the 1990s when I got my first VCR. I was beyond excited - just imagine, no more waiting for the cable guy to show you something good. Back then, there was no internet to help me figure out what to watch, so I headed to the local video store. I asked a friend who worked there that I wanted to watch an interesting mystery thriller and asked for suggestions. He told me to pick any Hitchcock movie - I couldnt go wrong. Thats when I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock.

Since that day, Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors. His mastery of suspense, mystery, and thriller genres is what makes him stand out. I think I’ve watched almost every Hitchcock film (at least the ones released after 1940), and each one has been a joy to revisit. Whats even more impressive is how well his movies have aged - something I can't say about a lot of films from that era. Hitchcock’s films have been remade and adapted countless times. Directors and writers still draw inspiration from his work. Even today!

Here’s a list of my top 5 Hitchcock films. If you haven’t seen them, I highly recommend you do. It wasn’t an easy task narrowing it down because I love so many of his films, but these are my absolute favs.

1. Psycho Psycho was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It was the first movie I saw on my new VCR. I’m not exaggerating when I say I got goosebumps during the final reveal. I literally jumped out of my chair, wondering what just happened. A fun fact: Psycho was the first movie ever made in the US to show a toilet flushing. Yep, you read that right - something as simple as a toilet became a big deal back then.
2. Rebecca I’ve always loved the book by Daphne du Maurier, so when I heard Hitchcock adapted it into a film, I was both excited and a little skeptical. Typically, I’m not a fan of book-to-movie adaptations, but Hitchcock did an amazing job. The movie brings the eerie atmosphere of the novel to life, with strong performances and a perfect blend of tension and mystery. Highly recommend it.
3. Rear Window Rear Window is an absolute masterpiece. Stewart and Kelly lead a stellar cast in this film, where Stewart plays a man stuck in a wheelchair, spying on his neighbors through the rear window. What he sees gets him tangled up in something far more sinister than he bargained for. The suspense is built slowly but steadily. What unfolds after is such a treat to watch. It’s been adapted and remade several times, with one of the most famous being Disturbia - not a bad film in itself but the original is much much better.
4. Strangers on a Train This one really kept me guessing. The premise was intriguing - two men meet on a train, and one proposes a strange idea: if they each commit a murder for the other, they’ll be in the clear. It’s one of those thrillers that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering how it’ll all unfold. The film does a great job of playing with psychological tension and moral dilemmas.
5. Dial M for Murder I saw Dial M for Murder a little later in my Hitchcock journey. Actually, I watched The Perfect Murder, a remake starring Michael Douglas, before I saw this. While I thought the remake had a decent plot, it didn’t quite measure up. Then, I read somewhere that it was copied from a Hitchcock movie - Dial M for Murder. I saw it and absolutely loved it. The plot was similar with some differences, but the execution was so much better. It was a fun, thrilling watch that had me hooked from start to finish.

It would be remiss of me not to mention some of my other favorite Hitchcock films, like Birds, Rope, Notorious, Spellbound, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. These could easily make a top-five list on another day.

If you haven’t seen his work and like watching movies, I suggest you watch his work. You won’t regret it.

El Camino was somewhat of a step down from Breaking Bad, it was still a pretty amazing movie, and could’ve been pretty successful as a stand-alone movie, the plot definitely would’ve worked. Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse’s story. 

The Simpson’s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far. The movie wasn’t much of a step down from the series and episodes themselves. It was just as funny as most episodes are, but had a lot more emotions in it.
