devops,SWE vs MLOps,"Hi guys, I’m an Indian who is currently living in Ireland. I have been hunting for a job for sometime. Background: 1 year work ex in India as ML Engineer, recent masters in CS from UCD, graduated 2024. I only have experience in ML/AI in full time and internship roles.

I’m currently interviewing for the role for MLOps engineer in India for a company which is reputable and I’m sure a lot of you must have heard. about it or used its product. I have also been approached by Microsoft and IBM for the role of SWE in Ireland.

Here’s my dilemma: I’m sure that I will get a result for MLOps engineer much sooner than my interviews will progress at Microsoft and IBM, and I will definitely be asked to move back to India before I get a response from Microsoft/IBM. I think MLOps is a great role for someone like me and due to personal reasons I do not mind shifting back to India. At the same time, I’m not that confident about SWE interviews because my DSA is not that strong so I might just lose a great opportunity as well. However, I’m also worried that my career path could get stuck at MLOps and I back myself into a corner with limited career options down the line, which compared with SWE opens up several options for me. Had both these interview processes been running at the same time, I would have decided to go with Microsoft/IBM, but given my current circumstance I don’t want to risk turning down MLOps with just a chance of maybe getting selected in SWE.

devops,"rant Devops and SRE part 1
","There’s an internal change management tool I’m required to use as a developer to track any code or infrastructure changes, whether in production or a testing environment. As an SRE, I frequently make small fixes across codebases, which means I need to create detailed records documenting every action taken to resolve issues.  
The tool itself wouldn’t be so frustrating if it were intuitive and efficient, but mostly it's the opposite.  
One major problem is the overly specific yet incomplete categorization system. While there are very granular options for some scenarios, they rarely apply to the situations I deal with, leaving me to default to vague categories like “Other” more often than I’d like.  
Assigning changes to other teams is another headache. Instead of clear team names, the system relies on team codes, which don’t mean much unless you’re already familiar with them. To assign a record, I usually have to identify an individual team member and then backtrack to figure out their team name, a tedious and unnecessary step.  
All of these issues make my experience worse than it was a few years ago when I wasn’t forced to rely on this tool. To make matters worse, the interface design is severely outdated. It looks like it belongs in the Windows 98 era, which doesn’t exactly help with usability or morale.  
As an SRE in a GitOps world, do you still have to track your changes in parallel in another tracking system? Or do you use some magic git connector to Jira or other tools?

devops,Multiple Postgres Databases vs one larger database?,"We have 4 primary postgres databases - each has a hot standby.

Our applications allow customers to sign up to our service, and when they do, they will have a database created in one of these databases - which stores all their information and schemas they can interact with.  
We have opted for multiple postgres databases because we believe this would ease the load of off just one point of failure.

However, as our databases grow in size, we just scale horitzontally by adding another database ( and hot standby). This is all done on a vps - each instance on its own server - and can take some engineering time.

We have considered instead to just have one very large Primary and one very large hot standby. Is there any benefit to keeping the multiple postgres instances instead?  
I've tried to get a breakdown of cost, and I don't believe it would cost much less to go just go to one instance.

Additionally, we can't do much with pooling because each customer goes to their respective database within their respective postgres cluster.  
Whenever we join a new primary/stand by we point our new customers to this database, so this is where newest customers will be created.

With previous customers their data can be stored on one of any four of the other postgres DBs, and we use application logic to findout their database instance before connecting them to it.",ReverendRou,1h6bu4m,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6bu4m/multiple_postgres_databases_vs_one_larger_database/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6bu4m/multiple_postgres_databases_vs_one_larger_database/,2024-12-04 09:01:04,3,0.72,3,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6bu4m

devops,Has Anyone dealt with DORA Metric tracking in disconnected systems?,"Currently, my leaders are asking about DORA metrics for better visualization of process improvement, but the system ultimately being deployed to is literally a remote, disconnected system. I can measure lead time to release, but not deploy because all development is required to be bundled to a pre-staging area, where once every quarter that bundle is final tested before being physically transported to a remote location for on-site testing and deployment.

By definition this makes our deployment frequency every 3 months and completely throws off attempting to track change failure rate and TTR. The entire system of DORA is pretty much based around attaining a certain volume of deployability, and then working to improve that.
