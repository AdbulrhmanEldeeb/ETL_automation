gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't have to buy weapons or armor. There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.

None of this makes these games bad, it just feels weird to carry around so much cash and not have a use for it.",Sensitive-Hotel-9871,1h6g2sj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6g2sj/what_game_has_the_biggest_issue_with_money_being/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6g2sj/what_game_has_the_biggest_issue_with_money_being/,2024-12-04 13:32:56,62,0.72,62,0,212,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6g2sj

gaming,"Path of Exile 2, and a recent trend in gaming","It seems like Path of Exile 2 is shaping up to follow in the footsteps of Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3, a game in a more niche genre, that doubles down on the things people love about that genre, and finds mainstream success by virtue of it being really, really good. Even Metaphor: Re Fantazio sort of fits into that catagory, although I think it's a littke more refined than Persona. And it's got me thinking about how some of the bigger failures of the past few years were games that tried for the broadest appeal possible, and ended up being super bland and forgettable in doing so.

Recently my hands and wrists have gotten a little painful so I haven’t played in a few weeks. The thing is I don’t miss it. Right now as it stands if I never played again it wouldn’t kill me.
It made me wonder how many of us are playing for the love of gaming or because it’s become an easy habit to fall into.
When was the last time any of us stopped playing for a week just to catch our breath so to speak?

Classic Doom in Doom Eternal: well in 2016 you can play a lot of the classic levels, they are all in a separate menu so out of universe but in Doom Eternal, you access them in universe in Doomguy’s computer inside his fortress

Crash in Uncharted: in the first few chapters of Uncharted 4 you get to a part where Elena tries to get Nate into a PS1 game she really likes and it happens to be Crash Bandicoot.

Classic Activition Games in Call of Duty Cold War: in Cold War there is a section where you go through a mock city used by the russians to train for a US ground invasion. In this mock city you can find arcades with classic activition games.

gaming,I've never felt worse buying CoD.,"Been playing CoD since CoD3. I bought BO6 yesterday and played multiplayer for a few hours. Since the original MW2 I always bought every 3rd or so game in the series, because maybe after 2 to 4 ""new"" games they would have actually added one new feature. I still knew I was being charged $65 for what should be a patch I waited too long for, but I had fun. The last CoD I played was MW2019 (entry I played before that was BO3) and I had a great time with both.

I didn't even realize playing BO6 that its FIVE! (FIVE!!!!) games after MW19 and the only change was omni movement? Omni movement affects and helps my playstyle more than most and I still don't care. I've regretted buying games before, but this time I'm just pissed. Everyone please make fun of me for paying $75 so that I ""get"" to unlock the same acog scope for the same ak for the 20th time.

After a big battle you look around and see how many lives were lost, how terrible was the encounter, and it feels nice and realistic.

Games where enemies get Thanos snapped like in Elden Ring or turn into a puddle of blood and few random ribs Dragon Age: Origins style or turn into a lootable pouch like in Witcher 3 kind of lack that magical feeling of realism.

I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004).  Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.

The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I'll play that now for online multiplayer.  I'm curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?

Also, I think it's cool that the original Unreal Tournament (a game from 1999, which I originally played on Windows 98) still runs without a problem on modern PCs (I have it on my current PC, which has Windows 11 and an Intel i9-9900k and an Nvidia 3080 TI).  I have the Game Of The Year edition from Steam though, so I think it was pre-packaged to work on modern PCs.

I've been running my set up for a while and it's run fantastic without any problems (dead space remake, psychonauts 2, dungeons 4 ect ect)

I thought that was strange I was only getting these drops with very recent games even on low end settings and not 1-3 year old games on high end settings 

So I've been running my Nvidia stats the last couple days and realised once I hit the 75-80° the gpu would hang but that's not crazy surprising

What was surprising is that the default fan settings on msi afterburner aren't great so I set mine to max out at 80° but the fan curve to slowly rise evenly from 30&gt;80° and now even on the higher end of horizon forbidden west or stalker settings its sitting around 65-70°",JonnyNutz,1h6dmp7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6dmp7/msi_afterburner_settings_pc/,https://i.redd.it/xim5unxpet4e1.jpeg,2024-12-04 11:12:14,0,0.33,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ae2-3-Kd9OnBSUE3p4142fwzp69pWznV6vicS43ynFY.jpg,t3_1h6dmp7

gaming,I actually found a good mobile game and I want to talk about it. ,"The name of the game is Arcane Rush Battlegrounds. 

It’s a battleroyale card game that’s perfect for folks looking for a TFT like experience but something more casual. 

The game starts with 2 groups of 8, the top 4 players of each group then duke it out to find the top player. The original group stage is based on points and the second stage everyone gets 3 life and last one standing wins. 

The cool thing with this is that you’re playing against offline players. So there is no time pressure if something comes up which is great. I found that in the beginning it was very easy to score first place as I am getting to higher ranks I do take some losses against the AI. You earn gold for each elimination you achieve while offline. 

There is also an arena that takes your top builds from the battleroyale to test them against other players and I have found this to be very challenging. 

The game has dealers that have their own cards, and a hero collection they can draft from every game. On top of their being a number of unique races to play while in game each with their own strategy. My personal favourite race are demons and the discard strategy they play with. 

The only time the game pushes ads is to gain extra gold rewards or arena battle chances. Otherwise there are no ads. 

The negative, each of the races are kind of insular, there isn’t many combos to be found. If you start building a race your only real option is to fully build that race since they are all designed to work with themselves. Also the cost of upgrading your dealers is high,300 gold a shot where dailies may not give you enough to enough gold for an upgrade. There are currently 2 dealers with a third on the way and I hope they make some changes to upgrade costs or the amount of gold you can get. 

Well that’s the long and short of it. I hope you all check it out because I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the game.

gaming,Over twenty years later and nothing beats the experience of riding around in a warthog with your best friend. Halo: CE,"Finally got around to buying the Master Chief Collection. Playing through Halo: CE today and I again become amazed with how well Halo did vehicle combat. It’s not realistic in any way. It’s more like driving a Sea Do than a truck, but over twenty years later, it hasn’t been beaten. IMO, of course

Even Halo 2, which had amazing vehicle combat, lost something with destructible vehicles. There’s something pure about the indestructible warthog that goes soaring through the sky when it gets struck by a perfectly timed rocket/grenade. Hoping beyond hope that you’re able to pull off the landing and make it back to base with your flag

What happened? Why have game developers leaned so much more towards realism when it comes to vehicles? If they include them at all? 

Am I just alone here? Are there great vehicles in other FPSeseses that put the Warthog to shame?

What are some games that are good for people who get motion sickness? She likes RPGs, magic and fantasy, adventure games. Not much for shooters, racing, or sports games. She plays a bit of WoW, but I'd like to find some things that aren't subscription based since she refuses to pay for that. I have Game Pass, so that would be ideal, but going through Steam or GoG is fine too. Nothing super graphic intensive since she'll be playing on a 4 year old Alienware laptop with a RTX 2060.

gaming,"Are there any alternate online servers for Unreal Tournament 3, or a similar active game for multiplayer?  I know Xonotic exists, but it seems it's not very active","I used to like to play online multiplayer Unreal Tournament, with the last being Unreal Tournament 3.  There used to be a lot of great online game servers with different game types, and some with mods, and I used to play those quite a bit.  I always liked the game and the genre, but recently, I've tried playing and noticed the servers seem to be shut down.  And today I noticed I can't even log in anymore.  Indeed, it sounds like [Epic turned off online services for some games](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-is-turning-off-online-services-and-servers-for-some-older-games), including Unreal Tournament 3.

I installed [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org) several years ago, as it's a similar 3D shooter game, but I've noticed it doesn't seem to be very active - Whenever I go into multiplayer with Xonotic, there are few games, and what games there are usually only have 1 or 2 players.

I have to think people still enjoy playing multiplayer 3D shooters online?  Or have most people stopped playing them?  I'm curious if there are any similar active multiplayer games?

gaming,"Witcher 3 is almost a decade old, RDR2 is 6 years old. How are these still just about the best graphics? Are there no graphically stunning “show stopper” titles in the last 6 years to compete with them? Have video game graphic advances slowed to a crawl now?","**EDIT** I thought this was clear in my post, but maybe not. I am not saying there aren't better graphics to be found into today's games. I am saying they don't look a Decade better, they don't look 6 years better. For example, Legend of Zelda OOO came out in 1998, Crysis came out in 2007, that's the same gap between the release of Wild Hunt 3 and now. Skyrim came out in 2011, and 6 years prior to that, same gap as between RDR2 and now, the most graphically amazing game just released was the King King movie tie game. There is an ocean of difference, graphically, between Ocarina of Time and Crysis, between King Kong and Skyrim. You could show your grandma a picture of the two and she'd be able to easily point to the one with better graphics. But if you showed Wild Hunt 3 or RDR2 or Battlefield One next to many or even most big budget graphically cutting edge titles of the day, your gran probably couldn't say which have better graphics. The gulf is REALLY narrow compared to the same time span in the past. And if you look up just about any listing of the most graphically impressive games, RDR2, a 6 year old game, is still near the top of basically every list.

Was recently doing an RDR2 play though and was blown away coming back to it, just how damn good it looks. I remember it looked good, but I mean it looks GOOD. And I remember thinking the same about a year ago when I picked Witcher 3 back up. 

Hell star wars battlefront 2 was released in 2017, battlefield 1 was released in 2016, and you’d be hard pressed to find games in their genres released this year that look any better. 

I’m not saying games now look bad, they just don’t look a decade better than Witcher 3. I feel like for most of my life video game graphics have been making continuous leaps. I can’t think of any other time since, hell, the N64, when you’d go damn near a decade with the top tier most graphically impressive cutting edge game not really looking much better than those from 6, 7, 9 years prior. 

Are there graphical powerhouses out there I’m just not aware of?

Control is the only one I can really think of, and control looks great, I just don’t think it looks that much better than say rdr2, maybe slightly better lighting system? But it’s hard to compare since almost all of control takes place indoors.

gaming,Deep Rock Galactic made me appreciate Indie games more,"Now to be honest, I'm still not that much of an Indie fan. I prefer my games to have a realistic artstyle, to have high visual fidelity, to have hollywood like moments and real time cutscenes and overall the polish only a AAA game can provide. Really, you couldn't bring me to touch an Indie game, because I got burned badly by some and after those experiences, they all looked so cheap and not worth the money.

That said, after a friend finally persuaded me to give DRG a chance and after I played it for a while, both with him and alone, I realized that indie games do can be fun and that stylized graphics can look good. I was really surprised at how fun the game is and over time, my mindset changed to:"" If this Indie game is fun, maybe others are as well."". 

And so I did try them and while most of them still aren't to my liking, I did find a few that I enjoyed (Ready or Not, Executive Assault 2, Cavern of Dreams or Eternal Evil to name a few). It also helps that Indie games become better and better and can reach AA quality levels nowadays, while also having a realistic artstyle.

That said, my tolerance still has limits. If I see any pixelart or cell shading in a game, I still instantly lose any interest, same with obvious pre made assets. And for stylized graphics, it really is a case by case situation. While I tolerate Running with Rifles for example, you can hunt me to the end of the world with Battle Bits Remastered or anything made with Synthy.

However, when you have a game like Ready or Not or SCP 5K, where you can show me ""Here, look. This game looks realistic, this game is dark and gritty and looks like a AAA title on the surface"", then you have my interest and usually a buy as well, if the end product is well made.",Nino_Chaosdrache,1h4elho,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h4elho/deep_rock_galactic_made_me_appreciate_indie_games/,2024-12-01 21:51:06,0,0.19,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4elho

gaming,What's with the reluctance to use hall effect sticks in all new controllers?,"A lot of complaints about drift. Hall effect seems to be a simple solution to a widely known problem but it isn't being used as standard. What actual advantage is there in the standard controllers for gaming?

Would I be correct in assuming earlier controllers such as the PS2 and Gamecube controllers used hall effect sticks? My Gamecube controllers still work to this day.

gaming,"Owners of Xbox Elite Controllers, How long did it last/has it lasted?","Is the poor quality perception true or a result of loudness bias?

I recently bought the Elite 2 and love the back peddles. I recommended controllers w/ back buttons in r/MHWilds and got a lot of messages about the poor quality control for the Elites.

What is your experience? Do they last longer than a year? Arrive broken? What broke first?

**EDIT:**

F\*ck my inbox. Thanks for the replies!

**EDIT 2:**

Will the haters please stop down-voting any neutral/positive comments? This kinda shit is just going to make me &amp; others think it's loudness bias instead of objective truth.

**EDIT 3:**   
  
Thank you all for giving your input. But f'real, fuck my inbox. I'll read all this in my free time over the next week.
