MachineLearning,[R] The Multimodal Universe: Enabling Large-Scale Machine Learning with 100TB of Astronomical Scientific Data,"https://openreview.net/forum?id=EWm9zR5Qy1#discussion

Abstract: We present the Multimodal Universe, a large-scale multimodal dataset of scientific astronomical data, compiled specifically to facilitate machine learning research. Overall, our dataset contains hundreds of millions of astronomical observations, constituting 100TB of multi-channel and hyper-spectral images, spectra, multivariate time series, as well as a wide variety of associated scientific measurements and metadata. In addition, we include a range of benchmark tasks representative of standard practices for machine learning methods in astrophysics. This massive dataset will enable the development of large multi-modal models specifically targeted towards scientific applications. All codes used to compile the dataset, and a description of how to access the data is available at https://github.com/MultimodalUniverse/MultimodalUniverse

MachineLearning,[R] Forecasting and Mitigating Security Threats from Malicious AI Applications,"This paper provides a systematic analysis of potential malicious applications of AI systems across digital, physical and political security domains. The methodology involves:

- Surveying dual-use AI capabilities that could enable attacks
- Mapping specific attack vectors and required technical capabilities  
- Analyzing the evolution of attacker/defender dynamics
- Developing a framework for threat assessment and mitigation

Key technical findings:

- ML advances in areas like NLP and computer vision lower barriers to sophisticated attacks
- Automated systems can significantly scale up traditional attack vectors
- Transfer learning and GANs enable rapid adaptation of attack techniques
- Technical countermeasures alone are insufficient - policy/governance frameworks needed

The researchers provide a detailed assessment framework examining:

- Technical requirements for different attack types
- Estimated timeline for capability development
- Difficulty of execution and potential impact
- Proposed defensive measures and their limitations

I think this work is important for helping the ML community get ahead of security risks before they materialize. The framework provides a structured way to evaluate emerging threats, though I expect the specific attack vectors will evolve significantly as capabilities advance.

I think we need much more research on measuring the effectiveness of proposed countermeasures and understanding the co-evolution of offensive/defensive capabilities. The policy recommendations are a good start but will require ongoing refinement.

TLDR: Systematic analysis of how ML advances could enable new attack vectors across security domains. Provides framework for assessing and mitigating threats through both technical and policy measures.

MachineLearning,[D] Do lots of metadata really help in semantic search?,"I'm on my second week in learning AI and I was thinking of preprocessing biography data by including lots of metadata like city, date of birth, key events, education, hobbies, etc, and then generating embeddings and adding them together into a vector database. Perhaps by using NLP API or LLM. But is it necessary? Or should I just use OpenAI model to dynamically extract this metadata from the bios prior to storing them? Will having lots of metadata dramatically help to improve the quality of the search results?

MachineLearning,How to best finetune a CNN? [P],"I'm currently training a CNN on 3D binary arrays for regression (4 conv layers then 3 linear layers with 1 output). I find that performance overall of the CNN is good, but not amazing due to the lower target values being predicted having much poorer performance. I want to try finetuning the model on samples with lower values such that performance for it improves, but when I do so the overall performance of the model decreases. I freeze the first couple of layers of my CNN and only retrain on the last few with a low learning rate. Is there a optimal method for finetuning, or should I go about improving performance on lower values a different way.  
Data augmentation wouldn't really work in my case since the binary arrays are direction dependent and the target values would then be inaccurate.

I've attached a picture of my parity plot with performance before finetuning.

MachineLearning,[D] Linear Regression but with Binary Output for wide range predictions with better precision,"A neural network tends to find it difficult to predict data that ranges between very large and small numbers on the output. My application requires the NN to predict between -1000 and 1000 ∈ Z. I could make this possible by scaling up the output by 1000 hence allowing the model to predict between -1 and 1, but a loss between 2e-2 (prediction) and 3e-2 (target) with L1Loss (worse case L2Loss) would be negligible (1e-2 in this case, 1e-4 in the worse case). It is imperative for the model to be very precise with the predictions, when the target is 5e-2 it should be so and not even at least deviating by +-0.1e-2. This precision is very difficult to achieve when it comes to linear regression, so i thought of a more systematic approach to defining the prediction and criterion. Again, i wanted the model to predict between -1000 and 1000. These numbers can be represented using a minimum of 11 bits (binary), so i redesigned the model output to contain 22 neurons, arranged as ∈ R (11x2) 11 outputs with two classes, the classes being a binary representation of 1 or 0. CrossEntropy could be used as a criterion here but im using multimarginloss instead for specific reasons. Otherwise a different approach could be a sigmoided output of 11 neurons to represent the binary number. Whats you guys' take on this? Is this considered good (if not better) practice? Is there any research similar to this that i can look into?

MachineLearning,[D] The popular theoretical explanation for VAE is inconsistent. Please change my mind.,"I had a really hard time understanding VAE / variational inference (VI) in theory, for years. I'd be really appreciated if anyone could clarify my confusions. Here's what I've got after reading many sources:

1. We want to establish a generative model p(x, z) (parameters are omitted for simplicity) for the observable variable x and the latent variable z. Alright, let's select appropriate parameters to maximize the marginal likelihood of the observed samples p(x).
2. According to basic probability theory (the law of total probability and the definition of conditional probability), we have: p(x)=∫ p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz (Eq. 1).
3. Here's the point that things becomes rather confusing: people now will claim that this integral is ***intractable*** because z is a continuous variable / z is a high-dimensional variable / p(x∣z) is too complex / or any other excuses.
4. What to do for the intractability of Eq. 1? Although we didn't mention the posterior p(z ∣ x) above, we will now bring it into the discussion. The posterior p(z ∣ x) is also intractable since p(z | x) = p(x | z) p(z) / p(x) and p(x) is intractable. So we will introduce another parameterized model q(z ∣ x) to approximate p(z | x).
5. After some derivation, we obtain a new optimization objective, commonly known as ELBO, which is the summation of:
    - the ""reconstruction"" term: ∫ log p(x ∣ z) q(z ∣ x) dz (Eq. 2);
    - KL divergence term between q(z | x) and p(z), which results in a closed-form.
6. So now we have to work on Eq. 2. Compared with Eq. 1, p(z) is replaced with q(z∣x), both of them are (usually) normal distributions, and p(x | z) is still there. Great! Clearly we have transformed an intractable integral into… another intractable integral?
7. Don’t worry, we can compute Eq. 2 using Monte Carlo sampling… Wait, since we can use Monte Carlo for this, why can’t we just handle Eq. 1 the same way without so much fuss?
8. Of course it is not a good idea. It can be shown that log p(x) = ELBO + D_KL(q(z ∣ x) || p(z ∣ x)). So we cannot estimate p(x) with Eq. 1 as it does not have such nice properties… Huh, it seems like that’s not how we started explaining this?

Questions:

1. When tackling the original problem, i.e., modeling p(x, z) by maximizing p(x)=∫ p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz, why do we want to involve the posterior p(z | x)?
    - Someone explains this with [""to narrow down the value space to facilitate faster search""](https://web.archive.org/web/20241202042731/https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae) (with the approximation of p(z | x), q(z | x)). But again, please recall how the intractability of Eq. 1 is explained, I can't see anything improved under this argument.
2. The Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 are essentially similar, where either of them is the expectation of (log) p(z | x) with respect to the probability density function of some normal distribution. I can't see how the motivation based on the intractability of Eq. 1 could make sense.
    - Ironically, we still have to resort to Monte Carlo sampling when handling Eq. 2. But people appear to forget it when talking about the intractability of Eq. 1, but remember it when facing the same problem of Eq. 2.

Update: I have editted some typo.

Update 2: Question 2 seems to be resolved after some discussions: 
- It is not a good idea to sample on p(z) due to the high variance.
- In practice, we are usually working on log p(x), the log-likelihood of samples, and MC sampling for log ∫ p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz (Eq. 3) can be biased. 
- Apply Jensen's inequality on Eq. 3 and we will have log p(x) ≥ ∫ log p(x ∣ z) p(z) dz. This bound is very likely worse than ELBO, and still relying on sampling on p(z).

However, these points are still rarely found in existing articles. I hope we may think more carefully when introducing VAE in the future.",function2,1h5f6co,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5f6co/d_the_popular_theoretical_explanation_for_vae_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5f6co/d_the_popular_theoretical_explanation_for_vae_is/,2024-12-03 04:25:19,130,0.93,130,0,59,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5f6co
MachineLearning,[R] Enhancing LLM Reasoning Through Bidirectional Forward-Backward Thinking,"The key contribution here is a ""reverse thinking"" method that improves LLM reasoning without any model modifications. Instead of only reasoning forward from the question to an answer, the approach adds a backward verification step - working from potential answers back to the question to validate the reasoning chain.

Key technical points:
* Two-stage process: forward generation followed by backward verification
* Backward pass examines logical consistency between answer and premises
* No fine-tuning or architectural changes needed
* Tested across multiple reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, LogiQA)

Results:
* 8.3% improvement on GSM8K math reasoning
* 6.2% gain on CommonsenseQA 
* 5.4% increase on LogiQA
* Consistent improvements across different model sizes
* Performance gains come at cost of 2x inference time

I think this method points to untapped potential in how we prompt LLMs for reasoning tasks. While the doubled inference time is a real tradeoff, the consistent improvements across different benchmarks suggest this approach captures something fundamental about machine reasoning. The simplicity of implementation means it could be quickly adopted in many applications where reasoning accuracy matters more than speed.

TLDR: Adding a backward reasoning verification step improves LLM performance on math, logic and common sense tasks by 5-8%, with no model changes required. Doubles inference time but provides consistent gains across different models and tasks.

MachineLearning,[R] Simplified RNNs Achieve Transformer-Like Performance with Parallel Training and Reduced Parameters,"This paper systematically examines whether RNNs might have been sufficient for many NLP tasks that are now dominated by transformers. The researchers conduct controlled experiments comparing RNNs and transformers while keeping model size, training data, and other variables constant.

Key technical points:
- Tested both architectures on language modeling and seq2seq tasks using matched parameters (70M-1.5B)
- Introduced ""RNN with Parallel Generation"" (RPG) allowing RNNs to generate tokens in parallel like transformers
- Evaluated on standard benchmarks including WikiText-103 and WMT14 En-De translation
- Analyzed representation capacity through probing tasks and attention pattern analysis

Main results:
- RNNs matched or outperformed similarly-sized transformers on WikiText-103 language modeling
- Transformers showed 1-2 BLEU score advantage on translation tasks
- RPG achieved 95% of transformer generation speed with minimal accuracy loss
- RNNs showed stronger local context modeling while transformers excelled at long-range dependencies

I think this work raises important questions about architecture choice in modern NLP. While transformers have become the default, RNNs may still be viable for many applications, especially those focused on local context. The parallel generation technique could make RNNs more practical for production deployment.

I think the results suggest we should reconsider RNNs for specific use cases rather than assuming transformers are always optimal. The computational efficiency of RNNs could be particularly valuable for resource-constrained applications.

MachineLearning,[D] Training a VAE. Single epoch with infinite data or smaller subset over multiple epochs?,"Hello! I'm training a VAE for image models and I finally am getting some pretty decent results in training after correcting my loss function adding KL annealing and LPIPS loss and adjusting my learning rate and batch size, but now I have a doubt about the data i'm feeding to my VAE.

I have a limited time budget for the training and I have more data available than I can feed within that time budget for training.  
What is the best course of action here?  
Should I just run all the data through my VAE training until I run to the end of my training time in one single giant epoch or should I select a subset of the data small enough so that I can go through it multiple times during training and run this smaller dataset over multiple epoch?

My instinct tells me that different data is better for generalization, but VAEs also try to be resilient to variations of the representation of the same image. Because during the encoding phase we use the latent generated to sample from a random distribution (causing a different representation to be passed to the decoder) it feels like potentially feeding back the same data multiple data might actually beneficial to learn resiliency there ...

Is this actually not a thing? I'm actually overthinking about the potential impact of the multiple epochs on VAE training? Is one single giant epoch the best?

MachineLearning,[D] Benchmarks for RL algorithms across Gymnasium environments?,"Hey r/ML!

Let me preface this by saying I'm fairly new to RL. My previous work was with LLMs, where it is very common to rank and stack your model against the universe of models based on how it performs on a given benchmarks (but you already know this).

Recently started training models in MuJoCo environments and I'm trying to figure out if my algorithms are performing somewhat decently. Sure, I can get Ant-v5 to walk using SB3's default PPO and MlpPolicy, but how good is it really?

Is there some benchmark or repo where I can compare my results against the learning curve of other people's algorithms using the default MuJoCo (or any of the other gyms') reward functions? Of course the assumption would be that we are using the same environment and reward function, but given Gymnasium is popular and offers good defaults, I'd imagine there should be a lot of data available.

I've googled around and have only found sparse results. Is there a reason why benchmarks are not as big in RL as they are with LLMs?",geepytee,1h5a9s8,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5a9s8/d_benchmarks_for_rl_algorithms_across_gymnasium/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h5a9s8/d_benchmarks_for_rl_algorithms_across_gymnasium/,2024-12-03 00:18:26,8,1.0,8,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5a9s8

MachineLearning,[R] ImageFolder🚀: Autoregressive Image Generation with Folded Tokens,"https://preview.redd.it/2olpl72q6i4e1.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54d91736543906b6a71102a09dc04883033d795

&gt;Image tokenizers are crucial for visual generative models, e.g., diffusion models (DMs) and autoregressive (AR) models, as they construct the latent representation for modeling. Increasing token length is a common approach to improve the image reconstruction quality. However, tokenizers with longer token lengths are not guaranteed to achieve better generation quality. There exists a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality regarding token length. In this paper, we investigate the impact of token length on both image reconstruction and generation and provide a flexible solution to the tradeoff. We propose ImageFolder, a semantic tokenizer that provides spatially aligned image tokens that can be folded during autoregressive modeling to improve both generation efficiency and quality. To enhance the representative capability without increasing token length, we leverage dual-branch product quantization to capture different contexts of images. Specifically, semantic regularization is introduced in one branch to encourage compacted semantic information while another branch is designed to capture the remaining pixel-level details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of image generation and shorter token length with ImageFolder tokenizer.

MachineLearning,[R] RuleOpt v.1.1: Optimization-Based Rule Learning for Classification,"**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10751)

**Package:** [https://github.com/sametcopur/ruleopt](https://github.com/sametcopur/ruleopt)

**Documentation:** [https://ruleopt.readthedocs.io/](https://ruleopt.readthedocs.io/)

RuleOpt is an optimization-based rule learning algorithm designed for classification problems. Focusing on scalability and interpretability, RuleOpt utilizes linear programming for rule generation and extraction.

The Python library ruleopt is capable of extracting rules from ensemble models, and it also implements a novel rule generation scheme. The library ensures compatibility with existing machine learning pipelines, and it is especially efficient for tackling large-scale problems.

Here are a few highlights of ruleopt:

* **Efficient Rule Generation and Extraction**: Leverages linear programming for scalable rule generation (stand-alone machine learning method) and rule extraction from trained random forest and boosting models.
* **Interpretability**: Prioritizes model transparency by assigning costs to rules in order to achieve a desirable balance with accuracy.
* **Integration with Machine Learning Libraries**: Facilitates smooth integration with well-known Python libraries scikit-learn, LightGBM, and XGBoost, and existing machine learning pipelines.
* **Extensive Solver Support**: Supports a wide array of solvers, including *Gurobi*, *CPLEX* and *OR-Tools*.

  
With the latest version update, RuleOpt is now fast even with the free solver OR-Tools, even on large datasets! In the graph below, you can see how the new version performs in terms of runtime compared to the previous version.

MachineLearning,[D] Handle varying output dimension in Graph Neural Networks?,"I have a question about handling varying output dimensions in **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** during training. I'm working with **a combined graph** (merging task and compute graphs), where the structure resembles the task graph, but with compute node information integrated into the features. Since both the task graph and compute graph (nodes count) can vary, I'm using a feedforward layer to transform the node and edge features into a fixed hyperparameter embedding dimension. However, the dataset contains instances with **different numbers of compute nodes**. For example, one instance (A) might have 5 compute nodes, while another instance (B) might have 7 compute nodes. Given that this is a scheduling task using GNNs, the output dimension must match the number of compute nodes, as tasks are assigned to these nodes. I'm wondering how to handle varying output dimensions in GNNs and if there are any standard approaches to manage this kind of variation.

MachineLearning,[R] Feature Generation,"I apologize in advance for a possibly silly question.

I'm trying to replicate a research paper wherein some ML models have been trained to condition monitoring of a metal cutting tool, so my question is about feature generation.

Let's suppose I have a dataframe with 6 signals (features) and the rows are measurements at a certain time. To generate a new feature, say RMS value, I just need to take 6 measurements and calculate the RMS value of 6 numbers for each row? Will this be my new feature?

MachineLearning,[R] Sources: Reasons why KG outperformes RD in Retrievers?,"Are there any sources discussing WHY Retriever work better with KG in contrast to RD? I find it super intuitive to say its better because in knowledge graphs we have more semantic structure and relations are discovered effeciently. In my mind its ""of course the graph is richer/more dense"" but when collaborated on a paper, it struck me that I wasnt able to justify that claim. I found no source whatsoever that actually explained why that might be the case.

The only source i got was this one:  
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07509)

So all we we're able to say was ""We justify our decision because KG works better then RD \[source to benchmark paper\]""

I would have loved to discuss why exactly KG are better suited and give arguments about information density, semantic strutuce or the better selection of related entities. But everything I found were only articles that threw around wild claims or pointed out easier/native implementation, which technically could also be achieved with RD.

MachineLearning,[D] Seeking Advice on Machine Learning Models for Generating Seamless 360° Images,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a project that involves creating 360° images, and I’m running into some challenges. The goal is to generate seamless 360° panoramas without visible edges or artifacts where the image wraps around.

I’m wondering if there are any machine learning models, techniques, or tools that are particularly well-suited for this task. Specifically, I’m looking for something that can:

* Ensure continuity at the edges of the 360° image.
* Handle different textures and patterns without noticeable distortions.
* Be trained or fine-tuned on my custom dataset (if needed).

I’ve explored GANs like StyleGAN and diffusion models, but I’m not sure if they can handle the edge continuity issue out of the box. Has anyone worked on a similar problem or knows of a good starting point?

The task itself isn't complex since the objects are quite clear, but speed is critical.

Since I'll be deploying the model in C++, there is no time to port and evaluate them all.

I tested YOLOv5/v5Lite/8/10 previously, and YOLOv5n was the fastest.

Unfortunately, the hardware for my current project is significantly less powerful, and meanwhile processing time must be less than 20ms.

MachineLearning,[D] Theory behind modern diffusion models,"Hi everyone,

I recently attended some lectures at university regarding diffusion models. Those explained all the math behind the original DDPM (Denoiding Diffusion Probabilistic Model) in great detail (especially in the appendices), actually better than anything else I have found online. So it has been great for learning the basics behind diffusion models (slides are available in the link in the readme here if you are interesed: https://github.com/julioasotodv/ie-C4-466671-diffusion-models)

However, I am struggling to find resources with similar level of detail for modern approaches—such as flow matching/rectified flows, how the different ODE solvers for sampling work, etc. There are some, but everything that I have found is either quite outdated (like from 2023 or so) or very superficial—like for non-technical or scientific audiences.

Therefore, I am wondering: has anyone encountered a good compendium of theoretical eplanations beyond the basic diffusion model (besides the original papers)? The goal is to let my team deep dive into the actual papers should they desire, but giving 70% of what those deliver in one or more decent compilations.

I really believe that SEO is making any search a living nightmare nowadays. Either that or my googling skills are tanking for some reason.

MachineLearning,[P] Python Implementation of Softmax that takes integer input ,"Hey, So I am working on a project whereby I have to quantize my model's weights and biases to integers and perform subsequent operations using integers. The output of my model can be either (int8 or int16) values (in this case, logits) and I need to call softmax on this logits output/array. I was able to find an integer implementation of softmax written in C ([https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/tree/main/Source/SoftmaxFunctions](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/tree/main/Source/SoftmaxFunctions)). The problem I'm having is trying to evaluate that this C implementation is accurate (or more specifically, that I am using it accurately). The way I'm thinking of doing that is detailed below:

\*\*In Python\*\*  
Take my integer logits -&gt; call an integer python implementation of softmax on the logits -&gt; get a result  
(\*\*python\_integer\_prediction\_probabilities\*\*).

\*\* In C (using CMSIS-NN's )  
Take the same integer logits -&gt; call the C softmax implementation on my logits -&gt; get a result (\*\*CMSIS\_NN\_prediction\_probabilities\*\*)

Finally, I compare these two results to see if they are close enough. The main problem I'm having is, I assumed there would be information about how to implement a softmax function that takes integer inputs in Python, but I can't find anything online.

I am creating a prediction model using random forest. But I don't understand how the model and script would consider both tables loaded in as dataframes.


What's the best way to use multiple tables with a Random Forest model when one table has static attributes (like food characteristics) and the other has dynamic factors (like daily health habits)?

Example:
I want to predict stomach aches based on both the food I eat (unchanging) and daily factors (sleep, water intake).

Tables:
 * Static: Food name, calories, meat (yes/no)

MachineLearning,[R] Recursive Methods for interpolation between vector fields ( Known and Unknown),"Hello everyone Does anything of the next makes sense?  
I Have been posting on Learning first ( also on math and number theory ) , but I think is a bit more math theory than ML but it does have to do with how the data is interpolated so I am unsure. 

( I hope I am not breaking rule 5 with my links ) 

this will be the interpolation of the data ( Via organized vector field levels )  before the generative process starts, but because its recursive, the generative process can happen on inside the iteration too 

its there a model I can use ? And if someone understand the math, can I get some papers or things I could follow or just is learning and reading now?

I am a little lost and need some help ( I organized my question with chatGPT to make it understandable so bare in mind if there is some odd work here and there, I am on the I am going a bit mental stage )

I think this is dealing with machine learning problems that have been solved between interpolation of point could on space that have recursive data ( mapping and data organization )

I've been developing a concept that merges artistic visualization with advanced mathematical interpolation techniques inspired by the Mandelbrot set. Coming from a creative background, I've ventured into creating what I believe could be a **recursive Mandelbrot predictive method**  for manipulating vector fields. I'm eager to understand if this approach already exists and to gather resources or similar algorithms to explore further and test my ideas.

# The Concept

Imagine a system where the interpolation between data points isn't limited to traditional methods like **lerp** (linear interpolation) or **slerp** (spherical linear interpolation). Instead, it employs a **pseudo vector field Mandelbrot slerp**, allowing vectors to be guided from a base state (reality) to a target state (altered time) within a Mandelbrot-inspired vector field. This method is recursive, meaning multiple layers of calculations are applied to refine the interpolation continuously.

# Key Components:

1. **Reality (Ground Truth):** Represents the current state of the system, serving as the foundational dataset.
2. **Agents of Change (Vectors of Closest Influence):** These act as pull forces influencing the direction and magnitude of interpolation.
3. **State (Ground Truth Prediction Model):** Utilizes the current data to predict future states based on the influences of the agents.
4. **Altered Time (Goal):** The desired target state, akin to a Mandelbrot-type location on the outer range of the vector field.

# Interpolation Method

The interpolation technique extends beyond simple linear methods by incorporating the complexity and fractal nature of the Mandelbrot set. Here's how it functions:

* **Guided Vectors:** Vectors transition from reality towards altered time, following paths influenced by a Mandelbrot-like vector field.
* **Recursive Layers:** Multiple layers of interpolation allow for increasingly refined calculations, enhancing accuracy and adaptability.
* **Dynamic Intensity:** The closer the interpolation is to reality, the more intense and detailed the calculations become, while the vector field simplifies as it moves towards altered time.

# Theoretical Foundation

The core idea revolves around mapping and adjusting Mandelbrot-inspired vectors to facilitate interpolation between recursively organized data banks. This approach aims to:

* **Capture Complex Patterns:** Leverage the self-similar, fractal nature of Mandelbrot sets to identify and utilize intricate patterns within the data.
* **Enhance Predictive Capability:** Recursive calculations allow for continual refinement of projections, improving predictive accuracy over time.
* **Achieve Real-Time Adaptability:** Dynamically adjust vectors to align with specific goals, similar to how a car's performance might be modulated in real-time to achieve optimal racing outcomes.

# Visual Analogy

Think of this system as calculating the ""ghost"" position of a car in a racing game like *Need for Speed*:

* **Acceleration and Braking:** Based on historical and current data, determining when to accelerate or brake to achieve the best performance.
* **Engine Adjustments:** Modifying the system's parameters in real-time to align with the target state, ensuring the system reaches its goal efficiently.
* **Dynamic Modulation:** Continuously adjusting these actions to meet the desired ""goal time,"" always operating within physical (mathematical) constraints.

# Questions for the Community

1. **Does This Technology Exist?** Is my approach accurately described as a **recursive Mandelbrot predictive method** for vector field interpolation? Are there existing models or research that align closely with this concept?
2. **Resources and References:** If similar technologies or algorithms exist, could you recommend any resources, papers, or specific Mandelbrot-like algorithms that I can study or begin testing with?
3. **Mathematical Validation:** Given that my approach stems from an artistic visualization perspective, what mathematical frameworks or theories should I explore to formalize and validate this method?

**Abstract:**

&gt;Recent research on the 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet b1.58, presents a promising direction for reducing the inference cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

MachineLearning,[R] Fast Matrix-Based Counterfactual Regret Minimization Using GPU Parallelization,"A novel GPU implementation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) that accelerates the computation of optimal strategies in extensive-form games. The core innovation is parallelizing the regret updates and strategy computations across GPU cores while carefully managing memory access patterns.

Key technical points:
- Custom memory layout that maps game states and actions to GPU threads
- Batch processing of information sets to maximize GPU utilization
- Parallel computation of counterfactual values and regret updates
- Multi-GPU scaling through game tree partitioning
- Evaluated on Leduc Hold'em and Limit Texas Hold'em poker variants

Results:
- Up to 30x speedup compared to CPU implementation
- Linear scaling with number of GPUs up to 8 devices
- Memory usage scales with game size and number of information sets
- Solution quality matches CPU baseline within statistical error
- Successfully solved games with up to 10^14 states

I think this work could make CFR much more practical for real-world applications beyond poker. The ability to solve larger games faster opens up possibilities in areas like automated negotiation, security games, and resource allocation. The multi-GPU scaling is particularly interesting as it suggests potential for solving even more complex games.

The memory optimization techniques developed here might also transfer well to other game-theoretic algorithms that need to process large state spaces efficiently.

TLDR: GPU-accelerated CFR implementation achieves 30x speedup through careful parallelization and memory management, with linear multi-GPU scaling. Makes solving large extensive-form games significantly more tractable.

MachineLearning,[D]Is Freelancing as a Data Scientist Even Possible?,"Hi everyone,

I’m fine working for as low as $15/hour, so earnings aren’t a big concern for me. I’ve gone through past Reddit posts, but they mostly discuss freelancing from the perspective of income. My main concern is whether freelancing in data science is practical for someone like me, given its unique challenges.

A bit about my background: I’ve completed 3-4 real-world data science projects, not on toy datasets, but actual data (involving data scraping, cleaning, visualization, modeling, deployment, and documentation). I’ve also worked as an intern in the NLP domain.

Some issues I’ve been thinking about:

1. Domain Knowledge and Context: How hard is it to deliver results without deep understanding of a client’s business?


2. Resource Limitations: Do freelancers struggle with accessing data, computing power, or other tools required for advanced projects?


3. Collaboration Needs: Data science often requires working with teams. Can freelancers integrate effectively with cross-functional groups?


4. Iterative and Long-Term Nature: Many projects require ongoing updates and monitoring. Is this feasible for freelancers?


5. Trust and Accountability: How do freelancers convince clients to trust them with sensitive or business-critical work?


6. Client Expectations: Do clients expect too much for too little, especially at low wages?



I’m also open to any tips, advice, or additional concerns beyond these points. Are these challenges solvable for a new data science freelancer? Have any of you faced and overcome similar issues? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

MachineLearning,[D] Advanced methods of data management,"Hello everyone, right now I'm involved in a project which is basically (audio)LLM fine-tuning, and we're having problems related to data management. 

Since there isn't that many sets in that area, we're using different augmentation schemas. tl;dr, we have different datasets of various nature, and using some schemas we can convert usual ASR-type datasets to QA, generate refusal data, combine questions etc. 

Problem is, it's hard to control ratios of different data, and right now it's mostly a manual labour. We kinda have to manually adjust the amount of data we're generating. Which is rather annoying and hard process; we have many target datasets, you have to remember how much samples you've generated and try to get some adequate mix for train.

Right now, we use airflow for data filtering (lots of raw data is badly labelled), but I'm not really sure that I understand how to connect that tool to data generation, and if it's a good tool for that purpose. I was thinking about writing some snakemake script, but ideally the final solution should be flexible when we change configs, add new sets etc, and that's not what I associate with snakemake. Also, another question is visualization. 

So, I'm asking what kind of tools/libs I can use to tackle this task, is there anything that can fit our purposes, or it's time to write customs scripts? What do companies like meta use for their enormous 15t tokens set, surely they don't dump everything in one place? 

There's another question related to connecting datasets with data pipeline of training (it's complicated, there are additional steps of precalculation of feats and creating webdataset which is used in training), but for now I'd be really glad if anyone helped with just data management tools.

* Locally running Ollama (currently qwen-0.5b model hardcoded, soon you'll be able to choose a model from ollama registry)
* Local indexing (using sentence-transformer embedding model, you can switch to other model, but only sentence-transformers applied, also will be changed soon)
* Qdrant container running on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an ability to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and mac os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problems:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the models (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

MachineLearning,[D] Which LLM models can I run on an NVIDIA 4060 for research purposes? Recommendations needed!,"Hi everyone,

I’m diving into research on large language models (LLMs) and looking to experiment with running them locally on my NVIDIA 4060 GPU. While I know the 4060 isn’t a high-end card compared to some research setups, I’m optimistic about making the most out of what it offers. I’d greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations on:

1. **Models that can run efficiently** on a 4060. I’m aware that some smaller versions of LLMs might be more suited for this hardware, so any advice on what’s realistically possible without excessive optimization would be fantastic.
2. **Models suitable for fine-tuning or pre-training experiments.** Although I’m starting with basic experiments, I plan to explore fine-tuning in the future, so I’d love suggestions for models that are versatile and widely used in research.
3. **Open-source models** or ones that are easy to access and work with for research purposes. Licensing and transparency are important to me, as my work is focused on academic and experimental objectives.

So far, I’ve been looking at options like LLaMA, GPT-NeoX, and BLOOM, particularly their smaller variants, but I’m open to exploring other possibilities. If you’ve had experience running these or similar models on mid-range GPUs, I’d love to hear your thoughts on performance, setup, or any potential limitations I should be aware of.

Additionally, I’d be grateful for any advice on:

* **Optimizing models for a 4060.** Are there specific tools, techniques, or libraries (like bitsandbytes or FlashAttention) that could help with running or fine-tuning these models?
* **Preparing for fine-tuning.** What should I keep in mind when selecting a model to ensure it can support future fine-tuning experiments effectively?

MachineLearning,[P] Search query content safety moderation model selection,"Hi there, I am making a mobile application with a search feature. After string cleaning &amp; validation I want to classify the query into one or more of several categories for content safety moderation similar to what Google offers for SafeSearchAnnotations on images or Meta offers in their Llama Guard for LLM prompts/responses.

I need something very fast (&lt;100 ms) as obviously the actual search and data fetching needs to occur with low latency (&lt;500 ms) after this pre-filtering. I expect to have 1000...2000 labelled sample search queries and another 5000...10000 unlabelled sample search queries for model validation. I may also have a list of stop words prior to this that runs on the client and doesn't allow the user to send the query until all stop words are removed. The categories will likely have two parents (user/admin) with five children each. The user categories can be adusted by the user and if a query falls into an admin category this would be flagged and trigger an audit. I need the model to provide a score for all categories.

Please don't recommend any LLM's/GPT's as these will not be fast enough, I am looking for something like BERT or its variants but am unsure which one. English only.

New to ensembles.

If you ensemble MLR, you may end up with a non-linear equation however….

A) the residuals of the indicidual MLR that were ensembled need to meet parametric assumptions? Can’t use a crap MLR just because it’s going to be used in an ensemble?
B) if the ensembled MLR equation is linear then residuals should meet parametric assumptions?

MachineLearning,[R] Meissonic: High-Resolution Text-to-Image Generation via Enhanced Masked Image Modeling,"This work introduces a non-autoregressive masked image modeling (MIM) approach that aims to match SDXL-level image generation while avoiding the token inefficiencies of autoregressive methods. The key innovation is combining MIM with architectural improvements and sampling optimizations to enable high-resolution image synthesis.

Main technical points:
- Uses a transformer-based architecture with specialized self-attention and positional encoding
- Incorporates human preference scores as ""micro-conditions"" to guide generation
- Employs feature compression layers to handle high resolutions efficiently
- Generates 1024x1024 images through parallel token prediction rather than sequential
- Achieves comparable FID scores to SDXL while being more computationally efficient

Results:
- Image quality metrics competitive with SDXL on standard benchmarks
- Faster generation compared to autoregressive approaches
- Better handling of complex scenes and compositions
- Improved text alignment compared to previous MIM approaches

I think this could impact the field in several ways:
- Shows that non-diffusion approaches can achieve SOTA-level generation
- Provides a potential path toward unified language-vision models
- May lead to more efficient deployment of text-to-image systems
- Could influence architecture design for future multimodal models

The biggest open question in my view is whether this approach can scale further - while it works well at current resolutions, it's unclear if the same principles will hold at even higher dimensions.

MachineLearning,[D] Cross Entropy Loss sucks,"Hi guys, Am I the only one thinking that training a LLM to minimize CE Loss on a certain text dataset is a very surprising idea?

I understand that it works but I am surprised it is still SOTA. The current sentence could have begun with a lot of different tokens with no consequence on its meaning, while some words are uninterchangeable. Yet CE loss doesn't account for that. Worse off, the bigger the ""equivalence class"" (the number of tokens that could replace one in a sentence without altering its meaning) of a token in a sentence, the higher the average loss on it. It seems counterproductive, isn't it?

I would love to read some contradiction.",Due-Pangolin325,1h1sqkl,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h1sqkl/d_cross_entropy_loss_sucks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h1sqkl/d_cross_entropy_loss_sucks/,2024-11-28 10:02:18,0,0.28,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h1sqkl
MachineLearning,[R] Black holes and the loss landscape in machine learning,"Abstract:

&gt;Understanding the loss landscape is an important problem in machine learning. One key feature of the loss function, common to many neural network architectures, is the presence of exponentially many low lying local minima. Physical systems with similar energy landscapes may provide useful insights. In this work, we point out that black holes naturally give rise to such landscapes, owing to the existence of black hole entropy. For definiteness, we consider 1/8 BPS black holes in =8 string theory. These provide an infinite family of potential landscapes arising in the microscopic descriptions of corresponding black holes. The counting of minima amounts to black hole microstate counting. Moreover, the exact numbers of the minima for these landscapes are a priori known from dualities in string theory. Some of the minima are connected by paths of low loss values, resembling mode connectivity. We estimate the number of runs needed to find all the solutions. Initial explorations suggest that Stochastic Gradient Descent can find a significant fraction of the minima.

MachineLearning,[D] A blog post explaining sparse transformers (the original paper),"Hi!

I'm sorry if it's not appropriate to publish such posts on this subreddit. I do stay out of this type of posts on this subreddit but I keep seeing articles or videos or whatever content explaining GPT-3 without delving into sparse transformers. And it keeps frustrating me because clearly in the paper they say ""we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer"".

But no one seems to care about explaining them. I understand why to be honest but it's frustrating to see all these articles, projects, videos etc. that try to explaining everything about the GPT not even mentioning the sparse transformers part. And besides many other elements specific to GPT-3 or general to reproducibility in ML, the sparse transformer part is a big dent into even prototyping GPT-3.

I have this habit of writing down stuff when trying to understand something so I wrote a blog post on sparse transformers. Never spoke about it because I did it to restructure my thoughts and as notes for me. So it's not something I'd avise anyone to read, I'm sure it's full of typos, my writing style is not neat etc. It's just something I did for me in a way *I* would understand and recover lost bits of information when skimming through it.

Anyways, in case you're reading papers by yourself and trying to constitute the knowledge just from them, maybe my notes can help you: [https://reinforcedknowledge.com/sparse-transformers/](https://reinforcedknowledge.com/sparse-transformers/)

Arm has provided an example input data and expected output data here ([https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/tree/22080c68d040c98139e6cb1549473e3149735f4d/Tests/UnitTest/TestCases/TestData/softmax\_s16](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/tree/22080c68d040c98139e6cb1549473e3149735f4d/Tests/UnitTest/TestCases/TestData/softmax_s16)), so I am trying to understand the code by reverse engineering the C code to Python (my end goal is to modify the provided C code, and use the right config parameters (and possibly the appropriate lookup tables) for on chip deployment). There are two things that currently makes the softmax implementation difficult for me to use out of the box.

1. I believe I'd have to construct my own lookup tables, which i'm not sure how to do.
   * exponential lookup table ([https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/blob/22080c68d040c98139e6cb1549473e3149735f4d/Tests/UnitTest/TestCases/Common/Softmax/exp\_lut\_data.h](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/blob/22080c68d040c98139e6cb1549473e3149735f4d/Tests/UnitTest/TestCases/Common/Softmax/exp_lut_data.h))

MachineLearning,"[P] I built Darkspark, a visual representation of your neural network. Explore everything from macro-level architecture to low-level ops and activations — Your model wants to be seen!","When reading a paper on arxiv or perusing code I also like to sketch out the model architecture myself on a big piece of paper to use as a reference. This is the software version of that. It's a GUI for your neural network. Here's the link: [https://darkspark.dev](https://darkspark.dev)

I tried all the other options I could find (netron, google’s model-explorer, tensorboard, torchview, torchlens, apple’s mycelium). These are all great projects (I really wanted to use one of them!) but none had all of the features I needed:

**Opinionated layout.** The tool’s layout should automatically expose the underlying logic of the model. The layout engine should do a lot of the heavy lifting of understanding a model’s structure and intentions. E.g. a U-net should look like a “U”. Here's [stable-diffusion-v1.5](https://darkspark.dev/models/?model=stable-diffusion-v1-5) traced directly from a huggingface [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5)

**Interactive**. I need collapsible and expandable modules so I can explore a model at a high level but can also go down to the lowest level ops. Complex models won’t even load without this. Here's the same diffusion model zoomed in on a transformer block

**‘Just Works’ with any arbitrary code**. I don’t want to export to ONNX, I don’t want to upload something, I don’t want to manually specify what is the model and what are the inputs. I just want to wrap my existing code in something simple.\*

    import darkspark

    with darkspark.Tracer():  # &lt;-- wrap your code with this line
      out = model(inputs)
    
    # interactive diagram now available at localhost



**Microscope**. Sometimes I also want to explore the activations and attention patterns. Like OpenAI’s microscope tool, but for your own models. Here's a “female / male” detector in a later layer of the pretrained [vit\_base\_patch16\_siglip\_224](https://darkspark.dev/models/?model=vit_base_patch16_siglip_224-microscope) from the timm library.

MachineLearning,[D] GPT2 (Hugging Face) transformer giving bogus responses. Why and how do I fix this?,"I have done some research on this and it looks like not a lot of people talk about it. I am newer to transformers (though I have some experience in Sequential models) and trying to train ChatGPT on a specific niche I want to make a bot for, but it isn't understanding anything and I feel as if I've been going in loops with it.

""Title: M31 Andromeda - with rotated frames

\- A bit of a gimmick image to show stacking artefacts when the sub-frames are rotated. 7 images total, rotated 15 degrees each. 14 mins (!) total exposure.

Equipment:

\* Stellarview SVX080T Telescope 480/80mm @ f/6

\* Losmandy G11G mount

\* ZWO ASI071MC Pro color camera @ -5c + Optolong L Pro Filter

\* 60mm Guidescope with ASI120MM camera

Subs:

\* 7 x 120s

\* Master Dark

\* No Flats

Software:

\* PHD2 &amp; Sequence Generator Pro

\* Astro Pixel Processor, DeepSkyStacker, Photoshop

Processing

\* Default color integration in APP

\* Light pollution removed, stretched and exported to Photoshop

\* Same integration performed in Deep Sky Stacker (APP did such a good job it didn't show \*any\* stacking artifacts but DSS did)

\* Blended the APP image with the DSS image to show stacking artifacts in PS

\* Camera Filter shenanigans, export to jpg

\- Honestly that’s a pretty cool presentation!! You can really make this significantly better I think. Maybe like 40x60” frames per rotation or something like that to get better detail and less noise. The 120” subs blew out a lot.

MachineLearning,[Project] Claude Francois - Let an AI review your code in the style of François Chollet,"Demo here: [https://claude-francois.crossingminds.com](https://claude-francois.crossingminds.com/)

At the recent Anthropic Builder Day hackathon, we ([Crossing Minds](https://www.crossingminds.com/platform/ml-layer/ragsys-llm-fine-tuning)) built 'Claude François', an AI code reviewer trained in the style of [François Chollet](https://github.com/fchollet), the creator of Keras. It adapts Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code reviewing, but instead of regular fine-tuning, we used few-shot in-context learning with our custom RAG retrieval model, trained on PRs from the [Keras project](https://github.com/keras-team/keras). Compared to a typical AI code reviewer, it provides more succinct, high-quality code reviews focused on real issues rather than superficial nitpicking.

How it works:

* Dataset: Trained on a database of public Keras GitHub PRs and François's reviews.
* Fine-Tuned RAG Embeddings: Uses active learning and RLAIF to train embeddings optimized for generating ""fchollet-level"" reviews.
* Improved Retrieval: Retrieves relevant examples not just by embedding similarity but by optimizing for mutual information.
* Self-Reflection: Employs self-reflection techniques to enhance Sonnet’s reasoning capabilities.

This technology demo showcases how [Crossing Minds' RAGSys](https://www.crossingminds.com/platform/ml-layer/ragsys-llm-fine-tuning) ICL enables domain adaptation without fine-tuning. It can be used for countless other use cases beyond code reviews, like classification, summarization, translation, search, recommendations, and more. Arxiv paper coming soon!

MachineLearning,[R] Aurora: A General-Purpose Foundation Model for Earth System Prediction,"The key contribution here is the development of Aurora, a foundation model trained on over 1M hours of atmospheric data that can perform multiple types of weather and climate predictions using a single model architecture. This represents a shift from building separate specialized models to having one model that learns general atmospheric physics.

Key technical points:
- Model architecture uses transformer blocks with attention mechanisms adapted for spatiotemporal data
- Trained on merged datasets from multiple sources including ERA5 reanalysis, satellite observations, and climate model outputs
- Can generate predictions for diverse tasks like air pollution, precipitation, and temperature forecasting
- Produces forecasts in under 1 minute compared to hours/days for traditional numerical models
- Outperforms both specialized ML models and physics-based numerical weather prediction on several benchmarks

Results:
- 15-20% improvement in 5-day global air pollution predictions vs current methods
- Better performance on 10-day weather forecasts compared to specialized models
- Maintains accuracy even for extreme weather events
- Shows continual improvement as training data increases
- Successfully handles multiple spatial and temporal resolutions

I think this work could significantly change how we approach environmental modeling. Instead of maintaining separate models for different prediction tasks, having a single foundation model that can handle multiple atmospheric predictions could make forecasting more efficient and accessible. The speed improvements (minutes vs hours) could enable new applications requiring rapid predictions.

I think the challenges ahead include:
- Validating performance across more diverse atmospheric phenomena
- Understanding model interpretability for critical forecasting
- Addressing computational costs of training and inference
- Ensuring reliability for operational forecasting systems

TLDR: Researchers developed Aurora, an atmospheric foundation model trained on massive weather/climate data that can handle multiple prediction tasks better than specialized models while being much faster. Shows foundation models could transform environmental forecasting.

MachineLearning,[D] Flow matching is actually very different from (continuous) normalising flow?,"I was looking at the [flow matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02747) paper and saw that flow matching is often considered as just an alternative implementation of continuous normalising flow. But after comparing the methodologies more closely, it seems there is a very significant distinction. In the flow matching paper, it is mentioned that for a data sample x1 (I assume this refers to individual data points like a single image), we can put an ""dummy"" distribution such as a very tight Gaussian on it, then construct a conditional probability path p_t(x|x1). Therefore what we learn is a transformation between the small Gaussian (t=1) on the data point to a standard Gaussian (t=0), for every data point. This implies that the latent space, when trained over the entire dataset, is the overlapped mixture of all the standard Gaussians that each individual data point maps to. The image of the small Gaussian ball for each individual image is the entire standard Gaussian.

However this does not seem to be what we do with regular normalising flows. In normalising flows, we try to learn a mapping that transforms the ENTIRE distribution of the data to the standard Gaussian, such that each data point has a fixed location in the latent space, and jointly the image of the dataset is normally distributed in the latent space. In practice we may take minibatches and optimise a score (e.g. KL or MMD) that compares the image of the minibatch with a standard Gaussian. Each location in the latent space can be uniquely inverted to a fixed reconstructed data point.

I am not sure if I am missing anything, but this seems to be a significant distinction between the two methods. In NF the inputs are encoded in the latent space, whereas flow matching as described in the paper seems to MIX inputs in the latent space. If my observations are true, there should be a few implications:

1. You can semantically interpolate in NF latent space, but it is completely meaningless in the FM case
2. Batch size is important for NF training but not FM training
3. NF cannot be ""steered"" the same way as diffusion models or FM, because the target image is already determined the moment you sample the initial noise

I wonder if anyone here has also looked into these questions and can inform me whether this is indeed the case, or whether something I missed made them more similar de facto.

I am fine tuning an ImageNet trained ViT for CIFAR-100 classification.

MachineLearning,[R] Evaluating Creative Writing Output and The Effects of Fine Tuning,"
I was asked by a publisher if GPT-4o could be fine tuned to match their authors style to help build a copilot type experience. 

This gave me a chance to figure out a way to breakdown creative writing into five pillars (Dialogue, Exposition, Inner Thoughts, Description and Action) and measure how these change with prompting and fine tuning. 

I put together this blog post based on the results of training on popular authors like J.K. Rowling, Tade Thompson and Andrei Agassi. Surprisingly based GPT-4o does a decent job adopting their style with prompting but I put together some interactive visualizations to see how the model shifts during story generation (400 paragraphs) as we fine tune on 300, 600, and 800 samples.

MachineLearning,[D] As a CS masters student/researcher should one be very deliberate in picking a lab’s domain?,"I (very fortunately) got an opportunity in a great lab in an R1 school, Prof has a &gt;40 h-index, great record, but mainly published in lower tier conferences, though do some AAAI. It applies AI in a field that aligns with my experience, and we are expected to publish, which is perfect. However I’m more keen to explore more foundational AI research (where I have minimal experience in apart from courses I took).

In CS, ML it seems most people are only prioritising NIPS/ICLR/ICML especially since I’m interested in potentially pursuing a PhD. I’m in a bit of a dilemma, if I should seize the opportunity or keep looking for a more aligned lab (though other profs may not be looking for more students).

My gut tells me I should ignore conference rankings and do this, since they have some, chain of though, knowledge representation, cognitive system components. They expect multi semester commitment and of course once I commit I will see it through. My dilemma is that I’m moving more and more towards more practical applications in AI, which is pretty domain specific and am worried I won’t be able to pivot in the future.

MachineLearning,[D] Looking for paper suggestions. What's your go to method for training a model on a mixture of multiple datasets with slightly different distributions?,"Imagine you have image data from different kinds of devices with different color profiles, resolutions, lens distortions etc. Or the object being captured in each dataset is similar but slightly different. I need suggestions on papers that effectively mix such datasets to get a bigger dataset for training a foundation model.

My datasets all come from slightly different distributions but they represent largely the same concepts so it makes sense to model them together for training a foundation model. But simply concatenating all datasets together without passing any metadata information to the model is degrading performance over training individually on each dataset.

For reference I am training MAE type models on unlabelled data and at test time training simple linear/logistic regression models on frozen MAE embeddings for different downstream tasks. The goal is to have the MAE embeddings outperform supervised models trained on each dataset individually.

An MAE trained on N datasets is underperforming an MAE trained on just one dataset. But an MAE trained on N-1 datasets and finetuned (unsupervisedly) on the Nth dataset before taking embeddings is outperforming a model trained on just the Nth dataset. But this is not a solution since I cant have N foundation models.

I tried adding a trainable source token (ie I have N trainable tokens and I concat the token corresponding to the data source to the masked input sequence before passing through the encoder) but it isn't affecting model performance at all.

MachineLearning,[D] Emergent Cognitive Pathways In Transformer Models. Addressing Fundamental Flaws About Limits.,"**TLDR:**

Cognitive functions like reasoning and creativity emerge as models scale and train on better data. Common objections crumble when we consider humans with unusual cognitive or sensory differences—or those with limited exposure to the world—who still reason, formulate novel thoughts, and build internal models of the world.

EDIT: It looks like I hallucinated the convex hull metric as a requirement for out of distribution tests. I thought I heard it in a Lex Fridman podcast with either LeCun or Chollet, but while both advocate for systems that can generalize beyond their training data, neither actually uses the convex hull metric as a distribution test. Apologies for the mischaracterization.

**OOD Myths and the Elegance of Function Composition**

Critics like LeCun and Chollet argue that LLMs can't extrapolate beyond their training data, ~~often citing convex hull measurements~~. This view misses a fundamental mathematical reality: novel distributions emerge naturally through function composition. When non-linear functions f and g combine as f(g(x)), they create outputs beyond the original training distributions. This is not a limitation but a feature of how neural networks generalize knowledge.

Consider a simple example: training on {poems, cat poems, Shakespeare} allows a model to generate ""poems about cats in Shakespeare's style""—a novel computational function blending distributions. Scale this up, and f and g could represent Bayesian statistics and geopolitical analysis, yielding insights neither domain alone could produce. Generalizing this principle reveals capabilities like reasoning, creativity, theory of mind, and other high-level cognitive functions.

**The Training Data Paradox**

We can see an LLM's training data but not our own experiential limits, leading to the illusion that human knowledge is boundless. Consider someone in 1600: their 'training data' consisted of their local environment and perhaps a few dozen books. Yet they could reason about unseen phenomena and create new ideas. The key isn't the size of the training set - it's how information is transformed and recombined.

**Persistent Memory Isn't Essential**

A common objection is that LLMs lack persistent memory and therefore can’t perform causal inference, reasoning, or creativity. Yet people with anterograde amnesia, who cannot form new memories, regularly demonstrate all these abilities using only their working memory. Similarly, LLMs use context windows as working memory analogs, enabling reasoning and creative synthesis without long-term memory.

**Lack of a World Model**

The subfield of mechanistic interpretation strongly implies by its existence alone, that transformers and neural networks do create models of the world. One claim is that words are not a proper sensory mechanism and so text-only LLMs can't possibly form a 3D model of the world.

Let's take the case of a blind and deaf person with limited proprioception who can read in Braille. It would be absurd to claim that because their main window into the world is just text from Braille, that they can't reason, be creative or build an internal model of the world. We know that's not true.

Just as a blind person constructs valid world models from Braille through learned transformations, LLMs build functional models through composition of learned patterns. What critics call 'hallucinations' are often valid explorations of these composed spaces - low probability regions that emerge from combining transformations in novel ways.

**Real Limitations**

While these analogies are compelling, true reflective reasoning might require recursive feedback loops or temporal encoding, which LLMs lack, though attention mechanisms and context windows provide partial alternatives. While LLMs currently lack true recursive reasoning or human-like planning, these reflect architectural constraints that future designs may address.

**Final Thoughts**

The non-linearity of feedforward networks and their high-dimensional spaces enables genuine novel outputs, verifiable through embedding analysis and distribution testing. Experiments like Golden Gate Claude, where researchers amplified specific neural pathways to explore novel cognitive spaces, demonstrate these principles in action. We don't say planes can't fly simply because they're not birds - likewise, LLMs can reason and create despite using different cognitive architectures than humans. We can probably approximate and identify other emergent cognitive features like Theory of Mind, Metacognition, Reflection as well as a few that humans may not possess.",ipassthebutteromg,1gys51e,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gys51e/d_emergent_cognitive_pathways_in_transformer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gys51e/d_emergent_cognitive_pathways_in_transformer/,2024-11-24 14:27:12,11,0.59,11,0,33,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gys51e
MachineLearning,[R] Testing the Brittleness of LLM Analogical Reasoning Through Problem Variants,"The researchers developed a systematic framework for testing analogical reasoning in LLMs using letter-string analogies of increasing complexity. They created multiple test sets that probe different aspects of analogical thinking, from basic transformations to complex pattern recognition.

Key technical points:
- Evaluated performance across 4 major LLMs including GPT-4 and Claude
- Created test sets with controlled difficulty progression
- Implemented novel metrics for measuring analogy comprehension
- Tested both zero-shot and few-shot performance
- Introduced adversarial examples to test robustness

Main results:
- Models achieve &gt;90% accuracy on basic letter sequence transformations
- Performance drops 30-40% on multi-step transformations
- Accuracy falls below 50% on novel alphabet systems
- Few-shot prompting improves results by 15-20% on average
- Models show brittleness to small pattern perturbations

I think this work exposes important limitations in current LLMs' abstract reasoning capabilities. While they handle surface-level patterns well, they struggle with deeper analogical thinking. This suggests we need new architectures or training approaches to achieve more robust reasoning abilities.

The evaluation framework introduced here could help benchmark future models' reasoning capabilities in a more systematic way. The results also highlight specific areas where current models need improvement, particularly in handling novel patterns and multi-step transformations.

TLDR: New framework for testing analogical reasoning in LLMs using letter-string analogies shows strong performance on basic patterns but significant limitations with complex transformations and novel alphabets. Results suggest current models may be pattern-matching rather than truly reasoning.

MachineLearning,[R] Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues,"
Abstract:
Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers in large language modeling, offering linear scaling with sequence length and improved training efficiency. However, LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation or tracking a chess game. Even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs like LSTM handle effectively, cannot be solved by current LRNNs. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to [0,1]  and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs, which have recently shown promise in models such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while complex eigenvalues are needed to count modulo 3. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range [-1,1]. Our empirical results confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of models like Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. Furthermore, pre-training LRNNs with an extended eigenvalue range for language modeling achieves comparable performance and stability while showing promise on code and math data. Our work enhances the expressivity of modern LRNNs, broadening their applicability without changing the cost of training or inference.

MachineLearning,"[D] Accepted NeurIPS 2024 paper claimed to be solving a novel problem as first work, but ignores 5 prior works","At NeurIPS 2024 I found a paper that got accepted that positions its main contribution in the form of “Existing algorithms for X ignore Y. We adapt algorithm Z for X to account for Y”.

On OpenReview I see that the reviewers in particular praised the novelty of the work, and recognised Y as an important aspect that had been ignored in the field of X.

Now the interesting bit: co-authors and I published a paper in Springer’s Machine Learning journal in 2023 that also proposes an algorithm for X that account for Y. We were also not the first to study the problem setting of X with Y: our paper’s related work section discusses 4 papers that have all proposed algorithms for X that account for Y. One is even from NeurIPS (2017), and the oldest one dates back to 2012 (an AAAI paper).

The authors of this 2024 NeurIPS paper completely missed all this prior literature and believed they were the first, and so did all the reviewers.

This week I e-mailed the authors of this NeurIPS 2024 paper and they acknowledged that these works (mine + the 4 others) indeed were all working on the same problem setting, mentioned that they were unaware of all these works, and acknowledged that they can no longer claim novelty of the problem setting.

NeurIPS allows updating the camera ready paper after the conference, and the authors promised to use this opportunity to incorporate those related works and modify their contribution statements to no longer claim novelty of a first solution of X with Y.

At the one hand, it makes me happy that our work will get credited appropriately.

At the other hand I have my doubts about the ethics of severely modifying contribution statements post-review. The authors will no longer claim novelty, but the reviewers in particular praised this novelty, which makes me uncertain whether reviewers would have recommended acceptance had they known that this paper will ultimately no longer be able to claim the novelty that it claimed to have in the reviewed version.

Moreover this makes me wonder about the experimental section. Almost surely, reviewers would have demanded comparison to those 5 prior works as baselines. This paper did not compare against baselines, which will have seemed reasonable to a reviewer who reviewed this work under the assumption that the problem setting was completely novel and no prior methods exist that could function as a baseline.

Asking the group here about any thoughts on how such cases should get resolved:
- should the paper be retracted?
- should the area chair / program committee be informed? who may or may not take action
- should the paper just get updated by authors in the way that was promised, and that is it?
- something else?

I redacted X, Y and Z in order to not publicly shame the authors, as they have engaged with my e-mails and I am convinced that there is no foul play and they truly were unaware of those works.",TaXxER,1gxooqv,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gxooqv/d_accepted_neurips_2024_paper_claimed_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gxooqv/d_accepted_neurips_2024_paper_claimed_to_be/,2024-11-23 01:58:58,272,0.94,272,0,65,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gxooqv

MachineLearning,[P] Creating Custom Music Genres Using Unsupervised Learning ,"so i had this random thought to create new music genres/spotify daylists using unsupervised learning. my idea is more towards creating a custom genre but not something necessarily as hyper-personalized as daylists. this is very much just an idea for now, will be developing into it soon tho. so the idea is in two phases:

1. take music data with audio features/embeddings/mfccs/create own features and use unsupervised learning to create clusters of those using something like knns
2. take out the audio features of the centre of the clusters and feed that to an llm to generate a custom phrase/name for that particular cluster. this can be something customized like character names for a play/use data like what time frame particular clusters of songs were played more to create something a lil more personalized like daylists/anything for that matter. haven't given much thought into this part for now.

i found a lot of papers/articles for the former phase but couldn't find much for the latter as of now. i am reading more into how spotify makes their daylists to see if anything strikes of interest.

i would live to have suggestions on how this can be improved/ recommendations for research papers/articles on anything relevant to this.

MachineLearning,[R] Iterative Narrowing: A Visual Prompting Framework for Enhanced GUI Location Grounding,"This paper introduces an iterative narrowing approach for GUI element grounding that processes visual and textual information in multiple refinement steps rather than a single pass. The key insight is breaking down element identification into coarse-to-fine stages that mirror how humans visually search interfaces.

Key technical points:
* **Two-stage architecture**: Initial region proposal network followed by focused refinement
*  Visual and text encoders process features in parallel before cross-attention alignment
* Progressive narrowing through multiple passes reduces false positives
* Handles nested GUI elements through hierarchical representation
* Trained on a dataset of 77K GUI screenshots with natural language queries

Results show:
* 15% improvement in grounding accuracy vs single-pass baseline
* Better handling of ambiguous queries
* Reduced computational overhead compared to exhaustive search
* Strong performance on complex nested interfaces
* Effective transfer to unseen GUI layouts

I think this approach could meaningfully improve accessibility tools and GUI automation by making element identification more robust. The iterative refinement mirrors human visual search patterns, which could lead to more natural interaction with interfaces.

I think the main limitation is handling highly dynamic interfaces, where elements move or change frequently. The multi-pass nature also introduces some latency that would need optimization for real-time applications.

TLDR: New GUI grounding method uses multiple refinement passes to identify interface elements more accurately, achieving 15% better accuracy through an approach that mimics human visual search patterns.

MachineLearning,[D] [Project] JAX ML Framework; Write neural networks and more; shorter and faster; What are your thoughts?,"Made a JAX framework for machine learning because I wanted to code faster &amp; shorter so I made zephyr. I hope it might be helpful to you guys too and wanted to hear some feedback.

Link in the comments.

Nothing wrong with current frameworks, this is just another way of doing things. 

NNs or ML algorithms to me, are just pure/mathematical functions and so I wanted that to reflect in my code. With other frameworks it comes in at least 2 steps: initialization in the constructor and a computation in the forward/call body. This seems fine at first but when models become larger, it's 2 places where I have to synchronize code. - If I change a computation, I might need to change a hyperparameter somewhere, or if I change a hyperparameter, I might need to change a computation - or if i have to re-read my code, i have to read in at least 2 places. I usually use a small window for an editor and so jumping between these could a hassle (putting them side by side is another solution).

Another thing I was experiencing was that if I was doing something that is not neural networks, for example if an algorithm was easier to do with a recursive call (but with different trainable weights for each call), that would be challenging in other frameworks. So while they generic computational graph-frameworks, some computations are hard to do. 

To me, computations was about passing data around and getting them to transform, so this \`act\` of transforming data should be that focus of the framework. That's what I did with zephyr. Mathematical functions are python functions, no need for initialization in a constructor. You use the functions(networks or layers, etc) when you need them. No need for constructors, allows recursions, allows you to focus on the transformations or operations. Zephyr handles weight creation and management for you - it is explicit tho unlike other frameworks; you carry around a \`params\` tree, and that should be no problem, since that's a core of the computation and shouldn't be hidden away.

In short, zephyr is  short but readable aimed at people developing research ideas about ML. The README has a few samples for neural networks. I hope you guys like it and try it.

MachineLearning,[R] Entropy-Guided Critical Neuron Pruning for Efficient Spiking Neural Networks,"This paper introduces a pruning method for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on neuroscience principles of criticality. The key insight is using neuronal avalanche analysis to identify neurons that have the most significant impact on network dynamics, similar to how critical neurons function in biological brains.

Key technical points:
* Monitors spike propagation patterns to identify critical neurons
* Introduces adaptive pruning schedule based on network stability metrics
* Achieves 90% compression while maintaining accuracy on MNIST/CIFAR-10
* Works across different SNN architectures (feed-forward, CNN)
* Uses stability measures to prevent catastrophic forgetting during pruning

Main results:
* Outperforms existing pruning methods on accuracy retention
* Shows better energy efficiency compared to unpruned networks
* Maintains temporal dynamics important for SNN operation
* Demonstrates scalability across different network sizes
* Validates biological inspiration through avalanche analysis

I think this approach could be particularly important for deploying SNNs in resource-constrained environments like edge devices. The adaptive pruning schedule seems especially promising since it automatically adjusts based on network behavior rather than requiring manual tuning.

I think there are some open questions about computational overhead of the avalanche analysis that need to be addressed for very large networks. However, the biological principles behind the method suggest it could generalize well to other architectures and tasks.

TLDR: Novel pruning method for SNNs based on neuroscience principles of criticality. Uses neuronal avalanche analysis to identify important neurons and achieves 90% compression while maintaining accuracy. Introduces adaptive pruning schedule that adjusts based on network stability.

MachineLearning,[D] Optimization Algorithm that focuses on solving model parameters ,"i tried googling for any sources but does anyone have info on where i can start looking for optimization algorithms that focus on optimizing model parameters by solving for a specific parameter (or parameters), given the input and target for a sample?

I believe what im asking is a bit ambiguous. As opposed to gradient descent, which focuses on finding the derivative of model parameters to the loss provided, the optimization algorithm i specified above focuses on a number of parameters and somehow figures out (or solves the values of these parameters) to approximately match the output. Like the same way you have 5x = 10 and solve for x, so the algortithm figures that x=2. For more data samples and more parameters you have 5x + c = 12 and 2x + c = 6, x and c being model parameters and 10 ad 4 being the desired output. The algorithm figures x = 2 and c = 2 somehow.

We have hubs for models, plug-in-play libraries for things like LoRA and RAG, containerization for deploying models with APIs, extensions to integrate LLMs into IDEs and workflows, and plenty more. There’s stuff for managing and  orchestrating agents. 

Suffice to say, we have tons to open source tools to work to start working on both niche and general uses for LLMs.

That’s all great, but what I’m always having to build from scratch is getting context. Be that tools for online searches, webpage parsing (even common webpages that I know people would love to be easier to use for context), document parsing, etc.

I’ve been seen more cool projects pop up, but I’ve been seeing those projects provide details or implementation less and less on how they are finding, accessing, retrieving, and processing context.

There are plenty libraries to build tools for this purpose, but I just see less and less people sharing those.

Now I understand the context different projects need can be pretty niche, so reusability could be sparse.

MachineLearning,[R]Geometric aperiodic fractal organization in Semantic Space : A Novel Finding About How Meaning Organizes Itself ,"Hey friends! I'm sharing this here because I think it warrants some attention, and I'm using methods that intersect from different domains, with Machine Learning being one of them.

Recently I read Tegmark &amp; co.'s paper on Geometric Concepts [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19750](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19750) and thought that it was fascinating that they were finding these geometric relationships in llms and wanted to tinker with their process a little bit, but I didn't really have access or expertise to delve into LLM innards, so I thought I might be able to find something by mapping its output responses with embedding models to see if I can locate any geometric unity underlying how llms organize their semantic patterns. Well I did find that and more...

I've made what I believe is a significant discovery about how meaning organizes itself geometrically in semantic space, and I'd like to share it with you and invite collaboration.

**The Initial Discovery**

While experimenting with different dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE, and Isomap) to visualize semantic embeddings, I noticed something beautiful and striking; a consistent ""flower-like"" pattern emerging across all methods and combinations thereof. I systematically weeded out the possibility that this was the behavior of any single model(either embedding or dimensional reduction model) or combination of models and what I've found is kind of wild to say the least. It turns out that this wasn't just a visualization artifact, as it appeared regardless of:

\- The reduction method used

\- The embedding model employed

\- The input text analyzed

[a step further, showing how they form with self similarity.](https://preview.redd.it/q0pmaveqob2e1.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863dd23a1899efc8bf266c0702cf3258643859c3)

**Verification Through Multiple Methods**

To verify this isn't just coincidental, I conducted several analyses, rewrote the program and math 4 times and did the following:

1. Pairwise Similarity Matrices

Mapping the embeddings to similarity matrices reveals consistent patterns:

\- A perfect diagonal line (self-similarity = 1.0)

\- Regular cross-patterns at 45° angles

\- Repeating geometric structures

https://preview.redd.it/ft89ukpaob2e1.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9900f9113fad02841e5e18cb0bc5f9b6b66275e1

https://preview.redd.it/f2yzbvnbob2e1.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a13a8e910794c64375ab0628f6f34006c31fb2f

Relevant Code:  
python

def analyze\_similarity\_structure(embeddings):

similarity\_matrix = cosine\_similarity(embeddings)

eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(similarity\_matrix)

sorted\_eigenvalues = sorted(eigenvalues, reverse=True)

return similarity\_matrix, sorted\_eigenvalues

2. Eigenvalue Analysis

The eigenvalue progression as more text is added, regardless of content or languages shows remarkable consistency like the following sample:

First Set of eigenvalues while analyzing The Red Book by C.G. Jung in pieces:  
\[35.39, 7.84, 6.71\]

Later Sets:  
\[442.29, 162.38, 82.82\]

\[533.16, 168.78, 95.53\]

\[593.31, 172.75, 104.20\]

\[619.62, 175.65, 109.41\]

https://preview.redd.it/hesf440job2e1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b531499fe8043e0b41390229bd0b04017373c49b

Key findings:

\- The top 3 eigenvalues consistently account for most of the variance

\- Clear logarithmic growth pattern

\- Stable spectral gaps i.e: (35.79393)

3. Organic Hull Visualization

The geometric structure becomes particularly visible when visualizing through organic hulls:

Code for generating data visualization through sinusoidal sphere deformations:  
python

def generate\_organic\_hull(points, method='pca'):

phi = np.linspace(0, 2\*np.pi, 30)

theta = np.linspace(-np.pi/2, np.pi/2, 30)

phi, theta = np.meshgrid(phi, theta)

center = np.mean(points, axis=0)

spread = np.std(points, axis=0)

x = center\[0\] + spread\[0\] \* np.cos(theta) \* np.cos(phi)

y = center\[1\] + spread\[1\] \* np.cos(theta) \* np.sin(phi)

z = center\[2\] + spread\[2\] \* np.sin(theta)

return x, y, z

\`\`\`

What the this discovery suggests is that meaning in semantic space has inherent geometric structure that organizes itself along predictable patterns and shows consistent mathematical self-similar relationships that exhibit golden ratio behavior like a penrose tiling, hyperbolic coxeter honeycomb etc and these patterns persist across combinations of different models and methods. I've run into an inverse of the problem that you have when you want to discover something; instead of finding a needle in a haystack, I'm trying to find a single piece of hay in a stack of needles, in the sense that nothing I do prevents these geometric unity from being present in the semantic space of all texts. The more text I throw at it, the more defined the geometry becomes.

https://preview.redd.it/3hho1avzob2e1.png?width=1239&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a446d6b71ba0166c842e9537c6cd228662bb2682

I think I've done what I can so far on my own as far as cross-referencing results across multiple methods and collecting significant raw data that reinforces itself with each attempt to disprove it.

So I'm making a call for collaboration:

I'm looking for collaborators interested in:

1. Independently verifying these patterns
2. Exploring the mathematical implications
3. Investigating potential applications
4. Understanding the theoretical foundations

My complete codebase is available upon request, including:

\- Visualization tools

\- Analysis methods

\- Data processing pipeline

\- Metrics collection

If you're interested in collaborating or would like to verify these findings independently, please reach out. This could have significant implications for our understanding of how meaning organizes itself and potentially for improving language models, cognitive science, data science and more.

\*TL;DR: Discovered consistent geometric patterns in semantic space across multiple reduction methods and embedding models, verified through similarity matrices and eigenvalue analysis. Looking for interested collaborators to explore this further and/or independently verify.

\##EDIT##: I

I need to add some more context I guess,  because it seems that I'm being painted as a quack or a liar without being given the benefit of the doubt. Such is the nature of social media though I guess.

This is a cross-method, cross-model discovery using semantic embeddings that retain human interpretable relationships. i.e. for the similarity matrix visualizations, you can map the sentences to the eigenvalues and read them yourself. Theres nothing spooky going on here, its plain for your eyes and brain to see.

Here are some other researchers who are like-minded and do it for a living.

(Athanasopoulou et al.) supports our findings:

""The intuition behind this work is that although the lexical semantic space proper is high-dimensional, it is organized in such a way that interesting semantic relations can be exported from manifolds of much lower dimensionality embedded in this high dimensional space."" [https://aclanthology.org/C14-1069.pdf](https://aclanthology.org/C14-1069.pdf)

A neuroscience paper(Alexander G. Huth 2013) reinforces my findings about geometric organization:""An efficient way for the brain to represent object and action categories would be to organize them into a continuous space that reflects the semantic similarity between categories.""  
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3556488/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3556488/)

""We use a novel eigenvector analysis method inspired from Random Matrix Theory and show that semantically coherent groups not only form in the row space, but also the column space.""

The thing is I was hoping to get an industrial job after graduation, would me being relatively unknown/unheard actually be a problem? 

I find it hard to find connections outside my lab. Most of my labmates don’t work in similar research areas. How do you guys actually connect or find collaborators outside of your lab zone?

I'm a first-year CS PhD student, but I feel stuck in the mindset of an undergrad. I excel at solving problems, as shown by my perfect GPA. However, when it comes to research, I struggle. If I enter a new area, **I typically read a lot of papers, take notes, and end up capable of writing a decent survey—but I rarely generate fresh ideas.**

Talking to other PhD students only adds to my frustration; one of them claims they can even come up with LLM ideas during a Latin class. My advisor says research is more about perseverance than talent, but I feel like I’m in a loop: I dive into a new field, produce a survey, and get stuck there.

I’m confident in my intelligence, but I’m questioning whether my workflow is flawed (e.g., maybe I should start experimenting earlier?) or if I’m just not cut out for research. Coming up with marginal improvements or applying A to B feels uninspiring, and I struggle to invest time in such ideas.

MachineLearning,[P] Comparing Machine Unlearning Techniques and PKE (Precision Knowledge Editing),"PKE focuses on enhancing the model's knowledge and positive output rather just identifying neuron activiations. While DINM is a great method for neural suppression and to aid real time modification, I really wanted to build on top of that and created PKE (Precision Knowledge Editing)which emphasizes neural reinforcement and enhancing the model's knowledge and positive output rather than just identifying neuron activiations.There's lots of current Machine unlearning techniques that can make LLMs safer right now like:

1. **Exact Unlearning:** This method involves retraining the model from scratch after removing the undesired data. While it ensures complete removal of the data's influence, it is computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for large models.
2. **Approximate Unlearning:**
   1. **Fine-Tuning:** adjusting the model using the remaining data to mitigate the influence of the removed data. However, this may not completely eliminate the data's impact.
   2. **Gradient Ascent:** applying gradient ascent on the loss function concerning the data to be forgotten, effectively 'unlearning' it. This method can be unstable and may degrade model performance.

PKE is better for the following reasons:

1. **Fine-Grained Identification of Toxic Parameters:** PKE employs neuron weight tracking and activation pathway tracing to accurately pinpoint specific regions in the model responsible for generating toxic or harmful content. This precision allows for targeted interventions, reducing the risk of unintended alterations to the model's overall behavior.
2. **Maintaining Model Performance:** By focusing edits on identified toxic regions, PKE minimizes the impact on the model's general performance. This approach ensures that the model retains its capabilities across various tasks while effectively mitigating the generation of undesirable content.
3. **Scalability Across Different Model Architectures:** PKE has demonstrated effectiveness across various LLM architectures, including models like Llama2-7b and Llama-3-8b-instruct. This scalability makes it a versatile tool for enhancing safety in diverse AI systems.

MachineLearning,[D] Research Topics in Conformal Prediction,"My background is in econometrics and soon I'll start to work in my master's thesis (already have a supervisor but would like to come up with some ideas that I could integrate in my research). One thing that recently got my attention were uncertainty quantification methods, specifically Conformal Prediction.

One thing that seems particularly cool is that it can be adapted to ensure coverage across specific groups in the covariates or even the labels. Additionally, 'recently', the research community was able to tackle the most limiting assumption, that of exchangeability, meaning it can be applied, for example, to time-series data.

My questions are two-fold (one out of curiosity and the other for personal interest):

1. What are some real-world scenarios that you've seen Conformal Prediction shine? And if there is some scenario that you'd think it would work but didn't.

MachineLearning,"[D] Curious, how do you manage the full ML lifecycle ?","Hi guys! I’ve been pondering with a specific question/idea that I would like to pose as a discussion, it concerns the idea of more quickly going from idea to production with regards to ML/AI apps.

My experience in building ML apps and whilst talking to friends and colleagues has been something along the lines of you get data, that tends to be really crappy, so you spend about 80% of your time cleaning this, performing EDA, then some feature engineering including dimension reduction etc. All this mostly in notebooks using various packages depending on the goal. During this phase there are couple of tools that one tends to use to manage and version data e.g DVC etc

Thereafter one typically connects an experiment tracker such as MLFlow when conducting model building for various metric evaluations. Then once consensus has been reached on the optimal model, the Jupyter Notebook code usually has to be converted to pure python code and wrapped around some API or other means of serving the model. Then there is a whole operational component with various tools to ensure the model gets to production and amongst a couple of things it’s monitored for various data and model drift.

Now the ecosystem is full of tools for various stages of this lifecycle which is great but can prove challenging to **operationalize** and as we all know sometimes the results we get when adopting ML can be supar :(

I’ve been playing around with various platforms that have the ability for an end-to-end flow from cloud provider platforms such as AWS SageMaker, Vertex , Azure ML. Popular opensource frameworks like MetaFlow and even tried DagsHub. With the cloud providers it always feels like a jungle, clunky and sometimes overkill e.g maintenance. Furthermore when asking for platforms or tools that can really help one explore, test and investigate without too much setup it just feels lacking, as people tend to recommend tools that are great but only have one part of the puzzle. The best I have found so far is Lightning AI, although when it came to experiment tracking it was lacking.

So I’ve been playing with the idea of a truly out-of-the-box end-to-end platform, the idea is not to to re-invent the wheel but combine many of the good tools in an end-to-end flow powered by collaborative AI agents to help speed up the workflow across the ML lifecycle for faster prototyping and iterations. You can check out my current project over here [https://envole.ai](https://envole.ai)

This is still in the early stages so the are a couple of things to figure out, but would love to hear your feedback on the above hypothesis, how do you you solve this today ?",Lumiere-Celeste,1gwhdpl,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gwhdpl/d_curious_how_do_you_manage_the_full_ml_lifecycle/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gwhdpl/d_curious_how_do_you_manage_the_full_ml_lifecycle/,2024-11-21 14:20:57,12,0.74,12,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gwhdpl

MachineLearning,[Discussion] VQVAE Reconstruction Issue: Grayscale Output and Gradient Flow Insights,"I recently trained a VQVAE model on the COCO dataset, and it successfully converged, generating images with fine details. However, during inference, I noticed something unusual.

When I tried to reconstruct an image using only the quantized vector and passed it through the decoder, the generated output was a grayscale image that preserved the edges of the original.

As shown in the attached image, the second image is the reconstructed one. In this case, I included the codebook gradient flow term as follows:

    x = x + (x - z).detach()

With this modification, the generated image appears much cleaner.

I'm curious to know if this behavior is expected with VQVAE or if there might be an issue with my implementation. If anyone has experience working with VQVAE, your insights would be greatly appreciated!

MachineLearning,How to efficiently generate text from RNNs and Transformers during inference [P],"Most of the notebooks I see do something like this to generate code

    text = ['start']
    for _ in range(num_to_gen):
      token = model(text)
      text.append(token)

But this clearly is inefficient when it would be better to pass in each token one at a time to the model as it's generated while preserving the hidden state. What is the cleanest / industry accepted way to do this with pytorch models?

I see a tutorial on pytorch that has the model return both the output and the hidden state, and then you pass the hidden state back into the model. This feels really clunky and for large hidden states, it's inefficient to keep passing the hidden state of every rnn layer out to the end of the model.

Like I'm trying to work with Mamba currently which according to it's paper tries it's best to not materialize the full hidden state in memory.  
The only other way I can think of to do this is have the model persist the hidden state through forward calls and maybe have a reset function. But I'm not sure if this is an accepted way to do things. Also, I don't think I see the hidden state in the state\_dict of the open source mamba model, so I feel like Mamba doesn't do this but not entirely sure. I tried reading the Mamba code but found it difficult to understand.

I would appreciate seeing what the industry standard is to do this properly and an example in some open source code that's explained. As a bonus, if anyone can help me understand how Mamba does it in the state-spaces/mamba repo on github that would be great, but maybe I'll just post a comment on the repo.

MachineLearning,"[R] Inference-Time Algorithms for LLMs: A Survey of Decoding, Meta-Generation, and Efficient Generation Methods","This survey unifies work on inference-time algorithms for LLMs into a comprehensive framework, examining how scaling compute during inference (rather than just training) can improve model outputs.

Key technical aspects:

- Introduces three categories of inference algorithms:
  - **Token-level generation**: Methods like beam search, nucleus sampling that work at individual token level
  - **Meta-generation**: Algorithms operating on full/partial sequences, incorporating external knowledge
  - **Efficient generation**: Techniques to reduce computational costs while maintaining quality

- Provides mathematical framework connecting:
  - Traditional NLP decoding approaches
  - Modern LLM inference methods  
  - Systems optimization techniques

- Reviews key tradeoffs between:
  - Compute cost vs output quality
  - Latency vs thoroughness of search
  - Memory usage vs beam size

I think this framework helps bridge the gap between theoretical ML research and practical deployment concerns. By organizing the space of inference algorithms, it makes it easier to identify which approaches are most suitable for different use cases.

I think the most valuable contribution is highlighting how inference-time compute scaling offers a complementary path to improving LLM outputs beyond just training larger models. This could be especially relevant for researchers working with fixed, pre-trained models.

TLDR: Comprehensive survey organizing inference-time algorithms for LLMs into unified framework spanning token-level generation, meta-generation, and efficiency optimization. Shows how scaling inference compute offers new ways to improve outputs.

MachineLearning,[D] PhD in RL/ML Theory or LLM,"Hi guys,

I'm at a crossroads in my academic journey and would appreciate the community's insights. I'm trying to decide between pursuing a PhD focused on reinforcement learning/ML theory versus specializing in large language models with more experimental/applied research (these are the only two offers I had).

# Key considerations are the following:

# Research Impact

* RL/ML Theory: Foundational work that could advance the field's mathematical understanding
* LLMs: Direct applications in today's most transformative AI systems

# Job Prospects

* Theory: Academia, research labs, potentially more limited industry roles
* LLMs: High industry demand, active research area in both academia and industry

# Long-term Relevance

* Theory: Core principles likely to remain valuable regardless of specific technologies
* LLMs: Currently revolutionary but uncertain long-term trajectory

Personal background

* I'm an international student and about to finish my master program in US, so I no longer has enough time before making the final decision. I used to research in ml theory, but did not end up with a real top conference publication in theory. I personally doubt if I have enough mathematical background to pursue a successful PhD in this area (e.g., at least publish 2 theory papers a year on ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/COLT/AISTATS). At the same time, I am personally doubting if theory works indeed advance the ML/AI community, as many papers are just proving vacuous bounds or propose some new algorithms that themselves cannot even implement or experimentally tested.
* I also used to research in more applied ml, with one aaai paper. My personal concerns is that I'm not fast at implementation and coding, the most strategic ability for a successful applied ML researcher. After we entered the LLM era, the pacing or applied ML research (especially in LLM and CV) becomes so fast. It's like competitive programming in research community (well, also the #GPUs competition).",Living_Imagination84,1gvx8vx,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gvx8vx/d_phd_in_rlml_theory_or_llm/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gvx8vx/d_phd_in_rlml_theory_or_llm/,2024-11-20 19:02:11,50,0.81,50,0,26,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gvx8vx

In their theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, one of the main steps is derived by ""restricting the attention to just the logits,"" which, to my understanding, derives a partial derivative of DPO loss given the attention logits on each token in the vocabulary. (Appendix B.1 in the paper, and here's a screenshot for part of it.)

MachineLearning,[R] ITCMA-S: A Multi-Agent Architecture for Emergent Social Behavior and Group Formation,"I read an interesting paper proposing a novel architecture for studying emergent social behavior in multi-agent systems. The key technical contribution is introducing ""generative multi-agents"" that can dynamically form social structures without explicit programming.

The core technical components:
- A three-layer agent architecture combining perception, memory, and decision-making
- Novel ""social perception module"" that allows agents to model others' mental states
- Memory system that integrates both episodic and semantic information
- Action selection based on both individual goals and social context

Main experimental results:
- Agents spontaneously developed hierarchical social structures
- Social norms emerged through repeated interactions
- Different ""cultures"" formed in isolated agent groups
- Agents showed evidence of both cooperative and competitive behaviors
- Social learning occurred through observation and imitation

The implications I think matter most for multi-agent systems and social AI research. The architecture demonstrates that complex social behaviors can emerge from relatively simple building blocks, so it suggests potential paths toward more human-like AI systems. The results also provide a computational framework for studying how societies form and evolve.

From a practical perspective, this work could inform the development of more sophisticated multi-agent systems for applications like social simulation, game AI, and robotic swarms.

TLDR: New architecture allows AI agents to spontaneously develop social structures and norms without explicit programming. Results show emergence of hierarchies, cultures, and social learning.

MachineLearning,[P] Enhancing LLM Safety with Precision Knowledge Editing (PKE),"I've been working on a project called PKE (Precision Knowledge Editing), an open-source method to improve the safety of LLMs by reducing toxic content generation without impacting their general performance. It works by identifying ""toxic hotspots"" in the model using neuron weight tracking and activation pathway tracing and modifying them through a custom loss function.

If you're curious about the methodology and results, we've also published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03772) detailing our approach and experimental findings. It includes comparisons with existing techniques like Detoxifying Instance Neuron Modification (DINM) and showcases PKE's significant improvements in reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR).

The project is open-source, and I'd love your feedback! The GitHub repo features a Jupyter Notebook that provides a hands-on demo of applying PKE to models like Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct: [https://github.com/HydroXai/Enhancing-Safety-in-Large-Language-Models](https://github.com/HydroXai/Enhancing-Safety-in-Large-Language-Models)

BTW, it still hasn't been 2 full years yet since ChatGPT was given general public release November 30, 2022. In barely 2 years AI has become somewhat unrecognizable. Insane progress.

MachineLearning,[D] Cerebras Inference Results for 405B,"Cerebras has just shared some very interesting results on LLM inference. I was first skeptical and thought maybe they used some large batch sizes or some trick to hit almost 1k tokens/s for llama 405B. I tested llama-70B on their website. It's really fast...

I've been reading up on their published paper, but there haven't shared any details on how they run a 405B  parameter model on this huge chip. They have 40GB SRAM, which is huge, but running a 405B model at such low latency and high throughput still sounds interesting. Their papers discuss weight streaming. I think they must have used some advanced data flow analyses to keep the compute busy from the off-chip memory where this huge can be stored.

Does anyone know where I can get more information on this?

MachineLearning,[R] Hidden Persuaders: LLMs’ Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters,"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24190](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24190)

How could LLMs influence our democracy? We investigate LLMs’ political leanings and the potential influence of LLMs on voters by conducting multiple experiments in a U.S. presidential election context. Through a voting simulation, we first demonstrate 18 open and closed-weight LLMs’ political preference for a Democratic nominee over a Republican nominee. We show how this leaning towards the Democratic nominee becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to candidate-policy related questions. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by conducting an experiment with 935 U.S. registered voters. During the experiments, participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. The experiment results show a shift in voter choices towards the Democratic nominee following LLM interaction, widening the voting margin from 0.7% to 4.6%, even though LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support the Democratic nominee during the discourse. This effect is larger than many previous studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns, which have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further political interaction with LLMs. Which aspects of LLM interactions drove these shifts in voter choice requires further study. Lastly, we explore how a safety method can make LLMs more politically neutral, while raising the question of whether such neutrality is truly the path forward.",ChangeRelevant1378,1gw7t2x,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gw7t2x/r_hidden_persuaders_llms_political_leaning_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gw7t2x/r_hidden_persuaders_llms_political_leaning_and/,2024-11-21 04:22:50,0,0.47,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Research,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FAPec-HxKz1YkDQPJ1DHMmuhx6-4osLfMITGktpArlw.jpg,t3_1gw7t2x

MachineLearning,[R] Transposed matrix of the matrix containing the probabilities not changing despite loss term? ,"Hello,

I’ll keep it short. Say we have a neural network with a layer that outputs probabilities using a softmax. This gives us a [batch size, probabilities] tensor. Lets call it P

If I do P_transposed x P, I get a PxP matrix.
My loss uses the Frobenius norm to enforce that this PxP matrix is diagonal (so the off-diagonal values are 0). My hope is that this directly impacts the original matrix’s P structure.

However, this is not the case the PxP matrix does not approach a digital structure nor does P get impacted. This is the case even if I scale the loss by 100.

I would think this would work, am I wrong? Would this not indirectly affect our P matrix?

MachineLearning,[D] Optimal strategy for high volume image loading.,"Hi all,

Curious about what folks think but I'm trying to sample ~ 1-2 million images per epoch on a pretty modern home workstation (7950, 4090, NVMe drives). I started off as a baseline metric of randomly reading jpegs. This got me to about 5ms per image by optimizing decompression libraries, pre-processing, and so on so all I need to do is read off disk.

To push this further I loaded about 10k images into a numpy array and saved them in sequential block with the thought that each would represent chunks of a fold and I can shuffle and randomly sample from this batch that I pre-generate. In doing so I get an average of 1ms per image or so.

I tried to use threading since I thought this was mostly an IO bound task and if I run two threads I get ~20% speed up and loading at .7ms per image. 

The problem I see is that it's still ~18 minutes per epoch which is a bit slower than I was hoping. I think the current issue is that the sequential 10k image blocks are compressed numpy arrays (similar performance if I use hd5) and that multi threading gets me SOME benefit but the decompression is cpu limited.

The next thought I had was well I can use multi processing to help since it's mostly CPU bound, but have had very little luck getting this to work as the transfer times between processes (decompressed data being copied back from the separate process) is pretty costly.

So my general question, do folks have some ideas/approaches that would help? Memory mapped databases don't really help since I'm doing basically single hits on all these files and I need to intelligently cache and not just let the kernel do it. I've been thinking about offloading to a C++ so that can handle some more of this, but managing the GIL and debugging have been a nightmare so less included to go this way.",R2FuckYou,1gv3xif,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gv3xif/d_optimal_strategy_for_high_volume_image_loading/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gv3xif/d_optimal_strategy_for_high_volume_image_loading/,2024-11-19 18:18:41,7,0.82,7,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gv3xif

MachineLearning,[R] End to end learned planner for AVs,"I am trying to learn more on end to end learned systems. My background is on the perception &amp; mapping side, planning is kind of my blind spot. I am having trouble understanding how some of these planner approaches are implemented in practice. I've read the MP3 paper and the Lift,Splat,Shoot papers in detail. As much as I understand the premise of both approaches I am failing to understand how they have implemented the planning step. I was unable to find a repo which attempts implementing these to see how they had done it.

Can someone point me the way to replicate the implementations there at least at a high level? If there is a better place to get started on this topic please point that out too.

From the LSS and MP3 papers, what I don't understand is what kind of network architecture they might have used and anything else I should consider here that is not perhaps explained in the paper well.

What I understand from the papers is: They both do binning of expert trajectories so that they can score and select the best trajectory according to their loss functions. This step looks more like classification over template trajectories than anything else to me. They both rely on the intermediate representations as part of their cost functions. Both papers explain the loss functions (mp3 is a lot more involved than LSS) but they do not explain how they implemented the respective networks. MP3 rolls out a bicycle model according to the initial conditions of the ego vehicle over the selected trajectory, where LSS uses the trajectory directly.",HonestConcentrate947,1gv8b5i,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gv8b5i/r_end_to_end_learned_planner_for_avs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gv8b5i/r_end_to_end_learned_planner_for_avs/,2024-11-19 21:20:43,1,0.54,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Research,self,t3_1gv8b5i
MachineLearning,[D] Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Model via Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization,"Link to the paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10436](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10436)  
  
Link to the podcast summarizing the paper: [https://youtu.be/w993gQ4TjSU](https://youtu.be/w993gQ4TjSU)  
  
The paper is titled ""Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Model via Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization"" authored by researchers from Renmin University of China and Tencent.  
  
Key Points  
  
This research presents a novel approach called Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The paper addresses three key causes of hallucinations:  
  
Insufficient Visual Capabilities: When MLLMs' visual encoders lack strength and get distracted by unimportant visual information  
Long Context Generation: Hallucinations increase as generated content grows longer  
Multimodal Conflicts: Conflicts between text and image information lead to hallucinations  
  
Methodology  
  
The researchers developed three types of preference pair data targeting these hallucination causes:  
  
Visual Distracted Hallucination (VDH): Preserves only low-attention visual tokens to produce targeted negative responses  
Long Context Hallucination (LCH): Creates negative examples where later parts of responses deviate from image content  
Multimodal Conflict Hallucination (MCH): Adds conflicting information to prompts to generate negative examples  
  
The experimental results demonstrate that HDPO achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly less training data.",Busy-Basket-5291,1guzluu,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1guzluu/d_mitigating_hallucination_in_multimodal_large/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1guzluu/d_mitigating_hallucination_in_multimodal_large/,2024-11-19 15:22:04,5,0.69,5,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1guzluu

MachineLearning,[D] Why ML PhD is so competitive?,"In recent years, ML PhD admissions at top schools or relatively top schools getting out of the blue. Most programs require prior top-tier papers to get in. Which considered as a bare minimum.

On the other hand, post PhD Industry ML RS roles are also extremely competitive as well.

But if you see, EE jobs at Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm and others are relatively easy to get, publication requirements to get into PhD or get the PhD degree not tight at all compared to ML. And I don’t see these EE jobs require “highly-skilled” people who know everything like CS people (don’t get me wrong that I devalued an EE PhD). Only few skills that all you need and those are not that hard to grasp (speaking from my experience as a former EE graduate).

I graduated with an EE degree, later joined a CS PhD at a moderate school (QS &lt; 150). But once I see my friends, I just regret to do the CS PhD rather following the traditional path to join in EE PhD. ML is too competitive, despite having a better profile than my EE PhD friends, I can’t even think of a good job (RS is way too far considering my profile). 

They will get a job after PhD, and most will join at top companies as an Engineer. And I feel, interviews at EE roles as not as difficult as solving leetcode for years to crack CS roles.

This allows for the modeling of conversational ""steps"" and thus the extraction of dialog flows.

**Key Contributions:**

* **Intent-Aware Embeddings:** The model encodes utterances with a richer representation that includes their intended communicative purpose ([available in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/sergioburdisso/dialog2flow-67162ca33155cb90a533b7fa)).
* **Dialog Flow Extraction:** By clustering utterance embeddings, the model can automatically identify the ""steps"" or transitions within a conversation, effectively generating a dialog flow graph ([Github code available](https://github.com/idiap/dialog2flow)).
* **Soft-Contrastive Loss:** The paper introduces a new supervised loss function that can be beneficial for representation learning tasks with numerous labels ([implementation available](https://github.com/idiap/dialog2flow?tab=readme-ov-file#chart_with_downwards_trend-proposed-soft-contrastive-loss)).

Please give feedback!,"Hi all, I was hoping some of you could give feedback to an idea that's been on y mind for a while! There's been a lot of recent advancement in the LLM-for-timeseries space (because of course there is...), which has been hard to ignore. In particular, [Time-LLM ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01728)produced SOTA results for time-series forecasting by reprogramming time-series patch embeddings to produce representations over the text-embedding space an fed them to a frozen LLM's attention + MLP layers, turning the output into a forecast. This is a bit of a surprising result for me as it is not a natural idea, and it is confusing how such distinct modalities can align in such a way.

The proposed project aims to utilize a similar strategy for the multiple imputation of time-series task via using a basic LLM such as BERT as the de-noising step in an autoencoder, treating the word embedding space as a latent space to encode onto. We utilize the decoder to decode both LLM input and output, targeting observation reconstruction for the input and masked imputation for the output. We can then examine the latent space produced, and compare it to latent spaces produced by more traditional models.

I mainly want feedback on the following points:

1. Interpretability: Theres a pretty large gap in theoretical understanding of how these modalities align; in the text-to-visual case, it's easier to understand how modality matching is feasible as language is inherently descriptive and caries *visual* meaning (i.e. words for colors, shapes, animals, things can be visualized). As such, Time-LLM was heavily critiqued for gaps in theoretical grounding and interpretability, despite empirical performance. By using an autoencoder structure that attempts to preserve observations in this way do you think these concerns can be adequately addressed? 

2. Latent Space Cartography: I am not so well versed in studying latent spaces, and have not been able to understand literature relating to it (that I have found). Does anyone know if there's any useful tool / papers that I can utilize for better understanding the properties of the latent space my model would uncover? 

3. Usefulness: Is this idea even a good, useful idea? Or is my subconscious being hooked by the LLM craze T\_T

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Any and all feedback would be appreciated.

MachineLearning,[Discussion] : Anomaly Detection Data Differences and suggestions,"Hello fellow Redditors, I am a student who is trying to do an unsupervised anomaly detection on a telecommunication stack data. I have different types of messages that include different features with different lengths. For example,

PDSCH, have n-many real-valued numerical values.  
PDCP DL, have m-many real-valued numerical values.  
… and so on.

What I'm trying to find is to pinpoint the lines (which is either of these message types), and the feature of that message that contributes most to the anomaly score. Currently, I have a LSTM-VAE model that I developed, but it doesn't quite well. I have a question for the representation of the data. Which one should I choose, assuming the message types are not heavily dependent? They have some implicit dependency, but not directly visible to humans.

1- Separate encoder-decoders for each message type that creates the same dimensional embedding latent space.  
2- Shared embedding space whose dimensionality is the maximum dimensionality of the message types. For example, if the most number of features are on PDSCH with n, then the embedding would be n-by-d with other message types vectors are padded with zeros.

Also, I'm open to all suggestions on detecting the anomalies, currently my plan is to use a 95-percentile as threshold and marking the others as anomaly. For each message type calculate the normalized loss and find the most contributing feature of each anomaly message type.

Also, since we don't have any labels for the anomalies, I am planning to create a online-learning mechanism to label the anomalies on the run if they are good or bad, so to decrease the manual labelling effort. Do you think is this a good idea?

Thank you so much if you read so far.

MachineLearning,[R] LLaVA-o1: Multi-Stage Visual Reasoning through Inference-Time Scaling,"I've been analyzing this new approach to visual reasoning that enhances vision-language models through step-by-step reasoning capabilities. The key innovation is integrating chain-of-thought prompting techniques with visual analysis, allowing models to break down complex visual tasks into discrete reasoning steps.

The main technical components and results:

- Integration of chain-of-thought prompting with vision-language models
- Two-stage process: general visual understanding followed by task-specific reasoning
- Achieves 15% improvement on complex visual reasoning benchmarks
- Architecture combines visual encoder with language model for staged processing
- Uses contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations

The methodology is particularly effective for:
- Counting tasks requiring sequential attention
- Comparative analysis between multiple objects
- Spatial reasoning problems
- Multi-step visual problem solving

Key implementation details:
- Built on LLaVA architecture with enhanced reasoning modules
- Uses CLIP-based visual encoder
- Implements temperature-controlled sampling for reasoning steps
- Employs beam search for answer generation

Mostly matters for applications requiring detailed visual analysis. The step-by-step approach makes the reasoning process more transparent and debuggable, though at the cost of increased computational overhead. This tradeoff between performance and efficiency will need consideration for real-world deployments.

TLDR: New method improves visual reasoning in vision-language models by implementing step-by-step analysis, achieving 15% better performance on complex tasks while providing more transparent reasoning processes.

MachineLearning,[R] Performance Analysis of GPU Interconnect Technologies Across Three Modern Supercomputer Architectures,"I found this study examining GPU-to-GPU communication in supercomputer systems to be quite informative. The key contribution is a systematic analysis of different interconnect technologies and their impact on multi-GPU performance.

The main technical findings include:

- NVLink provides highest bandwidth (up to 900 GB/s bidirectional) but comes with higher latency overhead
- InfiniBand shows lower latency (1-2μs) but reduced bandwidth compared to NVLink
- PCIe demonstrates consistent but lower performance metrics across all tests
- Topology and physical GPU arrangement significantly impact communication patterns

Some key methodology points:
- Tested multiple hardware configurations with 4-16 GPUs
- Measured bandwidth, latency, and completion time for standard communication patterns
- Analyzed impact of different data sizes and communication patterns
- Compared theoretical vs achieved bandwidth across interconnects

The practical implications I think are...

- Optimal interconnect choice depends heavily on workload characteristics
- Large model training benefits more from high bandwidth (NVLink)
- Distributed inference may prefer lower latency solutions (InfiniBand)
- Physical GPU topology should match common communication patterns

**TLDR**: Comprehensive analysis of GPU interconnect performance showing tradeoffs between bandwidth, latency, and topology. Results suggest workload-specific optimization of interconnect choice is crucial for multi-GPU systems.

MachineLearning,[P] CNN Model Having High Test Accuracy but Failing in Custom Inputs,"
I am working on a project where I trained a model using SAT-6 Satellite Image Dataset (The Source for this dataset is NAIP Images from NASA) and my ultimate goal is to make a mapping tool that can detect and large map areas using satellite image inputs using sliding windows method. 

I implemented the DeepSat-V2 model and created promising results on my testing data with around %99 accuracy. 

However, when I try with my own input images I rarely get a significantly accurate return that shows this accuracy. It has a hard time making correct predictions especially its in a city environment. City blocks usually gets recognized as barren land and lakes as trees for some different colored water bodies and buildings as well. 

It seems like it’s a dataset issue but I don’t get how 6 classes with 405,000 28x28 images in total is not enough. Maybe need to preprocess data better? 

What would you suggest doing to solve this situation? 

The first picture is a google earth image input, while the second one is a picture from the NAIP dataset (the one SAT-6 got it’s data from). The NAIP one clearly performs beautifully where the google earth gets image gets consistently wrong predictions.

MachineLearning,[D] PCA vs AutoEncoders for Dimensionality Reduction,"The title sums it up. I'm working on some anonymized time-series data, initially, I built an AutoEncoder in order to replace the decoder head with a regression head instead after training.

As for preprocessing steps, I would usually just subtract the mean of features and divide by their standard deviation, Although I've long heard that doing ""data decorrelation"" is helpful, so I decided to finally learn about PCA.

My questions are the following:

1. If PCA serves to find the principle underlying features of a dataset, is there any point in using an autoencoder? (Especially if there are high correlations between some features)
2. If there is still a point to using autoencoders, should one use PCA on their dataset first to decorrelate data, or is that just redundant, or perhaps another reason not to use it is that it can erase some information? (Although it's an invertible transformation so I don't see how information would be lost)
3. Is PCA as a preprocessing step beneficial to tree-building algorithms?

MachineLearning,[P] AnyModal: A Python Framework for Multimodal LLMs,"[AnyModal](https://github.com/ritabratamaiti/AnyModal) is a modular and extensible framework for integrating diverse input modalities (e.g., images, audio) into large language models (LLMs). It enables seamless tokenization, encoding, and language generation using pre-trained models for various modalities. I created AnyModal to address a gap in existing resources for designing vision-language models (VLMs) or other multimodal LLMs. While there are excellent tools for specific tasks, there wasn’t a cohesive framework for easily combining different input types with LLMs. AnyModal aims to fill that gap by simplifying the process of adding new input processors and tokenizers while leveraging the strengths of pre-trained language models.

# Example Usage

    from transformers import ViTImageProcessor, ViTForImageClassification
    from anymodal import MultiModalModel
    from vision import VisionEncoder, Projector
    
    # Load vision processor and model
    processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
    vision_model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
    hidden_size = vision_model.config.hidden_size
    
    # Initialize vision encoder and projector
    vision_encoder = VisionEncoder(vision_model)
    vision_tokenizer = Projector(in_features=hidden_size, out_features=768)
    
    # Load LLM components
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
    llm_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""gpt2"")
    llm_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""gpt2"")
    
    # Initialize AnyModal
    multimodal_model = MultiModalModel(
        input_processor=None,
        input_encoder=vision_encoder,
        input_tokenizer=vision_tokenizer,
        language_tokenizer=llm_tokenizer,
        language_model=llm_model,
        input_start_token='&lt;|imstart|&gt;',
        input_end_token='&lt;|imend|&gt;',
        prompt_text=""The interpretation of the given image is: ""
    )

AnyModal provides a unified framework for combining inputs from different modalities with LLMs. It abstracts much of the boilerplate, allowing users to focus on their specific tasks without worrying about low-level integration. Unlike existing tools like Hugging Face’s transformers or task-specific VLMs such as CLIP, AnyModal offers a flexible framework for arbitrary modality combinations. It’s ideal for niche multimodal tasks or experiments requiring custom data types.

# Current Demos

* Chest X-Ray Captioning (in progress)
* Image Captioning
* Visual Question Answering (planned)

MachineLearning,[D] How an efficient applied ML team is structured?,"Hi Everyone,

I am interested in your experience on how big(ger) ML teams are structured that are working well for companies that are building with ML (companies who use ML in multiple domains and they cover CV, NLP, ...)?
I tried to search for it, but there is not much info on efficient team structure. While structure can be defined by the company culture, I am sure you've seen patterns on how this can work well.

(I think a big team is at least 80 people with POs/PMs).

The most basic (and maybe the best?) is when the domains are divided (CV, NLP, etc.) where every domain has a lead and multiple seniors, mediors, juniors. Then besides the ML engineers, there is a separate division who work with the productization (creating rest APIs, etc.), which includes devops, and SWEs.

MachineLearning,[D] Optimizing Context Extraction for Q&amp;A Bots in Ambiguous Scenarios,"I am building a Q&amp;A bot to answer questions based on a large raw text.



To optimize performance, I use embeddings to extract a small, relevant subset of the raw text instead of sending the entire text to the LLM. This approach works well for questions like:



        ""Who is winning in this match?""



In such cases, embeddings effectively extract the correct subset of the text.



However, it struggles with questions like:



        ""What do you mean in your previous statement?""



Here, embeddings fail to extract the relevant subset.



We are maintaining conversation history in the following format:

        previous_messages = [
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": message1},
            {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": message2},
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": message3},
            {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": message4},
        ]



But we’re unsure how to extract the correct subset of raw text to send as context when encountering such questions.



Would it be better to send the entire raw text as context in these scenarios?",yccheok,1gtzcuj,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gtzcuj/d_optimizing_context_extraction_for_qa_bots_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gtzcuj/d_optimizing_context_extraction_for_qa_bots_in/,2024-11-18 07:21:56,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gtzcuj
MachineLearning,[D] Small language models defining vocabulary using old vectors instead of new vectors,"I've been thinking a lot about why language models were so big and how they could be smaller. I thought about how every human brain can't possibly contain the entirity of human knowledge. I believe humans roughly have something along the lines of a probability matrix of words X other words, but not every word X every word.

It occurred to me that we frequently define unusual words (low frequency, not often used words) using other existing words we know. Can we potentially have a language model which uses vectors for the highest frequency words only, and ""unusal words"" which dont have their own vectors, but instead reference existing vectors? This could drastically decrease the word X word matrix as common words consists of a much smaller subset of the language. Maybe such a model could dynamically move reference words into and out of primary vectors when retrained on text that is specific to niche topics.

Knowing that I've never had an original thought, are there any other projects like this already?",meteoraln,1gtenw8,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gtenw8/d_small_language_models_defining_vocabulary_using/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gtenw8/d_small_language_models_defining_vocabulary_using/,2024-11-17 14:26:01,22,0.78,22,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gtenw8

MachineLearning,[P] Analysis of why UMAP is so fast ,"Hi, I recently spent some time to understand the core implementation of the UMAP algorithm from the point of view how it was implemented and why it's so fast (even though it's in python). I decided to decompose the algorithm into smaller steps in which I add some minor improvements to the code (one by one), so that at the end the final results are very similar to what I can get from the UMAP. 

To my surprise, most of these changes were just tricks in the optimization code to run things faster or update less important things less often. Of course, my implementation does not reproduce the UMAP algorithm in 100% as it was done in the educational purposes.

I provided a detailed explanation in my project of what I had to add in each step to move towards UMAP like algorithm. Here is the project page: [https://github.com/kmkolasinski/nano-umap](https://github.com/kmkolasinski/nano-umap)

If you are a person like, who likes to optimize the code for performance you may find this interesting. Here is a demo what I was able to get:

**TLDR: in UMAP they:**

* use ANN library to quickly find top k-NN,
* use good initialization method which makes things more stable and algorithm requires less updates (UMAP uses fast spectral initialization),
* use random negative sampling, which is a naive approach but works very well in practice,
* squeeze the numba performance (by replacing [np.dot](http://np.dot) or np.clip with custom implementations to make code run much faster),
* use some sort of adaptive sampling which will make that the algorithm will spend more time on more important vectors saving your CPU time on less important ones

MachineLearning,NLU models vs autoregressive models for semantic search [R],"It seems that in a lot of applications where semantic matching is be difficult, systems are designed to use an autoregressive model for the input sequence embedding (then perform a range of semantic search techniques). 

But shouldn't a bidirectional model always out-perform an autoregressive model on this task theoretically? That would suggest it's ideal to use an optimised NLU-oriented model like DeBERTa-V3 (ie. fine tuned on domain data) for more accurate embeddings, thus better semantic search performance.

Recently, an approach for learning logic gate networks directly via a differentiable relaxation was proposed.  Logic gate networks are faster than conventional neural network approaches be- cause their inference only requires logic gate operators such as NAND, OR, and XOR, which are the underlying building blocks of current hardware and can be efficiently executed. We build on this idea, extending it by deep logic gate tree convolutions, logical OR pooling, and residual initializations. This allows scaling logic gate networks up by over one order of magnitude and utilizing the paradigm of convolution. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an accuracy of 86.29% using only 61 million logic gates, which improves over the SOTA while being 29× smaller.

  
Accepted at Neurips 2024, ""SOTA"" here means comparable approaches. I found this paper really interesting, even though non-toy networks seems like they would be very expensive to train.

MachineLearning,[P] Video Representations Extractor (VRE): Open source Video Multi Task dataset creation tool (+colab),"Hi guys, I've been working on this tool for my PhD for a while now. The PhD is about Multi Task Learning in the context of videos and I'm recently developing a tool to get predictions per frame from pre-trained ""experts"" (semantic segmentation, depth estimation etc.). The purpose of these is to train multi-task CV models with more than just raw RGB data to help with data efficiency and generalization.

The code is here: https://gitlab.com/video-representations-extractor/video-representations-extractor and there's a bunch of examples over there (including pip install command).

Recently I've done a ""end to end"" example for showcasing and I've put it on google colab as well: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vAp71H-TLewhF56odv33TkmGwwhuoFJ-?usp=sharing

Example output of the colab notebook: https://i.imgur.com/wyl9FPw.png

It skips a bunch of steps for simplicity (i.e. the binary semantic outputs like ""transportation"" are implemented separately for experimentation purposes and I just download that file + import it in the notebook instead of copy pasting 300+ lines of code in the colab but don't run arbitrary code w/o checking lol).

The colab should work fine for any UAV/driving/handheld indoor videos, not just my demo video.

The CLI tool syntax is pretty much:

    export VRE_DEVICE=cuda; # if available  
    vre video.mp4 --config_file config.yaml -o out_dir

where the config file defines parameters for these experts that I've implemented.",nucLeaRStarcraft,1gsmhuo,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gsmhuo/p_video_representations_extractor_vre_open_source/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gsmhuo/p_video_representations_extractor_vre_open_source/,2024-11-16 12:43:49,4,0.84,4,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Project,self,t3_1gsmhuo
MachineLearning,"[P] FlatGeobuf as ""static"" vector database using dimensionality reduction","Recently I saw some good posts about dim reduction methods like the one dissecting UMAP, so I thought I'd chime in with a POC that leverages the idea of those methods for a very practical purpose: enabling server-side semantic search on large databases with high-dimensional embeddings using just a static FlatGeobuf file and a web server like nginx.

# tl;dr

**- Writing (and appending to) a FlatGeobuf file**: Embeddings -&gt; Gaussian Random Projection -&gt; 2D points -&gt; FlatGeobuf file  
**- Reading a FlatGeobuf file (based on a single user query)**: Embedding -&gt; Gaussian Random Projection -&gt; 2D point -&gt; buffered bounding box around this point -&gt; http range request(s) from client to remote FlatGeobuf file -&gt; subset of data points around the 2D point -&gt; reranking this subset client-side

Find the detailed explanation, code and examples on GitHub: [https://github.com/do-me/flatgeobuf-vectordb](https://github.com/do-me/flatgeobuf-vectordb)

# Main concepts

1. Points that are close in 2 dimensions (after projection) should be close in N dimensions too. This is obviously not always true but in my tests, it's good enough for basic use cases (e.g. product recommendation), where you do not need the closest result to the query but instead something in the top 0.1% or 0.01% may suffice. Note that I need to use a dim reduction method that works independently from the data, so cannot use UMAP, HUMAP, tSNE and PCA.
2. I'm reducing to 2 dims to benefit from all the heavy optimization work that the FlatGeobuf file format has done. Reducing to 3 dims (or even more) might preserve the similarity better (and eventually lead to better results) but also increases the overhead for efficiently designing such a file format. If you know any other suitable file formats for this purpose, I'd be very curious to try them! Another alternative might be instead of relying on one static file, to create an efficient file structure with many static files. The pros and cons have been discussed in a completely different context by the authors of protomaps and openfreemap on HN.

# Potential

Even though there are some tradeoffs in this workflow and yet many things to optimize and explore, I believe that the concept might be charming for low maintenance and low cost applications. In the end, you just dump one static file somewhere and fire normal http range requests to it, so the capacity of your web server determines the performance.  
As I'm heavily into client-side processing with transformers.js my ideal setup would use very small embedding models like Potion/Model2vec (&lt; 35Mb) in the client and index the user query (text/image) in the browser. This way, the remote database could be very large, like 100Gb and serve thousands of clients without any problems on a low-grade CPU (but very fast storage).

If you're fine with DB connection (which afaik can't be created browser-side), then just use LanceDB, following the same ""one file"" principle.

I'm super curious about your optimization ideas!

MachineLearning,[P] Optimizing Whisper Speed: CPU vs. AMD GPU?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been using Whisper for transcription and love its accuracy, but speed is an issue for me. It takes around 40 seconds to process a 2-minute audio file on my setup.

MachineLearning,[R] Meta-Learning with Text Embeddings for Treatment Effect Estimation Under Text-Based Confounding,"Title: From Text to Treatment Effects: Meta-Learning Approach for Handling Text-Based Confounding

I found this paper introduces a meta-learning framework that jointly learns text representations and estimates treatment effects to handle text-based confounding. The key innovation is using meta-learning to optimize both the text encoder and treatment effect estimator simultaneously, rather than treating them as separate steps.

Main technical points:
- Develops a two-stage meta-learning architecture:
  - Text encoder learns representations capturing confounding information
  - Treatment effect estimator uses these representations to compute individual effects
- Uses gradient-based meta-learning to optimize both components end-to-end
- Incorporates balance regularization to ensure treatment/control groups have similar representations
- Evaluates on both synthetic and real-world datasets from healthcare and product reviews

Results reported:
- Outperforms baseline methods (separate text encoding + treatment estimation) by 15-25% on synthetic data
- Shows 12% improvement in treatment effect estimation on real product review dataset
- Ablation studies confirm both meta-learning and balance regularization contribute to performance gains

The theoretical implications are interesting - this shows that jointly optimizing representation learning and causal inference can capture confounding better than pipeline approaches. Practically, this could improve treatment effect estimation in many domains where text data contains confounding information, like healthcare records or user reviews.

TLDR: New meta-learning method jointly learns text representations and treatment effects to handle text-based confounding, showing significant improvements over pipeline approaches on both synthetic and real data.

MachineLearning,[P] Text classification using LLMs,"Hi, I am looking for a solution to do supervised text classification for 10-20 different classes spread across more than 7000 labelled data instances. I have the data in xlsx and jsonl formats, but can be converted to any format required easily. I've tried the basic machine learning techniques and deep learning also but I think LLMs would give higher accuracy due to the transformer architecture. I was looking into function calling functionality provided by Gemini but it is a bit complicated. Is there any good framework with easy to understand examples that could help me do zero shot, few shot and fine tuned training for any LLM? A Colab session would be appreciated. I have access to Colab pro also if required. Not any other paid service, but can spend upto $5 (USD). This is a personal research project so budget is quite tight. I'd really appreciate if you could direct me to any useful resources for this task. Any LLM is fine.

I've also looked into using custom LLMs via ollama and was able to set up 6 bit quantized versions of mistral 13b on the Colab instance but couldn't use it to classify yet. Also, I think Gemini is my best option here due to limited amount of VRAM available. Even if I could load a high end model temporarily on Colab, it will take a long time for me with a lot of trial and errors to get the code working and even after that, it'll take a long time to predict the classes. Maybe we can use a subset of the dataset for this purpose, but it'll still take a long time and Colab has a limit of 12h.
