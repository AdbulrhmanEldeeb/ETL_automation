movies,I don't get Beau is Afraid. At all.,"Most of the time, even when I like/love a movie, I can tell why someone might disagree (I love Avatar 2, but I agree with like 90% of the criticism and see them as valid). And vice versa, even if I hate something, I can usually tell why someone might like it (Infinity Pool was hot garbage to me, but I can see where somebody can be enthralled by the premise). I cannot do that with Beau is Afraid. It's just pure ass to me. Spoilers ahead.

The plot boils down to ""A controlling mother orchestrates her son's (Beau's) journey back home, torturing him every step of the way, only to kill him in the end"". This movie is noted as an absurdist black comedy- on its Wikipedia, so this isn't my perspective-, but it's not funny. I've literally laughed more watching Saw movies. I get dark humor, but dark humor has to have a proper target. There's no rocket science. It's a two-step process: remove sympathy for the target, then hurt them in unexpected ways. Beau is Afraid seemed to have skipped step one, so it feels like watching someone drown a sack of puppies for two hours.

And the ""absurdist' angle doesn't work either. First off, all of the absurdity except for maybe the penis monster is mundane. The disparity between the scenes and reality are a light parody filter at-best. Characters weren't outrageous, they were just caricatures; I could easily see all of them in a GTA cutscene. Not old wacky GTA, but new, exaggerated-shitty-realistic GTA. Secondly, even that level of absurdity is watered down by the reveal that the mother's been orchestrating everything. Suddenly, the scenes like everything at the doctor's house and the time where everyone walked into his apartment complex become fully explained and there's no absurdity to it at all. I'll admit, the penis monster is a surprise, but it's a surprise 1:30 into the movie; it's a little late to try to establish the genre you claim to be. 

I'm not 100% hating 100% of its aspects. Visually, it has its moments, and the acting is fine, too, but good visuals and solid performances can't cover for shit writing and a hollow premise

I'm just hoping someone can articulate what they liked about this movie so I can stop thinking I'm insane for seeing anything else than a pile of dogshit compressed into film reel.",Kangarou,1h65zv7,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65zv7/i_dont_get_beau_is_afraid_at_all/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65zv7/i_dont_get_beau_is_afraid_at_all/,2024-12-04 02:58:18,0,0.46,0,0,26,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h65zv7

movies,Jim Carreys Grinch is the Definitive adaptation. Yeah I said it.,"Rewatched the Jim Carrey Grinch movie tonight. Idc what anyone says, this is the definitive version of the story. Don't get me wrong, the original animated short is a classic and always will be, but the Jim Carrey version will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the only Dr. Seuss film that updates the original story, while still sticking true to what the original book standed for, if not enhances it.

Not to mention the set design is absolutely phenomenal, and Jim Carrey as The Grinch is everything. Not just the makeup work, which is also phenomenal, but his performance as well. Unlike Mike Myers Cat in the Hat, who was just phoning it in to the point where it felt like he didn't even want to be there, Jim Carrey put 110% into his performance, he almost became one with the suit and captured the character perfect, while still adding his own energenic flair that Carrey is known for.

It's not perfect, not all the jokes land, I could do without seeing Grinch's face in....um......Melons, and while ""Where are you Christmas"" Is a beautiful song, in the context of the film, it feels out of place, especially since it's not a musical. But overall, I absolutely love this underrated classic, and I'm glad it's finally getting the recognition it deserves. Especially after the shit piece from Illumination. I hope we one day get live action Dr. Seuss films again, as long as they are like this one.",darrylthedudeWayne,1h65k6b,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65k6b/jim_carreys_grinch_is_the_definitive_adaptation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h65k6b/jim_carreys_grinch_is_the_definitive_adaptation/,2024-12-04 02:36:02,0,0.38,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h65k6b

movies,"Were the Detectives at the beginning of ""A Bronx Tale"" Paid off/Fake cops?","Just a thought i Had while rewatching A Bronx Tale at the part where the 2 detectives ask C who the shooter was. I thought it because It's just really strange, Firstly them knowing C was a witness, how would they know that? Did a witness tell them? And if so why didn't they ask THAT witness what they thought rather than the child, furthermore how did that witness know what C's name was? Secondly, they never bring C or Lorenzo to a police station or something that looks more formal, they just line some guys up on the street and ask C who did it, And Thirdly all the suspects were in the mafia. There's more, like how they're both Italian American And It's a very strange way to ask a witness what they thought. As to why the Mafia would do this, It's likely a way to see if they thought C was worthy of becoming a mobster later in life as they've seen him at the bar before looking at sonny, though Sonny wasn't the boss at this point so this might be unlikely, It's also possible this was just to determine if they should kill C or silence him somehow incase the Real police were to ask him. There's some parts that make me think otherwise, like how there is other cops there but they could easily be bribed/fake too, and that mainly, it makes sonny's character look way worse morally but then again he wouldn't be calling the shots at this point and that Mafia dressing up as police is a little silly but has happened before..

movies, Favorite movie by european country: Serbia,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in San Marino. As expected, it wasn't easy to find any movie that fits to the criteria here, but I think, we've found a winner which in a way reflects the heart of this journey very well: ***Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino*** (engl.: *The Unknown Man of San Marino*) is absolutely one of those hidden gems I hoped to find during this project.

Today, I think, it will be easier again to find movies and to be honest, I think, that it's very easy to guess the winner that will take its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). We turn our attention to **Serbia** and, as always, have only two rules to follow:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Horror films without omnipotent villains,"Hi all,

I watch a decent amount of horror films and a trope that I hate in the genre is when the villains are seemingly omnipotent by which I mean this like:

1. They win no matter what
2. Nothing they do ever fails in any way
3. Nothing the main characters do has any impact on the outcome
4. Even if the main characters destroy/win somehow the villain is just back at the end

This can look a lot of ways depending on the kind of villain in the film but the principal is similar. 

I personally find these kids of endings really boring I think because they feel totally unreal and not analogous to the real world as I perceive it. I once complained about this regarding a specific movie and a friend said she loved the ending because it was realistic (she's a very cynical person). 

I'm wondering what you guys think of this trope on general. Anyone else find it boring and tired like me?

Also do any of you have any suggestions for good horror films that somehow subvert this?

Films that I think subvert this and are good include:
The Orphanage (Spanish film)
Babadook
Alien
The mist (though holy hell that ending has it's own problems lol)

movies,Trying to figure out a movie title,"Ok so it's a horror/comedy about an asian(?) Burglar and his girlfriend who work with 1 or 2 others.  The beginning of the movie has the main character arrested during a botched job.  Either he goes to jail or can't get in trouble again without going to jail...but he needs money for a debt I believe.  His girlfriend convinces him to take 1 last job with 1 goofy really tall burglar who's sort of a gangsta asian dude maybe he was her brother?  So they break into a guy's house and find a woman chained in the basement and then they free her.  I remember the twist at the endingish being that it was her kink to be chained down there and she was with the killer home owner all along.  
It was a very similar movie to the collector series,  that war veteran movie where the kids break in, but for the life of my I can't find the name anywhere online from Google searches.  It was kind of low budget....legit hilarious at times and really well made I feel like for it's budget.
Anyone have any clue wtf I'm talking about?
For some reason I feel like the cover of the movie had artwork with a green background like lime green maybe.

A prequel of how Nicomund the Red came to be Santa. Seriously Hollywood, after the sequel you gotta get on this! :D

My idea could be it had something to do with the Norse Gods as it was Odin who bestowed Nicomund the Red with immortality as he became Santa Claus to atone for his sins, and his hammer skullcrusher having been forged by the dwarf brothers Brokkr and Eitri and they're actually amongst Santa's helpers who decided to take them in at the North Pole alongside his elves after Ragnarok occurred killing the Norse Gods.

What stands out is the climax, in which she is on some Carousel Ride, enjoying herself. All the sudden, the carousel horses seem to be taking her away. From what it turns out, she wakes up from a very bad dream in which the carousel horses were taking her away.

movies,Gone Baby Gone (2007) is the ultimate moral conundrum on film. Lots of spoilers.,"I first saw Gone Baby Gone the day it opened in theaters, mostly because I was more curious to see how Ben Affleck's directorial debut turned out after four years of him being the punchline of every Bennifer joke in existence throughout that weird period in pop culture. But also because I saw it was an adaptation of another Boston-set Dennis Lehane novel, and Mystic River became an instant favorite of mine in late 2003, and everything I'd read about the novel Gone Baby Gone convinced me this was gonna be another Lehane multi-layered mystery tragedy. I loved it after leaving the theater, but I didn't expect it to stick with me as long as it did. Patrick's decision to get Jack Doyle arrested once he figured out the entire conspiracy behind Amanda's kidnapping making all the other characters hate him for giving Amanda back to her mother is one of the reasons it stuck with me; I kept asking myself over and over if he made the right decision. Was doing the legally correct thing the morally correct choice?

When it was released on DVD and I got to rewatch it, it finally hit me why the ending stuck with me so much; other than Helene going right back to her old self now that Amanda was home safely, Amanda correcting Patrick on her doll's name hit me like a fucking Mack truck. Throughout the entire movie, Amanda being taken while in possession of her doll named Mirabelle is mentioned several times; Patrick, now on babysitting duty because Helene didn't think to hire one for her date with a ""fan"" of her talk show interviews, sees Amanda playing with her doll and asks, ""Is that Mirabelle?"" Little Amanda responds with ""Annabelle"". 

Now, it's entirely possible this was a new doll purchased for Amanda after Mirabelle took a dip in that quarry's lake, but the look on Patrick's face before it cuts to the credits tells me he realized in that moment that **no one,** not even Amanda's aunt who hired and then stiffed Patrick and Angie, knew the actual name of Amanda's doll, since the media reported multiple times that Amanda had her ""doll named Mirabelle"". Helene and Bea likely would've corrected the record that the doll's name was Annabelle since they were the only two characters who actually wanted the mystery of Amanda's kidnapping solved. But no one corrected the record, so ""Mirabelle"" was the name mentioned several times *until* Amanda corrected Patrick; it's that look on his face as [Alexi Murdoch's ""Through the Dark""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPng8o3zDqM) starts playing that made me realize why this movie stuck with me so much. Patrick put his life and relationship on the line to save this little girl for a woman whom everyone else saw as the drug addicted neglectful horror show of a mother she had been, and lost pretty much everything for doing it: Angie left him and hated him for ripping Amanda away from the nice police captain in the nice, safe home and giving her back to Helene and *didn't* even get paid for all the shit he and Angie went through.

Patrick is the ***only*** character who sees how much pain and torment Helene is experiencing, which explains his ultimate decision and why Angie hates him for it; Angie was never around to see how truly sorry Helene was for her actions leading to Amanda's kidnapping. While others, and the audience, may rightfully disagree with Patrick's decision, pay attention to the times when Helene breaks down on your next rewatch, and you'll better understand why Patrick chose the way he did; no one else saw that side of Helene, they just saw the drug addicted neglectful mother, which was used as the justification for a whole bunch of crimes. Also, I think Patrick's Catholic guilt over executing Corwin Earle was another big deciding factor in him trying to do what he saw as the morally and legally correct choice, and Remy's little motivational speech -- which got the ball rolling for Patrick to realize the truth behind Amanda's kidnapping -- outside the hospital did *nothing* to relieve Patrick's guilt, nor did Angie's pride in Patrick for it. And *goddamn* was Ed Harris a fucking powerhouse in that scene outside the hospital after Nick was shot. If 2007 hadn't been so stacked with amazing Supporting Acting nominations, including Casey Affleck himself as Robert Ford, I'm betting Harris would've been nominated, even if he had *zero* chance of beating Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh.

I also think it's interesting how the *major* mystery of the movie is seemingly solved an hour before the movie ends. But as this was yet another Dennis Lehane multi-layered crime mystery, it makes sense. Little Amanda running out that door and happily jumping into Doyle's arms was one of the biggest mind fucks in a movie since finding out that Dave Boyle was &gt;!entirely innocent of Katie Markum's murder, that he'd actually murdered a pedophile\*!&lt; in Mystic River, making [""The last time I saw Dave Boyle was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9k-uO50300) one of the most tragic movie quotes of this first quarter century. Doyle's entire justification speech to convince Patrick not to report this is the centerpiece of the story's main thesis on doing what's legally or morally correct, which is also apparently the main topic of the [novel's sequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_\(novel\)) Angie's tearful ""She's happy here. I saw her."" does nothing to help Patrick's difficult decision.

Fuck, I love this movie. It's a great addition to the New England Tragedy pentalogy dominated by the brothers Affleck: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Manchester by the Sea. Oh, and it needs to be said that Harry Gregson-Williams' scores for this and The Town are some of the most haunting film scores in the last 20 years.

And RIP to both Michael K. Williams -- still weird to see him in a police uniform after knowing him as Omar Little for so long -- and John Ashton, who just passed away in September.

movies,I hated Mulholland Dr.,"I honestly couldn’t stand it and i was so excited to watch it. 
Before someone says it yes, i could understand it. It is not the great plot twist that it is made out to be, the plot twist is quite literally forced down your throat in the last 30 minutes. I get the first 2 hours is meant to be dream like and yes it did feel dream like, it also felt like complete wank. Every half an hour i’d tell myself “it’s going to get better” it didn’t. 
Obviously i’m in the minority with my dislike towards the film so i’m not going to act like i’m completely correct but i feel like most people force themselves to like the film because of its concept and because it’s meant to be confusing, when in reality it isn’t. 
It was all a dream. Okay? NICE, i’m pretty sure i utilised that plot twist when i was 11 and in primary school. 

Edit: 
I realised that i framed my entire dislike about the film around the fact i didn’t think the plot twist was stupendously confusing, i want it to be apparent that that’s not my main reason for disliking the film, it probably came out this way because the majority of praise i see for the film always surrounds this idea of confusion. This is ofcourse not my main reason for disliking the film, that’d be silly, i just couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it. I’ve realised i should’ve been more open and less critical with my dislike for the film, it just isn’t for me.

Very excited for this movie (out nationwide on December 13th). As someone who read the book and has always been fascinated by Burroughs' work, glad that Guadagnino got to make the film.

Funny enough, Craig becomes the fifth actor to portray Burroughs on the big screen, following Peter Weller in *Naked Lunch* (1991), Kiefer Sutherland in *Beat* (2000), Viggo Mortensen in *On The Road* (2012) and Ben Foster in *Kill Your Darlings* (2013).",MrPuroresu42,1h63qre,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h63qre/queer_exclusive_movie_clip_pig/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h63qre/queer_exclusive_movie_clip_pig/,2024-12-04 01:07:06,0,0.24,0,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Trailer,self,t3_1h63qre

movies, Park Chan-wook's Decision to Leave and how it embraces modern tech ,"This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.

Decision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and ""smart"" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.

This is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.

1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices

* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.
* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.
* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners
* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app
* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)
* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to ""point"") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.
* The ""captain's log"" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app
* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up
* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.

1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.

* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.
* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband
* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband

1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices

* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.
* I like the ""switch"" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks
* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear
* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly

Overall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.

movies,Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before,"Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, ""But where's his brother?"", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.

- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.

- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. ""Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic."" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of ""There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!"" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.

- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (""I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box""). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the ""real"" prestige.

movies,has joe biden ever commented on greg kinnear's portrayal of him in confirmation?,"in 2016, HBO aired the movie confirmation, a movie about the clarence thomas congressional hearings. although it's not among the most famous HBO original movies, the film was acclaimed when it was aired and was even nominated for a few awards. the film has also made several lists of the best HBO original films, which considering their filmography is no easy feat.

in my opinion, one of the best things about the movie is the performances. of course, you have kerry washington and wendell price as anita hill and clarence thomas respectively. however, another important character is joe biden since he's the one who oversaw the hearings. in the film, biden is portrayed by greg kinnear and he gives a really stellar performance in my opinion. not only is he a dead ringer for a young joe biden but he captures his mannerisms and voice perfectly. kinnear captures the essence of biden without dipping into parody and, as a result, gives one of his best performances in my opinion.

it is not uncommon for real life people who are still alive when biopics are made about them to comment on their portrayals. i'm kind of curious if joe biden himself had anything to say about kinnear's performance. does anyone know if biden has ever commented on kinnear's portrayal of him or the movie in general? i mean, the clarence thomas hearings are a pretty significant part of biden's legacy so there's no way that he isn't aware of the movie.",herequeerandgreat,1h5t9go,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5t9go/has_joe_biden_ever_commented_on_greg_kinnears/,2024-12-03 17:46:31,0,0.17,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5t9go
movies,Thriller fans should check out The Last Stop In Yuma County,"This is highly impressive debut by Francis Galluppi, who's set to direct the next Evil Dead movie. It's a single-locatio thriller that takes place in a diner in the middle of a desert highway. Two of the guests are bank robbers who are on the run but their car has run out of gas, and one of them is played by a truly menacing Richard Brake. It's similar to movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Hate, and The Standoff at Sparrow Creek in that it's only a matter of time until the tension erupts into violence, but Galluppi does a great job at squeezing tension out of the littlest moments until the poop hits the fan.

movies,EW's Frat Pack,"Before following other entertainment magazines, Entertainment Weekly had been using the Frat Pack name to describe the group of  Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Edward Norton, as they also had been in movies together.

I know that Leonardo and Tobey are close friends, as are Matt and Ben. Is their a another name for the above list of actors, I would like to be able to see what movies they did together, including the ones that inspired EW to label them as their original Frat Pack.",SnooRegrets4878,1h68qnr,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h68qnr/ews_frat_pack/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h68qnr/ews_frat_pack/,2024-12-04 05:26:21,0,0.18,0,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h68qnr

movies,Info on the Demographics of Cinema goers,"Hi, I'm currently writing an essay on Family Comedy Horror films and was wondering if there was a data base or a way of seeing the demographics of the age range of the people who see specific kinds of films. Like with family films obviously its plenty of parents and their kids but if there was a way to see distributions so i could speculate on and do research on why and how these films are appealing to certain age ranges.

A bit wordy I know, but if yall have any pertinant information I would be happy see it, even if it is a refocusing of my broad question hahah.",CyberAdept,1h5plej,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5plej/info_on_the_demographics_of_cinema_goers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h5plej/info_on_the_demographics_of_cinema_goers/,2024-12-03 15:11:16,0,0.22,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5plej
