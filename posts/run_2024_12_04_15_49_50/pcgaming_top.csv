pcgaming,"Announcing ""Do No Harm"" - A Lovecraftian ""Papers, Please""-like Medical Simulator","Earlier this year we decided to make a game that would be about a Spooky Doctor in a Spooky Town. I just got verified, so I wanted to share with gamers in here. If you like *Papers, Please* or *Strange Horticulture*, I think you'll like my game too!  
  
*Do No Harm* is a Lovecraftian medical simulator where you play as a 19th-century doctor using Galenic medicine (think Four Humours theory) to heal patients on an eerie island village.

* Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do\_No\_Harm/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming)
* YouTube: [https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE](https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE)

The gameplay revolves around patients coming to you with symptoms—some they’ll describe, while others you’ll notice visually or diagnose using tools. You’ll consult your Book of Medicine, which offers hints and narrows down potential treatments, but ultimately, you’ll need to experiment with different medicines to see what works. Sometimes, your patients get better; other times… they don’t make it.

All the while, a Lovecraftian story unfolds in the background, mixed with eerie events and subtle resource management elements.

**What makes** ***Do No Harm*** **unique?**

* **Doctor Simulator with Galenic Medicine**: Immerse yourself in medieval medical practices as you analyze symptoms and treat patients.
* **A Lovecraftian Twist**: Unravel a chilling narrative where reality blurs and cosmic horrors creep into your everyday life.
* **Moral Choices**: In this cultist ridden island village, you'll have to decide whom to trust, heal or maybe even kill. Each choice leads to a different ending.

If you’re intrigued, you can [Wishlist the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming) to support us and stay updated on its release.

I'm the indie developer of *Flocking Hell*, a whimsical-yet-sinister roguelite where you defend your pasture from demonic invasion. It blends calm exploration with auto-battler combat, offering a mix of easy-to-learn mechanics and deep strategy. It also has a lot of sheep.

Check out the demo on Steam:

Here's some more about the game!

* Bite-sized – explore the map, expand your cities, mine for crystals, and defend against the demons, in 5-minute levels that fit into your lunch break.
* Accessible – *Flocking Hell* features simple design, making it easy to learn but challenging to master.
* Low-stress – focus on discovery and growth. The demons will not interrupt until the level is done, at which point you can grab the popcorn and watch the outcome of your work.
* Customize your strategy – draft your deck from over 100 cards and recruit a team of guides from over 40 options, making each run different.
* Endless replayability – each run is unique, with a variety of demons to oppose you and a different mini-challenge in every level.
* Whimsical yet sinister – the world of *Flocking Hell* is full of cuddly sheep and magical cottages. Even the demons are adorable, at least until they start munching on lamb chops …
