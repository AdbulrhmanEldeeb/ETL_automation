gaming,"Path of Exile 2, and a recent trend in gaming","It seems like Path of Exile 2 is shaping up to follow in the footsteps of Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3, a game in a more niche genre, that doubles down on the things people love about that genre, and finds mainstream success by virtue of it being really, really good. Even Metaphor: Re Fantazio sort of fits into that catagory, although I think it's a littke more refined than Persona. And it's got me thinking about how some of the bigger failures of the past few years were games that tried for the broadest appeal possible, and ended up being super bland and forgettable in doing so.

Classic Doom in Doom Eternal: well in 2016 you can play a lot of the classic levels, they are all in a separate menu so out of universe but in Doom Eternal, you access them in universe in Doomguy’s computer inside his fortress

Crash in Uncharted: in the first few chapters of Uncharted 4 you get to a part where Elena tries to get Nate into a PS1 game she really likes and it happens to be Crash Bandicoot.

Classic Activition Games in Call of Duty Cold War: in Cold War there is a section where you go through a mock city used by the russians to train for a US ground invasion. In this mock city you can find arcades with classic activition games.

Those are the 3 I can think of, I also thought of the classic levels in Wolfenstein but those are see as nightmares so they don’t actually exist in universe but what are some others you guys can think of??",Plastic-Fly9455,1h5snb4,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5snb4/what_are_some_irl_games_that_exist_inside_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5snb4/what_are_some_irl_games_that_exist_inside_other/,2024-12-03 17:20:51,140,0.88,140,0,208,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5snb4

Then suddenly memories started flooding in.

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't have to buy weapons or armor. There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.

Recently my hands and wrists have gotten a little painful so I haven’t played in a few weeks. The thing is I don’t miss it. Right now as it stands if I never played again it wouldn’t kill me.
It made me wonder how many of us are playing for the love of gaming or because it’s become an easy habit to fall into.
When was the last time any of us stopped playing for a week just to catch our breath so to speak?

My question is, is this real or even possible? I ask because this month I've been looking at marketplaces like Amazon, Ebay, and Facebook Market and virtually no one sells these new, sealed consoles. They only sell them second-hand without manuals or boxes.

Is it possible that these consoles that are being sold in my country are really new or is it a scam?",NaitDraik,1h5qyfr,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5qyfr/is_it_still_possible_to_find_new_wii_u_and_2ds/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5qyfr/is_it_still_possible_to_find_new_wii_u_and_2ds/,2024-12-03 16:09:11,0,0.4,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5qyfr
gaming,Msi afterburner settings (pc),"Just wanted to share my experience and maybe help someone out with having drops with their gpu

I've been running my set up for a while and it's run fantastic without any problems (dead space remake, psychonauts 2, dungeons 4 ect ect) 

But I've got into some newer games where I would have gpu device hangs (such as stalker 2, cod 6, horizon forbidden west) which would happen less frequently when I dropped the graphics to the lowest end

I thought that was strange I was only getting these drops with very recent games even on low end settings and not 1-3 year old games on high end settings 

So I've been running my Nvidia stats the last couple days and realised once I hit the 75-80° the gpu would hang but that's not crazy surprising

What was surprising is that the default fan settings on msi afterburner aren't great so I set mine to max out at 80° but the fan curve to slowly rise evenly from 30&gt;80° and now even on the higher end of horizon forbidden west or stalker settings its sitting around 65-70°",JonnyNutz,1h6dmp7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6dmp7/msi_afterburner_settings_pc/,https://i.redd.it/xim5unxpet4e1.jpeg,2024-12-04 11:12:14,0,0.33,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ae2-3-Kd9OnBSUE3p4142fwzp69pWznV6vicS43ynFY.jpg,t3_1h6dmp7

gaming,Soulslike Are Killing The Character Action Hack And Slash Genre,"I remember before the PS4/XBO gen we used to get a lot of character action games with hack and slash DMC style combat, wall running and double jumping, QTEs, giant collosal bosses etc. We dont get games like DMC, God of War trilogy, Prince of Persia trilogy, Ashura's Wrath, Darksiders, Metal Gear Rising etc anymore. The closest recent games are Stellar Blade, Nier, KH3, and Bayonetta 3. The silver lining is that it seems atleast Chinese devs are interested in keeping the genre alive, if games like Lost Soul Aside, Where Winds Meet, and Project Perciever are as good as their trailer like Black Myth was then that will be amazing

gaming,If  you had a choice which would you choose between console and keyboard?,"I can't upgrade this computer to Windows 10 ( yes I know I can bypass the test) but i'm leery of doing that and then Microsoft decides to disable my computer  when the next Windows comes out.

So i'm contemplating making some changes. 

I'm trying to decide which would be a better way to go.

A console or a  new desktop or a laptop.

I've always played with keyboard because there are so many more action possibilities but maybe this would be a good time to simplify and use a gaming laptop to cast  to my big screen tv. A TCl  with a beautiful picture.

Wouldnt a gaming laptop give me the best of both worlds? Smaller size but stlll has a keyboard.

As I understand it, with a gaming laptop I can project sound and picture to my TV.

Right?

  
I know its a matter of preference but i'm wondering which route most people would take.

gaming,I actually found a good mobile game and I want to talk about it. ,"The name of the game is Arcane Rush Battlegrounds. 

It’s a battleroyale card game that’s perfect for folks looking for a TFT like experience but something more casual. 

The game starts with 2 groups of 8, the top 4 players of each group then duke it out to find the top player. The original group stage is based on points and the second stage everyone gets 3 life and last one standing wins. 

The cool thing with this is that you’re playing against offline players. So there is no time pressure if something comes up which is great. I found that in the beginning it was very easy to score first place as I am getting to higher ranks I do take some losses against the AI. You earn gold for each elimination you achieve while offline. 

There is also an arena that takes your top builds from the battleroyale to test them against other players and I have found this to be very challenging. 

The game has dealers that have their own cards, and a hero collection they can draft from every game. On top of their being a number of unique races to play while in game each with their own strategy. My personal favourite race are demons and the discard strategy they play with. 

The only time the game pushes ads is to gain extra gold rewards or arena battle chances. Otherwise there are no ads. 

The negative, each of the races are kind of insular, there isn’t many combos to be found. If you start building a race your only real option is to fully build that race since they are all designed to work with themselves. Also the cost of upgrading your dealers is high,300 gold a shot where dailies may not give you enough to enough gold for an upgrade. There are currently 2 dealers with a third on the way and I hope they make some changes to upgrade costs or the amount of gold you can get. 

Well that’s the long and short of it. I hope you all check it out because I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the game. 

Thank you.
