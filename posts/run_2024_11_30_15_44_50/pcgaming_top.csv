pcgaming,Anyone out there still like written video game reviews/articles?,"Just curious if anyone out there still enjoys reading video game articles/reviews? Like - oldschool style - longform text + screenshots.

I myself tend to just skim down to the review score (not that these really mean much these days in the world of sponsored reviews) - but once upon a time, I used to really enjoy a good, longform review.

I myself wrote them freelance for a while, for a local gaming site and the small amount of money I made from it coupled with review copies of various games was always pretty exciting.

But I've been thinking a lot lately - possibly because I'm getting on in age these days, if anyone actually reads the reviews / articles rather than just skim them? Reading for the enjoyment of reading.

pcgaming,"Will you get War of the worlds or not, knowing 1c is based in Moscow?","Hello, I saw a game inspired by HG Wells today, namedThe War of the World: siberia.

It is made by 1c, a studio based in Moscow. This is one thing that would make me hesitate buying the game, and apparently their CEO is close with russian government. Is this something that would impact your decision to buy a game? Of course I understand the CEO does not represent the whole company and that it is noteasy to really oppose the government in a country like Russia
