math,Inductive definition of a set.,"I am a computer science student and have studied basic discrete maths, including set theory. I was pacing across some questions when I came across this one. It seems like the standard way of defining a set inductively. A basis clause stating that certain elements are in the set, and an inductive clause which states that if x is in the set, y is also in the set. 

  
Now the problem that I have with this definition is that for many objects, it does not specify if they are in the set or not (which are not taken into account in both of the clauses). For example in this question, I cannot tell if b is in L or not. According to me, a good definition of a set should be able to define for every object in the universe of discourse, that it belongs to the set or not. The answer here, also completely depends on this assumption. My question is, am I missing something in the way sets are defined inductively, or the question is just vague and poorly framed, or the inductive definition of sets is incomplete and there are better ways to define a set?

I'd be happy to provide any clarifications in my post. TY

math,Alternatives to Billingsley's textbook,"My goal is to cover enough measure theory that will enable me to study and understand the following 

1. Math stats graduate books like that written by Jun Shao or Keener or Bing Li.

2. Stochastic calculus books (say the one by Oksendal or the one by Shreeve and Karatzas)

FWIW, I am working towards a career in quantitative research and these are supposed to be useful (perhaps necessary).

I have studied and worked through Rudin's PMA, Topology by Mendelson, Strang's linalg book, and have worked through most of Hogg and McKean's math stats book.

For measure theory, I have glanced at (1) Capinski and Kopp's book (2) Rene Schilling's book and (3) David William's book. They don't seem as dense as Billingsley's book. But many people seem to opine that Billingsley is a must read. 

I hope this is not a redundant post. I did google search for alternatives to Billingsley's book but could not find it. All I found was a plethora of book recommendations but not specifically as an alternative to Billingsley's book. Hence this post.

So I am requesting for a book that coveres as much or more as that of Billingsley's book, is not dense, and it would be a great plus if it has a solutions manual as I am doing self study.

I am a mathematics student with interests in Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and theoretical aspects of Physics. Recently, I’ve been exploring Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS), and I’m fascinated by its deep connections to Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, and String Theory.

I would like to ask for guidance on the following:

1. Roadmap: What is a good progression of topics or prerequisites to study before diving into HMS? For example, how much familiarity with Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, or Category Theory is required?


2. References: Could you recommend foundational textbooks, lecture notes, or papers that introduce HMS in an accessible way? Are there any must-read works by Kontsevich or others to understand the origins and formalism of the conjecture?


3. History: I’m interested in the development of HMS. How did it emerge historically from Mirror Symmetry in Physics, and what are the most significant milestones in its mathematical formulation?


4. Applications and Extensions: Where is HMS actively being applied or extended in current research? Are there particular areas or open problems that are especially exciting?



I’d love to hear from those who have studied or worked with HMS. Any advice or insights into this beautiful theory would be greatly appreciated!

All of this screams commutative algebra to me (Although I won't take it until next year). Is is this what is usually taught??

I am thinking of delving deeper into homotopy theory (Chapter 4 of Hatcher's Algebraic Topology) for my report, but I wonder if homology/cohomology are prerequisites to studying homotopy theory because I barely know anything about homology/cohomology.

Context: The report should be 10 pages minimum and I have 2 weeks to work on it.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

math,Don't feel smart enough to do really well in mathematics,"I am a math undergrad at a prestigious university (T10 world). I'm currently taking courses such as Ring Theory, Lebesgue Integration and Complex Analysis. On paper, it seems as if I have enough 'ability' to do well in mathematics - I'm the typical, did fairly well in olympiads and high school, and found math easy person.

Despite this, I'm finding it very difficult to crack into the top 10% of my cohort. It feels as if no matter how hard I study, some people just pick up material faster and have a better and deeper understanding. I just feel like I'm not smart enough. I also feel like my exam performance doesn't really reflect my ability - I tend to get very nervous and anxious and fumble hard in exams. I really do enjoy my subject and am considering further graduate study, and feel that my exam performance is going to close doors. I find this sad because I feel that exams aren't really that important in terms of real math understanding.

Does anyone have any tips, apart from just do a lot of math, that can point me in the direction of becoming really really good at math and math exams. I'm starting to feel like graduate study may not be something for me, and it's quite disheartening.

Edit: I don’t find the concepts we are taught so far too difficult to grasp, it’s just that I can never do as well as I would like to in exams. I’m taking more difficult courses next term though, so things could change.

math,Can We Define 'Understanding' Between Systems Mathematically?,"Hello,

Is it possible to mathematically formalize the concept of one system ""understanding"" another? If so, are there any studies or theories that have explored this topic? I would be grateful if you could point me to any relevant work or ideas.

This question stems from the following motivations:

* By formalizing ""understanding"" between systems, I aim to identify subsets such as ""natural language"" and ""mathematical language,"" with the ultimate goal of exploring the limits of human intelligence.
* I believe that by turning the concept of ""understanding"" inward, we may gain insights into the possibility of understanding consciousness itself.
* Ideally, such a formalization would be applicable to human brains or intelligence in a relatively straightforward manner.

More specifically, I am interested in topics such as:

* Mathematical studies on ""understanding"" or ""correspondence"" between systems.
* Applications of information theory, model theory, or type theory to this concept.
* Research on abstract definitions of ""understanding"" in cognitive science or artificial intelligence.

Any suggestions, references, or insights would be greatly appreciated.

math,I’ve been reading Max Tegmark’s book “Our Mathematical Universe” which argues convincingly that we’re living in some vast mathematical structure that somehow acts as a real-life model of itself…,"This seems to render the much-reviled simulation argument moot, because it’s like we drop all pretence that it was ever anything other than a simulation in the first place. 

But anyway my question: what structure could it be?

For this I think we have to call in the model theorists.

From my limited understanding of the subject, perhaps we’re looking for a countable structure (or maybe with the cardinal it the reals?) which is homogeneous, saturated - perhaps some kind of Fraïssé limit which also has a universal interpretability quality?

A countable structure able to interpret any other countable structure, and perhaps with additional saturation properties, would be nice - bonus points if it’s locally finite. 

If one framed a rigorous definition, it seems possible that there are many structures with these properties, and one could then reasonably ask for the simplest or most easily defined. Maybe the rational numbers fit the bill, which would be almost as Delphic and useless as 42 being the answer to everything.

math,I think the formal definition of a limit in Walter Rudin’s Real Analysis text has an unexpected consequence,"This is the second of two definitions of a limit given in Walter Rudin’s *Principles of Mathematical Analysis,” which I understand to be a reliable reference text for analysis. The first definition comes before the introduction of the extended real numbers and, crucially, requires that the point A at which the limit is taken be a limit point of the domain. To cut to the chase I think this second definition allows for the following:

&gt; Let f: E = (0, 4) -&gt; R be defined by f(x)=x. Then f(t) approaches 4 as t -&gt; 5.

Given a neighborhood U of 4 in the codomain, U contains an open interval (4-e, 4+e) for some e&gt;0.
Now let us define a neighborhood of 5 in R which need not be a subset of the domain E. Let V = (4 - e, 5 + e).

We have thus met the required conditions for V: 
- V \cap E is nonempty; the intersection is (4-e, 4).
- On this intersection, we have 4-e &lt; f(t) &lt; 4+e, that is to say f(t) is in U, for every t in V \cap E

Is this an intentional consequence? If so I am curious to hear any perspective that might contextualize this property in a broader or more general topological framing.

Is it unintuitive but nevertheless appropriate because of the nature of the extended reals?

Or is it a typo of some kind that is resolved in other texts?

Or am I misunderstanding something?

math,Is there a bigger picture behind all the different operator norms on Hilbert spaces?,"One way to think of L\^p spaces is that it measures the decay of a function at infinite and its behavior at singularities. As p gets bigger singularities get worse but decay at infinity gets better. 

I noticed the operators on Hilbert spaces have a very similar definition to L\^p spaces and measurable functions. For example the equivalent of an L\^1 norm for operators is the trace class norm, the equivalent of the L\^2 norm is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, and the equivalent of the L\^infinity norm is the operator norm. Is this a coincidence or is there some big picture behind these operator norms similar to the L\^p space idea I gave above? What are these norms tell us about the operator as p increases?

Also while we're talking about this, do we still have the restriction that p &gt;= 1 for these norms like in L\^p spaces? If so why? What about for negative p?

I am reading section 4.2 of Stein and Shakarchi's *Complex Analysis*, where the Schwarz-Christoffel integral is defined as in the image, where A1&lt;...&lt;An and all the beta's are in (0,1) and their sum is &lt;=2. The powers are defined using the branch of log which is defined everywhere except the nonpositive imaginary axis. We define a\_k=S(A\_k) for all k and define a\_∞=S(∞).

In the proof that this integral maps the upper-half plane into the polygon with vertices a1,...,a\_n,a\_∞, they note that S′(x) is real and positive when x&gt;A\_n.

I believe this should mean that when x travels from A\_n to ∞, S(x) should travel in a straight line parallel to the real axis, from left to right. Hence a\_n should be directly left of a\_∞.

However, the image shows what the textbook has drawn.

In the picture, when Σβk=2, a\_1 is to the left of a\_∞ which is to the left of a\_n. But it seems to me this should all be the other way around.

Even worse is the case when Σβk&lt;2, when the line between a\_∞ and a\_n is not even horizontal.

As well, a\_∞ is depicted as being at the top of the shape in these images, but I believe it should really be at the bottom (ie: it should have a smaller imaginary component). Since the line between a\_{n−1} and a\_n is at angle −πβn with the real axis, hence it ""points"" downwards, so a\_{n-1} is above a\_n.

So from my understanding, the polygon should have a flat bottom between points a\_n and a\_∞, where a\_n is to the left of a\_∞. And the rest of the points should be put counterclockwise around the polygon. But this is not what the picture in Stein and Shakarchi depicts, so I'm wondering if I have done something wrong.

Please let me know if my understanding is correct or if I have made a mistake somewhere.

math,"Strange Feature of the Finite Projective Plane PG(2,3)","I was playing with finite projective planes and stumbled across a phenomenon that surprised me. I've thought about it a bit, but cannot explain why it should be so.

Consider PG(2,3), the two-dimensional finite projective plane over GF(3). If we assign a numerical label to each of the thirteen points in the space then we can describe each line in the space by which points it contains. Each line contains four points, so each line can be written as a 4-tuple. So, we can characterize the thirteen lines in PG(2,3) as a 13x4 array. One example of doing so might be (taken from the La Jolla Covering Repository Tables):

|Point A|Point B|Point C|Point D|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3|5|11|
|3|4|6|12|
|4|5|7|13|
|1|5|6|8|
|2|6|7|9|
|3|7|8|10|
|4|8|9|11|
|5|9|10|12|
|6|10|11|13|
|1|7|11|12|
|2|8|12|13|
|1|3|9|13|
|1|2|4|10|

Since these labels are arbitrary, we can permute them however we want and get an equivalent description of the space.

I wondered, is there some permutation of these labels that is ""nice"" in the sense that the row sums of the corresponding array representation of the space are all equal? I've convinced myself that the answer is ""no"", but it looks like something stronger is true.

Clearly, permuting the labels won't affect the *mean* of the row sums of the array. What is surprising (to me anyway), is the fact that permuting the labels also won't affect the *variance* of the row sums of the array. No matter how you shuffle the labels, the variance of the row sums is always 42.

For example, in the array above, the row sums are \[21, 25, 29, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 31, 35, 26, 17\].

If we swap all of the 1s and 13s, however, the row sums are \[21, 25, 17, 32, 24, 28, 32, 36, 28, 43, 23, 26, 29\]

These are different multisets (notice, for example, that the second has a 43 as an element but the first does not), but both have a variance of 42.

What's going on here? It seems clear that there's something about the underlying symmetry of PG(2,3) that's is causing this, but I can't for the life of me see what could be causing the variance of the row sums to be invariant when permuting the point labels.",shdgctbei,1gy94bn,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,2024-11-23 20:33:09,19,0.92,19,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gy94bn

math,Struggling with Discrete Math Teaching Methods at My College—Is This Normal?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently taking a Discrete Math course at my college, and I’m finding the way it’s taught incredibly frustrating and borderline incomprehensible. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar or has advice for dealing with it.

Here’s what’s happening: the materials we’re given—lecture notes and problem sets—are filled with references to other questions, sentences, or formulas scattered across 400+ pages. For example, I’ll be trying to follow a proof, and it’ll say something like “According to question 28c” or “As per sentence 1.24 and question 14k.”

The problem is, I’m expected to use these earlier questions or sentences to understand the current proof, but I’m struggling to keep track of where everything is or how it all connects. If I didn’t understand question 28c, how am I supposed to use it to build a new proof? It feels like I’m being asked to construct something complex without being given a proper foundation.

I’ve talked to friends who study at other colleges, and their Discrete Math courses seem much more straightforward. They get proofs written out step-by-step in a clear way, without having to constantly refer to random questions or pages. Meanwhile, my course feels like a maze of scattered information, and it’s making me doubt my abilities.

I understand that math requires rigor and effort, but this approach feels unnecessarily convoluted. I don’t know if it’s meant to encourage independence or what, but it’s honestly just overwhelming and frustrating.

Does anyone else’s school teach Discrete Math like this? How do you deal with such a fragmented way of learning? Are there any resources or strategies you’d recommend for surviving this kind of course?

Thanks for reading—I’d really appreciate any advice or insight.

math,Is Lowenheim-Skolem just an artifact of the formalism?,"
People here, and on various math blogs,  love to point out the existence of countable models of ZFC. Seems like at least once a week, and this is stated like it has profound implications. Conclusions like ""uncountable sets are an illusion,"" ""God could count the reals,"" or ""we might live in a model where every set is countable"" are common.

But Cantor's argument shows, in a very generic way, whenever we conceive of a collection and its subcollections, there can be no one-to-one correspondence between them. The proof doesn't rely on any controversial axioms of a specific set theory. It's a basic consequence of a very general idea.

And sure, when formally studying models of a first-order set theory, some are countable from the metatheory. It's like making maps of the world. On any given map, South America will be larger than Europe, because it's larger in real life so we make maps that reflect that fact. But South America on one map might be smaller than Europe on a different map (because the whole map is smaller).

But *so what?* Why would you compare objects across models like that? It's common for diagonal arguments to relativize in this way. The halting problem: a Turing machine can't decide it's own halting, but there's always an oracle machine that can. Or the second incompleteness theorem: a theory can't prove itself consistent, but there's always a stronger theory that can.

Yet no one ever says ""incompleteness is an illusion"" or ""we might live in a model where every problem is decidable."" The fundamental ideas are reflected *within each level*, and comparisons across levels don't seem particularly important.

In physics, we encounter ""artifacts of the formalism"" sometimes. Like tachyons in special relativity, closed timelike curves in general relativity, or zero-point energy in quantum fields. Extra stuff that shows up in the math but generally isn't thought to be physically relevant.

Can we say the same about *mathematical* phenomena sometimes? Lowenheim-Skolem seems like a pretty good candidate. While the core idea behind |P(N)| &gt; |N| is reflected (in some form) in each of the models of the set theories we use, the existence of countable models feels like a technical limitation of formal systems, similar to the various paradoxes that ensue when you have to use logic to talk about logic. 

Thoughts? I'm sure there are some formalists here who disagree.

* Terry Tao launched a project for decentralized math research where anyone can contribute a piece of progress to a math problem. See his [blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/).
* Bluesky, a social media platform, is building a protocol for decentralized communication. User's data, including content and followers, is reachable from multiple interfaces. If a user does not like the policy of a platform interface, it can move to another one with her followers and content. See their [blog post](https://bsky.social/about/faq).

**Ambition.** Bluesky aims to let anyone use their decentralized protocol and build new platforms, with a genuine access to all users content and data. Researchers and entrepreneurs may innovate interaction mechanisms, beyond for-profit prediction AI that aims to manipulate people and waste their time for advertisement.

**Discussion**

* If we took the stance of Terry Tao, and started to think of collaborative mechanisms for a new kind of math research, Would the new aspired wave of decentralized internet take place?

The online course is taught online synchronous with the use of James Stewart's book 2nd edition, chapter 1-5. We would be using Knewton for exams and homeworks.

The in-person course focuses on learning calculus through actively engaging; we do calc together as teams and individually. It will also use a lot of visualization concepts through graphs. The textbook is the openstax Calc Volume I, and the course is designed with the 'growth mindset' method which means a weird structure of learning targets, WebWork assignments, PLTL sessions (also in the online course though) and some more stuff like 'carnival days (?) which are remedial days.

math,When to start this Coin Flipping Game over?,"I was thinking about the following problem. Take a game where you have a fixed number of flips f and a prerequisite number of heads h you need to win.

You can start the game anew whenever you like, your headcount get's reset and you get the same number of flips again.

The goal is to win the game as soon as possible so in the least amount of total flips. When is the probability to win the ongoing game low enough that you expect to win earlier by restarting and forfitting the flips you already did.

Let's say it's 100 Flips and you need 80 heads to win. I'd wager that if you flipped 30 times and got only 15 heads you're better off to start over, since getting 75/80 heads is too unlikely and you may hope for a better Start.

I tried some calculations, but my stochastic is very rusty. I though about this in the context of speedrunning a RNG heavy game, when is the run so bad, that you shouldn't waste your time playing it out - I thought this coin flipping game breaks this down to the most basic case?

math,The Correct Way to Search Math,"Very often I have a mathematical thought or question, and think to myself ""surely someone has thought of this before."" However, I'm not really sure how mathematicians search for mathematical work. Some things I've tried:

* Google search
* Arxiv search
* Posting on the internet (here, stack exchange, overflow)
* ChatGPT (are there any AI tools yet for searching through math literature?)

Sometimes the hard part is not knowing what the standard words are for the the concepts you're thinking of. What is your approach to looking for math?

For context: I was thinking about the set of distances between points in a subset of the real line. If we look at some subset A of the reals, and then the set D of all distances between points in A, what sorts of things can we say about D given A?

math,"Examples where ""taking a step backwards"" is helpful","For a project I'm looking for examples in math where it's useful to ""take a step backwards.""

Computation example: the distributive law $a(b+c) = ab + ac$, which we can interpret as a pair of rewrite rules. If we assume that distributing $a(b+c)$ -&gt; $ab + ac$ is the forward direction [1], then factoring is running the distributive law backwards. Factoring is obviously incredibly useful, e.g. in finding closed forms for (convergent) geometric series, or finding roots to polynomials.

Proof-based example: [sometimes it's easier to prove a stronger statement than a weaker statement.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1007256/examples-where-it-is-easier-to-prove-more-than-less) Considering statements / theorems as vertices in a directed graph, where a forward [2] edge from A to B means ""A implies B"", deciding to prove a stronger statement is taking a step backwards in this graph. 

What are some more examples of ""taking a step backwards?"" Computational / algebraic tricks would be the most helpful for the project, but all examples are welcome.

[1] Justification of distribution being the forward direction: computationally speaking, it's easier to match patterns of the form $a(b+c)$ modulo associativity and commutativity than patterns of the form $ab + ac$. Anecdotally, students usually can easily identify situations where they can distribute, but it's harder for them to identify situations where they can factor.

[2] Justification of implication being a forward edge: generally, it is easier to specialize a theorem to a special case than to enumerate all the more general theorems that imply it.",umop_aplsdn,1gvkbgn,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gvkbgn/examples_where_taking_a_step_backwards_is_helpful/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gvkbgn/examples_where_taking_a_step_backwards_is_helpful/,2024-11-20 07:39:58,34,0.84,34,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gvkbgn

I’m an international student considering pursuing a Master’s in Applied Statistics to break into the analytics field.

I’m drawn to analytics because of the opportunities in fields like data science, finance, and tech, but I’m questioning whether this is the best path for someone in my position. Some programs seem highly technical, and I’m wondering if the effort and time would be worth it in the long run.

A few questions I’d love advice on:
	1.	Is a Master’s in Statistics a good way to pivot into analytics, or should I consider other degrees (e.g., Data Science, Business Analytics)?
	2.	Would spending 2+ years preparing for the program and then 2 years in the program itself be worth the time and money investment?

Probably you have heard of the Interesting number paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting\_number\_paradox) which states that every integer is in some way ""interesting"".

So I started digging for the smallest uninteresting integer. First I looked for facts on Wikipedia. On [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_(number)) of numbers, the 2040 seems to be the smallest integer, that is not listed.

So on the search for properties of the 2040, I went to the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org) and found almost every number I was interested in, was somewhere in their database. So I wrote a small python script that searched the OEIS for numbers, to find the smallest integer that is not on there.

It is the 20067. Of course I was not the first one to discover this. Googleing the number, I came across [this blog post](https://benwiederhake.github.io/oeis-funfacts/) by Ben Wiederhake with fun facts about the OEIS, including the 20067.

I am willing to accept that being the smallest integer not in the database of the OEIS *is* in itself an interesting fact about the 20067. Even though the number is not actually that boring. For example it's semi-prime!

So the second smallest integer not in the OEIS is the 20990. I haven't found anything interesting about it so far.

\- It's factorization is  2 \* 5 \* 2099  
\- It is unhappy  
\- It is deficient

I haven't got any good ideas on how to discover interesting properties about numbers. So far I've got just by going through online databases and now I'm a bit stuck. Almost went out to make some sort of crazy piece of art with the 20990 in it...

Maybe someone here got an idea on how to study a number for it's hidden special properties. I'd be very grateful for any help, thank you in advance! :)

I am a second year engineering major in a 4 year university and I’m surrounded by a lot of people who are exceptionally good at math.they’re taking the same classes I am or higher.

for context I’m in calc 2 but I’m a semester behind because I took trig stat in high school and not precalc (cause I was an idiot) because your supposed to start at calc for the engineering program at my university 

contrast that with my friend who doesn’t do a stem major and wants to take as little math as possible. 

But it got my thinking what is the highest level math the average person takes in their lifetime. Not just highschool. Since most people are pretty averse to math I’m guessing it wouldn’t be too high, but it’s also an extremely important subject. Does anybody have the statistic?

math,Determinant trick,"In Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, he uses what he calls the ""determinant trick"" to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.   He does this by working with matrices with elements from a subring A' of endomorphisms A\^n-&gt;A\^n corresponding to ""multiplication-by-ring-element"".  This allows actions by a homomorphism \\phi in A\^n to be treated as multiplication in the ring A'\[\\phi\].  Then he multiplies the matrix \\phi\*I\_n-N, where N is the matrix of the homomorphism with respect to a basis of the free module (regarded as having elements in A'\[\\phi\]) by the adjoint matrix to conclude that the determinant is zero in A'\[\\phi\] and hence, the characteristic polynomial applied to \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] (or N, remembering that multiplication by \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] corresponds to action by \\phi, and working with the chosen basis in A\^n) is also zero, because the map

\\Psi:A\[x\]\\to A'\[\\phi\], x \\mapsto \\phi

commutes with det(as a function on A'\[\\phi\] valued matrices) and det(as a function on A\[x\] valued matrices).

It seems to rescue the bogus proof of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (substituting N\*I\_n into x\*I\_n in x\*I\_n-N) by turning the unwieldy application of the characteristic polynomial to a matrix into the nicer application of the characteristic polynomial to a single element in the ring A'\[\\phi\].

This argument seems to be applicable in general to finitely-generated modules, and is used by Atiyah and MacDonald in the proof of Proposition 2.4.

Could somebody check if my understanding (after two hours of pondering yesterday and another two hours just now) is correct?

Also, what is this adjoint matrix?  I seem to have missed this magical matrix in my linear algebra coursework.  It feels like a computational ""cop-out"" that just works.

math,When did you start to feel good at math?,"I don't know where to begin writing this. I did my undergrad in Math and Biology. I always thought I'd be more of a biology person when I began undergrad, but as time went on I realized that the things I liked about science actually boiled down to math. While I took courses that I absolutely loved like Abstract Algebra and Probability Theory (even Multivariable Calc was taught so theoretically that I loved every second of it), the math major wasn't the most rigorous and I didn't even take Real Analysis. I'm so embarrassed to admit that, because it's so fundamental. Nevertheless, I graduated with an A- average and did a math thesis in Fluid Dynamics.

I've then got my PhD in mathematical biology. While I was technically in a biology department, my dissertation and my research is all about graph theory. I've come up with a new construction in graph theory and proved theorems in research (not always perfectly, and I second guess myself so much it's impossible to get to the finish line efficiently). My PhD research group wasn't the most uplifting environment; my advisor was increasingly absent over the years, and while we have a good relationship and I respect him a lot, I always had the sinking feeling that he didn't respect me as much as other members in the group. When I look back at what I learned, I can see that I have managed to accumulate a real expertise in my area. However, compared to what I want to be able to do as a mathematical researcher, there are so many other fields I want to know (expand into geometry &amp; topology), as well as some basic areas I need to get more solid in (e.g. real analysis, measure theory). And I have had my spirit crushed by my advisor more than once.

I've just started an applied math postdoc, which I feel has been going well, but I can't help but still feel doubtful of my skills and frustrated that I don't get things quicker. I have to get papers out, but I also want to learn more fields of math. I have genuine passion for math and honestly have felt happier in the few months of my postdoc than I ever did during the entirety of my PhD, but I feel like the stress and burnout has been getting to me over the last few days.

n=2 -&gt; ~.45
n=3 -&gt; ~.13

As n increases, I would expect to get less eigenvalues in F (the degree of the characteristic polynomial increases, so the probability that 1 solution lies outside of F increases). Similarly, as q increases, I would expect to get more eigenvalues (there are more ways to solve the eigenproblem). 

However, I wouldn’t necessarily expect this value to converge as q increases.

That all broke down once I got to the section on the generalized product topology and onwards; I could barely comprehend what was going on with those sections, and the exercises were hell to get through (I'm not even sure my solutions are correct). Come today, the section on the quotient topology is going smoothly -- the proofs are proofing, the geometric intuition is intuitioning, etc. Until I get to the exercises.

math,Is there a version of Vector Calculus that works in all dimensions? Why isn't it taught instead of Vector Calculus?,"Hey y'all,

Over the past few months I've had this growing... frustration(?) with Vector Calculus as it's usually taught in a Calculus 3 course, and I'm coming here because I kind of want to spill my thoughts about it in the hopes that someone else understands why I'm feeling this way and can offer some guidance.

(Also, just to be clear, I'm not posting this because I struggled with vector calculus or thought it was ""too hard,"" I honestly found it to be just fine)

I think most of my frustration stems from the fact that vector calculus is an exclusively 3-dimensional theory. The definitions of surface integrals and curl, as they're given in a typical course, only make sense in 3D, and this bothers me, because it feels to me like there shouldn't be anything ""special"" about 3D, right? Any R\^n can be treated as a vector space, so why was a theory of calculus created in such a way that it only works in R\^3? As an example of what I'm talking about, the fact that we represent the curl of a vector field as another vector field seems kind of like a ""coincidence,"" if that makes sense? Because it's been mentioned on numerous occasions that curl in other dimensions requires a different number of parameters (in 2D, curl only requires 1 parameter, and in 4D, it requires 6) and it just so happens that, in 3D, curl is described in 3 parameters. 

Is there a theory that serves the same purpose as vector calculus but that doesn't have this shortcoming? If there is, why is Vector Calculus so ubiquitous? I would love to live in a world where, for example, E&amp;M and Maxwell's Equations were taught using some other theory that's less reliant on 3D coincidences.

To put it in layman term, this set of vectors is ""approximately"" linear dependent. Clearly if the set is linear dependent, then it has property (P), but the converse is not true in general. I would like to know if anyone knows what this property called(if any), and any resources about it.

math,"Karen Uhlenbeck said, ""two minds thinking together -- there can't be more intimate experience that that"": does anyone remember hearing this? ","Hello, guys. 

I am not a math person. I about a month ago, due to the strange Youtube algorithm, saw an interview of Karen Uhlenbeck. It was a short clip and I watched it to the end. I think it occurred toward the end of this clip that she said something that struck me as remarkable. I reconstructed it from memory, trying as hard as I could to be faithful, and put it in the title above. 

I didn't make any record about the video or what she said. I saw a few more short videos (only short ones, less than 10 mins) showing her speaking, but not many, about 3. I thought, in case I want to be sure about what she said, I would easily look it up and check. 

Today, I wanted to be sure about what she really said, and looked up all the short videos I watched a month ago, but I can't seem to find the part where she says that. She said that in the context of collaboration among mathematicians. Her point was, if you do math, really do it together with other people, it is sharing minds, something deeply personal is revealed and shared. 

I am hoping someone has seen the video in question and remembers what she said. The video was very likely related to: 1) Abel prize, or 2) her appearance on the channel Closer to Truth. I checked all the clips I saw, some of them twice, but failed to find the part I wanted. I am hoping I somehow missed it when it was there for me to catch it.

math,Are complex eigenvectors for nonconjugate eigenvalues orthogonal?,"For a complex eigenvalue conjugate pair, their eigenvectors will not be orthogonal. This is because if v = a + bi (a and b are vectors) and u = a - bi, then v · u = (a + bi) · (a - bi) = a · a + b · b, which is clearly non-zero since we established v and u are complex and thus have nonzero b.

(EDIT: Apparently, I was using an alternate inner product for complex numbers than most mathematicians would use. So apparently a + bi and a - bi can be orthogonal according to other inner products. Thanks u/lucy_tatterhood! Also, I meant to write I was only considering real-valued matrices.)

But what I'm wondering is for nonconjugate eigenvalues, are their corresponding eigenvectors orthogonal? For example, with the matrix:

A =  
\[0 1 0 0  
\-1 0 0 0  
0 0 0 -1  
0 0 1 0\]

nonconjuate eigenvalues do have orthogonal eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are (-i, 1, 0, 0), (i, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, i, 1), (0, 0, -i, 1), and we can see orthogonality with the nonpairs. But that could be do to how I structured this matrix. Afterall, this matrix was skew symmetric. Though I've tested with a non skew-symmetric matrix like

B =  
\[√3/2 -1/2 0 0  
1/2 √3/2 0 0  
0 0 √2/2 -√2/2  
0 0 √2/2 √2/2\]

and a similar result happened. But maybe I'm getting these orthogonal eigenvectors because my matrix has 0s separating the dimensions. But maybe because every rotation can be broken down into rotation of orthogonal planes, this result with nonconjugate eigenvalues eigenvectors being orthogonal will keep happening? I'm not sure.

The reason I've been thinking about orthogonal eigenvectors is I realized recently that ALL eigenvectors being orthogonal for distinct eigenvalues implies real eigenvalues (due to conjugate eigenvalues implying nonorthogonality, as shown earlier, meaning we can't have complex eigenvalues), which then by the Spectral Theorem implies a symmetric matrix. So I'm trying to learn more on what my idea of partial orthogonal eigenvectors (orthogonal for nonconjugate pairs) implies in terms of the matrix structure.

  
(EDIT: My conclusion that all eigenvector are orthogonal for distinct eigenvalues implies real eigenvalues realized on a non-commonly used inner product for complex vectors. So my conclusion was false.)

math,State Machine as a Binary Matrix?,"I'm a CS nerd, but I know enough about linear algebra to know that anything can be represented as a vector if you're brave enough. 

I want to make a hyper-condensed model of a Boolean logical circuit, using a series of 0 1 matrix operations to transform the inputs. 

While I've been able to find one explanation about binary matrices being used as logic gates and another about automata being mappable to a polynomial matrix, I'm having trouble figuring out how to bridge that to map automata onto a boolean matrix.  And with Google being what it is nowadays, even finding those two was hard enough on its own.

Does anyone know how I'd be able to map a finite state machine onto a binary matrix? Or a series thereof?


EDIT: For example, a Set-Reset latch would be modeled as the stateful expressions `Q_n=!(R_n+Q'_(n-1))` and `Q'_n=!(S_n+Q_(n-1))`, where S and R are inputs, but I can't seem to get myself to understand how to translate that to a binary vector or matrix.

Ideally, I would like to be able to repeatedly multiply the transformed vector and the matrix to continue ""ticking"" the circuit. 

Even if we deviate from linear algebra to another mechanism for deriving meaning from a set of numbers, I'd love to hear it. My current option is essentially 32^({layers of abstraction}) times larger per single binary value, which I just feel is wasteful.


EDIT 2: So when looking back at this, I realized that I'd basically need a matrix with one degree for every wire. And since most circuits don't have anything to do with each other, I'd end up with a hundred thousand wasted zeros.

It might be better to do a combination of a tree and a matrix then, using the tree to narrow down the required inputs and then the matrix to actually perform the computation.  That or just stick to a linked graph form of a circuit since that's the most intuitive way to do it, and then a bitwise matrix or something to serialize and compress it.",bythepowerofscience,1gt7etf,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gt7etf/state_machine_as_a_binary_matrix/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gt7etf/state_machine_as_a_binary_matrix/,2024-11-17 06:20:31,13,0.82,13,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gt7etf

math,Is there a geometric relationship between certain points and lines in barycentric coordinates?,"I've been playing around with barycentric coordinates recently, and a question came up that I couldn't find an answer to.

Suppose we are working with barycentric coordinates with respect to an arbitrary triangle. Given a triple of numbers (a_1, a_2, a_3) such that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ≠ 0, we have a point (a_1 : a_2 : a_3) in barycentric coordinates. Also, if a_1, a_2, and a_3 are not all equal, we have a line consisting of points (x_1 : x_2 : x_3) such that a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0.

Does anyone know if there is any geometric relationship between a point and corresponding line defined this way? If we go up to higher dimensions, does this geometric relationship still hold between a point is its corresponding hyperplane?

As an example of the type of thing I mean by a geometric relationship, if we were instead working in cartesian coordinates, we have that the vector from the origin to (a_1, a_2, a_3) is normal to the plane defined by a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0.

math,Local/global maximum of a polynomial lies on the greatest interval between x-intercepts,"Apologies if this is too low level for this subreddit.  I ran into this theorem that I just can't believe I haven't heard before.  If a global maximum lies between any two zeros of a polynomial function, it will lie on the greatest interval between *x*\-intercepts.  Is this true?

So for example, the function *f*(*x*) = -*x*^(4) \+ *x*^(3) \+ 20*x*.  Without graphing, we know that *f* has a global maximum between *x* = 0 and *x* = 5 *because* the *x*\-interval \[0, 5\] is greater length than the interval \[-4, 0\].

math,Contour integrals around non isolated singularities?,"In my, nearly nonexistent, free time, one of my current side interests is finally going back and properly learning some complex analysis. In particular, I’d like to have a better handle on contour integration.

Now, I of course took a complex analysis course in my undergrad and so I am familiar with standard Cauchy-Gorsaut, Jordan’s Lemma, and Residue methods. These all work for the standard meromorphic functions that one sees in a course like that.

But what about functions such that the set of singularities has cluster points or perhaps contains a continuum? A simple example would be something like

f(z)=(e^(1/z)-1)^(-1) or

g(z)=tan(1/z)

Neither of these are meromorphic as z=0 is both singular and a cluster point of other singularities. Now, I actually don’t know any minimal conditions for complex integrability like one might have in the theory of Riemann or Lebesgue integration. But assuming that such a function can be integrable, how could one compute a contour integral around a cluster point or a continuum of singularities?

the novel has its obvious flaws, but what he describes sounds to me very very much like Langlands -- only more ambitious in that it includes music and some of the other sciences

so i'm interested in hearing what mathematicians think of the novel and the game as a language that bridges math with history and politics.

i'm sure anyone here who read Glass Bead Game has also read other fictional works that describe similar ""universal languages"", and i am interested in those too

math,"Why are estimated ""centers"" sometimes bimodal?","For a project I'm working on, I've been trying to find the most central point in each country, which I defined as the point inside the country that has the smallest mean distance to all other points in the country (I believe this is equivalent to the centroid if the shape is contiguous and convex, but the centroid can lie outside the country, whereas this point can't). I couldn't calculate this directly, so I estimated it with a Monte Carlo method as follows:

1. Generate 1000 points in the shape randomly according to a uniform distribution
2. Find the point that has the lowest average distance to all the other points, take that as the central point
3. Repeat 200 times
4. Take the average of the 200 central points

Much to my surprise, some countries (like Slovenia) had a unimodal distribution, while others (like North Macedonia) had a bimodal distribution.

To make sure this wasn't a mistake in my code, I tried it again with a different number of points in each trial (step 1). The distribution of central points oscillates between unimodal and bimodal as the number of points increases. I then ran the same algorithm on an ellipse in the plane, and this time, the distribution was sometimes unimodal, sometimes bimodal, and once even trimodal.

math,"Typo in R. Milner's 1975: ""PROCESSES: A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF COMPUTING AGENTS""","**I will try to give as much context as possible to enable as many people as possible to answer but it is likely that only people with knowledge in denotational semantics and/or process algebra will be able to answer this question.**

Milner defines a process as a member of the Scott domain

`P = V -&gt; LxVxP` (1)

with `V` the domain of values, `L` the domain of locations and `P` the domain of processes. A domain of functions from values to a triplet &lt;location, value, process&gt;. Intuitively, it means that a process will receive a value and produce a location, a value and a new process (its continuation).

Let `w_1` and `w_2` be values and `s=pw_1` and `t=p'w_2`. From the previous definition (1), `s` and `t` are triplets so that each value in the triplet have the following types:

`(s)_1 : L, (s)_2 : V, (s)_3 : P`

Same goes for `t`

We say that a process returns a result when its continuation contains the special member `l` of `L`  
When defining parallel composition of processes `p` and `p'` receiving a pair of values `&lt;w1, w2&gt;`, Milner states that the rough idea is that if either `p` or `p'` reached a result, reduce the other one and return the pairing of the two results. If none is completed, ask an oracle to pick which process to reduce"".

I thus expected a definition of the type :

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) := 
    
    if ((s)_1=l) {
      // since p is complete, we sequentially compose p' with the result of p 
      (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2 
    } else if ((t)_1 = l) {
      // since p' is complete, we sequentially compose p with the result of p'
      (p * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1
    } else {
      // we ask an oracle to decide to reduce either p or p'
    }

using the notation of the paper for conditionals, we should get 

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) = 
    ((s)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2,
    ((t)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1,
    oracle_decision
    

but the paper gives us 

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) = 
    ((s)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2,
    ((s)_2=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1,
    oracle_decision

with `(s)_2 : V` I think the `(s)_2` is a typo, that what Milner meant was `(t)_1` but I can't seem to find any erratum of any sort and papers tracing the history of process algebra don't bother explaining this particular definition of parallel composition as it is dropped in the following paper by R. Milner.

math,Maximum Number of Near Orthogonal Unit Vectors in a High Dimensional Space,"Suppose we have a set V of k unit vectors in an n-dimensional space, where k &gt;&gt; n and both are large (at least on the order of hundreds in this case). All k vectors are mutually near orthogonal: -ϵ &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ with i ≠ j and 0 &lt; ϵ &lt; 1.

The goal is to find a function of n and ϵ that yields the maximum possible k.

From [this stackexchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4680506/what-definition-of-nearly-orthogonal-would-result-in-in-a-10-000-dimensional), we get: n ≥ C \* ln(k) / ϵ^(2), where C is a constant currently accepted 8 (ignore what the post says about C - assuming [the proof on page 6/7 of this](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/OBDA_spring16/material/random_projections.pdf) holds, 8 is the best available right now). Further, from that equation we move things around to get the desired k ≤ exp(n \* ϵ^(2) / C).

So problem solved right? Well, maybe. That post gets the equation from [this response](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/24864/almost-orthogonal-vectors/24873#24873) which was to essentially the same question. That response was written by Bill Johnson, who in turn references the [Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) for which he is a namesake.

So problem definitely solved, surely?! After all, one of the creators of the lemma themselves directly answered this question. The problem is: if you read about the lemma on wikipedia or the various other available sources, it becomes increasingly confusing how one is supposed to make the jump from the equation being used by the lemma as a condition for the existence of a linear map to the same equation being used to get a lower bound on the dimension size n needed to allow for k near-orthogonal vectors. Specifically, the lemma shows that V can be reduced in dimension from some N to some lower n so long as the equation holds, where the n is the same as used above in the equation but now V is of R^(N) instead of R^(n). **So, how was this jump made?**

Further, I could find no information on how this equation was derived in that form, which is a problem: I am looking for a generalization of this equation with -ϵ1 &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ2, both ϵ1 &amp; ϵ2 being between 0 and 1 but not necessarily the same value.",OblivionPhase,1gpyz8k,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,2024-11-12 23:37:48,32,0.84,32,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpyz8k
math,The Sandwich Problem (Open Discussion),"Suppose you have a square sandwich of area 1 with an infinitely thin crust along the edges. You remove a constant area from the sandwich such that it has area 1 at t = 0 and area 0 at exactly t = 1. This area can be removed in any way you'd please so long as dA/dt = -1. For example, you could remove it in an expanding strip from one side of the square to the other, two strips from both sides converging to the centre, an expanding circle centred at the middle of the square, etc. 

The method by which you choose to remove the area is called strategy S and can be as complex or as simple as you'd like.

Let P^(S)(t) be the crust-less perimeter of the sandwich at time t when using strategy S. That is, the total perimeter of the shape subtracted by the perimeter with crust on it at time t when using strategy S. 

Find the strategy S that minimizes the value of the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of P^(S)(t) with respect to t.



Some examples:

The integral has value 1 for the strategy where you remove an expanding strip from one side.

The integral has a value 2 for the strategy where you remove two expanding strips from opposite sides that converge in the centre.



From a bit of discussion with my friends, we've found that a good way to start is removing an expanding quarter circle from one of the corners, but it's unclear how to proceed once the quarter circle is inscribed within the square.

math,How Does an Infinite Number of Removable Discontinuities Affect the Area Under a Curve?,"Hey everyone! I am currently redoing Calculus 2 to prepare for Multivariable Calculus, going over some topics my lecturer did not cover this past semester. Right now, I am watching Professor Leonard’s [lecture ](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=V9z1wMUcNE_L9REs)on improper integrals and I am at the section on removable discontinuities [1:49:06](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=TWEzTwTz3diLYk88&amp;t=6546).

He explains that removable discontinuities or rather ""holes"" in a curve do not affect the area under the curve. His reasoning is that because a hole is essentially a single point and a single point has a width of zero, it contributes zero to the area. In other words, we can ""plug"" the hole with a point and it will not impact the area under the curve. This I understood because he once touched on it in some of his previous video, I forgot which one it was.

But I started wondering what if a curve had removable discontinuities all over it, with the holes getting closer and closer together until the distance between them approaches zero? Intuitively to me it seems like these ""holes"" would create a gap. But the confusion for me started when I used his reasoning that point each individual point contributes zero area, therefore the sum of all the areas under these ""holes"" is zero? 

If the sum is zero then how do they create a gap like I intuitively thought? or they do not?

How do I think about the area under a curve when it has an infinite number of removable discontinuities?

math, Why does the Lebesgue Integral not require countably many partitions? ,"Originally posted on r/learnmath but I thought it would be better suited here.

I'm working my way through Axler's Measure, Integration and Real Analysis. In Chapter 3A, Axler defines the Lebesgue Integral of *f* as the supremum of all Lower Lebesgue Sums, which are in turn defined as the sum over each set in a **finite** *S*\-partition of the domain *P*, where the inside of the sum is the outer measure of the set multiplied by the infimum of the value of *f* on that set.

My question is, why is it sufficient that *P* is a finite partition and not a countably infinite one?

In Chapter 2A, Axler defines the Outer Measure over a set *A* is as the infimum of all sums of the lengths of **countably** many open intervals that cover the set *A*. I'm confused as to why the Lebesgue Integral is defined using a finite partition whereas the Outer Measure uses countably many intervals.

I've always found this to be a pretty dry subject compared to others that we study, so to make it more fun I designed a video game to play with the concept. In brief, you are a paranormal investigator trying to determine if visiting aliens are hostile or friendly. To do this, you have a relatively complex (15 nodes and about 25 edges) BBN, and the first part of the game is to query the BBN to get a sense of when the aliens tend to visit the town. The second part is an investigation where you interview people who claim to have seen the aliens and describe their behavior as friendly or hostile. Your job is, using the insights you gained from the first step, to determine if the eye-witness report is credible or dubious, and your judgment on the aliens if determined by a majority vote, ie did most credible witnesses describe them as hostile or friendly?

**My question is about defining credibility. I have two possible answers to this:**

**A witness is credible iff P(Aliens|evidence) &gt; P(Aliens)** \- or in other words, the posterior probability given their account of events is greater than the prior probability of alien visitation.

  
**OR**

**A witness is credible iff P(evidence|Aliens) &gt; P(evidence|\~Aliens)** \- relating the probability of their account to aliens being present or not being present.

These two conditions are clearly related by Bayes rule:

P(A|evidence) = P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/P(evidence) = 

P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/(P(evidence|Aliens)\*P(Aliens)+P(evidence|\~Aliens)\*P(\~Aliens))

All the terms are there and related to each other, but it need not be the case that if one condition is met then the other is necessarily met.

One assumption about this is that we are trusting the evidence the NPC is giving us, but we doubt their claim that they actually saw the aliens. That assumption is fine for me. We also are not evaluating the probability that someone saw aliens given that they say they saw aliens, and that is also fine with me.

What do you think? Or could there be another way we can evaluate credibility?

(Tangent) The game in its more simple form (without the interview mechanic) was a real hit last year, really transforming one of the most boring lectures into one of the most fun ones. The students also learned a lot because they get to actually see and explore things that they previously only heard about - like we say rejection samplers are wasteful because most of their samples are not used. Ok, how many samples are wasted? We say Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers are extremely expensive compared to other approaches - ok, how long do they take to run on a graph like this? With algorithms like these, getting to actually explore them and see them at scale is key, and I think that actually using these objects and algorithms does a lot for learning.",ProdigiousMike,1gpccdv,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,2024-11-12 04:13:49,16,0.86,16,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpccdv
math,Branches of Algebra,"Hi everyone,
I started my Master's not long ago, and I'm mainly interested in algebra (I really enjoyed the courses in Galois theory and commutative algebra).

From what I saw, a lot of the research done in algebra in my university uses a lot of calculations, asymptotics and big O notations, which really surprised me as there were no such things in the courses I took.

Does every topic in algebra (which relates to Field theory) uses a lot of calculations? I don't really enjoy that type of proofs (I remember taking a seminar in number theory, where the theorems where really interesting, but the proofs were just a bunch of inequalities thrown together, like in Dirichlet's theorem, which I really didn't like)

Is there a branch of algebra (especially field theory) that doesn't have as much of these calculations, and generally has more elegant proofs?

math,"Math puzzle: solve the subway conundrum, a Martin Gardner puzzle","A young man lives in Manhattan near a subway express station. He is dating two women: one in Brooklyn; one in the Bronx. To visit the woman in Brooklyn he takes a train on the downtown side of the platform; to visit the woman in the Bronx he takes a train on the uptown side of the same platform. Since he likes both women equally well, he simply takes the first train that comes along. In this way, he lets chance determine whether he rides to the Bronx or to Brooklyn. The young man reaches the subway platform at a random moment each Saturday afternoon. Brooklyn and Bronx trains arrive at the station equally often—every 10 minutes. Yet for some obscure reason he finds himself spending most of his time with the woman in Brooklyn: in fact, on the average, he goes there nine times out of 10. Can you decide why the odds so heavily favor Brooklyn?

math,Curious about forms of solutions for differential equations.,"I'll preface with I don't study differential equations and have at best a scattered understanding of parts of the theory.

When teaching or studying intro DE's, we pretty universally cover the Laplace transform as a method of solving constant coefficient linear IVPs. Some courses will also go over power series solutions to equations with nonconstant coefficients and, if they're lucky, possibly the Method of Frobenius.

Here's what I'm curious about: The motivation and ideas leading to the development of the Laplace transform itself are almost *never* taught. Things like the historical study of various integral forms and the extension of power series to a continuous indexing variable.

**Is there any well-developed study of solutions to DEs where, instead of a power series solution, we look for a solution in the form of an integral transform?**

I tried working out a few possibilities, but it seems to fail for various reasons depending on the form of the differential operator and even the form of the inhomogeneous term. For example, if we take something like a second order operator with polynomial coefficients and some forcing term g,

y''-2xy'+x^(2)y = g(x), y(0)=a, y'(0)=b

we can guess a solution of the form y=&amp;int;_0\^&amp;infin; f(t)x^(t) dt where f is an unknown function. This would be a continuum-indexed analogue of a power series solution. After substituting this into the DE, we can do some simplifying calculations and write the left side as the Laplace transform of some polynomial multiple of f. Using the properties of &amp;Lscr;, we can recast the original DE as a new DE whose solution is the Laplace transform of this unknown function f.

What seems to happen in some surprisingly simple cases is that this simply leads nowhere. It seems to be the case that if the function g is not chosen fairly carefully, then the equation expressing g as a Laplace transform of f simply has no solution. The issue is that the function g(e^(-s)) must tend towards 0 as s approaches &amp;infin; in order to be in the range of &amp;Lscr; and this simply is not the case for many reasonable choices of g.

So what gives? Why is it that a power series solution to the above equation is perfectly viable, but this integral transform solution appears not to be? And is there a better guess for a transform that *will* work? Could we perhaps try something like a ""basis"" of delta functions? I'd really like to know more about this sort of thing if it's out there.",OneMeterWonder,1gog0ff,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,2024-11-11 00:58:53,28,0.86,28,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gog0ff

About one year ago, I posted a question here about [how to be successful mathematicians](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/10bqo7i/successful_mathematicians_what_differentiates_you/), in which *working hard* seems to be a common theme (*networking* is another).

I am a Master student and currently my research interests are analytic/additive number theory and extremal combinatorics. My previous background also includes computer science (CS), so I also enjoy tinkering with computers and programming, for instance, recently I got my hands on homelab and trying to play with LLMs (large language models).

As mentioned in said post, my goal is to become a professor at a university, which means I'll likely follow the usual path of PhD -&gt; postdoc -&gt; tenure-track position. However, I often worry that the time I spend tinkering and programming -- usually in the evenings -- might be ""wasted"", since I could instead use that time to skim/read papers.

math,Is it possible to be a competent and respectable mathematician without access to academic resources?,"I would say that my prospects of studying under a respected authority in the field amount to a fat and flat zero, and my access to and comprehension of open resources occupies the same standing  
  
\[The following paragraph provides context, skip to the next one if it doesn't matter\]  
I really loved math in high school and was gunning for a B,Sc in mathematics in a top university, but a tumultuous period of life kept me from applying myself to the subject for multiple years and I soon got horrifyingly bad at the most elementary areas of the subject. Now I'm doing an online degree that I *really* need to finish if I'm to live my dream of not being homeless, and part of it was an elementary course in discrete mathematics which I had been ignoring for the entire semester with a week till the final exam. I fumbled through the course material and escaped a failing grade by two marks, and it's been eating away at me how fun and interesting all the problems looked if only I were to put in the effort to build my ability up from its current uselessness. Following that line of thinking for a few months, I've now got a somewhat reignited ambition for a career in mathematics

Now, if I were to try and enter the field in any serious capacity, I'd need to do it outside of my actual degree. Once that's over I'll be competing with people who, unlike me, did not drop the ball through their secondary and tertiary education, and have proven themselves and trained at levels I am nowhere near, and might possibly never reach for my age range. I'm 23, I'm quickly losing ""fresh meat"" status as an academic in my country. I got sloppy, and now doors are closing fast

So I figure if I'm to have my hopes crushed, best have them crushed early.

math,"If you could go back and reteach yourself math in childhood, what would you do differently? ","Hi all and thank you greatly in advance for any input. 

I’m a dad homeschooling my 4 y/o who seems to have a strong receptivity to math. They know their times tables through 10, can mentally perform three digit addition and subtraction problems with multiple carries quite fluidly, do various puzzles well, and generally appear to have a very strong conceptual grasp of everything we do together and why operations work out the way they do. FWIW I’m no tiger dad—I couldn’t care less how advanced my child is, I just want to help them along in their development as best I can. Nor am I trying to make any claim about my child’s abilities—I just try to do a little bit every day with them, be enthusiastic and engaging, and over the course of their childhood it’s snowballed into them being pretty far along for their age. 

As we get further along in arithmetic I find myself at a bit of a crossroads. My sense has been that one of the best things I could do with them is drill arithmetic problems/puzzles and leverage the incredible retention powers of childhood to memorize things like addition/subtraction math facts and times tables with the hope it’d strongly develop their number sense and save them a lot of time later. But I’m wondering about how far to take this: should I have them start memorizing squares and cubes through 30 or something? Should I try to get them proficient handling larger and larger numbers? Or should I focus more on introducing new concepts? 

I’m not a mathy person myself—it’d be generous to say I’m capable through basic highschool math—so I’d love some perspective from people who are highly numerate and consider math a passion: if you could go back, how would you like your math education to have been conducted? What could you have been taught early that would’ve really helped you along on your journey? What was not so helpful? I’d just really love any and all perspective of others on the other side of this mountain I never traversed so I can help my child along their journey as usefully as I can. Thank you so much!

math,Why study so hard when AI can do the work for you?,"I love math olympiad- as a student I have pored hours into this subject, loving it for the creativity and logic needed to solve each problem.

When I heard about AlphaGeom that was referred to early 2024, I was shocked- AI has developed to the stage that it can solve questions with international olympiad level of difficulty.

Then came an article in July, praising AI for being able to achieve a high silver medal in the IMO.

At that point, I was just coping- I thought ""Oh, it solved the Algebra, Number theory, Geometry questions by blindly bashing and trying many options, but its unable to solve the combinatorics questions as it is bad at logic. Humans will forever beat AI in terms of logical reasoning."" It was true that this model solved all the questions in the IMO except the two combinatorics questions.

But I was wrong. In late 2024, OpenAI developed a new AI chatbot model o1 that, on average, solved 11/15 questions in the AIME (A math competition in the US). That's already better than me: and most of those problems are combinatorics questions.

Of course, right now these models aren't that good in combinatorics yet, but it will be able to surpass even most IMO medalists in combinatorics, in the coming years.

If AI models already beat most humans in the area of logical reasoning, whats the point of studying so much math olympiad if an AI will destroy you in it?

Why even study math in the first place then, if an AI would be much more effective than us? I'm losing motivation to study because of this...

math,Do you think math is an easy degree?,"I’m in my third year of my math degree at a strong university taking the most rigorous math courses (e.g. I have complex analysis, PDE, and abstract algebra right now) and while I wouldn’t say it’s a breeze, compared to some of my peers in other programs, I feel like school is going very well. 

My friends in engineering, business, life sciences, etc. are all following the stereotypes of pulling all nighters to study and having no free time, but I don’t really relate. I am also under the impression that my classmates in math are more or less the same (i.e. they do not find school as hard as many non-math people do). Do you think this is something unique to math majors?

I have a few theories as to why this might be the case:

1. The material in math is so difficult that there is an upper limit to how fast the courses can move, so if you are good at math it’s easy to keep up (although this seems a bit contradictory)
2. People in math are naturally smart and good at school (egotistical but I do notice a correlation)
3. People generally don’t pursue math unless they are very very good at it

But if we have hundreds of DiffGeo textbooks WHY CAN'T ONE OF THEM JUST WRITE DOWN EVERY F-ING DETAIL FOR ONCE. No, you DON'T get to ""choose coordinates x\_j"". Maybe it could be useful to just, like, maybe distinguish the dozen types of derivatives you have defined not just for one page after the definition, but maybe, uuuhm, till the end of the textbook? All of these things are functions, all of these objects are types, and have you maybe considered that actually precisely specifying the functional relationships and clarifying each type could be USEFUL TO THE STUDENT? Especially when you're not just sketching an exercise but demonstrating FUNDAMENTAL CALCULATIONS IN THE THEORY. How hard is it to just ALWAYS write the point at which stuff happens? Yes I know it's ugly, I guess you must think it's a smart idea to hide all those ugly details from the student. But guess what, I actually have patience.

math,How invested should I truly be in courses? (Rant),"TLDR: Is it worth it to sacrifice ALL of my time to learn the subjects super well or should I do as my classmates and just get a passing grade and not give a damm about the material?

Hello. Second year undergraduate here, at a college with a relatively hard curriculum. I have 5 courses every semester, with 25h per week of lectures. On top of that, I devote 5h per day to studying, more on the weekends. I basically have no free time, its classes in the morning, lunch, studying in the afternoon/evening, then going to the gym, dinner, study some more, rinse and repeat. 

I feel like many of my colleagues have more free time. I usually study to the point of fully understanding the subject, quite a bit deeper than what was taught in class, this involves researching on my own, reading books outside of the curriculum and such, so in the end I am very satisfied with the outcome, as I truly love math.  But this comes with a price that is basically my entire life during that period. Students from other degrees spend most of their time having fun, with hobbies, socializing, etc.
I dropped all of my hobbies.

Even half of the students in my own degree study just to pass and don't care about learning profoundly about what they are being taught. I dont know why but the idea of not learning the math perfectly gives me so much anxiety. Just thinking about not knowing a certain part of the degree or dropping some electives in future years makes me really nervous.

Im starting to think I might be going a bit too hard, this might be some completionist syndrome type of thing.

While I love math, I'm not sure it is worth the best years of my life, Im studying in a different city, famous for its college scene, so I feel like Im wasting so much.

And then there is the dilemma of choosing whether to sacrifice my youth completely with a Masters and PhD or to go into finance or tech which is what I actually should do (for the life I want in the future) and feel like I failed at math.

I noticed that it had a few papers in it but didn't think much of it until I got home and pulled out the papers. To my surprise, it includes the following:

* A handwritten letter from January 1995. It said ""FEDORYUK. According to Sergai Slavyanov, Fedoryuk died when he fell off a railway platform and landed on the back of his head. Might have been pushed? Mightc have had hangover?""
* A printed out email with a bunch of people from Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Duke, etc. (i can provide the names but i dont wanna dox people from like 30 years ago) just saying that they saw a sticker on a truck that said ""JESUS IS COMING: LOOK BUSY"" that weekend. A few of the recipients have passed away but a couple are still alive and well.
   * I have no idea how this ended up at my university (UMN)
* A few summaries of the book from Springer.
* A handwritten summary that has the table of contents.
* What I find most interesting: Inside the book, someone wrote ""To professor F.W.J Olver with compliments from the author."" Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything from Fedoryuk himself :(

math,I want to REALLY understand geometry. What books do I need?,"(Sorry, the title is a bit ridiculous.) Context and current place: I am a statistician &amp; data scientist by trade - calc, linear algebra, tensor nonsense, yep all good. I had a proof class in undergrad but it's been so long I forgot all of it. So I'm going through *A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics,* which promises to remind me of what I've forgotten.

But I really like prime numbers, and I had a teacher decades ago who said, ""all math is geometry,"" and I want to play around with both of those things. So I've decided I'd like to dive very, obnoxiously deep into geometry. I assume it will take me years. That's ok. I'm quite bored. It may pay dividends at some point by connecting back to my understanding of the operations of neural networks, who knows.

Does anyone know a series of books or some set of books (videos won't work, I need to be able to do problems till I understand it) that would be useful? Minimal cost is preferable, but usually this crap is textbooks so I can accept some pain. A lot of math textbooks are truly very poorly written, though, or written with the intention of a professor doing most of the work (so, poorly written). I obviously won't have a professor, so it needs to stand alone.

math,Pictures of Spec Z[X],"I've been reading Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, and it's been a really enjoyable read.  I appreciate the effort he puts into motivating the development of ring and module theory.  The use of first person is unusual, but this is one of the few cases where I don't mind seeing so much of the author's personality.  And Atiyah and MacDonald's exceedingly terse text feels somewhat more penetrable after reading this book.

That said, the book teases and hints at a lot of advanced math, which is cool but frustrating.  For instance, in the opening chapters he draws a couple of pictures of things like Spec k\[X,Y\] and Spec Z\[X\].  He tells the reader that it's okay if you don't understand these pictures at this point.  

I feel like a novitiate and I'm being shown a Zen riddle by a master, who tells me that I will understand it someday when I'm enlightened enough.  What does it take to really understand these pictures?  Do algebraic geometers each have their own way of visualizing prime spectra?

Intuitively, the free product is the naive way of combining the fundamental groups of two spaces, but it leads to overcounting the loops, so we then rein in our guess by quotienting out the stuff we double counted.

This feels remarkably similar to the inclusion-exclusion theorem, that |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|.

math,"Question on defining the spectral family of a bounded self-adjoint operator T using the ""positive part"" of the operator T-\lambda I (Thm 9.8-3 in Kreyszig's ""Functional Analysis..."") (definition of ""positive part"" in description).","Summary: I have looked everywhere, and so far, can't find a satisfactory explanation of one aspect of Theorem 9.8-3 in Kreyszig ""Functional Analysis with Applications"": in particular, what is the motivation for using the **""positive part""** of the operator T\_lambda instead of T\_lambda itself, and what goes wrong if we had just used T\_lamba itself instead?

here is a screenshot of the theorem in question:

where the ""positive part"" is defined as T\^+ = 1/2 (B+T) where B = (T\^2)\^(1/2).

my question is: why is the ""positive part"" used?

If we consider just the operator T\_lambda itself, then the projection onto the nullspace of T-lambdaI is just the projection onto the ""eigenspace"" (with the caveat that lambda could be a non-eigenvalue spectral value i.e. in the continuous spectrum of T) corresponding to the spectral value lambda; this to me is somewhat reminiscent of the finite-dimensional case; which involves a sum over projections onto the eigenspaces of T.

So why is the additional definition of the ""positive part"" of this operator needed?

math,Is it just me or is stochastic calculus extremely difficult?,"Some background: I’m a master’s student in mathematics, and during my bachelor’s degree, I took a course on stochastic calculus. I took it because I enjoyed both measure theory and measure-theoretic probability theory and was interested in seeing how they are used, for example, in mathematical finance. However, I found the course more difficult than any other that I had taken up to that point, so much so that I decided to drop it halfway through. Concretely, I had a hard time keeping track of all the very technical definitions and developing an intuition for the presented concepts.

Fast forward to my master’s studies, and I chose to take a course on numerical methods for mathematical finance, with only measure-theoretic probability theory as a prerequisite. Halfway through the course, we started discussing the basics of Brownian motion, stochastic calculus and SDEs, and once again, I found myself struggling in the same way I did during the stochastic calculus course.

math,Reading Recommendations in “Institutional” History of Mathematics,"It's not a big secret that good books on the history of relatively modern mathematics are few and far between. Sure, there are some memoirs, autobiographies, overviews of some particular fields, collections of anecdotes, and a few books on the history of mathematics in general, but little of what professional historians would call a serious history text — something that would concern the institutions, politics, economics, and other extra-mathematical contexts involved in the development of modern mathematics as a historically-grounded enterprise. 

This probably shouldn't come as too big of a surprise given the comparatively small number of academic mathematicians, the seemingly parochial, obscure, esoteric nature of the field in the eyes of historians, and the fact that few of the working professionals would have enough of historical “knack” to write a reliable history.

Yet still, there are many questions that could be easily asked and less easily answered regarding the every day matters of institutional mathematics.

How would they justify themselves to the government in the matters of, say, funding? How would they justify themselves to the universities? How did they attract students to the programs? What were the typical career paths of math students in, say, mid-20th century? What was the demographics of math departments: age, class, gender? What was expected to know from a freshman, a bachelor, phd candidate? When, why, where the pure math programs were created? How do external factors come into play — is it an accident, for example, that planned-economy era soviet mathematicians were dominant in optimisation and probability? And so on, and so on, and so on.

math,effective remaining area in circle packing,"I'm working on a problem where I'm packing circles of unequal radii sequentially into a rectangle

because I'm doing this sequentially, it would help if I can somehow the capture of how much effective area is remaining after I place a certain number of circles into the rectangle

for instance, for 4 circles I could:
1. pack all 4 in 1 corner
2. pack 2 in 1 corner, pack 2 in another
3. pack all 4 right in the centre of the rectangle

for all 3 methods, the area that remains afterward is the same, but methods 1 and 2 are clearly superior because the area that remains still allows for more circles of larger areas to be placed, whereas method 3 prevents that (i.e. the effective area that remains is reduced)

so, is there a way I can capture this notion?

math,Second thoughts in PhD program?,"I’m about to wrap up my first semester in an elite applied math PhD program and wanted to ask whether this experience is common. There are 10 students in my year, and although we’ve grown close, it seems almost all of us are having second thoughts — lots of talk of mastering out/switching to another program.

Most of us were originally enrolled 3 courses, but pretty much all of us have since dropped to 2 due to being overwhelmed. Even taking just 2 courses is comparably difficult to my undergrad where I was able to manage 5 without too much difficulty.

Between coursework and 10-20 hours per week of TA duties, I haven’t found time to start getting involved in research, and worry I am slipping behind on this front. In speaking to my cohort, it seems most of us are having similar concerns.

For those who finished their programs, did you also have these worries? How did you deal with them? What kind of attrition rate did you see year to year?

math,"I've developed mathematics for a non-human mind from my comic, and I'm interested in what you think about it.","This is a story about sapient distant descendants of rats, known as packers, living on Earth millions of years after the extinction of humans, began to develop mathematics using cognitive mechanisms never intended for such tasks. Due to an evolutionary quirk, multiplication came more naturally to them than addition, and their mathematics reflects this.

Packers write numbers as shapes, with each number having a corresponding number of corners.

[image 1](https://preview.redd.it/61t02k8j69zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1fae9d1bf27db3b92204ddf232a16c3c342136)

And they write large numbers as nested shapes. The number inside is multiplied by the number outside.

[image 2](https://preview.redd.it/captnd1l69zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a5af6c2f4567a1b4c83754262935d35bf79fcc)

Examples of some numbers:

Packers haven't invented 0 yet. They haven't even invented 1! In fact, they don’t need the concept of ""one"" much in their system. There's no need to say ""I ate one fish"" when they can simply say ""I ate fish"". (The fact that it's easier for them to multiply than to add has also had an impact).

Packers can't yet write large prime numbers, like 101 or 10,501, because they would have to draw a huge shape to represent them! Even writing 17 or 19 would be quite difficult if they only used convex shapes.

https://preview.redd.it/o4k6zjmo69zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=708e3f9013be63a36fb7b20f00ae6a2e3894407d

So packers use non-convex shapes too!

https://preview.redd.it/09rhm6m279zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c16fddd812e615691430d348b487c76066dd86ca

Many years later, some packer noticed that large prime numbers look suspiciously symmetric.

https://preview.redd.it/kew2kov479zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0331a79a552a630d3f54dbcf354f71d7e4352ab

So this packer improved the notation system and made it clearer.

https://preview.redd.it/arzughp579zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=267a0cb8f79ff45fe165b874b4157a6e98b00f9f

Later, another packer simplified this system even more, deciding that there was no point in writing the same shapes twice.

https://preview.redd.it/1kcldqm679zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122aebe0aab3fc7eb30ebb7762b3e4e26ad925c1

This packer was the first in their culture to declare that ""a dot isolated from a number"" should also be considered a number. The packer called this dot ""the wonderful number that's less than two"".

Many years later, another packer made an important innovation: the ""dot isolation"" could be repeated multiple times as long as the result remained odd. When the result became even, it could undergo a ""two isolation"" (division by two). The final result will be a series of dots and twos.

https://preview.redd.it/po4i3t0879zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c5077f52c348b15f72126f9c86d6f2199534b5

Here's an example for the number 60:

This invention led to the creation of a binary system based on one and two, which had a significant impact on the technological advancement of packers.

math,How to measure credibility? ,"When thinking about people making good and bad predictions, I got to wondering how one could design a system of rating people's predictions and the corresponding observation about whether they were right.  

To make things simple, let's say that a person has a probability distribution p over a random variable X, which is a prediction of a future event.  So for example X could be a roll of a die with support {1,2,3,4,5,6} and they believe the die is biased with probability distribution 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/2.

We roll the die once and the outcome is observed.  

How do we rate the credibility of the person based on their probability distribution and whatever the observed result is?  I.e. how can we assign them a score for their prediction, with the following obviously desirable properties.

1. They earn a positive score when their prediction seems to agree with the outcome, however that is measured.

2. If they assign to event X=i the probability 50%, then they neither earn nor lose points if X=i occurs.

The score should somehow reflect the value of the person as a source of information and prediction.  The two points above are not the only important considerations -- another would be informativeness of the prediction.  For example, if someone predicts that the sun will come up tomorrow, that's not very informative, so you shouldn't earn many points when the sun rises.  But I'll think about how to incorporate those kinds of considerations later.  

Is this the kind of thing people have already studied?

math,How would you nurture a young child’s natural interest in mathematics? ,"Edit: Thanks everyone. Some really great suggestions!

Asking on behalf of my 2, almost 3 year old. 

He is speech-delayed and recently diagnosed with ASD. He is absolutely obsessed with numbers and addition/subtraction and has been for the past 1.5 years. He gets very anxious with basic everyday things, but numbers and shapes really mellow him out for some reason. He definitely has a strong natural interest in it, so I’d like to help him with that. 

Neither his father or I are super mathematically-inclined, and I’m drawing blanks here. Simply counting to 100 with him is now boring for him and I can tell he’s over it. Some other things he likes are organising cereal into sets of 5s / 10s / 20s etc. He’ll count the sets, add them together, and move them between different containers. He counts/organises everything around the house; shoes, articles of clothing, squares on the window pane etc. I’ll give him a bunch of vegetables to play with while I’m making dinner and he’ll add the potatoes, take some away etc. Also loves shapes and moves his little magnet triangles together to make “diamonds” and so on. He refers to everyday objects as shapes , eg he calls my phone the “rectangle” and his playpen “hexagon” and coins are “circles” 

He also loves planets and everything related to
space. He gathers balls of various sizes (basketballs, golf balls, bouncy balls etc) and lines them up, pretending they are the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus etc. up until Pluto. He seems to know a bit about each one like Saturn has “icy rings” and Neptunes “windy”, Mars is the “red one”. I got him play dough and he mixed colours together and made little planets out of it. I had to google what the planets actually looked like and he was actually spot on. I think he maybe learned this from watching Blues Clues, not entirely sure tbh because he can’t speak in sentences and only has a handful of words. 

But anyways, I feel like 95% of the games he plays are focused around maths/space and I’d like to encourage that, but struggling to come up with how. I ask him questions but he can’t answer me. 

Would really appreciate any ideas/suggestions on what I could do with him, or even where to begin as a grown adult to improve my math skills to, in turn, help him? He is so eager to learn.

math,Math app recommendations for kids with learning disabilities,"Hello,

I work at a K-12 special education school. Kids are low to low-moderate and have some form of ADHD/ADD, are on the spectrum, or have dyslexia/dyscalculia to some degree.  Our math program is in need of restructuring and is a subject students struggle with the most, so I've been tasked with compiling a list of math software apps and looking into a good few options. The highest level we go to is Algebra 1 and Geometry in high school. Some problem areas:

* Elementary - developing number sense/numeracy. Our lowest kids have difficulty adding/subtracting without counting
* Middle school - fractions are the biggest thing that confuses students
* High School - lack of basic arithmetic knowledge/numeracy. Some kids in geometry can't do basic operations with fractions.

Either way, across the board, numeracy and basic arithmetic is something that is a struggle for some of our students.

The tricky part is not every student starts in elementary. Because we're an NPS, districts send their kids to us from all different grade levels and knowledge (but they all have some form of learning disability). We may get kids enrolling as early as 1st or late as 12th grade. So some of those basic numeracy skills need to be honed for our high schoolers who are really behind.

Here is a working list of apps I've been looking into. I'd love any additional feedback on some apps that you've worked with or are familiar with--any other suggestions not on the list are welcome!

Of course, critical feedback is more than welcome. There are so many of these out there it can be hard to choose, but I wanted to cast a wide net because we are different from your traditional public school.

* **Banzai** \- seems more applied (financial literacy) with real-life focused problems
* **Beestar** \- parents can monitor performance online. also gives motivational recognitions every week to encourage students
* **GeoGebra** \- was looking into an option for geometry and this was the top result
* **Illustrative Mathematics** \- has built-in assessments and hands-activities, review-focused
* **Gimkit/Prodigy** \- very gamified, can create own questions and students have to answer them to proceed in the game or get 'energy' etc.
* **iReady** \- Good as a diagnostic tool. Helpful in knowing a student's grade level and gaps in knowledge
* **IXL** \- great for review and practice. Not as visual as other apps
* **Khan Academy** \- particularly looking into Khan Academy Kids for K-8 but seems like a strong resource for geometry
* **Nessy Numbers (Woodin)** \- seems good for building numeracy/number sense 
* **Splashlearn** \- very visual and engaging
* **Zearn** \- K-5, seems good for early math review/practice",shuai_bear,1glccdh,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glccdh/math_app_recommendations_for_kids_with_learning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glccdh/math_app_recommendations_for_kids_with_learning/,2024-11-06 23:25:25,10,0.82,10,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1glccdh
math,An interesting problem related to elections,"I've been thinking of this question for a few months now, and all the talk about the elections have only made me think more about this, so here it goes.

Let's say there's a two-party system in a country, where P1 and P2 are the parties. Let's say I define a quantity called ""vote density"" for each of these parties, p1 and p2 - p1(x,y)dx dy would be the number of votes that the party P1 receives in an infinitesimal rectangular area of side lengths dx, dy, at the point (x,y), divided by the total population in that infinitesimal area- similar to a 2d probability density. The vote density p2(x,y) is defined in an analogous fashion. In general, there could be less than perfect voter turnout, so the sum of these voter densities, p1+p2 would be less than or equal to 1 for all (x,y).

Now let us say that the elections in this country work by splitting the country into smaller constituencies/counties. Whichever party gets higher votes in a particular county is declared the ""winner"" of that county, and whoever wins in the majority of the counties is declared the winner and forms the government. Further let us assume the vote density functions p1 and p2 are known, and that the county borders are given.

1) Let us define the total vote share of a party to be the integral of its vote density function. Can it be possible for party P1 to have a lesser vote share than party P2, but still win the elections - maybe in a way where P1 loses heavily in a select few counties and wins marginally in a larger number of counties, by virtue of which, the total vote share of P1 is lesser, but it is still declared the winner. What are the conditions for this to happen? 

2) Related to my above question, let's say the total vote share of P1 is less than that of P2. Can I always come up with a bordering of the counties such that P1 still manages to win? Or is there any ""critical vote share"" for P1, which if it fails to reach, no design of country borders can help it win? If yes, what is this critical vote share? If no, how do we construct such a county bordering?


3) Now let's say we only know the total vote shares of both the parties, and not the vote density functions themselves. I want to design my counties in such a way that leading in the vote share correlates to winning the elections - I wish to avoid a system where a party like P1, which has lower vote share, gets a ""rogue"" win due to a poor design of borders. Can I come up with an optimal county design which minimizes the chances of these ""rogue"" wins? If yes, under what conditions, and how do we design it? Does the chance of these rogue wins also depend on the voter turnout? That is, does a higher value of p1(x,y)+p2(x,y) result in lesser chances of rogue wins?


4) Do these questions also have answers for multi party systems?


Do any of these questions come under any particular field as such? Are there any resources to read more about these ideas? Also, I guess I haven't been too rigorous in formulating my problem, but I've tried to keep it as intuitive as possible.

math,How to disicpline myself in higher mathematics?,"I'm in my final year of undergraduate mathematics, though it is only my second year as a mathematics major (long story short, I switched majors a few times). What sparked my interest was how beautiful I found the subject of calculus to be, but, while currently suffering through a course in abstract linear algebra, I am beginning to realize two things especially: (1) how naive I was of the abstract logical structures underlying mathematics, and (2) how mathematically immature I am. The former is a wonderful surprise; the latter, not so much. When I discuss the homework problems with my classmates, I'll discuss my prolonged and awkward-but-successful proofs, and most of the time they'll laugh and show me their 3-line proof, making it seem trivial. It is good that I am surrounded by people more experienced in higher mathematics, and it has only made me hungrier for improvement. I'm often pessimistic due to my frequent inability to focus, but I want to change my mindset and gain confidence.

My most conspicuous shortcoming: problem-solving, the heart of mathematics itself. I'm poor at it, and I want to be better. So, how would you suggest I go about improving this skill?

math,I plotted the complex roots of an arbitrary cubic polynomial on the complex plane.,"[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cy3agqh4du](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cy3agqh4du)

The result is kind of fun to watch. Roots collide, split, and repel as the coefficients vary. If anyone wants to tinker, let me know if there are any interesting axes to jointly vary coefficients by that produce interesting behaviors. The following are the same code, but just with different combinations of varying parameters/different offsets, and I would be interested in seeing if varying specific expressions (e.g. the discriminant) would produce illuminating paths for the roots.

(I also found out today that Desmos has a complex plotter now... would have been helpful a while ago lol but this seems to be pretty stable regardless.)

math,XMJR,"So, just to warn you, the content of this post is admittedly a very low-stakes issue and in fact I'm not even sure about exactly what the question I want to ask is.

Basically the thing is: what the heck is the XJMR community? By XJMR I mean www.econjobrumors.com.

It has happened to me a few times, when googling some math related topic, to bump into a post in XJMR. Over time I started to develop a sort of zoologic interest in the species that seems to populate that forum, or more specifically the sub-forums concerned with academic mathematics.

If I had to describe my impressions of the community that inhabits those sub-forums in a couple of sentences, I would say that they seem to share two traits that I find it hard to imagine together in a single individual, namely: they seem to be pretty shallow, superficial people who have a hard time taking seriously any life pursuit that is not money or women; *and* they seem to spend lots of time researching and gossiping about the mathematics academic job market (even though they are mostly, if not only, ""outsiders"").

Am I the only one who finds this combination peculiar? As an example, some time ago there was a topic about some rumour that Ashwin Sah, the renowned combinatorics star under Yufei Zhao, was moving to industry. People were speculating about why that was, and one of the comments was:

""Combinatorics is a low-prestige field. Mostly just tricks, not big ideas. At some point a man realizes that any endeavour in life which doesn't make big money, get women or achieve high-status is basically pointless, and I'm glad AS came to this realization at such a young age.""

So here we have somebody who is shallow enough to believe that ""any endeavour in life which doesn't make big money, get women or achieve high-status is basically pointless"", while at the same time making clear that they have some non-trivial inside knowledge of math research. Now, don't get me wrong; I don't think that combinatorics is a ""low-prestige field"" because there are no ""big ideas"", but it does have that reputation and it's an opinion that only someone familiar with the math research community could possibly have.

So... who exactly are these people? Why do they care so much about who gets hired in what math department, when they could be looking up fancy cars to get them dates with hot women, which seems to be pretty much all they care about otherwise?",superkapa219,1gkzgsv,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gkzgsv/xmjr/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gkzgsv/xmjr/,2024-11-06 14:15:12,1,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gkzgsv

math,"Next ""step"" after studying Ext groups.","I'm presenting to a small group of fellow graduate students on homological algebra in a few days. The loose structure is that we take turns studying a concept and then presenting it to the group. We've generally been trying to follow Gelfand and Manin's Methods on Homological Algebra, though we've jumped around the book a bit, and some have taught concepts in different ways than what is presented in the book. So, our structure is pretty loose, if that makes sense.

Two weeks ago I talked about chain complexes and resolutions (with an emphasis on projective resolutions). Last week, someone built off of this defining Ext using projective resolutions and proved that any two different projective resolutions give isomorphic groups. Now, my question: Where should I take it from there?

Gelfand and Manin don't define Ext groups until they construct the derived category. This construction is obviously quite in-depth, and it would take me weeks, if not a month, to parse through the details, build up the derived category, then redefine Ext groups and progress the class further. So, the deeper meaning behind my question is: Is there a good place to take the class from our current ""naive"" definition of Ext groups without diving head-first into the category-theory side of things? Or is the next natural progression going to entail us fully embracing category theory, in which case it makes sense to take several weeks carefully defining the derived category?

I emailed the professor who technically ""runs"" the class (mostly, he only attends and lets us run things). He suggested I could discuss taking the category of complexes and considering morphisms up to homotopy. Then, talk about the mapping cone of a morphism. This feels to me like we'd still be embracing the category theory of things, but side stepping a lot of important details. In this case, it feels better to me to follow Gelfand and Manin and begin constructing the derived category, since that's where we'd be winding up anyway.

So, my question seems to be: Is the next natural step to embrace category theory head-on, let it take what time it may? Or is there a natural way to continue the class without embracing the category theory of things? (Thus far, people have been avoiding heavy doses of category theory).",DevilDuckTy,1gko2wd,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gko2wd/next_step_after_studying_ext_groups/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gko2wd/next_step_after_studying_ext_groups/,2024-11-06 02:25:35,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gko2wd

math,Books that explain Limits 'intuitively',"I am reading Prelude to Numbers and Mathematician's Delight by W.W Sawyer. And thanks to some internet troll I discovered Professor Gowers's blog where I stumbled upon [this article ](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/what-maths-a-level-doesnt-necessarily-give-you/#more-4693)which concludes with ""...the general principle that if you forget about understanding what’s going on and concentrate on mechanical manipulations, you’ll forget how to do even the mechanical manipulations."" 

1. This led me to wonder if there are books that intuitively build the idea of limits (and the implications of this idea and so on) without requiring the student to have encountered Analysis.   
  
2. Alternatively, I was wondering if there are books/pathways that circumvent limits entirely by approaching calculus through some other way. Maybe nonstandard calculus?   
  
3. Or is there a way to introduce someone not at the undergraduate level to Analysis in a way that helps them understand Limits better?! I am groping in the dark so maybe this is all very absurd to even ask. 

So far, from the r/math FAQ I found ""Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach"" by Keisler"" which might fit the bill. 

Lastly, I realize that Mir Publishers, AMS, Dover among others have books that intuitively build various mathematical ideas. I was hoping to hear about your favorite books of this nature (could be about any topic, not just calculus or limits).

PS: Also would ""The Metaphysical Principles of the Infinitesimal Calculus"" by René Guénon be a worthwhile read while on this subject?

math,Mathematics Summer School ,"I am surprised by the fact that there is so little opportunity for interested people to do mathematics over the summer. It is incredibly busy during term time but in summer there is a void with nothing to do. It is particularly bad in the UK where active lectures and seminars only run for 20 weeks a year(the rest is self study but I would still prefer more term time). I remember feeling a great hunger for studying in summer but I had nowhere to go apart from books and internet, and while they are a good way to study, they can't replace a live community and education. There are some math related opportunities in summer around the world but the list is honestly not very inspiring.

I want to setup an online summer school for people interested in doing more maths over the summer. It would involve courses mostly for school students and undergrads. But I don't think graduates and postdocs would find this useful since they are likely too busy with their own projects. It would also try to create a sense of community with discussions, group projects, and active engagement(which could all be done very easily with discord). I expect that the courses would be run by more experienced people who want to earn some cash, such as graduates or late undergrads, but all people should be welcome to run their course, including professors and postdocs. A big part of it would probably have to be volunteering but at the same time, I could expect a few dozen students from all over the world to enroll in a 5 week course(say) for a hundred bucks, which would make some good money for whoever's running the course while lecturing for only 3 hours a week.

People from less mathematically specialised universities could catch up with maths they are missing on, like analysis courses, while people from more specialised places could delve in topics that their university doesn't have courses in. High schoolers could get into olympiad mathematics or get a taste of university mathematics.

math,Spot it - but with three cards?,"Most of you probably know the math behind the ""[Spot it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobble)""/""Dobble"" game. If not, read about it [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36798/what-is-the-math-behind-the-game-spot-it).   
tl;dr: The cards are designed after the finite projective plane of order 7. Each card is equivalent to a line, each symbol on the card to a point and because two lines meet in exactly one point, two cards (=lines) will always have exactly one symbol (=point) in common.

Over the weekend I was thinking how to make this game harder. **Can you have n cards with k symbols on each of it such that the intersection of any three cards is exactly one symbol, but the intersection of only two cards is more than one symbol?** I read a lot about [Block design ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design)and [Combinatorial design ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design)and I am still not sure how to tackle this problem. I don't think a ""t=3-block design"" is what I am searching for because this would just make each triple of symbols occur on only one card - this is not what I am searching for.  
  
The only non-trivial solution I could think of is 4 cards with 4 symbols: 123, 124, 134, 234. If you pick any three cards here, all of those will have all symbols except one, so the intersection is 4-3 symbols.   
I have a gut feeling that larger solutions might not be possible, because for large n, there are many more way to choose 3 cards out of n as there are for choosing 2 cards out of n and therefore, the ""intersection is 1 symbol""-condition is much more restrictive.

So, are there larger non-trivial solutions you could use to design a similiar, harder game? What exact ""combinatorical design"" term do I need to search for?

There're more from Gower's website but I can only put 20 images here. Is this some sort of AI?

I originally noticed something strange when I saw every single comments under Terrence Tao's blog got 16 dislikes.

The Victor Porton guy from one of the image seemed a little off. But I don't see how he would be motivated to do this.

Who's actually behind this all? Why do they do this?

**Update:**

I got a screenshot of the username who made the comments that were deleted on Terrence Tao's website. They seem to be still spamming there but some precautions seems to be taken. When I hit refresh these comments go away.

I also found this comment, which just seems random and not that offensive, except for the profile picture, and when you click on the profile you can see the updated username that directly attacks Terrence's current work...

math,I love Hartshorne!!,"I think Hartshorne's algebraic geometry book is one of the best math books I've ever read. It's somehow so enjoyable that these days I just want to go around telling all my friends to read this book even if they are not math majors lol. For a long time I avoided it due to its notoriety and read Vakil's *Rising Sea* and Liu's *Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves* instead, but both of them never clicked for me. Vakil's book has way too many exercises that disrupt the flow of the book, and somehow I feel like I never know where he is trying to go. I've only read the first few pages of Liu's book, but I remember it being extremely dense and confusing to read. After struggling with AG for so long, I decided to bite the bullet last summer and read Hartshorne from the start, doing most of its exercises. And I regret so much not doing this earlier because this book really changed how I see AG. To me his style of writing is so much clearer than the two authors before, and I also found most of his exercises really enjoyable to work on. I've only read up to the middle of chapter 3, but this is already much further than I got in the other two books. I'd recommend anyone starting to learn AG to at least try reading Hartshorne and see if it fits your style of learning or not instead of completely avoiding it like me at the start.",attnnah_whisky,1gipuf4,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gipuf4/i_love_hartshorne/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gipuf4/i_love_hartshorne/,2024-11-03 15:47:53,166,0.92,166,0,31,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gipuf4

math,Question about a reducible complexity,"I'm a high school student who was thinking about tetration, pentation, etc. the other day and was curious if there was a more precise way to define them. I spent some time and came up with the recursive function f(n,k,a,b), where the function obeys the following rules:

1. f(n,k,a,b)=f(n,1,a,f(n,k-1,a,b)

2. f(n,1,a,b)=f(n-1,b-1,a,a)

3. f(1,1,a,b)=a+b

I'm pretty happy in general; the function derives multiplication, exponentiation, etc. on its own with the form f(n,1,a,b), with n=2 equaling a\*b, n=3 equaling a\^b, etc. However, the k is just a result of my process in reducing the function and is not in the input. Is it possible to come up with a new function that does the same thing with a domain of only three dimensions?

Unfortunately, though, I’m not aware of an autosave feature in VSCode, so if you forget to push your work to GitHub or your computer crashes, you risk losing a lot of progress.

  
By the way, **I feel a BURNING hatred in my heart for dealing with inserting figures in Beamer** presentations and I absolutely hate making Tikz figures, but I have a fondness for the Madrid theme because the first math class I ever took used it.

math,Set Theory Multiverse vs Mathematical Truth - Philosophical Discussion,"#

I've been thinking about the set theory multiverse and its philosophical implications, particularly regarding mathematical truth. While I understand the pragmatic benefits of the multiverse view, I'm struggling with its philosophical implications.

The multiverse view suggests that statements like the Continuum Hypothesis aren't absolutely true or false, but rather true in some set-theoretic universes and false in others. We have:

- Gödel's Constructible Universe (L) where CH is true
- Forcing extensions where CH is false
- Various universes with different large cardinal axioms

However, I find myself appealing to basic logical principles like the law of non-contradiction. Even if we can't currently prove certain axioms, doesn't this just reflect our epistemological limitations rather than implying all axioms are equally ""true""?

To make an analogy: physical theories being underdetermined by evidence doesn't mean reality itself is underdetermined. Similarly, our inability to prove CH doesn't necessarily mean it lacks a definite truth value.

Questions I'm wrestling with:
1. What makes certain axioms ""true"" beyond mere consistency?
2. Is there a meaningful distinction between mathematical existence and consistency?
3. Can we maintain mathematical realism while acknowledging the practical utility of the multiverse approach?
4. How do we reconcile Platonism with independence results?

I'm leaning towards a view that maintains objective mathematical truth while explaining why we need to work with multiple models pragmatically. But I'm very interested in hearing other perspectives, especially from those who work in set theory or mathematical logic.",wenitte,1gh5997,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gh5997/set_theory_multiverse_vs_mathematical_truth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gh5997/set_theory_multiverse_vs_mathematical_truth/,2024-11-01 13:22:10,25,0.7,25,0,79,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gh5997

math,How does ZFC Set Theory or Foundations of Mathematics relate to any of Mathematics?,"It's often assumed in a lot of papers and articles that modern mathematics is based on some foundational axioms and that these axioms are the axioms of ZFC Set Theory. I however struggle to see how mathematical subjects like calculus, geometry, algebra and statistics relate to ZFC Set Theory. I have read some textbooks in these fields and I do see the use of sets but I struggle to see how these sets are foundational to the theories. Perhaps this is because personally, I've relied more on intuition to understand mathematical concepts and theories rather than analytical axiomatic reasoning, and intuition is also how it's taught in schools and even at undergrad level in some cases.

I would be grateful if someone explains or gives resources or textbooks to help me see the connection between Mathematics and ZFC Set Theory or Foundations of Mathematics.
