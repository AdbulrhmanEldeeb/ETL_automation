webdev,PSA: You are good enough !,"I am not sure why I felt compelled to write this post. 

Perhaps it is the long unemployment stint I have been on and the rough interview loops I've been enduring or maybe I just needed the cathartic release. 

Either way, I want to take those who are interested down memory lane with me and reflect on a past experience of mine that helps me through tough times like this. 

It all started many years ago when I worked at a company with another developer. Lets call him Robert. Robert was by no means a super star developer but he was an amazingly nice person and was a pleasure to work with. 

However, he did not show qualities I would expect of a top developer.  No great understanding of CS. Not an algorithmic god. Minimal knowledge of craftmanship aspects in software. No extensive knowledge of building systems. He was just an every-day developer. 

One day Robert gets called by a FANG adjacent recruiter telling him that a team is interested in hiring him.  

What was different about this situation was the recruiter did not send him through the front door.  His interview loop consisted of 3 calls. 1 recruiter screen, 1 call with the hiring manager, 1 call with the wider team. 

He did not have to endure a single technical round (I don't want to go into the circumstances of why as I don't want to dox myself)

He of course takes this offer, and starts two weeks later. I was very happy for him and wished him the best and that was that. 

Fast forward to today. I am sitting here going through the trenches, 5 - 6 round loops. Code + system design + Behavioural. The whole sh\*t fest. 

Occasionally, the doubts creep in. Am I good enough ? should I throw in the towel and go into the #trades ? is my experience worthless ?

Then I always think back to our boy Robert.

Roberts story showed me that a vast number of developers probably can work these ""top"" roles if given the chance. 

The interview practices we endure are nothing more than a filter to whittle down the demand.  

When you fail an interview you are doing just that, failing a filter. It has no bearing on you, your ability, or your identity. Like Robert, if you could jump past all the interview mess you would be just fine!

As an aside, I believe that Robert would likely not have made it through the traditional interview loop for the same position.

  
Anyways, I hope you liked my story and wish you all the best if you are going through it also.

Lastly, I realise this post comes across bitter and jealous. It is not my intention (although perhaps I am a little). I am just a beaten-down dev struggling through it. I wish Robert the best and hope he is happy and killing it.

webdev,New company has clients point by nameserver instead of A record? There has to be a better way.,"Hey everyone, I recently started working at a website development company and ran into something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Here‚Äôs the situation:

When we build a website for a client, we ask them to point their domain to our **nameservers** so the website can go live. This means we end up managing their entire DNS, even though we‚Äôre just the website provider. It's an extra burden, especially when clients request changes for things like email or subdomains.

I asked why we don‚Äôt just have clients point their domain to our server using an **A record**, and here‚Äôs the explanation I got:

‚ÄúIf we ever need to change our server‚Äôs IP address (which has happened a couple of times), all clients would need to update their A record to the new IP. That‚Äôs impractical with thousands of clients. Nameservers avoid this issue because we can make IP changes behind the scenes without involving the client.‚Äù

Okay, that makes sense, but using nameservers feels inefficient for so many other reasons... I feel like there has to be a better way to solve this problem without the extra workload.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts considering my role at the company isn't as technical but this workflow is hugely affecting my output and I want to offer them a better solution.

webdev,New technology in prod fears,"I'm wondering if anyone else has fears of trying new tech in prod. I'm not just talking about trying out a new library. I'm talking about standing up stuff that you've never really used in prod before.

I feel like I can play around with new tech locally but I always fear that there must be some prod specific stuff that I'm missing. Extra load revealing issues, incorrect assumptions made, config stuff that I'm expected to know but don't, etc. I tend to use stuff I'm familiar with just because there are some bugs that have been really hard to figure out. Managers have asked before *how* a bug could ***possibly*** be introduced, and the thought of saying, ""eh, this is just my first time using it and I'm learning"" sounds like a good way to get on someone's shitty developer list. Most managers that I've had seem to think that any bug is just completely unacceptable, so the thought of admitting to incompetence or ignorance seems like out of the question.

Do most of you just stick with shit you know, or do you take the plunge if you think something might be better? Or go with something new that might work just as well but also save some paint points from existing tech? I'm not talking about going with new stuff just because it's new.

  
**Example**

I used to work at a place with multiple applications. I was talking to someone on another team in the enterprise one day about their architecture. This team literally didn't use a load balancer to load balance between different servers. They literally made separate URLs for the internal team to use. If one server went down, they would launch up the other and tell the internal customers to go the other URL. Load balancing is SO basic and it used to strike me as extremely weird that they wouldn't just add that in. I can imagine that it might be really scary for them though because of how critical the app was, and you could really screw up production if you messed up your session management setup. You might set up the load balancer and show that you're hitting the servers and that the website is working well, and then totally not do anything about session management. It hits production and then it's a disaster! Ok - you see errors and then you just shut down the other servers and you're pretty much back where you started.

webdev,Common data fetching in a layout and a page in ReactJS,"I have been thinking about data fetching of front end. Suppose you have

\- Layout: it resource A to render a sidebar

\- Page: it is in the layout. It needs resource A and B

Resource is stored globally in an app (with whatever, Redux or Context). Resource A may be fetched again on a user event like when \`userId\` changes.  
Page A should not know what layout fetches, vice versa. They should care only data they need.

How is it possible to fetch resource A only once?

If you put this \`useEffect\` in a layout and a page, it fetches when \`userId\` changes. A problem is that they may race in a layout and a page. They may run simultaneously.

\`\`\`  
useEffect(() =&gt; {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}, \[dispatch, userId\]);

\`\`\`

Putting another \`useEffect \` does not seem to solve a problem. You will not know when \`useEffect\` runs, no matter it is in a layout or in a page. If only a page waits until layout finishes loading, it would work, but it does not.

\`\`\`

useEffect(() =&gt; {

if (resourceAStatus === 'idle') {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}

}, \[dispatch, resourceAStatus \]);

\`\`\`

One simple way is ""Fetch data in layout, not in page at all"", but it is not a good practice. You should fetch data when you need it.

Does anyone know a good data fetching design?

webdev,Trying to break out of the field while simultaneously unemployed. Advise?,"I am a senior web dev (NodeJS, RoR) that has recently lost their job unexpectedly for the first time in forever. I live in the EU, in a country that does not have a lot of jobs, and what little can be found has a lot of competition, is underpaid, and you get worked to the bone. Up until this point I was working fully remote for other EU companies and was starting to make a decent living as an EM. When I lost my job I tried to keep that momentum going, but long story short, it's quite difficult and there is higher need for developers than there is for other roles.

I used my unemployment time to pick up Python which turned out great, successfully acing two different coding challenges and reaching the next stage in the pipeline. However, it seems that growing into Python further would involve delving into pretty specific and uninteresting libraries (django, or numpy or pandas).

Context over, now to the matter at hand. I am quite tired of web dev. It's why I ventured into Python in the first place. With time on my hands, I have it in me to pick up another language. To spare you the details, I believe these are the two avenues that might make sense:

\- Refresh in-demand, web only languages. This obviously snuffs out what little soul I have left. Refresh PHP. Or refresh NodeJS/TypeScript. Much better than PHP, but still quite boring. There are a lot of PHP, NodeJS, RoR jobs, but there are also a lot of candidates.

\- Try my hand at C#. Interesting, can think of very enticing projects! I am confident I could pick it up. Potentially moves me away from web dev. But my CV has no single a single speck of C#, so I would not be looked as a solid candidate.

webdev,Issue with vertically centered content shifting on wrap,"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm stuck and was hoping someone could help. Essentially, I have a splash/landing page with a logo. The logo is an SVG, it's vertically and horizontally centered. That all works great.

I have a little JavaScript that types in a byline type description under it. It's short. But on mobile screens, it wraps to the next line, which is fine. Only issue is that when it wraps, the element (H1) then shifts the logo above it upwards so the image, and now two lines of text are all vertically centered.

I'd like the text to just go downwards when wrapping without pushing the group of the content upwards.

Here's what I have currently. We're using Bootstrap 5.

Edit: I can see that putting the JS inside the section groups it with the logo to be centered, but we've tried it outside as well and same.

    &lt;section id=""landing"" class=""landing bg-light d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center vh-100""&gt;

    .landing .landing-logo {
    ¬† width: clamp(300px, 50%, 916px);
    }
    
    .typing-text {

webdev,CMS or VPS,"Hello everyone! 

2 years ago I made a small website for a charity, they told me it would need to be a static site which would \*not\* change over time. Well, so far there's been plenty of changes which also contain temporary changes (like an event).

Currently I have written a custom, ugly and bad static site generator, but it works in this case. The demand for changes has grown (still not a lot), and there's a request to move some of those responsibilities towards them, so they can maintain some of the content.

So far I've been looking into some CMS systems, and I haven't found a single one that I like. None of them offer the structure that I need/want for something small, or come off as having a snake in the grass on the free tier.

I've looked into Supabase as well, which I think I'd like, but it pauses your project quite fast, and freezes it after 90 days of inactivity. This doesn't suit me at all since it'll probably only be around 2-3 times a year they'll need to update their content. So the project would become frozen every time on the free tier.

I've also looked into Firebase, which looks like something I'd like to learn, but it doesn't offer image hosting on the free tier. And the Blaze plan looks good on paper, but I'm really afraid of having bots/abuse ramp up the requests/usage costs.

I've also looked at (not in detail yet) VPS. This is something that I'd love to learn, since I'll get full control over everything. My main issue with most systems is the control being limited. The main drawback here is, I'm terrified of unauthorized access, leaks, hidden costs, file uploads being abused and wrecking havoc... basically, a LOT of variables I'm not familiar with that could go wrong, I think... is a VPS really a safe option?

webdev,First-timer deployment strategy of web app,"Hi everyone,

I have been working on a new web app for the past few months, and I am approaching the moment of go-live. This being my first developed application, I am not sure what would be the best option for deploying. Digital ocean seems like an easy and straight forward option, but charging 15$/month for the db/cache container seems a bit steep.

For some context this is the technology stack i am using:

* Backend:
   * Spring Boot
   * Postgres
   * Mongo
* Frontend:
   * React

I am mostly oriented towards pricing, hosting platform quality, and future scenarios where I want to migrate. For example, I wish to have my app easily movable and not be locked in with a vendor.

I would highly appreciate and tips and/or tutorials for doing this so that I am ""covered"" when it comes to reliability and access.

webdev,"Is front end development dying [NOT duplicate, serious topic]","I'm sure there are lots of more exprienced developers out there, since I was professionally in the industry for 3 years now and I was working freelance before but things have gone much worse from my perspective. 

I'm not going to start AI will make us homeless stuff, but the way is front end viewed is the problem.

I think it is a nail in the coffin for this field. imagine this. so, we have backend colleagues. they are getting paid more than us and more important than that, they have PRESTIGE. 

even if they write a simple SELECT query, the employer and others think that it is a rocket science or something, but for a front end developers... "" it is just a simple button bro "". 

it almost took me 2 months to optimize the prescription section of our medical web app. we've had heavy lists and extremely dynamic forms and technical challenges.. but we've done something extremely good. 

and now after 2 months the only thing I heard from my boss was "" this was the least you can do, it is just a simple button "" 

and I don't blame him to be fair. this is what most of the industry thinks. 

  
I feel like the blue collar part of the developer society. you took the most effort, get paid less and no one values your job. 

and even worse than that, compared to Java or C# (Scala or .NET Core), front end is just a shit party! no rules, no strong foundation and god forbid for example if Vercel rolls out a new update and changes the whole structure of the framework! 

on the other hand, from my personal experience, I really enjoy reading .NET core documents. everything is very well structured and you don't have to give blow job  for AI or Stackoverflow developers to get your answer.

just a great Microsoft community. 

  
so, my question is... is it worth it? really after 3 years and couple years of freelance, I just started to regret my choice. 

it was like that in 2016 let's say...

Here‚Äôs my current approach: I separate a quantity/time bar chart into two components: quantity and time. Each component is tied to its own plugin for different data sources (SQL, API, IoT).

\- Free and open-source

\- Familiar Tech stack  
   \&gt; NextJS (it's on my fav tech stack as well to build web apps)

\- Extensible  
\&gt; I can easily customize it such as instead of Google Cloud Storage I can use Cloudflare R2

\- Modern

And thanks to everyone who validated that it's possible to have deep experience in the field and not having experience with one of the gazzillion tools and techniques that are out there.

As an aside: a few years after I got into this field, the browser wars happened. Things got really messy for awhile. We had to deal with variations in browsers that were pretty confusing. New tools were rising that were helpful. But it was a hard time to know whether any path was a good one. I assumed things would get simpler with time. But they didn't. Web development is much more complex now than ever. Not so much in terms of code, but in the vast array of tools, options, techniques, vendors and so on.

We're looking to replace our current component library, which is built with **BootstrapVue**. The main reasons for the switch are:

1. **Incompatibility with Vue3**
2. BootstrapVue uses **Bootstrap v4** under the hood which is very heavy-weight as it still uses jQuery.

We already use **TailwindCSS** and **SCSS** in our development, so we're considering **shadcn** as a potential replacement. One key requirement is that the new library must be **heavily customizable** to help us maintain the look and feel of the Bootstrap components we're currently using.

We also need it to support:

* Accessible components
* Responsive design
* Vue3 compatibility
* Interactive Components (Modals, Dropdowns, etc.)
* Animations and Transitions
* Comprehensive Documentation and Active Community

webdev,Question about GDPR and CCPA and cookie banners,"I'm making an startup that collects analytics and marketing data, [https://storyteller.so](https://storyteller.so)

The whole point of the app is to collect that data in-house, not using 3rd party tools or sending it to different providers.

From my understanding, the fact that the app is collecting information it requires to function, and isn't using 3rd party collection, it should be compliant to both laws without the need for a bunch of ""accept cookie"" banners.

It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.

I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in  California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.



EDIT::: So I asked chatGPT but I dont knwo if I can trust it's answer, but it seems reasonable.

If your site and app use cookies **only for essential purposes**, such as maintaining user sessions and tracking which A/B testing version a user is seeing, and you gather analytics directly on your own backend without setting additional cookies for these purposes, your GDPR and CCPA obligations may differ:

# GDPR Considerations

1. **Essential Cookies**: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations) are generally considered ""strictly necessary."" Under GDPR, **strictly necessary cookies do not require user consent**. However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.
2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:
   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).
   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.
   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.
3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).

# CCPA Considerations

1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:
   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.
   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.
2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.

# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?

* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.
* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:
   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).
   * The purposes for which the data is processed.
   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).

# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance

1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:
   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).
   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).
   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).
2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don‚Äôt use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.
3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.

By sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",IAmRules,1h21jfl,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,2024-11-28 17:49:14,0,0.4,0,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h21jfl

webdev,Which CMS to use?,"Hi, I'm seeking advice on which CMS to use.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Background**


I am a content creator and have limited knowledge on HTML and CSS.


&amp;nbsp;
 

I currently have a website built by myself from scratch using Wordpress. I wish to use other CMS as Wordpress seems too cluttered and messy with so many 3rd-party plugins being installed. There is lack of cohesiveness in design and operations.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Needs**


The website will be mainly an educational website with articles, videos and podcasts. Events will also be shown on the website for people to register.


&amp;nbsp;
 

Will be good if as many of the following items are built-in as possible instead of having to install plugin after plugin.


&amp;nbsp;
 

1) Native SEO


Don't want to wade through tons of SEO plugins, with each professing their way is the best way, just to get basic SEO done.


&amp;nbsp;
 

2) Forms


Built-in form functionality to collect feedback and to sign up for newsletters and memberships.


&amp;nbsp;
 

3) Memberships


I did not create memberships for the current website and would like to do so for the new website as I want to differentiate content between registered members and public.


&amp;nbsp;
 

4) Newsletters


For sending regular newsletters to members and people who sign up for them.


&amp;nbsp;
 

5) Integrations


Be able to integrate easily with other services like Nextcloud (for external storage, linking of videos, audio files &amp; images), Eventbrite (for booking of events created on Eventbrite) and social media platforms like Youtube, Instagram &amp; Tiktok (to showcase my videos and playlists posted on these platforms).


&amp;nbsp;
 

6) Localization


Able to have a multilingual website in English &amp; Chinese.


&amp;nbsp;
 

7) Mobile apps


Able to create mobile version of the website for Android &amp; iOS. Not going to do Native apps as they are too costly. So, I'm guessing I need to use headless CMS for this. However, I have read that Drupal can be Progressively Decoupled to allow for more Editoral needs and less Developer needs. Are there other CMS that can done this way? ([Source](https://medium.com/@opensenselabs/a-complete-guide-on-fully-decoupled-drupal-56fd283fcd60))



&amp;nbsp;
 

Any programming language is fine so long as the CMS can fulfill as many of the above items as possible.

webdev,Misleading salary offers in job opportunities,"I've been looking for a new job for the past month. I finally found the perfect match, but on the way there, I couldn't help but notice something that is increasingly used by firms/recruiters: huge salary offers, that lead nowhere.

A bit of context: I'm currently applying as a lead Dev in France/Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I saw a job offer in Paris, for an American company.

Remote 1 day/week. Fine by me, I like being onsite.

Salary ? 72k to 150k, based on experience.

Their stack is interesting, the product looks nice, I give it a go. 

It's a five step process, with 3 interviews, a peer coding session, and at-home assignment that took me roughly 5 hours. Last Friday, they came back to me: they want me on the team. So, 4th interview with my future manager and HR. Manager tells me that I aced the tests, and they'd like to start ASAP. 

Their offer ? 75K.

This is not the first time I see this kind of behaviour, so I asked frankly: I aced all tests, and showed interest in your product, and had a great human fit with everyone I talked to. We share the same values when it comes to both human and professional responsibilities. So, how comes I'm not getting the 150k salary ?

To which they answered that ""This salary is only for applicants who live in the bay area, since the cost of living is way higher there"". So, I turned down the job, because the offer they gave me was lower than my current salary. Plus, I felt like after showing so much investment in their process, this was basically a huge red flag.

webdev,A Browser-Based Solution for Reusable Libraries and Frameworks?,"Hey, I‚Äôm no expert, but I think I‚Äôve stumbled on a genius idea:

What if browsers offered to store commonly used libraries and frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) locally instead of downloading them repeatedly for each website?

Here‚Äôs the idea:

* The browser could cache reusable libraries, especially popular ones like CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries.
* If a website uses modified or custom classes, the browser could detect this and ensure they aren't overridden. (web devs should notify the browser in headers or something to not override)
* For JavaScript, core functions of libraries could be stored in the browser, while any additional custom code gets bundled and served as usual. ( again, devs should notify the browser, and split their code too for this purpose)

This could save tons of bandwidth and improve loading speeds, with only small updates needed for library changes, and I believe that this is the future of web dev speed.

What do you think? Could this work?

I'm not understanding the terms of service - theres is similar to Google (one of their named competitors). It says you can't pre-fetch, cache or store autocomplete addresses beyond 30 days. Does that apply to validated addresses as well?

How would a company, after a transaction (assuming that is the point of the 30 days), handle providing receipts to the end user beyond 30 days? I would assume an end user would still want to be able to verify what address a product was sent to beyond that time frame and a company probably would want to store that address longer to deal with incorrect sending/re-sending reppacements/etc. so how do they accomplish this?

Or are the storage terms there to prevent people from requesting all addresses in the platform and storing a copy of them all indefinitely (alleviating the need to use the platform) - more of a gotcha if needed?

I want to use this platform, it's the cheapest/least resteictive by far compared to Smarty, Loquate, Google (attribution), geoapify, USPS (mailing requirement) etc. but my address validation needs require storing the addresses a bit longer than 30 days (not indefinitely).",Unhappy_Trout,1h1vkzq,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,2024-11-28 13:08:11,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h1vkzq

They don't need a website for marketing, ads and videos does that it tiktok/fb/youtube. They don't need a site to sell, customers could talk to them via chat and order directly.

So your marketing effort does everything about building your brand image and awareness. You don't need a site to present your business informations. And you can sell through chat.

Been scheming on starting freelance Web Design for 6 months now learning the ins and outs of Elementor and overall web design.

So whether I like it or not I‚Äôm essentially selling a form of marketing. At the end of the day my passion is web design and I want to keep as close to that as possible as I can without locking myself out of the profit party filled with web designers that sell a website as part of a digital marketing package.¬†

I understand Webflow has SEO embedded but I can already see the clients face when they‚Äôve heard SEO SEO SEO SEO SEO a dozen times and that is my only bullet for how investing in me building them a new website generates them more revenue.¬†



**Question:**¬†

My question is what angle for SMBs should I take to ensure I can confidently say they‚Äôre investment is going to pay itself off that isn‚Äôt shying too far away from designing on Webflow and entering the ‚ÄòaLL iN OnE DiGiTaL MaRkEtiNg sPeCiAl‚Äô where I‚Äôm handling their google and meta ads etc. Just super intrigued as to how delusional I‚Äôm being or if there are people converting half decent clients essentially off straight web design as I more than understand the $500-1000 website motto is asking for trouble and headaches from cheapskate customers.¬†



Greatly appreciate any advice as I am as far as I can get in terms of throwing myself into the deep end and have no option but to go out and go get it.¬†",maxo6k,1h0yyro,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,2024-11-27 07:32:36,7,0.62,7,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0yyro

webdev,Asking for a webdev role sanity check,"I was hoping I could get some thoughts and observations about my current position and role. It doesn't make sense to me that my company is run this way, but here I am. 

We are an e-Commerce company (with a couple physical retail locations) that does about $15m a year through our Shopify website. We also do almost that much through Amazon. We have maybe 110 employees, most of which are in product development and fulfillment. 

I am the sole developer in the company. We have 1 IT guy, who helps run Netsuite as well as all IT functions. We have a Tech Manager who just started and is the 3rd one we've had in a year, who will mostly own Netsuite. I seldom speak with these people as our roles don't overlap.

I do *everything* regarding the website. I am a Front End Dev by training with 18 years experience (both in agencies and ecommerce). So, obviously I manage the functionality and look/feel of our site. I also build &amp; launch all of our products in Shopify (800+ SKUs), as well as maintain all of their information/images. I build all of the themes to swap for different site changes, promos or product launches. I build all of the discounts and promotions and upsells.  I own probably 25 of the 3rd party apps we have installed in our store to add functionality, meaning I am the point of contact if any of them have an issue. Search, cart, bundles, reviews, subscriptions, Klaviyo, etc. 

Our Shopify store was built by an agency 2 years ago, yet somehow I was not involved in that process. I was tasked with keeping our previous store running. The agency customized a ton of code because the our people involved *had* to have this or that functionality (most of which are no longer with the company anyway). There are no code comments or documentation of what they did or changed. This is my first Shopify experience, and I am trying to pick up Liquid as I go. 

Speaking of customized solutions... we are also running both a B2B and D2C solution off of the same platform that was NOT designed to do that natively. We have custom scripts running to calculate prices and shipping rules that don't play nice with other things we try to accomplish. 

I am also the point of contact for all of our employees for any issue with Shopify via Slack. I am 2nd layer support for any of our customers who have store issues our CS team cannot solve. 

I report to the marketing manager. She is not very technical. I make just over 90k. I work remote from home. Luckily, I don't touch anything order related, nor Amazon or Netsuite.

I have to ask... This isn't normal, right? 

I am barely keeping my head above water. I don't have any actual QA. I don't have any technical support (beyond Shopify support). I don't have any back up. I work on a non-technical marketing team. We are in the depths of holiday, and as you can imagine, it is unbelievably crazy. 

Do other $30m a year companies run like this? 

I often get approached from our VP of marketing with some idea that GAP or Sephora are doing on their website. Sure, that's a cool feature. I'm going to assume those places don't have a single developer who spends half his day context-switching. 

I've been here 6 years. When I started, we had 3 back end devs and myself. Slowly, they left and were never replaced. Which was why we went to Shopify. I guess this has been a 'slowly boil the frog' situation. 

I know I should probably find another job, but I live in a place that doesn't have a ton of jobs, and every remote job listing I see has 100+ applicants before I've even read it. I'm burnt out, looking for a sanity check.

webdev,How to Handle Currency Conversion and Rounding Issues on a Global Platform?,"`To Be fair i am not a native English speaker so took some help from chat gpt for rewirting my problem to make it less painfull for you guys to read. my apologies` 

  
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm working on a platform where service providers can list their offerings, and users from around the world can book them. We support multiple currencies, but our backend stores everything in USD for consistency. I‚Äôm facing a few challenges with pricing, conversion, and rounding, and I‚Äôm curious how others handle similar issues.

Here‚Äôs the setup:

1. A service provider creates a package with an hourly rate in their local currency (e.g., 100 GBP).
2. The backend converts the price to USD using the current exchange rate (e.g., 100 GBP ‚Üí 124.56 USD).
3. Users see the price in their local currency, rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 125 USD).

Now the issues:

1. **Rounding Discrepancies**:
   * If the user books a package for 3 hours, they see¬†`125 * 3 = 375 USD`. But the backend calculates¬†`124.56 * 3 = 373.68 USD`. This mismatch confuses users.
   * If I always round on the frontend, the service provider might receive less than they expected.
2. **Currency Volatility**:
   * Exchange rates change over time. Locking the rate at the time of booking solves this for transactions, but I‚Äôm unsure how to handle edge cases, like refunds after months of exchange rate changes.
3. **Adding New Currencies**:
   * Storing prices in every currency a user might use isn‚Äôt scalable. If we add a new currency later, recalculating and storing all previous package prices in the new currency seems impractical.

**Questions for the Community**:

1. How do platforms like Airbnb or Fiverr handle pricing and rounding across currencies?
2. Is there a better way to deal with rounding discrepancies without overpaying/underpaying either party?
3. Are there efficient ways to handle refunds in multi-currency setups when exchange rates fluctuate?
4. Any scalable strategies for introducing new currencies without recalculating older data?

Would love to hear how you‚Äôve tackled similar issues or any creative ideas you might have!

webdev,I don't understand how they build apps with AI,"To keep it short. I am modifying an app that uses python flask for backend, and I used SQLAlchemy as an ORM layer to work with my database. I had a model that is already in the db and I needed to add new boolean not nullable field to it. I know how to do it, but decided to test chatGPT. Yes, it was great at correcting auto-migration, as you need to pupulate this new field somehow to create it not nullable. But then things got tricky. I needed to add this field to my admin panel, and I wanted it to be 'read-only', so when user can see it but cannot edit it. And it tried to do it, he added it to list view and edit view, disabled the field, removed it from create view, added logic to assign value when the model is created in admin panel, BUT it cannot solve the issue, that when I start editing sexisting model where this disabled field is equal to True and save it, it gets saved to the DB as false, as disabled fields are not part of the form and then ORM treats it like False value. I gave it a chance, tried different promts but it couldn't correct this behaviour. 

So my thought is, I don't know how people are able to develop somethig complex with it. Sure, it helps me with snippents (like with migration), but when you try to get some even simple looking functionality it may introduce bugs and you are lucky if it is you who catches them, not the end-user. Also I get more satisfaction by researching and writing code myself, not writing instructions for who knows how long to get what I need.

This means that default / recommended way of using library relies on `Math.random`:

webdev,Building a PDF with HTML. Crazy?,"A client has a ""fact sheet"" with different stats about their business. They need to update the stats (and some text) every month and create a PDF from it.

Am I crazy to think that I could/should do the design and layout in HTML(+CSS)? I'm pretty skilled but have never done anything in HTML that is designed *primarily* for print. I'm sure there are gotchas, I just don't know what they are.

FWIW, it would be okay for me to target one specific browser engine (probably Blink) since the browser will only be used to generate the 8 1/2 x 11 PDF. 

On one hand I feel like HTML would give me lots of power to use graphing libraries, SVG's and other goodies. But on the other hand, I'm not sure that I can build it in a way so that it consistently generates a nice (single page) PDF without overflow or other layout issues.

Thoughts?

PS I'm an expert backend developer so building the interface for the client to collect and edit the data would be pretty simple for me.

webdev,Another unprepared project,"Seeing this stuff more and more at my agency as well as when multiple LARGE companies even come with work they would like done...

It gets to Dev to build and much of the project to date with scope, functionality etc is just not there.

Recently had a new landing page system requirement, these differer from the website. All ready to build.  
I sit with the project manager to go over it.

\- Design is done, ready to build!  
\- First off there are 3 enquire buttons in the top area next to the enquire form itself which made me laugh.  
\- I did not say anything but the flow of the page was all wrong, made no sense and to me did not seem to match what they said the goal was, but oh well  
\- They changed what the form did mid conversation to go to another page with more complete form and a part submission step... OK BUT - No idea what was on the page and what the other part of the form was going to be and no idea on what fields would come across pre-populate etc.

Few other things.  
I am the lead developer, I work with all the departments and managers and across everything. Rather than giving it to one of the team as it was a mess I took it on as I am also a designer so I could fill in a lot of the blanks there as well as it does not have a huge budget.

Did what I could and hand over with clear requirements on all the things still needed and missing.

1 week later and they have some back and forward with the client and I am asked to change a graphic (which should be the designers job) and some text changes.

4 days later I am being asked if it is live yet  
I just had to email all parties with the bullet list of the actual important stuff again.

It amazes  me that across several people including the client they have not mapped out the key flow and functionality of the project, want it live and STILL do not know what it is supposed to do and where the data goes and how they will use it.

webdev,"What's the hype around Cursor? I see so many people saying it's great, but it actually made me laugh out loud how bad it was. Are they shills or am I using it wrong?","I've used Claude and Chad Jupiter before, and I find them useful for a few specific things. 

1. If there's some algorithm I'm pretty sure exists, but I don't know what it's called. 

2. If I'm trying to do something that's way out of my element, like say I want to try to train a model to do something. I don't really know shit about ML beyond surface level stuff, and even though the AIs spit out code that doesn't quite work, I do find it more useful than opening a book to the first page, as I learn best by building something, and they can at least lay out some sort of path for me to follow even if it's not the optimal one. 

For everything else I think they're a waste of time, because it takes me more brain power to code review their code than to write it myself.

More than a few times I've seen the name ""Cursor"" come up as being the cream of the crop, so I downloaded it, tried the free trial, and it turned out the be the sloppiest of the slop.

Here's an example of a prompt I put in. 

    # I need some Elixir code that align characters or groups of characters in pairs of strings. 
    # Here's an example of what the data might look like.
    # 
    # Input:
    # ```
    # abc,LlmNN
    # ccb,NNNNm
    # ac,LlNN
    # bab,mim
    # ```
    # Output:
    # ```
    # a b c,Ll m NN
    # c c b,NN NN m
    # a c,Ll NN
    # b a b,m i m
    # ```
    # So it will look at all the lines to figure out how it can group the letters. 
    # As you can see from the last example, `a` in this case is no longer `Ll`, but we still can figure out where to split it because the `b`-`m` pairing is something we've seen before.

I didn't spend much time on writing the perfect prompt, and maybe it could be improved, but for comparison Claude spit out runnable code, however it didn't actually solve the task as requested. Chad Jupiter started to write code, but spazzed out at the end. I didn't bother reviewing the code to see if it was on the right track, but it at least made an attempt. Cursor? ...?

    I'm not sure how to approach this. Any ideas?

Do I have any ideas?! If I have to come up with all the ideas what are you here for? At one point while adjusting the formatting on the prompt it did spit out some code, but it was just a function that read from a file and split at new lines. Literally not even required based on the prompt. Is Cursor just this shit, or am I using it wrong?

[Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/UmopPBE)

Here's Claude's code. It doesn't solve the problem and just seems to zip each line of characters together, so still pretty useless, but at least it's ~150 lines of running code, which is still, ever so slightly better than asking me for ideas about what to do.

webdev,Is there a catch here? Why choose DigitalOcean when Hosting*r offers so much more?,"I‚Äôve been comparing hosting options for the early stages of a social network project. I came across two options that seem wildly different in terms of the resources they offer:

|**Specification**|**DigitalOcean Basic (2 vCPUs, 2GB)**|Hosting\*r KVM8 (8 vCPUs, 32GB)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**vCPUs**|2|8|
|**RAM**|2 GB|32 GB|
|**Disk Space**|60 GB SSD|400 GB NVMe SSD|
|**Bandwidth**|3 TB/month|32 TB/month|
|**Cost**|$18/month|$20/month|

The resources offered by Hosting&amp;r are so much higher that it seems too good to be true. I get that there‚Äôs likely a difference in quality. For example, even if Hosting&amp;r‚Äôs 32GB RAM doesn‚Äôt reach its full capacity and performs more like 10GB in real-world scenarios, it‚Äôs still 5x the RAM DigitalOcean provides. The bandwidth difference is also insane - 32TB vs. just 3TB.

Given that I‚Äôm building a social network in its early stages with about 100 users initially, is there a major reason to stick with DigitalOcean? Are there hidden trade-offs in Hosting&amp;r‚Äôs offering that I might be overlooking? Or does the sheer quantity of resources compensate for any quality differences?

webdev,How to remove Laravel Routes case sensitivity?,"Hi all, I have a laravel app running locally using Herd and deployed in prod on DigitalOcean. It is working fine so far. But one issue I'm having is that routes are not case insensitive so \`&lt;host&gt;/hello\` works but \`&lt;host&gt;/hellO\` doesn't. I get a 404.

How can I fix this behavior? I'd like for all routes to be lower cased.

I tried creating a middleware and apply it at the route level, at a group level, and globally by adding it to the list of middleware applied to \`$middleware-&gt;api(append: \[NormalizeRouteCasing::class\]\` but none of these works. I added debug statements in the middleware and is as if the execution never even gets to the middleware. When I remove the capital letter form the route it does reach it and I see the debug statements. So even before the middleware layer the upper cased routes are being rejected

Appreciate the help. Thank you.

UPDATE:

I Just want to give an update and say that the only thing I have been able to do that actually works (but it's ugly) is this:

In the public/index.php file, right before `(require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php')-&gt;handleRequest(Request::capture());` is called I'm doing this:

$requestUri = $\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\];  
$parsedUrl = parse\_url($requestUri);  
$path = isset($parsedUrl\['path'\]) ? strtolower($parsedUrl\['path'\]) : '';  
$query = isset($parsedUrl\['query'\]) ? '?'.$parsedUrl\['query'\] : '';  
$lowercaseUri = $path.$query;  
$\_SERVER\['REQUEST\_URI'\] = $lowercaseUri;

But please let know if there is a better approach or if there would be any downsides with this approach.

webdev,Can't Get HTTPS Working on Netlify with GoDaddy DNS ‚Äì Stuck and Need Help!,"Hey everyone,

I'm really struggling to get HTTPS set up for my site hosted on Netlify while my domain is registered on GoDaddy. I've been going back and forth switching nameservers, tweaking DNS settings, and retrying verification, but I just can't get Netlify to provision the SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.

Here's the situation:

Domain: Registered with GoDaddy.

Hosting: Netlify (pulling from GitHub).

Nameservers: Currently using GoDaddy's default (ns55.domaincontrol.com and ns56.domaincontrol.com), since they don‚Äôt seem deletable or changeable in the DNS zone.

DNS Records in GoDaddy:

A Records: Pointing to Netlify's IPs (75.2.60.5 and 99.83.229.76).

CNAME for www: Points to sitename.netlify.app.


Netlify Settings:

Custom domain added (sitename.com as primary, www.sitename.com redirects to it).



The problem is that Netlify keeps giving me a ""DNS verification failed"" error when I try to enable HTTPS. I‚Äôve tried:

1. Switching to Netlify‚Äôs nameservers (but GoDaddy doesn‚Äôt allow me to remove its NS records within the DNS zone).


2. Sticking with GoDaddy‚Äôs default nameservers and ensuring A and CNAME records are configured as Netlify recommends.


3. Retrying DNS verification after waiting for propagation (24+ hours).



No matter what I try, I‚Äôm stuck in the same spot. It‚Äôs frustrating because I can‚Äôt seem to delete or override those default NS records in GoDaddy either.


---

Has anyone dealt with this before or has advice on how to fix it? Should I fully switch to Netlify‚Äôs DNS and manage everything there, or is there a workaround for the NS records in GoDaddy? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

webdev,Image Hosting Approach for Small Web Site on Github Pages,"Hi all, I have a GitHub Pages site that I use for my portfolio and I'm working on expanding some of the functionality to support an online scorecard for a hobby league I'm part of. For context, the group paints Warhammer miniatures and submits a completion log to earn points based on certain submission criteria.

Thus far, this project is a fairly small repo (1.4mb because it has the entire Tabulator JS package in it) and I would like to keep it that way. However, I want to introduce an image gallery to the site and there are currently 45-50 images of varying sizes (not in the repo yet). I also expect that count to grow, especially after this site is released because I suspect participation will increase when users can see their submissions online alongside their friends'.

I know that hosting images on Github is bad practice, especially if those images change or change names over time, so I'd like to avoid doing so. Are there any recommended approaches to image hosting for a project like this?

Since this site is hosted freely on GitHub and I'm only paying for my domain, I'd like to keep it free *if* *possible*. I've seen CloudFlare suggested so that's first on my list to explore, but I'm curious if others have thoughts on image hosting for any similar smallish projects.

webdev,Trying to figure out how to better avoid this client situation,"**TL;DR: When to know when to cut your losses on a new ricocheting client?**

Someone I knew tangentially from a business transaction was struggling to make ends meet with her new business, so I offered to help with my skills and interests, some of which I was learning.

Things were progressing nicely, though she struggled understanding some necessary things with marketing and management. I can't call myself a pro with those things but I knew enough tangentially to make things work. I offered the services free to a certain point because I wanted the project on my portfolio and we got along well.

However, when it came down to images, I mentioned that I'm not a designer. She didn't like that answer, and said the previous team (which she said she couldn't afford) did that. I offered to do the free parts and they could send me the images. She didn't want separate entities working on the project. I later learned they also wrote all of the content, and a lot of it looked AI-generated. I generally don't write content, though AI makes things easier, which she at least understood.

Maybe this is the point where I should have cut ties: she said she has no money to spend, but insisted on a professional designer. Since I saw her just pay for something necessary for business management (not a big expense), I couldn't tell if she was being hyperbolic or not. I said, look, I don't know everything, but I'm offering you free marketing recommended by the hosting platform that the pros you paid didn't try. She kept going back and forth, eventually left on a ""let me talk to the other team"" note, and I figured why not see if I could just make the free marketing work.

webdev,About React,"hey chat

please help me understand. i've been programming for a long time and I started with web dev, for any project I always used vanilla JS, and in the past maybe something like bootstrap. But today React is absolutely everywhere. I can't find a single modern UI library that isn't dependent on it in some way. Every web project guide involves NextJS or React in some way, it's everywhere. Does nobody teach vanilla anymore? When did this shift happen?

I'm not a hater but I'm so surprised that I can't find much discussion on it.

Awhile ago I participated in a hackathon, and the winning project was a single-page react app that displayed a number pulled from a rest api. The fact that the app needed to be built and bundled, before deploying on an overcomplicated cloud saas platform, was crazy to me. That app would need 10 lines of JS max! I don't understand the react-ification of everything and I rarely see discussion on it. I'm sure it's great for apps that need a component library to function, but I don't see why it's absolutely everywhere. Is it like the modern jQuery? Everywhere for a few years and suddenly gone?

webdev,Building Side-Projects &amp; Navigating ‚ÄòPerfectionism‚Äô,"TLDR: Unable to build projects as I have imposter syndrome and worry too much about perfecting the code.

I‚Äôll start with the caveat that I know perfectionism and web dev don‚Äôt mix well, however hoping to explain the d conundrum I‚Äôm facing.

For context, I‚Äôm about 1.5 years into web development, mainly frontend. Stack is JS, Next and I‚Äôve used a few CSS libraries such as MUI. I am currently working in a startup and due to start transitioning more to ‚Äòfull stack‚Äô with more exposure to the backend.

I have never built a portfolio per se and was able to get the role by passing the tech tests and soft skills that were needed at the time (career changer, product management experience). The main reason why I never built a portfolio is because of the huge imposter syndrome and navigating the ‚Äòperfectionism‚Äô of trying to build something that‚Äôs production-level worthy.

By production-level worthy, I mean that building a codebase that could easily be used at enterprise level. I halt at this process because when I start building something, I worry about how the code looks or the patterns I‚Äôve used or even the way the codebase is organised. From a code perspective, I worry about how clean the code is and how optimised it is (more for readability, less spaghetti). This ‚Äòimposter syndrome‚Äô has kept me in tutorial hell and I can‚Äôt seem to move forward. I think the one major issue is that I think just following a full tutorial blindly and copy+paste means I‚Äôve not actually learned how to build something myself, but rather code monkey my solution. So, I try to build something from absolute scratch i.e read docs, read other codebases etc. but then when I get to a point that I know my solution is ‚Äòhacky‚Äô, I stop completely and convince myself I‚Äôm not ready enough.

Yes, I know sometimes a solution is needed no matter how it works as I‚Äôve experienced that at work. Many a times myself and my senior devs will put something together as quick as possible and just make it work to get a ticket across the line. Our codebase is far from perfect.

Not sure how to get myself from this rut and would really appreciate some advice. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking here but would love to hear what you guys have done to get out of tutorial hell and just start hacking away enough that you improved every project.

Have you guys tested the impact of using `rem` layouts these days? It really doesn't have many cases where it matters. I tested the following scenarios:

* Browser zoom (Ctrl + scroll)
* OS interface zoom
* Microsoft Edge font-size configuration

Edge's font-size configuration was the only test where `rem` scaled. The final question is: do the small percentage of users who need accessibility tools use font-size configuration or simply interface zoom? If interface zoom doesn't trigger `rem` scaling, is there any point in using it?

Ok, ok, I lied. There's one more question: should I use `rem` only for fonts or for spacing as well?

webdev,Recommendations for a framework/architecture for an embedded application with maps and video,"I need some help with a web application stack/framework. The application is an autonomous ship, similar to a drone. The ship is the server and the application is the client. There may be multiple clients connected to the ship/server (probably fewer than a dozen clients per server). 

The ship/server will send GPS truth coordinates, weather data, and multiple video feeds. The client(s) will need to display all this data and have the ability to create routes for the ship, then upload those routes to the ship/server. The client needs to be extremely responsive (30 FPS, no lag kind of deal).

The client and server communicate over a closed network which may or may not have Internet access. Because of that and speed, I assume we must store the maps (nautical charts) locally to the client. The application/client hardware will likely be a commodity laptop, but may be as low-end as a Raspberry Pi for a remote control station (still a client). 

We're currently using websockets on the server side and the client uses pyside2 via Python. The existing application is very much an engineering GUI. We need to hire someone with real UI/UX experience and embedded web experience so that we have something more polished to show clients. But of course, I need to know what to write for the job description.

webdev,Need Advice: Integrating Stripe for SaaS Subscriptions with Supabase and Next.js,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm building a SaaS app where users can subscribe to plans that provide monthly credits (e.g., for generating content) and access to specific functionalities. Here‚Äôs the flow I‚Äôm aiming for:

1. Users subscribe to a plan via Stripe.
2. Based on their plan, they receive monthly credits and access to features.
3. Credits reset or roll over (depending on the plan) each month.
4. Users should be able to switch plans seamlessly.

I‚Äôm using **Supabase** for my database and **Next.js** for the front end. My app was built using **Cursor**, so I‚Äôm comfortable coding whatever is needed. However, I‚Äôd love to streamline this to speed up my time to market.

**Main Question:**  
Do I need to manually retrieve payment info for every user from Stripe each time to update the dashboard (e.g., plan details, payment status, etc.), or is there an easier integration method?

**What I‚Äôve Considered:**

* Using Stripe‚Äôs **webhooks** for real-time updates.
* Storing subscription and plan info in Supabase and syncing it with Stripe as needed.
* Some libraries for Next.js (e.g., `stripe-node`), but not sure how well they integrate with Supabase.

Im a mobile developer, though i have some basic idea of html css javascript

I need to create a website soon which will be like a shopify website basically, and will involve custom payment methods involving APIs of payment methods and will include like in shopify a help button either support service on website or an external linkage to whatsapp, and most importantly the website will need the functionality for users to send messages as in data they input for orders to the admin or a team idk. 

i am a self learner and a fast one so creating the website wont be an issue with a bit if guidance and help.
I dont want to use firebase supabase etc as my backend or db cause that would later cost a lot for me. So i need free options for backend and database, nothing which leads to costs later.

Can you all please guide me as to which technologies i should use, and what basic setup and database and everything will be required ? 

I was thinking of django for backend and react for frontend, is my approach reasonable?

TLDR: I miss flash websites. I want custom borders/custom animations that aren't available in WordPress. What's a good alternative similar to flash? (including 'hand-coded')

I am primarily a business student but have designed a few sites using basic htmll/css for class projects. I have a clothing store, and I have used WordPress up to this point to create a basic store and I'm running into this issue where I want to express my brand in the most authentic way, but WordPress has its limitations regardless of theme, lack of custom product borders, animations for opening quick view product pages, background animation etc. I loved the flash sites of the early 2000s when I was a kid and would love to capture that feeling. I've heard great things about Adobe Animate and their export to HTML5 feature, still weighing my options.

If anyone knows any resources to send me to that they can vouch for I would appreciate it. Any advice on what I should learn to do is also appreciated.

webdev,TIL - Why is the terminal called that,"I was listening to lecture on linux -this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gojeTqXdBH0), but it's in Arabic- and the lecturer talked about the first time the terminal was used, which was interesting and worth sharing, so I asked Claude to talk about the point he mentioned in more details so I can share it here:

The term ""terminal"" in computing comes from its literal meaning as an ""endpoint,"" rooted in the Latin ""terminus"" (meaning boundary or end). In early computing, terminals were physical endpoints - devices with just a screen and keyboard that connected to massive mainframe computers. Unlike other input methods like punch cards (which were more like dropping off mail and waiting), terminals were special because they were interactive endpoints where users could have real-time, two-way conversations with the computer.

Picture a mainframe computer in a room with cables running out to multiple terminals - each terminal was literally at the ""end"" of a connection, where the computer system met the human user. When you typed on your terminal, your input would travel up to the mainframe, get processed, and the results would immediately come back to your screen. This was revolutionary compared to punch cards, which required you to submit your entire program at once and wait hours or days for results.

Today's ""terminal"" or command-line interface isn't a physical device anymore, but we keep the name because it serves the same purpose: it's your direct, interactive conversation point with the computer, where you can type commands and get immediate responses. Modern terminals are actually programs (like Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows) that simulate those old physical terminals, carrying on that legacy of being the ""endpoint"" where human and computer meet for direct communication.",Mohammed_MAn,1gzhqp7,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gzhqp7/til_why_is_the_terminal_called_that/,2024-11-25 12:30:35,0,0.42,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gzhqp7

I work for an education federation. Most of our updates end up on our Instagram, so I thought it'd make sense to mount that on our federation website instead of reuploading everything manually. 

I've found a couple of decent widgets that display the Instagram's main content tiles, but I'd like to somehow implement the story highlights separately. We have different story highlights for certain areas of the federation - ""Enrichment"", ""Early Years"", ""Training"" etc - where content gets grouped. I'd like similar buttons to appear on our website so that when they're pressed, people can easily look through the images without being redirected to Instagram itself. 

I've tried a widget by SociableKIT, and it was nearly what we needed, but it didn't pull through the titles, on the circular buttons. 

Any thoughts about how this could be achieved?

webdev,How to deal as a developer with large-ish json files embedded inside of an angular app?,"Context:

I have to maintain an angular 16 application, it is purely front-end.

The application has several large configuration files acting more like tables in a database which it gets it's data from.

Each file has an array of aprox 50 objects, which might not seem much but every object is very embedded with objects within objects within objects.

***I cannot change this, I tried asking, I tried offering other solutions (keep data on server in mongo or sql or etc and the FE app gets it via calls) it's not happening. The files are here to stay.***

A large part of my tasks ends up with me doing changes in these files by hand.

I know it doesn't sound like much but we're talking about large embedded objects without schemas, sometimes I need to only edit one sometimes I need to basically do a manual query to see some field from everything, sometimes I need to change in just 3 out of 50 objects.

My point is the work is very error prone because it's by hand and by me reading the files again and again to understand them.

***I cannot change this structure.***

As a developer what tools can I use to view/edit/manipulate these large json files in a sensible manner?

I am using VS Code as my code editor and my OS is Linux.

webdev,Do I need to use a context provider if I'm storing JWTs in a cookie anyway?,"I'm trying to implement JWT for my react/node.js app, but there are some parts that I'm confused about.

From my understanding: Client makes request to the backend -&gt; backend generates a token -&gt; sends it to the frontend -&gt; frontend stores the token on the client side(eg. cookie) so that you don't need to make a request to the server every time you want to access content.

However, I see people using React context providers to handle authentication as well.

Isn't the point of a context provider to pass down information down to children components, in this case, the authentication status?

Or are you meant to store the JWT token itself in the cookie, and use the context state to store information like ""{userAuth: true, favoriteColor: blue}""? But in that case, wouldn't all that info be lost anyways if the user reloads the page or something?",bae-va,1gy91xg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gy91xg/do_i_need_to_use_a_context_provider_if_im_storing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gy91xg/do_i_need_to_use_a_context_provider_if_im_storing/,2024-11-23 20:30:14,2,0.76,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gy91xg

Here Drizzle comes in. They stated that Drizzle is still not compatible with MariaDB: [Drizzle ORM - v1 Roadmap](https://orm.drizzle.team/roadmap).

* Global leaderboard for competitive motivation (completely optional and you can ""opt-in"" and ""opt-out"" anytime). Privacy is respected.
* Google OAuth integration
* Cross-device synchronization (Data persists across devices)
* Guest users (data saves to local storage) and authenticated users (allows data sync)

# How are you awarded points?

Although at the base level, you get to decide the difficulty level and importance level of tasks, XP is also awarded by things like completing a task earlier than a set deadline, and how many days earlier you completed it. If a task is past the deadline, then there is an overdue penalty applied to your total points as well.

webdev,Failed Web App (Can you share some thoughts on this or the AIGC/webapp markets?),"My Background:

My full-time job has been mainly a product designer, and I didn't program much, but I wanted to make a webapp by myself.

I thought about what product I could make myself, or with minimum paid help, and given my limited programming speed, I made a website: fanserviceai.com, which could generate images of specific anime characters etc.

The Market:

At the time, the AIGC market was already very saturated with the likes of Midjourney and many AI porn generators. However, few touches IP characters, - like none of them could generate Sakura Haruno well for example as the platforms avoid doing it. None of the debit card payment processors deal with such content either - thus for this website, I had to connect a crypto payment processor to the page, and thought that maybe there's a small, niche, grey market.

The Webiste:

Fanservice AI is a website that could generate anime characters, like the one piece, or naruto's characters etc closely resembling the original drawings. I thought that, as some generic AI porn generators could have subscribers, a generator that could generate specific characters would probably be better, and I made this MVP (searchable on Google) and tried to test it out with people. But that assumption was wrong, I posted on social media and then, nothing happens.

Question:

What are your thoughts about maybe side projects in general or like this? About the webapp market? About making money developing actually profitable websites or apps in the current era? I think I might be in the wrong career path and I don't know how I could make enough more money atm.",vistql,1gxy5h9,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gxy5h9/failed_web_app_can_you_share_some_thoughts_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gxy5h9/failed_web_app_can_you_share_some_thoughts_on/,2024-11-23 12:03:41,1,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1gxy5h9

webdev,Need Advice: Working with a Freelancer on WordPress + BricksBuilder,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm working on building my website and could really use some advice from people who‚Äôve been in a similar situation. Here‚Äôs a bit of background:

* I‚Äôve designed the site myself in Figma and provided the freelancer with all the on-page SEO details (like meta tags, alt text, and header structures).
* While I do have some experience with HTML and CSS, I‚Äôve hired a freelancer to help with the development side because of personal time constraints.
* We‚Äôve agreed to test and audit the site using tools like SEMrush, Google Search Console, and Google Analytics to make sure everything is running smoothly.

The website is being built on WordPress using **BricksBuilder**. The freelancer has a lifetime unlimited license for Bricks and plans to use it during development. My hosting is set up with SiteGround, and I‚Äôve already got WordPress installed.

Here‚Äôs where I could use some advice:

1. **WordPress Access:** What‚Äôs the best way to give the freelancer access to my WordPress account? Should I make them an admin temporarily, or is there a more secure way to handle this?
2. **BricksBuilder License:** Since the freelancer has their own lifetime license for Bricks, I‚Äôm wondering how that works in terms of ownership. Can their license be transferred to my site after the project is done, or would it be better for me to buy my own Bricks license to ensure I have full control in the future (especially if I lose contact with them)?
3. **General Tips:** Are there any other precautions I should take or things I should keep in mind with regards to the above or any further advice you have? thanks.

webdev,I reported a small bug with the Stripe dashboard UI. They fixed it within 4 days. This is how you earn loyalty from developers.,"Not much else to say. I had a situation where I had a bunch of funds held in a rolling reserve because I was a new customer doing fairly large volumes. A few months ago, they lifted the reserve, but this introduced a small bug in their Dashboard UI in which funds previously held were being added to the total balance twice, once as ""held in reserve"" and once as ""upcoming payouts"". 

This was not an issue, it was very easy to see what the real total balance was, but I figured I'd report it anyway.  After convincing the customer service team that it was a real bug, it was fixed within 3 days. 

Mad respect. Wish I would've switched to Stripe sooner. I know they get a lot of praise from developers, just figured I'd add one more kudos into the mix.

webdev,can someone explain how webpack updates url's in single page routing?,"if someone could point me in the right direction in the docs, i am working on a small site the utliizes client side routing with vanilla js and webpack. the navigation works in the sense that when users click on anchor tags it directs them to the 'page' they are looking for. however none of this changes the url, and if i try and type in localhost:9999/someotherpage it doesnt navigate to the path. which i know it wont because there is no history api functions being called, but where/how to connect the function call from the event listener on click is what i am struggling to find an answer for.

looking in the webpack docs its not clear to me how to implement that basic functionality so i dont know what i dont know that i am missing if someone could be kind enough to point me in the right direction. thx

webdev,How should I go about making a static site that may need to be upgraded to a Shopify site later? ,"Hi everyone. Relative beginner here. I've been learning CS and webdev parttime on my own for about 2.5 years. I've gotten pretty decent at making fullstack hobby-type projects (see my post history to check out my copyediting with AI project). And I've been updating a couple of WordPress sites for friends.

One of these WordPress sites is for a small indy publisher. When I started working on it, it was really bad. Like, it looked like a blog from 2008. So I've just been updating the template and posts, and creating a few custom pages. We're looking to rebuild it from the ground up, and maybe toward the end of next year be selling books through Shopify. But for now it's just a site that showcases the books and authors. No reviews or shopping cart, etc. Everything just links straight to Amazon if people want to buy a title.

How should I go about rebuilding? (I don't want to go deep into WordPress. I want to learn modern frameworks.) I could pretty easily build something in Django, just using Django templates and a lot of CSS, and I think that would be fine. But say we wanted to eventually move to Shopify, how much of a headache am I in for? Would any of it be portable?

I could also build the static site as a single page application in React, and just use Django to serve up data...not sure if that makes sense. Like I said, I am still n00b. 

I am doing this for free, to build a portfolio, to learn, and because I really want to help the business succeed. Timeline is not much of an issue, but generally hoping I can get the static site done in three months.

Any tips would be appreciated.

    &lt;/form&gt;
    

In my application, I have a button that calls ""logoutUser""

    protected logoutUser() {
       this.http.post('/foo/logout', {}).subscribe ({
         next: () =&gt; {
            location.reload(); //reloads the page after the post call invalidates the session
         }});}
    

the Java backend i have:

     u/jakarta.ws.rs.POST
      @operation(responses = {@ApiResponse(responseCode=""200"", content=@Content(schema = 
      @Schema(implementation = Void.class))),})
      public Response signout(@Context final HttpServletRequest request, @Context final

              return Response.ok().build();
          }
      }
    

I can login and logout and log back in FINE. However, if I do the following: 1. Login 2. logout 3. wait \~5 mins 4. login 5.¬†I receive 408 on my POST to .../j\_security\_check which is a Request Timeout.

I notice that when I login, i have 2 cookies - JSESSIONIDSSO and JSESSIONID. the JSESSIONIDSSO is set to ""REMOVE"" when I logout. I also noticed that the console has a warning that cookie ""JSESSIONIDSSO"" has been rejected because it is already expired. However, if I login within the 5 minutes or so, i still can.

From the login action, i see a POST (return 303) j\_security\_check where it sends JSESSIONID cookie and the response has the cookies JESSIONID and JSESSIONIDSSO

If I logout and the page refreshes, I see a GET on my current login page and I see the Response with set-cookie on JSESSIONIDSSO=REMOVE, Expires =Thu,01 jan 1970... and JSESSIONID = 123531....

I want the ""path of least resistance"" to get the login to work. If I can refresh cookie or clear cookie/cache when I logout that would be great. or if I can fix in backend that be great too. I think for now I just need to be able to 1. login. 2.logout. 3. after periods of time 4. login success.

Any ideas that could help? thanks

So I've ended with all the prehistoric or non-FOSS alternatives to WP, which happen to be a ton, but not amazing.

Generally, as a red flag, if they have a main website, which is a .com then it's a bad idea

They could be FOSS, but if they are selling straight their  CLOUD services on their homepage, bad idea also

I always thought that even that the wordpress . com (the for-profit option) was a terrible idea, but at least was a different domain to the .org version.

In an ideal world, something by the community, for the community. The idea is not only to consume it, but to contribute.

Just started working at a company that uses Github actions. They also have an odd/dangerous workflow (I believe they did this for speed purposes. But now, we want to change it).

So, How are YOU using your github actions for deployments? Any examples?

CURRENT JOB (bad flow, imho):  
Branch --&gt; PR Review  
\--&gt; Github Action --&gt; Into DEV  
\--&gt; Github Action --&gt; nightly build DEV INTO QA  
\--&gt; Manual Github Action --&gt; Dev into Production

This flow creates an issue in which code is in DEV that has not been verified by QA yet, but STILL can be released to Prod. We want to change this.

SO, How do you set up your Github actions to create a better flow? Any examples.  
Do you go from:  
Task Branch --&gt; QA --&gt; verified --&gt; DEV --&gt; STAGING --&gt; smoke tested --&gt; PRODUCTION

webdev,My Restaurant's Website Has Been Hacked,"I've been tasked with building a website for my restaurant. I have some knowledge in web development but mostly I've just been learning as I go. The website is coming along nicely but recently I've been having issues with the DNS records being changed or deleted which resulted in us losing access to our email for a day because a txt dns record was somehow deleted, and then also the website went down for a few hours because of a missing ""A"" record I was using to redirect the website because it was originally hosted through GoDaddy, and am now using BlueHost.

Today I decided to use virustotal to scan my website for any malware, and this popped up.

I contacted Bluehost and they confirmed that the website was hacked and has malware. They're suggesting that I pay the $300+ to SiteLock to come in and manually remove and close any backdoors these hackers might have created. The person I spoke with did seem genuine enough, but I'm also under the assumption that they receive compensation for selling these sorts of packages to customers. Is this necessary? I signed up for the basic plan of SiteLock for free scans and hopefully free malware removal to get us through the weekend while I continue to monitor the situation.

Also, is this my fault? Was it because of my inexperience as a Web Developer that maybe they got in through some poorly written javascript code that I included on the website? I don't thinkthey got in through the login credentials as I have two step authentication and a really strong password.

webdev,"We need to talk about your ""$25/hr is a scam"" comments","So there was that blockchain scam post where everyone was shocked about $25/hour, calling it ""criminally underpaid"" and ""definitely a scam"".

Let me drop some reality bombs about dev salaries in my part of the world:

I'm from Russia, and here's what our market ACTUALLY looks like:

Junior devs: $5-10/hour (yes, really)

Mid-level: $10-20/hour

Senior (10+ years, full-stack absolute wizards): up to $30/hour

And get this - Russia is actually on the HIGHER end for our region. In other CIS countries (Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, etc.), rates can be even lower. Southeast Asia? Even worse (except for tech hubs like Singapore/HK/SK where they're closer to Western rates, but still not quite there).

The absolute ceiling here? About $5K/month. That's it. That's the endgame. YOU CAN'T GO ANY HIGHER. And I'm not talking about some random WordPress shops - I mean legitimate tech companies doing serious development work (like Russian Google and stuff...)

Getting jobs abroad? Good luck with that visa lottery! I'm a digital nomad, bouncing between countries every month, and let me tell you - work permits are like unicorns for most of us. So many of us end up working ""unofficially"" for foreign companies, getting paid in crypto (goodbye benefits, insurance, and ""stability"" üëã) for $25/h.

You know what's wild? I regularly work with incredible developers from India and other regions who are in the same boat. What you guys call ""suspiciously low pay"" would be DREAM salaries for many of us.

European/US companies hire exceptional talent from our regions at $25/hour in crypto (which would be amazing money for us), charge clients $80-100/hour, and everyone would be happy! (And of course on paper you do everything by yourself)

Not trying to start drama here, just wanted to give you all some perspective on the global dev market. That ""$25/hour scam"" you're talking about? Sign me up! üòÖ

So what do you think about this reality? I'm curious to hear your thoughts.



Edit: Seeing lots of comments about ""$40-100/hr Ukrainian/Russian developers"" - I need to be crystal clear here. These aren't just rare cases - we're talking about 0.000001% unicorns who hit an incredible lottery.

Here's what I noted in the review:

\- Windsurf edged out better with a medium to big codebase - it understood the context better  
\- Cursor Tab is still better than Supercomplete, but the feature didn't play an extremely big role in adding new features, just in refactoring  
\- I saw some Windsurf bugs, so it needs some polishing  
\- I saw some Cursor prompt flaws, where it removed code and put placeholders - too much reliance on the LLM and not enough sanity checks. Many people noticed this and it should be fixed since we are paying for it (were)  
\- Windsurf produced a more professional product

Miscellaneous:  
\- I'm temporarily moving to Windsurf but I'll be keeping an eye on both for updates  
\- I think we all agree that they both won't be able to sustain the $20 (Cursor) and $10 (Windsurf) p/m pricing as that's too cheap  
\- Aider, Cline and other API-based AI coders are great, but are too expensive for medium to large codebases

webdev, Chrome extension and WordPress migration,"How can I achieve the following goals for my Chrome extension and WordPress migration?

I am currently developing a Chrome extension but am unsure how to migrate login and payment systems already set up on my WordPress site. Here's my current setup and what I want to achieve:

1. Current Setup:

On my WordPress site, I‚Äôve implemented a login and monthly subscription payment system using LemonSqueezy, which works seamlessly.

Users can sign up and manage their subscriptions directly on the WordPress site.



2. Goals:

A) Allow users to sign up and pay via my WordPress site, similar to how services like Grammarly direct users to their website for account creation and payments.

B) Enable the Chrome extension to verify payment status through the LemonSqueezy API. If the user is verified as having an active subscription, the extension should grant access to its features.



3. Experience and Challenges:

I‚Äôm relatively new to web development.

I‚Äôve dabbled with React and have basic experience using Stripe, LemonSqueezy, and Firebase.

I‚Äôve come across Next.js during research and understand it can handle server-side functionality, but I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs the right tool for this project.

My primary challenges are:

Integrating the Chrome extension with the LemonSqueezy API for payment verification.

Creating a seamless flow between WordPress and the Chrome extension.




4. Questions:

What tools, frameworks, or software should I use to implement this system?

Should I consider migrating away from WordPress to something like Next.js for better flexibility and integration with the Chrome extension?

What specific areas of web development should I focus on studying over the next few months to achieve this goal?

My newest site is Remix with a Supabase backend. It's my first time making a very frontend heavy tool app and it's like the lines have been completely blurred by this paradigm. I've made another big site in nextjs and Strapi, but this Remix experience is completely different. Loaders and actions and then a Supabase library and that's it. I have put maybe six hours into the backend and maybe 300 into the frontend.


Is this common nowadays? Like not even having endpoints? All just flowing from the frontend into the backend of the UI, and then libraries to take care of database interactions? Or is it just because my backend needs are so minimal and my product idea could legitimately exist as solely a frontend tool with zero backend if I removed login and all storage.

webdev,Does such a testing tool/strategy test? Probabilistic testing. ,"In my experience, in the context of web development, we're either doing some kind of unit test/component test, where we'll mock our API interactions with a tool like MSW, or there's e2e tests where you'll deploy some kind of real application and run it cypress/playwright tests against it. 

The problem that these strategies run into is that: 

1. Defining API mocks particularly becomes quite cumbersome, particularly for things CRUD like operations where you create a todo, now refresh the page and expect to see the new todo there. We end up having to reimplement our API in our tests. 

2. For e2e style tests, we either deal with an unreliable system, or a _too_ reliable system, that isn't going to be testing our error cases, or our tests are brittle and break when the data on the system changes. 

What both of these styles of test have in common that they make an assumption that 'when I go to this page, the application is going to be in this state'. 

What I'm wondering is if there's a style of test that is: 

- Go to X page. 
- These are the possible options: 
   - I see an error. 
   - I see a log in screen. 
   - I see products [A, B, C]
   - I see products [D, E, F] 

Now for each of these paths write test behaviour. 

We end up writing a tree of possibilities.

Then to run the test, we can either run this against a real deployment and our tests can navigate it fine. Or there's some kind of mocking behaviour, that observes the kinds of responses that typically occur and probabilistically returns responses of that type.

Most people vouch for Macs, for the Apple Silicone and whatnot.

webdev,Ecommerce for Print on Demand - a simple setup for an intermediate developer without too many catches?,"I am working on setting up a site for a print-on-demand shop. I am planning to use Printify for the supplier, but am happy to use something else like Printful, etc. if that makes it smoother.

All the suggestions I read, though, are either very complicated, or overly reliant on a specific system. For instance, I was going to go with Shopify, as that is almost always what I see recommended. They terminated my shop while I was still setting it up, with no explanation as to why. As far as I know I am not doing anything that could possibly be against their terms. I tried to dispute it, but the form they provide for this gives an error upon submission. I chatted with someone to see if they could fix this another way, but Shopify seems to be in no rush to help, and now I am hesitant to even rely on them at all.

WooCommerce appears to be the next most popular, but it seems convoluted, and relies on WordPress. I am OK with using WordPress if I HAVE to, but I prefer to work with something more developer-friendly - frameworks like Django or Rails or Laravel. Like, to set up WooCommerce, the standard way is to install it through the WordPress interface. This is not very reproduceable. You can automate some of it with the WordPress CLI, but that seems like a hack. I much prefer having a .env file I can put the configuration in, or at least coding things in a reproduceable way.

Medusa.js looks incredible, but I cannot for the life of me tell how much will ""just work,"" versus how much I will have to write custom code for. I do not mind doing some development to get things working, but I would like the stuff that would be very bad to fail, like order management, billing, etc. to work without having to trust myself to implement it all correctly from scratch. I assume I would use Stripe with this for payment processing, but I am not clear on how many other services I would need to rely on.

Are there any solutions that just kind of work? Shopify was the most hopeful, but they have quickly proven unreliable. WooCommerce would be good if it was not designed for manual setup, but maybe I am wrong and assuming that based on lack of knowledge? Medusa.js is promoted as a replacement for these, but I cannot tell how much more would be required.

I am open to any other options. I just thought that, with Ecommerce being so common, there would be some options besides Shopify that were relatively simple to set up, so I could focus on developing the site itself.

Thank you in advance to anyone who even bothers to read this overly-long post.

  
Edit: I know there are other services, like BigCommerce for instance, but none of them seem to have nearly as much information out there about integrating them with your tools. I get the impression that the Shopify DX is much better than most others, but would like to be told otherwise.

The full application is dockerized and hosted on Raspberry Pi.

# React Frontend Features:

* **Start Timer Button**: Begins data collection for an experiment. Triggers backend API endpoint, which starts storing data in a buffer array.
* **End Timer Button**: Stops data collection. Triggers the backend API endpoint which stops storing the data in the buffer and returns that to the frontend.

# Requirements:

1. Only one user at a time.
2. Only one experiment at a time.
3. Only one timer should be active on the server.
4. Delay for the data to show on frontend is accepted.

# Problems Faced:

* The serial port sometimes disconnects, leading to data loss.
* Socket connections occasionally drop, also resulting in data loss.

# Proposed Solution:

1. Use¬†**TimescaleDB**¬†to store the collected data.
2. Forward the stored data from TimescaleDB to the frontend.

3. User is redirected back to the website thank you page

webdev,What criteria should you use to pick your development stack?,"Question: Pretty much as per the title. I am a self-taught developer trying to validate my approach to an app I have built before I commit further time to it.

Context: I am a self-taught developer trying to build a mobile application. Webdev is a hobby of mine only and I have no professional education or work experience.

I had an idea for a mobile and web application last year, and went out and built a proof of concept app with the following stack:

- Laravel API backend
- Svelte / Sveltekit frontend
- CapacitorJS to turn the front end into a mobile app
- Socketi websockets

I chose Laravel because it's easy, has a big ecosystem and I already had a basic understanding of PHP (it was the only language I knew).

I chose Sveltekit and CapacitorJS because:
- I didn't want to learn two languages for iOS and Android, plus JavaScript as a third for browsers
- Similarly, I thought one code repo would be easier to manage/faster to launch
- Svelte was touted as fast, beginner friendly, easy to learn, and closer to native JavaScript (at least compared to Vue and React)
- My app needs native device functions like camera, QR Code readers, NFC scanning, geolocation, Bluetooth/wifi, and screen recording, all of which CapacitorJS can provide

I now have an MVP app that I've launched to friends and family. It works and I got good feedback and I am going to go on and build version 2 now. Before I do, I want to validate my decision making from the ground up:

1. I am reasonably comfortable that Laravel is fine for my needs, but I've heard that Symfony scales better, even though it takes more work initially. Is it worth rebuilding the backend in Symfony? Should I even consider a whole other backend, like Python or Java?

2. Is Svelte with CapacitorJS the right combination for the frontend mobile app? I am a little concerned that I should be using more native technology for a better UX, even though svelte is working fine so far. As I see it, there are 3 other options for this: 
- Spend the time to learn the native languages and maintain 3 repos (android, iOS, web)
- Rebuild in React / React Native due to its wider support, ecosystem and nativity
- Use something like Flutter or Tauri instead

I'm sort of adopting the principles of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" and ""progress is better than perfection"", but I'm also mindful that working as a single self-taught developer, I may be missing important decision making criteria that even a second year junior FAANG developer would intuitively know to consider.

So with all this additional context I come back to my original question, how do you pick your development stack?

webdev,The Critical Role of Technical Writing in Software Development,"Software development is fast-paced and we tend to be focused on writing efficient code, debugging issues, and optimizing performance. However, there is one essential skill that tends to be overlooked‚Äî**technical writing**. As a full-stack developer at LiwaTec Software Company, I‚Äôve come to recognize that **high-quality documentation** is just as critical to the success of a project as well-written code. Without it, even the best codebase can become difficult to maintain, and collaboration can suffer.

## Why Technical Writing is Crucial for Software Development

1. **Clear Documentation Saves Time and Reduces Frustration** Navigating through poorly documented code can be incredibly frustrating. Clear documentation ensures that anyone working with the code can understand the logic and structure. Well-documented code reduces the time spent on debugging and searching for answers, leading to higher productivity and fewer errors.
2. **Documentation Enhances Collaboration** Good documentation fosters collaboration across teams. Whether you‚Äôre working with front-end or back-end developers, UX/UI designers, or QA testers, **well-structured docs** provide a common understanding of the project. By documenting how components interact, teams can collaborate more effectively and avoid costly misunderstandings.
3. **Writing Docs Helps Improve Code Quality** Writing documentation isn‚Äôt just for others‚Äîit‚Äôs also a tool for improving your own work. When I write documentation for my code, I‚Äôm forced to think critically about how it works, which often leads me to spot inefficiencies or areas for improvement. This process can result in better, cleaner code overall.
4. **Scalability and Maintenance Are Easier with Documentation** As projects grow, so does the complexity of the codebase. **Documentation makes scaling easier** by providing clear guidance on how different parts of the system work. Without it, maintaining and updating code becomes an uphill battle. Well-documented code makes it much easier to add new features, debug issues, or refactor systems as the project evolves.
5. **Technical Debt: Documentation Helps Prevent It** **Technical debt** accumulates when developers rush through tasks without considering long-term consequences. One of the best ways to minimize technical debt is through solid documentation. By keeping your code and documentation aligned, you reduce the risk of introducing bugs and ensure that future updates and improvements are made with a clear understanding of existing systems.

### Best Practices for Writing Effective Technical Documentation

1. **Be Clear and Concise:** Technical documentation should be straightforward and to the point. Avoid using jargon or overly complex sentences. The goal is to make it easy for anyone to understand how the system works.
2. **Provide Real-World Examples:** Examples help readers connect abstract concepts with practical use cases. Whenever possible, include **code samples** and **real-world scenarios** to illustrate your points clearly.
3. **Use Structured Formatting:** Good documentation is easy to navigate. Break up your content with headings, bullet points, and numbered lists to make it skimmable. This will help users quickly find the information they need.
4. **Keep Documentation Up to Date:** Outdated documentation can be more harmful than no documentation at all. Regularly update your docs to reflect code changes, new features, or improvements.
5. **Explain the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù Behind Decisions:** It‚Äôs important not only to explain what the code does but also why certain decisions were made. This provides valuable context that can help others (or your future self) understand the reasoning behind your choices, making it easier to maintain the code later.

## Conclusion:

In fast-moving development environments, technical writing is often seen as secondary to coding. But as I‚Äôve learned, in building LiwaTec Software Company, **solid documentation** is essential for creating scalable, maintainable, and effective software. It empowers teams, improves collaboration, and helps reduce technical debt.

For those looking to dive deeper into the world of technical writing, I‚Äôve written a detailed post on the topic. You can read more about how to improve your documentation skills and make your codebase more manageable at [LiwaTec Software: Technical Writing](https://www.liwatecsoftware.xyz/posts/technical-writing).

CSS is broken.

That's it. I have nothing else to say.

Okay, here a few more thoughts:

Not ""needs improvement"" broken. Not ""could be better"" broken. Fundamentally, irreparably broken.

After fifteen years of building large-scale web apps, I can say this with certainty: CSS is the only technology that actively punishes you for using it correctly. The more you follow its rules, the harder it becomes to maintain.

This is why Tailwind exists.

Tailwind isn't good. It's ugly. Its class names look like keyboard shortcuts. Its utility-first approach offends everyone who cares about clean markup. It violates twenty years of web development best practices.

And yet, it's winning.

Why? Because Tailwind's ugliness is honest. It's right there in your face. CSS hides its ugliness in a thousand stylesheets, waiting to explode when you deploy to production.

Here's what nobody admits: every large CSS codebase is a disaster. I've seen codebases at top tech companies. They all share the same problems:

* Nobody dares to delete old CSS
* New styles are always added, never modified
* !important is everywhere
* Specificity wars everywhere
* File size only grows

The ""clean"" solution is to write better CSS. To enforce strict conventions. To maintain perfect discipline across dozens of developers and thousands of components.

This has never worked. Not once. Not in any large team I've seen in fifteen years.

Tailwind skips the pretense. Instead of promising beauty, it promises predictability. Instead of global styles, it gives you local ones. Instead of cascading problems, it gives you contained ones.

**""But it's just inline styles!""**¬†critics cry.  
No. Inline styles are random. Tailwind styles are systematic. Big difference.

**""But you're repeating yourself!""**  
Wrong. You're just seeing the repetition instead of hiding it in stylesheets.

**""But it's harder to read!""**  
Harder than what? Than the ten CSS files you need to understand how a component is styled?

Here's the truth: in big apps, you don't write Tailwind classes directly. You write components. The ugly class names hide inside those components. What you end up with is more maintainable than any CSS system I've used.

Is Tailwind perfect? Hell no.

* It's too permissive
* Its class names are terrible
* It pushes complexity into markup
* Its learning curve is steep (it still takes me 4-10 seconds to remember the name of line-height and letter-spacing utility class, every time I need it)
* Its constraints are weak

But these flaws are fixable. CSS's flaws are not.

The best argument for Tailwind isn't Tailwind itself. It's what happens when you try to scale CSS. CSS is the only part of modern web development that gets exponentially worse as your project grows.

Every other part of our stack has solved scalability:

* JavaScript has modules
* Databases have sharding and indexing
* Servers have containers

CSS has... hopes and prayers üôè.

Tailwind is a hack. But it's a hack that admits it's a hack. That's more honest than CSS has ever been.

If you're building a small site, use CSS. It'll work fine. But if you're building something big, something that needs to scale, something that multiple teams need to maintain...

Well, you can either have clean code that doesn't work, or ugly code that does.

Choose wisely.

*---*

edit:

A lot of people in comments are comparing apples to oranges. You can't compare the worst Tailwind use case with the best example of SCSS. Here's my approach to comparing them, which I think is more realistic, but still basic:

The buttons

Not tutorial buttons. Not portfolio buttons. The design system buttons.

A single button component needs:

* Text + icons (left/right/both)
* Borders + backgrounds
* 3 sizes √ó 10 colors
* 5 states (hover/active/focus/disabled/loading)
* Every possible combination

That's 300+ variants.

Show me your ""clean"" SCSS solution.

What's that? You'll use mixins? Extends? BEM? Sure. That's what everyone says. Then six months pass, and suddenly you're writing utility classes for margins. For padding. For alignment.

Congratulations. You've just built a worse version of Tailwind.

Here's the test: Find me one production SCSS codebase, with 4+ developers, that is actively developed for over a year, without utility classes. Just one.

The truth? If you think Tailwind is messy, you've never maintained a real design system. You've never had five developers working on the same components. You've never had to update a button library that's used in 200 places.

Both systems end up messy. Tailwind is just honest about it.",Momciloo,1gutstb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gutstb/why_tailwind_doesnt_suck/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gutstb/why_tailwind_doesnt_suck/,2024-11-19 10:03:31,1006,0.77,1006,0,648,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gutstb

webdev,Making multiple websites look like they're operating under one domain,"Hello!

Apologies beforehand if I sound like a simpleton, I'm just a graphic designer/retail guy with a strong knowledge of Shopify, but absolutely nothing in terms of web development... So here's the issue:

\- I have been building one Shopify store under one domain for 12 of our business's locations

\- **Every location is a separate LLC with separate investors (this part is very important)**

\- Having everything under one hood, with all funds going to one Shopify bank account to be dispersed to each location's bank account is becoming a nightmare for our accounting team

\- One solution is to separate each location into its own Shopify account with its ""own"" website, which would alleviate most of accounting's problems and have things much more streamlined

\- **The web development question:** Can I have 12 websites masked/redirected under one domain and make it look like they're all operating under the one main domain? It would need to look like one store with each ""collection"" actually linking to a different website though it still has our parent/ovaerarching brand website displayed in the URL. Though each location is a separate entity, we are attempting to brand all of them as one and it is imperative each location be navigable and look like its operating under the one main brand name's domain.

webdev,Storing a user's profile info during session- best practice,"Hi all, 

I would appreciate some input. I am using next.js 15 and have finished up my auth flow, storing jwt in httpOnly, strict, secure cookies. 

However, I'm wondering what best practice is for storing/caching things like the user's preferred name, a link to their profile picture (presigned url), and other such items. It needs to have quick access but still be secure. I'm thinking about how to approach dynamically rendering their name and image across components without spamming db requests. It's something I've not had to consider before. 

Right now I have it set to using a header, set by my middleware.js, example use in a component:

    import HeaderComponent from '@/ui/HeaderComponent';
    import { getHeaders } from '@/utils/get-metadata';

    export default async function Header() {

      const headerData = await getHeaders();

      return (
        &lt;&gt;
      &lt;HeaderComponent headerData={headerData}/&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
      );
    }


    import { headers } from 'next/headers';


    export async function getHeaders() {
        const headersList = await headers();
        const preferredName = headersList.get('x-preferred-name') || 'User';
        const profilePictureUrl = headersList.get('x-profile-picture-url') || '/public/static/placeholder-profile-pic.png';
        const userId = headersList.get('x-user-id') || 'User';
  
        return {
          preferredName,
          profilePictureUrl,
          userId,
        };
      }

But im encountering random issues with this, sometimes the userId is not in the header properly etc despite middleware always setting it just fine. It just seems really finnicky and unstable.

His profe and friends seem super legit.

Earlier this year I had a similar guy contacted me. He needed help with his NFT marketplace - He wanted to add 3D models support there. So we discussed some features for 2 days, then he sent me a gitlab repo and asked to implement a test feature (to show that I'm capable of). He didn't even asked to commit - just record a video of it working. I checked the repo for any  kind of malware very carefully, and it was clean.
So anyway, I did what he asked for, sent him the video. And that's it. He gone silent. And after a week I noticed that the chat disappeared with all message history.

So i have been working on a full-stack project for a client and i am hosting it on render (for now).
It uses twilio for SMS verification.

QUESTION - how do i manage all the billing for my client, as of now i am using my own account on render and twilio but suppose if the usage increases and there a some extra charges, what do it do?

Possible solution i can think of:
1) Make my client register  an account on render and twilio and give me access to it so i can set it up and let them manage all the payment while i just manage other stuff.

2) I manually track all the charges (with my account) and put all the trust in my client that they won't skedaddle.

3) hope that there is some kind of team collaboration agreement functionality with render and twilio and other services that handouts the billing to my client.

I graduated a bootcamp back in say April or June and as the final project, we had to recreate our portfolio website from the first chapter. I found an awesome color palette online, had a basic idea lined up for what I wanted each page to look like, and went at it. That being said I was happy with it, but I'm not 5 months post graduation and realize the market is still competitive and maybe I should revamp the look of it.

The reason I'm asking is because HTML and CSS are pretty vital skills(at least in my own, mostly self taught from material opinion). I figure I could probably redo my entire portfolio with React and MatUI in no time, asking GPT if I needed help with anything. But it struck me that future employers/clients will see this website. They will be judging it on every aspect(or so I fear as an aspiring Junior Dev). That being said... What do you guys have to say about it?

webdev,How should I structure this in laravel?,"I'm building a site where speaker designers can upload and share their designs, with a focus on technical data management. Looking for suggestions on how to structure this within Laravel, particularly the relationships between designs and components and suggestions on file management and version control systems.

**Speaker Designs**  
Users will be able to create Designs and attach Drivers to them.
Each design needs to store:
- Basic info (title, descriptions, specs)
- Technical arrays (specifications, bill of materials)
- Multiple file types (docs, measurements, drawings)
- Images and rich text content with embedded images

**Drivers (Speaker Components)**
There will be a database of drivers with factory information that users can browse that will also aggregate which designs the driver is used in.
Each driver stores:
- Basic specs (brand, model, type, diameter)
- Technical specs array
- Documentation and datasheets
- Images and rich text content

**Design-Driver Relationship**
When a driver is used in a design, I need to store:
- Implementation data (quantity, frequency range)
- Technical specs specific to this usage
- Multiple measurement files (frequency response, impedance)
- Design-specific documentation

Current approach and progress:
I've moved onto using the DevDojo Wave starter that came out recently after building on breeze for all authentication and stuff for future payment functionality. 

I've created models for both Design and Drivers and a pivot table between the two that also stores an array of specifications, and some other data like descriptions, frequency responses. I have created filament forms which all submit properly to the sqllite database I have using repeaters for the pivot tables. I am working on the browse pages soon but want this system completed beforehand.

I have mad a rudimentary file management system that automatically organizes all the documents in a design but it's full of issues. I want to add the ability to store snapshots as well in a basic version control system for each design.

How would you structure this if any differently? I'm not sure where to really start with the file management system or version control.

webdev,"Started off supporting Chrome, but realized that Safari was 40% of my traffic.... and now pulling my hair out, trying to support both... How do you guys deal with this?","To add insult to injury, I later realized that even ""Chrome"" on iOS devices, pretty much ""acts"" just like Safari - and in some cases, was more problematic - at least for my web-app.

Coming from developing an Android app (which can also lead you down device compatibility rabbit-holes) It's been hellish trying to support the different browsers, on desktop (portrait mode, &amp; landscape mode monitors), Android devices, and iOS devices, on which those same browsers may act differently.

I finally adopted the following approach:

Scrap huge amounts of work, and revert to a previous commit, and make sure that I am getting my initial audience 100% right. That is, my Desktop users, and Android Chrome users.

Of course, I can't neglect 40% of my traffic, so I am heavily considering re-directing those users to an ""iOS version"" of my web-app. Do people even do this? Is this even a thing?

The other option would be countless ""if (isIOS) { //do this instead }"" checks, and that could get ugly...

This is my first serious web-app, and boy... what a rude awakening! üòÖ

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

**EDIT:**

As someone mentioned in the comments, I should probably state the specific issues. So currently, they're related to touch-events / long-presses, and the ability to bring the focus into the textbox on Apple devices automatically (which is apparently a no-go) and any sort of mitigation has given me broken functionality back on Android.

The app in question is at [https://postbaby.org](https://postbaby.org)

**EDIT 2:**

And as someone else mentioned, I should have started off using a modern JS framework...

**EDIT 3:**

Unrelated to my issue: Attached a tiny ""short"" auxiliary screen to my desktop set-up last night, and realized that since this screen was a ""touch-screen"" the following code was obviously declaring my desktop PC a ""touch-screen"" device.

\`function isTouchDevice() { return 'ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints &gt; 0; }\`

The first weird thing is that you can't remove your profile. Trustpilot believes in ""transparency"", haha, but I've never seen a more dodgy and rotten business model ever. In practice this is what happens when you quit, and this is also what forced us to become a paying customer again, bear with me:  
  
Customers with bad experiences will go to Trustpilot to upload their very nuanced and sincere 1 star review. Trustpilot happily accepts these reviews and publish them. We saw that happening and thought, ok let's ask our customers for a review and so we link them to our Trustpilot profile. Suddenly Trustpilot is less eager to accept this behaviour. They were telling us it's illegal to send traffic to our profile without paying Trustpilot. In other words to be able to receive reviews from non-raging customers, you need to pay Trustpilot.

In return the product is really shitty. Paying 500 euro a month to be able to receive a limited amount of reviews, is already very bad and absolutely not helping end-customers. But the worst thing: the ""customer success manager"" that tries to stay in touch with me, telling me all kind of things like ""Hey, you can tag reviews"" and ""did you know we have an API were you can filter reviews by tag?""... Wowzers, you have an API that can return filtered results, amazing! Can you believe it? An API that can return filtered results? And no way, you have widgets? Tell me all about it. They were very happy that we are paying customers again. Kill me now!

We are making a plan to quit asap, and I want to encourage you to do the same. Trustpilot makes the internet only more rotten, and they earn a lot of money on it, can we please stop with this nonsense? Thank you! And thank you for reading my rant.

The difficulty I'm having is that I'll need to make columns or tables for each information bit so I'm trying to plan / brainstorm the DB architecture.

Basically, it turns my laptop into a local server so I can stream my personal media (like anime) over Wi-Fi. No cloud, no uploads‚Äîjust stream directly from my laptop to any device on the same network.

What SOYO does:
+ lets you stream your media collection (anime, movies, whatever) straight from your local drive.
+ Works across your local network on any device.
+ Has a clean and simple UI.

What I used to build it:
+ Next.js for the website.
+ Tailwind CSS to make it look nice.
+ Node.js and file system APIs for all the backend stuff.

Admittedly I'm not 100% familiar with the full implementation start to finish here, but I do know that the client setting a cookie on a domain they own and then passing it to us. ex. their site is ""client.org"" and our site is ""customsite.client.org"".

The cookie the client is passing to us frequently contains a space (and a slash, but I think that's allowed) in the key of one of the key/value pairs. ex:

orgId=1; Bad Key/Problem=2

The F5 doesn't like this:

Cookie not RFC-compliant \[1\]  
userId=1;\[0x20\]Bad\*\*\*\[0x20\]\*\*\*Key/Problem=2

The space in ""Bad Key/Problem"" doesn't adhere to RFC-6265 standards. That's a given. But - the client is unwilling to budge on fixing the cookie; apparently it is used by multiple vendors. The spaces seem to be widely supported by most browsers, but... I'm not a fan of doing something ""just because it works"" or ""just because it's common."" I'm sure it's low risk to add an exception for those spaces, but am I wrong in pushing the client to update their side? Should we just roll over and add the exception? Doesn't give me warm fuzzies.

webdev,How are you planing big projects?,"Hello people,

Im currently on my vacation and wondering, how some of you plan big projects.  
By big projects, i mean like for example internal apps for big coperations, that have complex logic and need an fail-safe deployment.

Im currently using a bunch of diagram tools to plan stuff like UML diagrams, workflows, use cases, etc. Some stuff like use cases and some not deep technical stuff is done for me by team members. But i feel like you have to use an different tool for every diagram you want to make. A tool like [draw.io](http://draw.io) is great for drawing diagrams in general, but there is so many to read from these diagrams that could automatically generate code for you, or better plan stuff ahead.

Wanted some feedback on how you plan your projects and what tool you use. I still have an tool that i made for me some time ago for modeling databases (uses react-flow, pretty neat!), i am thinking about restructuring that into an coding-project-planner.",AdministrationIcy737,1guzhkr,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1guzhkr/how_are_you_planing_big_projects/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1guzhkr/how_are_you_planing_big_projects/,2024-11-19 15:16:55,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1guzhkr

‚Ä¢	Which is the best place to buy a domain to ensure it remains secure and accessible for the long term?

‚Ä¢	How can I make sure I don‚Äôt lose the domain if I forget to renew it?

‚Ä¢	Is domain privacy protection worth it to keep his information secure when he eventually takes ownership?

webdev,What do you guys think about GraphQL?,"I've been working as a fullstack dev at my current job for about 1.5 years now and the stack is Ruby on Rails in API-only mode using GraphQL and NextJS for the SPA frontend that consumes the API.

codegen is set up to allow the generation of types for the frontend which makes working with the API in TypeScript a bit better.

The thing i've realized while working with GraphQL a decent amount is that i'm actually very mixed on it, i understand that it allows a lot of flexibility without necessarily having a lot of communication back and forth between teams, but it seems needlessly complex to me a lot of the time.

The way we use it where i work is by heavily using fragments so components can request the data they need by exporting a fragment and then a query higher up in the component tree can fetch data with the correct types and be fed in through props. in theory this is a utopia where everything just works and every piece of data is just perfectly typed and you barely have to think about it, but in reality this is not the case at all.

There's a generic helper type that sometimes works to properly get the type you want, but there's also a runtime function to convert the types and it's not clear which one to use a lot of the time which makes the DX feel kinda terrible. This may just be due to the way our codegen is configured, because when it ""just works"" it's pretty nice, that just rarely happens.

sometimes i find myself missing the simplicity of REST if i'm being honest.

I also find it way too easy to introduce security bugs in the form of data leaks especially if you're reusing a type that someone else made, that have no comments about containing fields that are not supposed to be available to most users due to company secrets or security concerns for example.

anyway, didn't mean to make such a long rant but i'd love to hear the general thoughts the community has on GraphQL, i do like it for the most part, but i find it too complex in a lot of cases as well as having some pitfalls such as the security aspect. I also just don't really like the DX with codegen, but i suspect that may be a problem more related to how it's configured (at least i hope this is not the intended experience)",MrMeatballGuy,1gugn0h,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gugn0h/what_do_you_guys_think_about_graphql/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1gugn0h/what_do_you_guys_think_about_graphql/,2024-11-18 21:51:10,10,0.7,10,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gugn0h
webdev,Why is &lt;span&gt; breaking my line? ,"Hi all, 

Super entry-level question, I'm afraid. 

I want to apply a different style to the numbers at the end of my heading. 

It looked fine before, but then I applied a span class to the computed number and it's now breaking onto a new line, despite the &lt;br&gt; coming afterwards. I anticipate it's something to do with the flex attributes applied to the containers and elements. 

&lt;div class = ""main""&gt;

&lt;div class=""heading""&gt;

&lt;h1 class=""title""&gt;Our Year at Halcyon&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1 class=""title""&gt;School trips experienced: **&lt;span class = ""data""&gt;&lt;script type = ""text/javascript""&gt;document.write(Math.round(differenceInDays / 7))&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;**

&lt;h1 class=""title""&gt;Live radio shows broadcast: &lt;script type = ""text/javascript""&gt;document.write(differenceInDays)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1 class=""title""&gt;Research-led lessons taught: &lt;script type = ""text/javascript""&gt;document.write(differenceInDays \* 84)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

The second two numbers are appearing inline as intended. The 11 has successfully had a style applied but is now line breaking, and I'm not sure why.

maybe someone knwos an answer. unfortunately i cant share the site or code but maybe someone has a hint in the right direction..

I have a site with a search field to search the site.  
the search field is a form with some attributes etc.

When i type something, i request suggestions which are shown below the search field.  
But sometimes when im typing really fast and press enter, i jump into the Raw Json preview instead of the search result page.

Heres an image where it goes

This behavior only occurs on my live system. dev system and every preview, this error cant be replicated.

I also added a lot of conditions and tried abort signals etc. Also i changed from submitting the form to directly change the location. This ""reduced"" the amount of this behavior, but didnt fully removed it. 

Im not really sure, what is happening here. Next im trying to remove the form and only work with an input, so i got no form which could be submitted..

I know, without a site or code its nearly impossible to make an answer, but i cant share it..

P.S. im done with stackoverflow, so i dont ask it there...
