Physics,Need Great gift ideas ,"I am trying to buy some presents for my uncle who is a physicist. Heâ€™s got a love for cool sort of gadgets and display objects like Newtons cradle. I was wondering what the best gifts like those would be, can be expensive obviously not too expensive though. Ideally to do with his favourite fields: relativity and quantum mechanics!

A few years ago we held a graduate student panel, where many recently accepted grad students answered questions about the application process.  That [thread is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3i5d4u/graduate_student_panel_fall_2015_1_ask_your/), and has a lot of great information in it.

Physics,"Even if a quantum computer that surpasses a classical computer is never successfully built, what are some useful research that has/will bear fruit along the way? ","This is similar to a previous question on [fusion energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/s/J4Ot4aPgq8), which I'm really curious about the answers for quantum computing too.

I believe there's always some nuance involved in these fields dedicated to building these technologies that're hailed as breakthroughs, it's not all or nothing.

With all this research going into it, there's bound to be at least some useful research done that could benefit other fields right?
