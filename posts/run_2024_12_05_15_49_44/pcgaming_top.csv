Now that the Steam fall sale has ended, I wanted to dump a few keys that are no longer on sale, I'll be giving away

[Remnant 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/REMNANT_II/) + [DLCs](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/remnant-2-dlc-bundle)

[Persona 4 Golden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/)

___

**Rules**: To enter, simply comment below with your favorite kind of soup (I'm cold and its lunch, don't judge) **And which ONE of the THREE games you would like**. One key per person (except for Remnant which includes DLC). NO DUPLICATE POSTS, I will be checking. I will distribute the keys via **Reddit messages** after 24 hours of this post being live. Please know how to access your messages in Reddit, as people love to say I haven't given them the key because they don't know the difference between Reddit messages and Reddit chat. 

Best of luck! This will be my last giveaway for 2024, but I have some additional keys ready for next year. 

Shameless plug: [My small Steam review curator group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Synik_GR), only join if you want to.

EDIT: There are a ton of people not fully reading the rules. If you do not put the title of the game you want in your post, and I end up choosing you, I will now be skipping over you and will choose another.

By the way, you can get several mutations in one run.

pcgaming,[Dev] Xukaackque - An Isometric Roguelite Where You Escape a Spider's Surreal Dreamscape,"# Hello! I'm excited to share Xukaackque, an upcoming isometric roguelite with a unique premise.

# Game Overview

In Xukaackque, you play as a ninja trapped within a spider's dream - a surreal, shifting landscape where each death pulls you deeper into a nightmarish realm. Your goal is to escape through portals, navigating a world that changes with each attempt.

# Key Features

* Isometric roguelite gameplay
* Procedurally generated dream environment
* Experimental music layering system that dynamically adapts to your journey
* Unique narrative concept of escaping a spider's subconscious
* Dash and shoot shuriken that seek out enemies
* Master the shield's slide and bounce abilities
* Abilities that evolve based on depth level

# Current Status

The game is currently ready for release and will be coming very soon to Steam, likely next week. We're just waiting on final store page changes from Steam, but the game itself is complete. I'm looking to build wishlist support to help gauge community interest!

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252270/xukaackque](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252270/xukaackque)

I'll be around to answer any questions about the game's concept and looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

pcgaming,Found this absolut gem today - don't miss out on this classical FF/DQ homage :-),"I'm a huge fan of classic turn-bases RPGs and happily payed/played the FF 2D Pixel R. games.

2 days ago I stumbled upon **8-Bit Adventures 2** (don't let the 2 in the title confuse you, you need no prior knowledge, the game provides you with everything) and I'm having a blast right now. I'd even go so far and say that I vastly prefer this game over most 2D FF games?! Combat is great, NES graphics and sounds are VERY charming and authentic, the writing is witty and the game comes with all of the more modern features that just save time (f.e. no random battles, enemies are visible on the map).

pcgaming,Pathfinder: Wraith of the Righteous Could Be My Next Dragon Age: Origins ,"## Background

Apart from the Mass Effect Trilogy and Fallout games, Dragon Age: Origins is my all-time favorite CRPG-ish title. I could never get that experience again, even with Dragon Age II, or Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Being in my late 30s, and having difficulty finding time to play videogames, I've been pushing myself to play those shorter experiences like Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch, even though I somehow managed to finish the Metro Trilogy recently, and that says something about that series.

But, there's always that itch for an immersive RPG experience.

## My Requirements for The Ideal RPG (across sub-genres)

1. Good story
2. Party-based gameplay (Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Origins have spoilt me)
3. Choices should matter
4. Voice-acted dialogues
5. Shouldn't take an eternity to complete the main quest (adult/parent gamer)
6. Should be able to motivate me to keep playing till the end

Basically, the game should hook me in during my play session so that I return to play it before real life pulls me away until I forget the plot, characters, controls, etc. I've lost interest in several very good games just due to this.

## What Didn't Work (along with reasons)

### Divinity Original Sin

- I could not connect to the story, probably due to being my first Divinity game
- Restricted camera movement felt awkward

### Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2 (Enhanced Editions)

I picked these up after tens (if not hundreds) of positive reviews.

- As much as I liked the original and could appreciate it, I found it hard to push myself past the aged graphics and gameplay style.

### Pillars of Eternity

Amazing story, execution, etc. making it feel like a modern Baldur's Gate

- Too much reading
- No camera movement
- Something was missing!

### Wasteland 3

Was a natural choice given how much I liked Wasteland 2

- Dark plot (darker than I can take)
- Too much gore for my taste
- Visuals were not as good
- Buggy experience
- I messed up a major choice after hours into the game, and didn't feel like continuing or starting over

### Divinity Original Sin 2

- Overwhelming interactions and conversations right during the start of the game
- Felt lost till the time I met all the companions after the intro mission on the ship

### Pathfinder: Kingmaker

An interesting start to the game, and felt well-made

- Too much reading
- Lost interest

### Baldur's Gate 3

Feels like a perfect game, but this one's expensive!

## Evaluating with Steam Deck Recently

I've had a preference for the Steam Controller against keyboard+mouse due to my Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and have recently been trying to move some of my gaming to the Steam Deck. I did not evaluate the above-mentioned games with the Steam Deck except Wasteland 3 which felt unnatural.

### Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire

Seemed very close to what I was looking for

Pros:
- Great gameplay
- Decent scaling on the Steam Deck
- Deep mechanics

Cons:
- No camera movement
- Unclear controls on Steam Deck, had to guess a lot
- Overall, felt more suitable with mouse+keyboard

### Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Seemed exactly what I was looking for!

Pros:
- Love the audio and soundtrack
- Native support for Steam Deck controls
- All controls are ""right there"" and feel natural
- A lot of voice-acting
- Camera rotation!

Cons:
- HowLongToBeat reports the gameplay hours to be way more than what I can afford

## Conclusion

Given my requirements, expectations, and time limitations, mostly around being able to spend enough time and focus on these huge games, it makes this pretty much impossible to find something that works for me.

If at all I could play something from what I mentioned, it may only be one unlike what I see on other posts where people beat these lengthy games multiple times, getting all the achievements, and then moving to other titles.

With that being said, and with all my research and experience, I'm settling with Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous on the Steam Deck until I can afford (or justify spending on) Baldur's Gate 3.

I haven't started a real playthrough yet, but I'm happy to hear your thoughts!",myTerminal_,1h6lv3u,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6lv3u/pathfinder_wraith_of_the_righteous_could_be_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6lv3u/pathfinder_wraith_of_the_righteous_could_be_my/,2024-12-04 17:33:37,0,0.33,0,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6lv3u

pcgaming,How Indiana Jones Proves That Game Engines Don't Matter,"I have been vocal about this topic a few times before, that a game engine inherently does not decide how a game performs, looks or feels to play.

People praise IdTech for being ""Optimized"", Source &amp; Source 2 for how it feels smooth and fluid, but criticise Unreal Engine for how every game that seems to be made with it runs poorly.

Let me try to explain the point one last time, a game engine is just a tool, it's up to you how to use it, and wether it will be used properly is also dependant on your skills, or the time you have, or what type of game you are making, what type of environment a game has, what kind of artistic, narrative or design decisions were made.

Case in point, Doom Eternal, which gets endless praise for running so well, is a fully linear game, with almost no dynamic environment elements, only enemies, projectiles and some objects are movable, this allows the developers to precalculate or ""bake"" all lighting information before hand, reducing computational load.

Although we are yet to see the true nature of Indiana Jones game design, we can already assume that due to certain reasons, the devs realized that baked lighting would not work, thus necessitating some sort of dynamic lighting system, like UE5's Lumen, also using higher res textures and models, making the requirements to run it steep.

To address the point about why Unreal Engine games always turn out poorly optimized, it's simply because it's the most widely used tool, and simply due to that, there will be a higher probability that some devs for whatever reason did not put in the time to make proper decisions and did not properly optimize the game. Batman Arkham Knight is a prime example, as bad as the game ran at launch, it was fixed, and now runs and looks fantastic despite being from the same time as Doom 2016. I can guarantee that if IdTech was used by more developers, we would quickly realize that it's not the silver bullet we thought of.",Danyaal_Majid,1h70dmv,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h70dmv/how_indiana_jones_proves_that_game_engines_dont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h70dmv/how_indiana_jones_proves_that_game_engines_dont/,2024-12-05 04:04:09,0,0.16,0,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h70dmv
