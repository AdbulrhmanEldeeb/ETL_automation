gaming,1v1 tournament,"I want to organize a gaming tournament for friends. I therefore look for games that are 1v1 versus. A match should not be longer than 20 min max. The games need to be local/couch games. Not online. Do you have any tips for this?

Some examples: -mortal combat - Tetris - all ea sports games - Nidhogg - tricky towers - brawhalla

The games are mainly played on PlayStation. Nintendo Switch is possible, but preferably not.

All ideas are welcome.
