books,"I'm sorry, I just finished East of Eden... ","And I have no one to talk to about how much I loved it.   
  
I used to read a lot as a kid and in spurts throughout my adulthood. After about 2 years of starting but never finishing a book I have read 15 in the past year. Mostly really disturbing horror and transgressive stuff with some modern/post modern lit peppered in.

East of Eden's grand scope, memorable and lovable characters(Samuel Hamilton and Lee come to mind) and beautiful descriptions along with Steinbeck tackling some really challenging human topics spoke to me.

books,I love finding rare old books but then it’s so difficult to read that English - Robinson Crusoe 1965 copy,"I found this rare gem 1965 edition, it’s in pretty good condition and was really cheap at 2nd hand shop.

But the page spacing is really not eye friendly, sometimes it doesn’t stop with periods and often don’t use capital letters. And above all the level of English makes it more difficult as it doesn’t feel like “common tongue” anymore. I often think about the meaning of the words more than the actual story.

I don’t want to give up this copy but at the same time I feel like I’m not actually enjoying it like I would with a modern one.",xSypRo,1h75h45,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h75h45/i_love_finding_rare_old_books_but_then_its_so/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h75h45/i_love_finding_rare_old_books_but_then_its_so/,2024-12-05 09:35:42,40,0.74,40,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h75h45

books,Unreliability in Penance by Eliza Clark,"I really enjoyed this book and am continuing to think about it, but I'm realizing there isn't a lot of payoff for the framing narrative/unreliable narrator-- the points where he's being self-serving or antagonistic are usually pretty clear during his first-person sections and the interviews he conducts, and looking for distortions or lies in his invented sections hasn't borne anything for me. It seems like Clark is using him as a justification for the more straightforward prose sections &amp; as a good conduit for the themes (e.g. the reveal at the end that he &gt;!obtained and published the girl's first-hand accounts illegally!&lt;), but that overall his perspective doesn't influence the 'truth' of the story Clark is telling very much. Did anyone get a different conclusion from reading those prose sections more closely, or from the book generally?",udibranch,1h776z5,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h776z5/unreliability_in_penance_by_eliza_clark/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h776z5/unreliability_in_penance_by_eliza_clark/,2024-12-05 11:37:01,4,0.7,4,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h776z5

books,How to finish one book before starting another one?,"I have an issue where I can't seem to finish a book before I start another one. Right now, I have 12 books that I have made various levels of progress in. I am interested in all of them, and want to finish them, but it's going to take a long time because I keep starting new ones. 

I have ADHD, and I feel like I have an issue of craving novelty, and get excited about a new book before I'm done with everything else I'm already reading. I usually only read one or two books a day--one fiction, one nonfiction. Switching it up like that seems to help, but I still struggle a lot to complete any book unless it's short. I probably have about another 10 books that are virtually abandoned because other ones have taken their place. 

How do you keep yourself interested in one book at a time and not open one book after another?
