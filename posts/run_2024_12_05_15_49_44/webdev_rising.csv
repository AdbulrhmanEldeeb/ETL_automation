webdev,5s wait using apache on homebrew  ,"I'm working locally on apache/php/mariadb/a few other things installed via homebrew on a new Macbook Air; most of the times (not every time though) requests return in approximately five seconds (at a minimum of course)  
  
That is, the browser (or whatever is doing the request, cURL, Postman, etc) hangs for a while, and then the request returns with no apparent issues. The request duration is always like five point something seconds. 

I used to have the same stack on a different mac, same problem. Looked around but found nothing conclusive and it's quite annoying. Other servers (like, working in node) don't cause the same issue.

webdev,Learndash and FluentCRM API related issue ,"Hi folks,

I am running a WordPress site hosted on Rapyd Cloud and the site uses LearnDash as the LMS, FluentCRM for managing email engagement, and WP Fusion for advanced syncing. I also use Uncanny Automator and LearnDash Notifications for additional functionality.

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m trying to achieve:

When a student completes a topic in LearnDash, I want to log the completion date in a custom field within FluentCRM for that student.

After 7 or 14 days, I want to check if the student has started the next topic in the course.

If no progress is detected within those two weeks, FluentCRM should trigger an automated email encouraging them to continue.

Iâ€™ve written a PHP function using LearnDashâ€™s hooks and FluentCRMâ€™s API to update the custom field, but itâ€™s not working. The completion date isnâ€™t being stored in FluentCRM, and Iâ€™m unsure if the issue is with the hook, the API call, or something else.

I also reached out to Rapyd Cloudâ€™s support to check if it might be a server-related issue, but they confirmed itâ€™s more of an application-level concern and suggested I check with LearnDash or FluentCRM.

Some questions I have:

Is learndash\_topic\_completed the correct hook for this, or is there a better one to use?

Is there a more reliable way to update FluentCRM custom fields programmatically?

For the follow-up, should I consider using WP Fusionâ€™s tagging features or a cron job for better reliability?

Here are the relevant documentation links Iâ€™ve been looking through:

LearnDash Developer Docs

FluentCRM API Docs

WP Fusion Documentation

If anyone has set up something similar or can point out where I might be going wrong, Iâ€™d really appreciate your help! Let me know if you need more details.

webdev,"Is Keycloak strictly for IdP, or can it be used for simpler applications?","Sorry for another auth question but I've narrowed down to 7 auth providers and I need some advice to move forward. Im building a b2b solution and need to incorporate SSO / SAML in addition to the standard OIDC, 2FA, and passwordless solutions out there:

 &amp;nbsp;

Clerk (the nextjs of auth. pricey)

firebase (not as flashy but cheaper to run)

authJS (seems basic, needs boxyhq for SAML)

passport (old reliable, also lots of DIY which I might fuck up)

 &amp;nbsp;

Then there's these 3 idp providers:

Authentik Zitadel Keycloak

Of the 3 keycloak is the most trusted, but Im not sure whether this is overkill for someone that isn't running multiple apps. Ive seen them mentioned a bunch in r/selfhosted, but I don't need to be a Identity Provider. I just need to be a Service Provider that can tie in with SAML. I also need to incorporate multi-tenancy, but Im not sure whether this is something I should delegate to my auth provider, or code myself.

Furthermore, I see both Zitadel and Authentik offer open source self-hosting, but ultimately they're investor backed, so should I just forget about them and stick with Keycloak?

TIA

webdev,The Rise of AgentWeb,"This is something I have been thinking about recently. Basically the idea how the Web is going to evolve in the future with AI. You can read the whole thing at my post, but just to flag a few things here:

""The web is splitting into two distinct futures: one driven by relentless AI agents, the other shaped by human hands. It fills me with both excitement and sadness - excited by the possibilities of AI-driven efficiency, yet nostalgic for the craftsmanship of a human touch. Let's dive into what this means for the future of web development and ownership.

# The Rise of AgentWeb

The AgentWeb represents the industrialisation of web development, where AI agents autonomously build, maintain, and optimise websites at scale. These digital properties will be born in vast WebFarms (remember Bitcoin farms?) where AI systems handle everything from design decisions to content optimisation and user experience refinement.

For website owners, this means hands-off management with AI handling:

* Complete brand identity creation and evolution
* Content creation and SEO optimisation
* Automated maintenance and security updates
* Real-time performance monitoring and optimisation
* User experience refinement through continuous testing
* Integrated social media presence and content distribution

# The Future Renaissance of ArtisanWeb

On the flip side, we might be witnessing a renaissance of handcrafted websites. Like craft beer versus mass-produced lagers, ArtisanWeb represents the boutique approach to web development. I can imagine content on the web being labeledÂ Handcrafted by a HumanÂ orÂ No AI Was Used in Creating This Content.

The interesting thing is that while handcrafted web will be proud to display these labels, web farms would not do the opposite:Â AI Generated Content. They are likely to try to fake that they are really hand-made content. In the same wayÂ [browsers once faked their identities to gain compatibility](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/?ref=mantcz.com), AI-generated websites might strive to mimic human craftsmanship to gain trustâ€”a new battle for authenticity in the AI driven digital age.""

I am curious to hear what people think.
