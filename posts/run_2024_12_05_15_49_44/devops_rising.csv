We don't need 50 nodes or 50 workers or 20 concurrent tasks. WTAF - is this for real?

devops,Jenkins Workflow Question,"Hi, I am a solo software engineer for a microscopy company. I own a pretty significant number of services and applications, and so far have just been relying on Github Actions to run my unit tests, integration tests, and releases.

I am identifying the need to finally have some kind of CI/CD pipeline. I am familiar with the concept after working at Amazon, but now I need to develop a pipeline myself.

My question is about what kind of workflows are possible in Jenkins. For some context, I have the following:

- A Django API
- An auto-generated Python client  for the API
- A package of Domain Models which are sent to/from the Django API
- A repository package that abstracts the REST API client and makes it simpler to use

These constitute a set of ""core"" services and packages, which all rely on each other to work. It is possible to change one of these packages/services without needing to modify the others, however, sometimes a feature change in one project will require all of the other projects to change.

For example, if I add a ""Food"" table to the Django API, I also need to add a Food class to the domain models, and a FoodRepository, and there will need to be new tests added as well.

Is there a way to design my workflows as a directed acyclic graph where each of my services/packages has a list of repositories that are downstream of it, and so all of those services are tested when a change is made? Many of these programs feed into each other as well, so there is a need for the output of one test to be used as the fixtures of the next test in some cases. For example, if the ""core"" services pass their tests, a script would populate a local database for use with all of the desktop applications that rely on the ""core"" services. Then if I see one of the desktop applications breaks, I know that this feature change requires the desktop app to be updated as well. Let me know if what I am asking for even makes sense.",ShagohodEnjoyer,1h6wpgg,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6wpgg/jenkins_workflow_question/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6wpgg/jenkins_workflow_question/,2024-12-05 01:03:57,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6wpgg

We are security researchers interested in how you use SCA tools. If you are willing to share your experiences with us, we'd be happy to talk to you. We're conducting interviews (\~45min) to understand your experiences.

Ultimately, we really want to understand:

* How you integrate SCA into software pipelines and any challenges that come with that.
* How you interpret the SCA reports and what actions are taken after.
* Challenges you run into with SCA, your opinions, and how you would like to see them be improved
