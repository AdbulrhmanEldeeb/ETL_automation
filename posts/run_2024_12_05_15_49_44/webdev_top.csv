webdev,software developer doesn't know where to start to fix existing wordpress page,"Hello, for context I am frontend developer and have never done anything with wordpress and it's a shame to admit, but I have never hosted any webpage (or maybe I did when I was studying, but can't remember).

My friend told me that his wordpress webpage has issues and is showing some sort of errors when he tries to edit in cms (content management system) and asked me to fix those issues without ruining page SEO (so that google doesn't show it lower in results) and without losing any content that was added through cms, because my friend had previous experience when developer deleted all content that was added before.

I'm not sure where to start... Right now I just asked him for credentials to access cms.

Where should I start? What information do I need from my client (friend)? Is it possible and should I make some sort of backup of the page? Bonus question - can I adjust styling of that page and do some layout changes without ruining content added through cms or messing up current google result position?

I'm looking for a way to create posts on Facebook pages that I am the administrator of, without having to log into Facebook each and every time.  Nothing fancy.  Ideally I'd like to be able to do this with cURL so I can program an interface with whatever has cURL bindings available.

But apparently, I have to create a Facebook app?  And get approval for that app?  Seems like a lot of obstacles to go through just to perform a simple task.

My intention is not to distribute this app or for other users to use.  I simply want to be able to post to pages I administrate without having to log into Facebook each time.

Other APIs I have used usually involve having an ID and a Secret to generate a token - which is then presented within a POST to the API's URL with fields for what content you want to post or do.

webdev,Learndash and FluentCRM API related issue ,"Hi folks,

I am running a WordPress site hosted on Rapyd Cloud and the site uses LearnDash as the LMS, FluentCRM for managing email engagement, and WP Fusion for advanced syncing. I also use Uncanny Automator and LearnDash Notifications for additional functionality.

Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:

When a student completes a topic in LearnDash, I want to log the completion date in a custom field within FluentCRM for that student.

After 7 or 14 days, I want to check if the student has started the next topic in the course.

If no progress is detected within those two weeks, FluentCRM should trigger an automated email encouraging them to continue.

I’ve written a PHP function using LearnDash’s hooks and FluentCRM’s API to update the custom field, but it’s not working. The completion date isn’t being stored in FluentCRM, and I’m unsure if the issue is with the hook, the API call, or something else.

I also reached out to Rapyd Cloud’s support to check if it might be a server-related issue, but they confirmed it’s more of an application-level concern and suggested I check with LearnDash or FluentCRM.

Some questions I have:

Is learndash\_topic\_completed the correct hook for this, or is there a better one to use?

Is there a more reliable way to update FluentCRM custom fields programmatically?

For the follow-up, should I consider using WP Fusion’s tagging features or a cron job for better reliability?

Here are the relevant documentation links I’ve been looking through:

LearnDash Developer Docs

FluentCRM API Docs

WP Fusion Documentation

If anyone has set up something similar or can point out where I might be going wrong, I’d really appreciate your help! Let me know if you need more details.

webdev,Next steps for semi-successful websites (and devs),"I have made a few websites over the years, but have substantially stepped up my skills over the last 12 months or so through uni study.

I currently have a simple game website averaging about 400 users per day and 10,000 views per week. It’s a little puzzle game that resets every 24 hours.

After a couple months of very little interaction it has built up to this point completely organically over a few months, but the growth is slowing.

So what do now? Try and advertise the site? Put google ads on the site and hopefully get $20-30 per week hoping not to alienate the users?

My full time work is currently in audio production and journalism so I am used to building creative things with technology. I think I could make more websites that attract users, but who knows? Making a living wage out of this feels pretty improbable. 

The most complicated website I have made but not put on the internet is a e-commerce site with flask - besides that mostly little games. I consider myself a bit more of a creative than strictly a dev - I can do a lot with a little. Having said that I am studying comp sci post-grad.

webdev,The Rise of AgentWeb,"This is something I have been thinking about recently. Basically the idea how the Web is going to evolve in the future with AI. You can read the whole thing at my post, but just to flag a few things here:

""The web is splitting into two distinct futures: one driven by relentless AI agents, the other shaped by human hands. It fills me with both excitement and sadness - excited by the possibilities of AI-driven efficiency, yet nostalgic for the craftsmanship of a human touch. Let's dive into what this means for the future of web development and ownership.

# The Rise of AgentWeb

The AgentWeb represents the industrialisation of web development, where AI agents autonomously build, maintain, and optimise websites at scale. These digital properties will be born in vast WebFarms (remember Bitcoin farms?) where AI systems handle everything from design decisions to content optimisation and user experience refinement.

For website owners, this means hands-off management with AI handling:

* Complete brand identity creation and evolution
* Content creation and SEO optimisation
* Automated maintenance and security updates
* Real-time performance monitoring and optimisation
* User experience refinement through continuous testing
* Integrated social media presence and content distribution

# The Future Renaissance of ArtisanWeb

On the flip side, we might be witnessing a renaissance of handcrafted websites. Like craft beer versus mass-produced lagers, ArtisanWeb represents the boutique approach to web development. I can imagine content on the web being labeled Handcrafted by a Human or No AI Was Used in Creating This Content.

The interesting thing is that while handcrafted web will be proud to display these labels, web farms would not do the opposite: AI Generated Content. They are likely to try to fake that they are really hand-made content. In the same way [browsers once faked their identities to gain compatibility](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/?ref=mantcz.com), AI-generated websites might strive to mimic human craftsmanship to gain trust—a new battle for authenticity in the AI driven digital age.""

I am curious to hear what people think.

webdev,How to communicate better during meetings? ,"I’m a new developer and an issue I’m facing is being able to clearly communicate the challenges of a task during team meetings. Sometimes clients would make requests to add something new or modify something prebuilt that sounds easy to do in theory but poses a great technical challenge. It could either be something entirely impossible to do or beyond my skillset. I’ve found when I try to communicate the difficulties, I’m being seen as “not having a can do attitude” or “not wanting to do the hard work”. Boss would interrupt me and tell me I just have to figure something out. 

I feel that my job as a developer is to clearly communicate the possibilities of what the client is asking for and/or provide possible solutions. But my boss just wants me to pretty much say yes to whatever and I think it’s because the more time I spend on the project the more he can charge the client. This may mean going away with a task then doing absolutely nothing and saying I’ve tried xyz and it didn’t work whereas this whole bullshit could’ve been avoided in the first place. I’m getting paid so not exactly complaining but this feels exploitative. 

And the other developers although understand the scope of the task, they just agree with the boss and the client to stay on their good side because it’s gonna be me doing the work anyways and not them. Also during calls they would briefly look at my code and confirm with the client exactly what I’ve said which I find disrespectful because I’m the one who wrote the code yet the client is more trusting towards someone who’s not even part of the project. They’re also very quick to make suggestions even though they don’t know anything about the codebase which is annoying asf. 

What are some things I can do?

webdev,First Contentful Pain(t),"**Dear all,**

This is my very first website, written entirely from scratch and optimized from the start. I have two questions:

1. I don’t really understand what the First Contentful Paint (FCP) means, nor how I can improve it, considering the website is built purely with HTML and CSS, without fancy features or heavy images.
2. Based on your experience, do these metrics actually affect crawling, indexing, or ranking of the website?

Thank you in advance!

webdev,Was interviewer being picky?,"I completed a relatively simple task for a Frontend Developer position. One part involved making a single word in a block of HTML bold.

I chose to wrap the word in a &lt;span&gt; tag and assign it a class, applying font-weight via CSS. However, the interviewer pointed out that this wasn’t the best approach and recommended using the &lt;strong&gt; tag for semantic reasons.

I understand their perspective, but aren’t both approaches valid? My reasoning was that if design requirements changed in a real-world scenario (e.g., the bold word needed a different color or style later), it would be easier to manage through CSS without touching the HTML structure.

Was the interviewer being overly picky, or is there a stronger case for using &lt;strong&gt; in this context? I’m open to feedback and willing to admit if I was mistaken.

The app works just as I wanted to and I even managed to prompt it so that GPT-4o does pretty good job with Finnish language. 🇫🇮 There are free and premium tiers, free being more of an demo and premium really making it good.

Anyway, I could not believe the amount of turd some friendly fellow redditors commented about the app when I posted about it in Finnish sub 😄 I don’t actually care about their loud opininos but time will tell whether those opinions were reflecting the general consensus or not.

I’ve been thinking of publishing the app in English to reach larger audience and here’s where I’d appreciate your input:

Does anyone really want to pay for an app that basically just generates a quiz and expects players to write their answers on a piece of paper for example? 

It’s hard for me to put this idea into words but I want to think it as a pub quiz or such.

What do you think?

webdev,I need your help 🙂,"I created a social media platform called Thoughts Area. Where you can post your thoughts or questions. While others users can upvote, downvote, comment on your post and even follow your profile.  It's a place where you can anonymously get answers to your questions or other people's opinion about your most random thoughts ( just a simple version of reddit ). But the issue is that i do not have any users on that platform and it is almost empty. So i need your help, please go to my platform and create an account, post your thoughts and interact with other people's posts.",Icy_Watercress1584,1h79itc,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h79itc/i_need_your_help/,https://thoughts-area.vercel.app,2024-12-05 13:46:40,0,0.07,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,Discussion,default,t3_1h79itc
