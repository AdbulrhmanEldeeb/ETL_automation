 For example extending this to 3-dimensions the numbers would appear in a 3-dimensional  arrangement(probably shouldn’t call it an array since that suggests 2-dimensions.) For 3-dimensions, you can interpret as a sequence of matrices extending vertically in the z-directions. Higher dimensions than 3 though would not come so easily for a visual interpretation.

math,Is there a standard for classifying circular permutations? Either by complexity or some other metric,"So this ""problem"" has been on my mind and I feel like the concept probably has been explored, but I am having trouble finding literature on it or the right term to google.

Say you have a set made up of elements with a known order (e.g. 10 integers).

And say that we can define a known order for this set, for example lets call the ""base"" circular permutation is is just N mod 9 in order so 0-&gt;1...-&gt;8

We know there are (N-1)! unique circular permutations. Some of them will be ""similar"" to the base circular permutation. For example,  (0,1,2,6,7,8,3,4,5) would be largely ""similar"" to the base permutation, but has two points where it jumps to other part of the the base cycle. On the other hand, (1, 8, 3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 0, 5) seems completely random form the base permutation.

Is there a known / standard way to quantify / sort all the permutations, based on how similar they are to known ordered ""base"" circular permutation?

math,"Road to mathematical rigor, where from here?","I am at a bit of an impasse. My interest in math bloomed a bit later than it does for most kids, and while I consider that both a good and a bad thing, it has left me in a bit of a pickle.

I am in my Senior year of high school, and became ""very good"" at math only in my junior year. Now my interests have grown exponentially, and quite beyond the school curriculum. 

I have done a lot of self study, currently doing differentials (I'm trying to get a good math basis for quantum physics which is very diff-e and vector heavy). I am considered very advanced by my peers and teachers, but I don't feel like it, and I think I know the reason why.

Because I've been trying to ""catch up"" to the truly talented kids for the past 6 months, I feel like I have a good grasp on the advanced concepts I've learned myself but lack the rigorous ability to do the basic stuff.

What I mean by this is, when I do the algebra portion of a problem, like let's say an integral was already set up, all the calculus was done, and now it's only 10th grade algebra that's left, there is a 50/50 chance I'll do it right the first time and then another 50/50 chance of me spotting the error (if the solution *feels* really wrong I usually find it, and it's something insane every time). I feel like the really talented math kids who've been doing math rigorously from like age 6 have this down to muscle memory.

To make a comparison to another hobby of mine, I feel like they are really good at writing prose while I'm very good at structuring a story. The issue is, a good structure with poor prose will give you a story no one will read.

I don't know where to go from here. I feel very concentrated while doing the ""hard parts"" of a problem and then my head feels full of cotton while I'm doing basic computations. I make errors that are both ludicrous and invisible to me, for example:

Let's say we have a function f(x) = (x^2)/(x^2-x),

This function is defined if x^2-x ≠ 0

After some basic computing we get the penultimate step:

x ≠ 0

x - 1 ≠ 0

And then I'll write

x ≠ 0
x ≠ **-1**

And I guarantee you I will not spot that error. It will sabotage the entire problem, whatever might come after it, and I won't notice it unless I redo the whole thing again.

I don't know what to do. This is just not good enough, but I don't know how to fix it. I've done probably hundreds and hundreds of practice problems and the same algebra mistakes are ruining me. It has gotten to the point where I never feel confident in my calculations, nor believe I have what it takes to be truly good at math. It's like I lack some mathematical intuition that really talented people have.

I've been feeling rather demotivated because of this, specifically because I can't trust myself and my own ability. If I could at least trust that and only have missing knowledge, I'd be excited to learn. The way things are I just feel useless as a mathematician and I have no plan on how this might be resolved.",zZEpicSniper303Zz,1h6ch6h,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h6ch6h/road_to_mathematical_rigor_where_from_here/,2024-12-04 09:50:20,9,0.68,9,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h6ch6h

Today the students were filling out their course evaluations and I was also doing some reflecting on how things went.

math,Triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°,"I would like to share a fun exercise that I came up with.

I was thinking about which points on a square grid have integer distance, and the answer is obviously given by Pythagorean triples, which can be generated by the famous Euclid's formula. Then I wondered: What about a triangular (or hexagonal) grid? There, the possible integer distances are given by the triangles with integer sides and an angle of 120°. If the sides are a, b, c, and the 120° angle is between a and b, then they satisfy a² + b² + ab = c² (by the law of cosines).

Then I wondered if I could come up with the analogous of Euclid's formula for this class of triangles, and I found that, if m and n are two integers with m &lt; n, then the triple (a, b, c) where

a = n² - m²

b = 2mn + m²

c = m² + n² + mn

satisfies our condition. Moreover, it is not difficult to prove that if m and n are coprime and not congruent modulo 3, then the triple is primitive (i.e., GCD(a,b,c) = 1). It can also be shown that all primitive triples can be obtained by this formula.

That's it, I just wanted to share this fun little exercise in number theory. I also wonder if this formula already has a name. I am not aware of it, but probably someone knows better than me.

math,Is there any intuition behind results in stochastic processes?,"I'm taking a class on probability theory and stochastic processes. So far I've been able to follow all the technical arguments but I've been uncomfortable because I can't build an intuition on any of the results.

For example the Ito integral is an L2 limit of simple processes using a subsequence argument. Since this integral isn't defined pathwise this integral clearly isn't an area of any kind so I have no idea what the random variable that is the Ito integral even represents. 

Another example is Ito's lemma. Again the quadratic variation means the ""stochastic chain rule"" has an extra term (the second derivative) compared to the ordinary chain rule but is there any intuition why it should be 1/2 the second derivative? You can make some sort of argument using Taylor series but we're able to motivate the ordinary chain rule without resorting to any expansions so this seems like a bit of a stretch. 

Stochastic differential equations are another example. A non-random ODE or PDE clearly describes the rate of change of different functions.

math,Notion of a standardized curvature?,"It’s been a while since I studied this in undergrad so apologies for the lack of rigor and specificity.

When I was in Calc 3, I remember learning about curvature, and I believe it was denoted with “k”. We were taught that a small circle was more curvy, than a larger circle with a larger radius.

I understood at the time, why this was defined as such, **however** I felt like there should also be some notion of curvature that is standardized for the shape of the closed shape.

So that all circles have the same shape regardless of size, but we could still compare the curvature of shapes, i.e. a circle is more curvy than a triangle.

In the same way that Usain Bolt can run really fast for his size, but a Giant 50ft troll running at 30mph would be quite average, if not slow. 

Then, I’m sure we could extend this in higher dimensions, where there would probably different ways to quantify curvature when standardized for the shape of the closed N-d shape.

Has anyone come across this line of thinking?

math,Looking for Seminar Topic Ideas in Functional Analysis with Connections to Probability and Ergodic Theory,"Hi everyone!

I’m currently taking a course in functional analysis, and for the oral exam, I need to present a 20-minute seminar on a topic related to the course. The topic should not overlap with the material already covered but still stay within the realm of functional analysis.

Some of the main areas we’ve covered include:

• Normed and Banach spaces, linear operators, and dual spaces.

• Hilbert spaces and orthogonal projections.

• Hahn-Banach theorem, topologies (weak, weak*), and convexity.

• Spectral theory for bounded operators and compact operators.

• Elements of distribution theory and spaces of sequences.

I’m particularly interested in topics that connect functional analysis to probability theory or ergodic theory, as these are fields I’d like to explore further.

Do you have any suggestions for seminar topics that fit these criteria?

math,How can I know my math problem/research is novel?,"I'm now doing math research on a probability theory question I came up with. Note that I'm an undergraduate, and the problem and my approaches aren't that deep.  
First, I googled to see if somebody had already addressed it but found nothing. So I started thinking about it and made some progress. Now I wish to develop the results more and eventually write a paper, but I suddenly began to fear: *what if somebody has already written a paper on this?*

So my question is, as in the title: how can we know if a certain math problem/research is novel?

If the problem is very deep so that it lies on the frontier of mathematical knowledge, the researcher can easily confirm its novelty by checking recent papers or asking experts in the specific field. However, if the problem isn't that deep and isn't a significant puzzle in the landscape of mathematics, it becomes much harder to determine novelty. Experts in the field might not know about it due to its minority. Googling requires the correct terminology, and since possible terminologies are so broad mainly due to various notations, failing to find anything doesn't guarantee the problem is new. Posting the problem online and asking if anyone knows about it can be one approach (which I actually tried on Stack Exchange and got nothing but a few downvotes). But there’s still the possibility that some random guy in 1940s addressed it and published it in a minor journal.

math,How monstrously long papers are made?,"Following the steps of a recent discussion in the community, I have read a Wiki page on the Feit–Thompson theorem. There I found the following:

*The final paper is 255 pages long. &lt;...&gt;*

*Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the proof was its length: before the Feit–Thompson paper, few arguments in group theory were more than a few pages long and most could be read in a day. Once group theorists realized that such long arguments could work, a series of papers that were several hundred pages long started to appear. Some of these dwarfed even the Feit–Thompson paper; the paper by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen D. Smith on quasithin groups was 1,221 pages long.*

How do authors come up with such long proofs? I don't believe there are brilliant insights every few pages. If there were, these gigantic papers would be valued as high as FLT proof, but they are not. I imagine there should be some machinery that produces arguments more or less mechanically, but still,  these arguments are not so standard that they could be just omitted from the paper.

But that's just my guess. If it is true, what does this machinery look like? If it is not, how are behemoth-long proofs actually made?

How do such failures correspond to failures in C and D being isomorphic?","The paragraph below is from [https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/](https://www.reddit.com/user/fredarietem/) , who posted four years ago in ""Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?Is it normal to be struggling to “get” the Yoneda lemma or is Category Theory just not for me?"", [https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is\_it\_normal\_to\_be\_struggling\_to\_get\_the\_yoneda/](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/n9a761/is_it_normal_to_be_struggling_to_get_the_yoneda/) . The post is archived, unfortunately, which means I can't discuss it with the original discussants. But the paragraph says exactly what I want to start from. To go further, I want to ask: in what way can Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) fail to be naturally isomorphic, and how do such failures correspond to failure in C and D being isomorphic?

&gt;One way to appreciate the Yoneda lemma is through its corollaries. There's one particular special case which I find particularly enlightening: the Yoneda embedding. The idea is that we can think of an object C as being represented by a hom functor Hom(C,-), i. e. by all its relations to other objects in the category (in the form of arrows from C). Then, an arrow from C to D corresponds exactly to a natural transformation between the corresponding hom functors (this is because the Yoneda embedding is fully faithful, courtesy of the Yoneda lemma). In particular, if Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-) are naturally isomorphic then C and D are isomorphic, which essentially justifies the ""it's the arrows that are important"" perspective of category theory. Note that we could just as well look at Hom(-,C) instead of Hom(C,-).

I've never seen this discussed, but is there a concept of ""C and D are isomorphic except for these cases""? Of, as it were, defects or deformations in isomorphism? As a programmer, I find it natural (sorry!) to study such points of failure. If I could do so for Yoneda, I think it would be enlightening. Because it's easy to see how a natural transformation can fail. Some components may not be there. But what kind of damage does that do to the wanna-be isomorphism arrows between C and D?

By the way, I attach a picture of a category with objects C and D in, also X, X', X'', etc. It also shows the functors Hom(C,-) and Hom(D,-), with just visible hom-sets indicating their effect on some of the X's, and a natural transformation. Maybe someone can see how to complete it to make the source of C and D's isomorphism obvious.

math,Quaternion double-cover of SO(3),"It’s clear to me why the quaternion rotation formula works.

And we use exp because exp of a 90-degree rotation (e.g. all unit pure quaternions) generates all rotations.

What doesn’t make sense to me is how this relates to the double-covering of SO(3) by Spin(3). I understand algebraically that the sign of the quaternion cancels in the rotation formula. I also understand that the theta/2 in the quaternion rotation formula requires you to take a 720deg path around Spin(3) to make a full loop. But I don’t understand what’s really special about a full 720deg walk. So what if we need that to take a loop around Spin(3)? What makes Spin(3) a truer group of rotations than SO(3)? I know it’s the universal cover, but why is that relevant in this case?

math,"Looking for references on ""coproduct"" of random variables","I'm trying to find what a concept is called and references to learn more about it. My best guess is to call it a coproduct of random variables, but this leads nowhere.

---

Here's a description (handwaving measure theory to keep things short):

Given two random variables x : Ω → S\_x and y : Ω → S\_y, we can form the joint random variable (x,y) : Ω → S\_x × S\_y by taking (x,y)(ω) = (x(ω), y(ω)). This is a product in the category of random variables over (Ω, Σ, μ). This raises the question: is there a coproduct?

Yes, there is. We can prove its existence using Zorn's lemma or explicitly construct it by taking the coequaliser of the maps x : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y and y : Ω → S\_x ∪ S\_y, i.e. the random variable x∨y : Ω → E, where E = S\_x ∪ S\_y / ~ and ~ is the smallest relation such that x(ω) ~ y(ω) for all ω.

Another characterisation of this object is that the sub-σ-algebra of Σ induced by (x∨y)^(-1) is the intersection of the sub-σ-algebras induced by x^(-1) and y^(-1).

math,Looking for creative and alternative representations of Graphs,"I believe there are more clever ways that we can graphically represent a symmetric binary relation between two objects than simply drawing a line between them or incidence/adjacency matrices.   
I haven't been exposed to much higher level math yet (only Olympiad style math, analysis, and linear algebra), so my scope to be creative might be limited, this is where people with different experiences could come in with a fresh perspective. 

I will start: Take a finite graph G, we represent the n points on some affine line (equally spaced), and if a pair of these points are incident we draw a circle around those points such that the space between the points is the diameter. Now project this line onto the real projective plane, so that the circles become ellipse. Now the pairs of incident points correspond to the foci of the ellipse.

math,A simple but powerful map ban format for 2-player random queue games,"I have no idea what the right subreddit for this is but I wanted to share it since I feel like it might be interesting and/or useful.

**For a short description of the problem:** You are hosting a random matchmaking queue for a game where two players face off on one of multiple possible maps. Most players don't want to learn every map, so you offer map bans. But you still want to ensure that any two players will be able to find a map that neither of them has banned. What is a good way to allow your average joe to ban as many maps as possible without making things feel too complicated or too restrictive?

The format that is typically used in games (e.g. AoE2) asymptotes at a map pool size of `2n` maps if each player has to leave `n` maps unbanned.

My previously favourite format asymptotes at `4n` maps for `n` unbanned.

This new format that I just found asymptotes at `n²/2` maps for `n` unbanned. **EDIT:** As pointed out by u/mfb- and u/bartekltg, the `n²/2` asymptote has the downside of not allowing the maximal amount of `n-1` arbitrary bans, but there is a separate asymptote of `n²/2.25` that does.

I think the theoretical limit (Fano plane anyone) is somewhere between `n²/2` and `n²` but it seems way too unwieldy and restrictive to make that into a user-friendly system.

**So here's my new system:**

1. Arrange the available maps into a grid of `x*y` maps, where `x` is odd.
2. Any given player must select one of the `x` columns as their ""home column"". They can't ban any maps in their home column.
3. The player may then ban most of the maps in the other columns, except that every *second* column (starting from the home column and looping around) must have at least one map not banned.

If these rules are followed, three scenarios can happen when attempting to match two random players A and B:

**a)** Both players have selected the same column. In this case, any map from that column can be randomly selected and played (fully random, or prioritizing favourited maps, or something else, we don't need to care).

**b)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an odd column. Then player A has left open one of the maps in player B's home column, so that map can be played.

**c)** Player A has selected (wLoG) column 1, and player B has selected an even column. Then player B has left open one of the maps in player A's home column, so that map can be played.

**Example:** There are `5x4` maps in the pool (picture 1).

    A B C D E        - B - D -        - - - - E
    F G H I J        - G - - -        - G - - J
    K L M N O        K L - - -        - - - N O
    P Q R S T        - Q - - -        - - - - T

Player A's bans leave open the maps in picture 2. Player B's bans leave open the maps in picture 3.

Both players have left map **G** open, so map **G** will be played.",Iwer_Sonsch,1h3dze9,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h3dze9/a_simple_but_powerful_map_ban_format_for_2player/,2024-11-30 14:43:19,55,0.93,55,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h3dze9
math,More in-depth reference for matrix calculus,"There are a number of threads on this subreddit and others asking for resources for matrix calculus. There isn't much attention given to differentiating with respect to matrices. For example, there's not much of this in The Matrix Cookbook. I'm looking for this sort of info (all in numerator layout as that's what I need to use):

* $\frac{\partial (Mx+b)}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)} = x^T \otimes I$. This one I can at least get out of https://www.matrixcalculus.org
* $\frac{\partial f(Mx+b)}{\partial M} = x f'$. (This was not on Wikipedia until I added it recently.)
* This attempt to relate $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial M}$, which is a monstrosity in numerator layout: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(M)} = \left( \mathrm{vec} \left(\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial M}\right)^T \right) \right)^\top$
* If $dv = M\mathrm{vec}(N)$, then $\frac{\partial v}{\partial \mathrm{vec}(N)} = M$

math,Inductive definition of a set.,"I am a computer science student and have studied basic discrete maths, including set theory. I was pacing across some questions when I came across this one. It seems like the standard way of defining a set inductively. A basis clause stating that certain elements are in the set, and an inductive clause which states that if x is in the set, y is also in the set. 

  
Now the problem that I have with this definition is that for many objects, it does not specify if they are in the set or not (which are not taken into account in both of the clauses). For example in this question, I cannot tell if b is in L or not. According to me, a good definition of a set should be able to define for every object in the universe of discourse, that it belongs to the set or not. The answer here, also completely depends on this assumption. My question is, am I missing something in the way sets are defined inductively, or the question is just vague and poorly framed, or the inductive definition of sets is incomplete and there are better ways to define a set?

I'd be happy to provide any clarifications in my post. TY

I am a mathematics student with interests in Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and theoretical aspects of Physics. Recently, I’ve been exploring Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS), and I’m fascinated by its deep connections to Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, and String Theory.

I would like to ask for guidance on the following:

1. Roadmap: What is a good progression of topics or prerequisites to study before diving into HMS? For example, how much familiarity with Algebraic Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, or Category Theory is required?


2. References: Could you recommend foundational textbooks, lecture notes, or papers that introduce HMS in an accessible way? Are there any must-read works by Kontsevich or others to understand the origins and formalism of the conjecture?


3. History: I’m interested in the development of HMS. How did it emerge historically from Mirror Symmetry in Physics, and what are the most significant milestones in its mathematical formulation?


4. Applications and Extensions: Where is HMS actively being applied or extended in current research? Are there particular areas or open problems that are especially exciting?

I hope this is not a redundant post. I did google search for alternatives to Billingsley's book but could not find it. All I found was a plethora of book recommendations but not specifically as an alternative to Billingsley's book. Hence this post.

Morphisms of algebras, valuations, ideals, maximals and primes, quotient algebras, localization, and Stone's representation theorem.

He keeps rambling about prime ideals being points in some space, and how every boolean algebra is actually a topology in some space, given by the zeroes of valuations...

I found the recurrence relation b_k =1/a (a_k-(k+1)b_(k+1)) to figure out the integral a little bit faster but unless i can point to a known theorem, i would have to prove it each time i want to use it which would destroy all the time savings.

math,I’ve been reading Max Tegmark’s book “Our Mathematical Universe” which argues convincingly that we’re living in some vast mathematical structure that somehow acts as a real-life model of itself…,"This seems to render the much-reviled simulation argument moot, because it’s like we drop all pretence that it was ever anything other than a simulation in the first place. 

But anyway my question: what structure could it be?

For this I think we have to call in the model theorists.

From my limited understanding of the subject, perhaps we’re looking for a countable structure (or maybe with the cardinal it the reals?) which is homogeneous, saturated - perhaps some kind of Fraïssé limit which also has a universal interpretability quality?

A countable structure able to interpret any other countable structure, and perhaps with additional saturation properties, would be nice - bonus points if it’s locally finite. 

If one framed a rigorous definition, it seems possible that there are many structures with these properties, and one could then reasonably ask for the simplest or most easily defined. Maybe the rational numbers fit the bill, which would be almost as Delphic and useless as 42 being the answer to everything.

Is it possible to mathematically formalize the concept of one system ""understanding"" another? If so, are there any studies or theories that have explored this topic? I would be grateful if you could point me to any relevant work or ideas.

This question stems from the following motivations:

* By formalizing ""understanding"" between systems, I aim to identify subsets such as ""natural language"" and ""mathematical language,"" with the ultimate goal of exploring the limits of human intelligence.
* I believe that by turning the concept of ""understanding"" inward, we may gain insights into the possibility of understanding consciousness itself.
* Ideally, such a formalization would be applicable to human brains or intelligence in a relatively straightforward manner.

More specifically, I am interested in topics such as:

* Mathematical studies on ""understanding"" or ""correspondence"" between systems.
* Applications of information theory, model theory, or type theory to this concept.
* Research on abstract definitions of ""understanding"" in cognitive science or artificial intelligence.

Any suggestions, references, or insights would be greatly appreciated.

math,Direction of the polygonal curve in the Schwarz-Christoffel integral,"https://preview.redd.it/0dm82t09bx2e1.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdbd72cb9b6b8fd5eb23eea96b32f3e3edd7e181

I am reading section 4.2 of Stein and Shakarchi's *Complex Analysis*, where the Schwarz-Christoffel integral is defined as in the image, where A1&lt;...&lt;An and all the beta's are in (0,1) and their sum is &lt;=2. The powers are defined using the branch of log which is defined everywhere except the nonpositive imaginary axis. We define a\_k=S(A\_k) for all k and define a\_∞=S(∞).

In the proof that this integral maps the upper-half plane into the polygon with vertices a1,...,a\_n,a\_∞, they note that S′(x) is real and positive when x&gt;A\_n.

I believe this should mean that when x travels from A\_n to ∞, S(x) should travel in a straight line parallel to the real axis, from left to right. Hence a\_n should be directly left of a\_∞.

However, the image shows what the textbook has drawn.

In the picture, when Σβk=2, a\_1 is to the left of a\_∞ which is to the left of a\_n. But it seems to me this should all be the other way around.

Even worse is the case when Σβk&lt;2, when the line between a\_∞ and a\_n is not even horizontal.

As well, a\_∞ is depicted as being at the top of the shape in these images, but I believe it should really be at the bottom (ie: it should have a smaller imaginary component). Since the line between a\_{n−1} and a\_n is at angle −πβn with the real axis, hence it ""points"" downwards, so a\_{n-1} is above a\_n.

So from my understanding, the polygon should have a flat bottom between points a\_n and a\_∞, where a\_n is to the left of a\_∞. And the rest of the points should be put counterclockwise around the polygon. But this is not what the picture in Stein and Shakarchi depicts, so I'm wondering if I have done something wrong.

Please let me know if my understanding is correct or if I have made a mistake somewhere.

math,I think the formal definition of a limit in Walter Rudin’s Real Analysis text has an unexpected consequence,"This is the second of two definitions of a limit given in Walter Rudin’s *Principles of Mathematical Analysis,” which I understand to be a reliable reference text for analysis. The first definition comes before the introduction of the extended real numbers and, crucially, requires that the point A at which the limit is taken be a limit point of the domain. To cut to the chase I think this second definition allows for the following:

&gt; Let f: E = (0, 4) -&gt; R be defined by f(x)=x. Then f(t) approaches 4 as t -&gt; 5.

Given a neighborhood U of 4 in the codomain, U contains an open interval (4-e, 4+e) for some e&gt;0.
Now let us define a neighborhood of 5 in R which need not be a subset of the domain E. Let V = (4 - e, 5 + e).

We have thus met the required conditions for V: 
- V \cap E is nonempty; the intersection is (4-e, 4).
- On this intersection, we have 4-e &lt; f(t) &lt; 4+e, that is to say f(t) is in U, for every t in V \cap E

Is this an intentional consequence? If so I am curious to hear any perspective that might contextualize this property in a broader or more general topological framing.

Is it unintuitive but nevertheless appropriate because of the nature of the extended reals?

Or is it a typo of some kind that is resolved in other texts?

Or am I misunderstanding something?

For example the equivalent of an L\^1 norm for operators is the trace class norm, the equivalent of the L\^2 norm is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, and the equivalent of the L\^infinity norm is the operator norm. Is this a coincidence or is there some big picture behind these operator norms similar to the L\^p space idea I gave above? What are these norms tell us about the operator as p increases?

Each line contains four points, so each line can be written as a 4-tuple. So, we can characterize the thirteen lines in PG(2,3) as a 13x4 array. One example of doing so might be (taken from the La Jolla Covering Repository Tables):

|Point A|Point B|Point C|Point D|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3|5|11|
|3|4|6|12|
|4|5|7|13|
|1|5|6|8|
|2|6|7|9|
|3|7|8|10|
|4|8|9|11|
|5|9|10|12|
|6|10|11|13|
|1|7|11|12|
|2|8|12|13|
|1|3|9|13|
|1|2|4|10|

Since these labels are arbitrary, we can permute them however we want and get an equivalent description of the space.

I wondered, is there some permutation of these labels that is ""nice"" in the sense that the row sums of the corresponding array representation of the space are all equal? I've convinced myself that the answer is ""no"", but it looks like something stronger is true.

Clearly, permuting the labels won't affect the *mean* of the row sums of the array. What is surprising (to me anyway), is the fact that permuting the labels also won't affect the *variance* of the row sums of the array. No matter how you shuffle the labels, the variance of the row sums is always 42.

For example, in the array above, the row sums are \[21, 25, 29, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 31, 35, 26, 17\].

If we swap all of the 1s and 13s, however, the row sums are \[21, 25, 17, 32, 24, 28, 32, 36, 28, 43, 23, 26, 29\]

These are different multisets (notice, for example, that the second has a 43 as an element but the first does not), but both have a variance of 42.

What's going on here? It seems clear that there's something about the underlying symmetry of PG(2,3) that's is causing this, but I can't for the life of me see what could be causing the variance of the row sums to be invariant when permuting the point labels.",shdgctbei,1gy94bn,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gy94bn/strange_feature_of_the_finite_projective_plane/,2024-11-23 20:33:09,17,0.86,17,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gy94bn

math,Struggling with Discrete Math Teaching Methods at My College—Is This Normal?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently taking a Discrete Math course at my college, and I’m finding the way it’s taught incredibly frustrating and borderline incomprehensible. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar or has advice for dealing with it.

Here’s what’s happening: the materials we’re given—lecture notes and problem sets—are filled with references to other questions, sentences, or formulas scattered across 400+ pages. For example, I’ll be trying to follow a proof, and it’ll say something like “According to question 28c” or “As per sentence 1.24 and question 14k.”

The problem is, I’m expected to use these earlier questions or sentences to understand the current proof, but I’m struggling to keep track of where everything is or how it all connects. If I didn’t understand question 28c, how am I supposed to use it to build a new proof? It feels like I’m being asked to construct something complex without being given a proper foundation.

I’ve talked to friends who study at other colleges, and their Discrete Math courses seem much more straightforward. They get proofs written out step-by-step in a clear way, without having to constantly refer to random questions or pages. Meanwhile, my course feels like a maze of scattered information, and it’s making me doubt my abilities.

I understand that math requires rigor and effort, but this approach feels unnecessarily convoluted. I don’t know if it’s meant to encourage independence or what, but it’s honestly just overwhelming and frustrating.

Does anyone else’s school teach Discrete Math like this? How do you deal with such a fragmented way of learning? Are there any resources or strategies you’d recommend for surviving this kind of course?

Thanks for reading—I’d really appreciate any advice or insight.

math,"Calculus I : Textbook-based online class or ""Growth Mindset"" method in-person class?","I will be taking Calculus I next semester, but I am not too sure on which class to register for. 

The online course is taught online synchronous with the use of James Stewart's book 2nd edition, chapter 1-5. We would be using Knewton for exams and homeworks. As I see it, it is a self-taught course as the lecture and notes will be taken directly from the book, and Knewton is an adaptive-learning program so it won't move to the next topic until you have ""mastered"" the previous one. And the professor is just there for guidance and input

The in-person course focuses on learning calculus through actively engaging; we do calc together as teams and individually. It will also use a lot of visualization concepts through graphs. The textbook is the openstax Calc Volume I, and the course is designed with the 'growth mindset' method which means a weird structure of learning targets, WebWork assignments, PLTL sessions (also in the online course though) and some more stuff like 'carnival days (?) which are remedial days.

* Bluesky, a social media platform, is building a protocol for decentralized communication. User's data, including content and followers, is reachable from multiple interfaces. If a user does not like the policy of a platform interface, it can move to another one with her followers and content. See their [blog post](https://bsky.social/about/faq).

**Ambition.** Bluesky aims to let anyone use their decentralized protocol and build new platforms, with a genuine access to all users content and data. Researchers and entrepreneurs may innovate interaction mechanisms, beyond for-profit prediction AI that aims to manipulate people and waste their time for advertisement.

math,Is Lowenheim-Skolem just an artifact of the formalism?,"
People here, and on various math blogs,  love to point out the existence of countable models of ZFC. Seems like at least once a week, and this is stated like it has profound implications. Conclusions like ""uncountable sets are an illusion,"" ""God could count the reals,"" or ""we might live in a model where every set is countable"" are common.

But Cantor's argument shows, in a very generic way, whenever we conceive of a collection and its subcollections, there can be no one-to-one correspondence between them. The proof doesn't rely on any controversial axioms of a specific set theory. It's a basic consequence of a very general idea.

And sure, when formally studying models of a first-order set theory, some are countable from the metatheory. It's like making maps of the world. On any given map, South America will be larger than Europe, because it's larger in real life so we make maps that reflect that fact. But South America on one map might be smaller than Europe on a different map (because the whole map is smaller).

But *so what?* Why would you compare objects across models like that? It's common for diagonal arguments to relativize in this way. The halting problem: a Turing machine can't decide it's own halting, but there's always an oracle machine that can. Or the second incompleteness theorem: a theory can't prove itself consistent, but there's always a stronger theory that can.

Yet no one ever says ""incompleteness is an illusion"" or ""we might live in a model where every problem is decidable."" The fundamental ideas are reflected *within each level*, and comparisons across levels don't seem particularly important.

In physics, we encounter ""artifacts of the formalism"" sometimes. Like tachyons in special relativity, closed timelike curves in general relativity, or zero-point energy in quantum fields. Extra stuff that shows up in the math but generally isn't thought to be physically relevant.

Can we say the same about *mathematical* phenomena sometimes? Lowenheim-Skolem seems like a pretty good candidate. While the core idea behind |P(N)| &gt; |N| is reflected (in some form) in each of the models of the set theories we use, the existence of countable models feels like a technical limitation of formal systems, similar to the various paradoxes that ensue when you have to use logic to talk about logic. 

Thoughts? I'm sure there are some formalists here who disagree.

I’m an international student considering pursuing a Master’s in Applied Statistics to break into the analytics field. The challenge is that my background isn’t in math or STEM (I studied International Business), so I’d need about 2 years to study Calculus 1-3 and Linear Algebra just to meet the prerequisites.

I’m drawn to analytics because of the opportunities in fields like data science, finance, and tech, but I’m questioning whether this is the best path for someone in my position. Some programs seem highly technical, and I’m wondering if the effort and time would be worth it in the long run.

A few questions I’d love advice on:
	1.	Is a Master’s in Statistics a good way to pivot into analytics, or should I consider other degrees (e.g., Data Science, Business Analytics)?
	2.	Would spending 2+ years preparing for the program and then 2 years in the program itself be worth the time and money investment?

math,When to start this Coin Flipping Game over?,"I was thinking about the following problem. Take a game where you have a fixed number of flips f and a prerequisite number of heads h you need to win.

You can start the game anew whenever you like, your headcount get's reset and you get the same number of flips again.

The goal is to win the game as soon as possible so in the least amount of total flips. When is the probability to win the ongoing game low enough that you expect to win earlier by restarting and forfitting the flips you already did.

Let's say it's 100 Flips and you need 80 heads to win. I'd wager that if you flipped 30 times and got only 15 heads you're better off to start over, since getting 75/80 heads is too unlikely and you may hope for a better Start.

I tried some calculations, but my stochastic is very rusty. I though about this in the context of speedrunning a RNG heavy game, when is the run so bad, that you shouldn't waste your time playing it out - I thought this coin flipping game breaks this down to the most basic case?

Probably you have heard of the Interesting number paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting\_number\_paradox) which states that every integer is in some way ""interesting"".

So I started digging for the smallest uninteresting integer. First I looked for facts on Wikipedia. On [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_(number)) of numbers, the 2040 seems to be the smallest integer, that is not listed.

So on the search for properties of the 2040, I went to the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org) and found almost every number I was interested in, was somewhere in their database. So I wrote a small python script that searched the OEIS for numbers, to find the smallest integer that is not on there.

It is the 20067. Of course I was not the first one to discover this. Googleing the number, I came across [this blog post](https://benwiederhake.github.io/oeis-funfacts/) by Ben Wiederhake with fun facts about the OEIS, including the 20067.

I am willing to accept that being the smallest integer not in the database of the OEIS *is* in itself an interesting fact about the 20067. Even though the number is not actually that boring. For example it's semi-prime!

So the second smallest integer not in the OEIS is the 20990. I haven't found anything interesting about it so far.

\- It's factorization is  2 \* 5 \* 2099  
\- It is unhappy  
\- It is deficient

I haven't got any good ideas on how to discover interesting properties about numbers. So far I've got just by going through online databases and now I'm a bit stuck. Almost went out to make some sort of crazy piece of art with the 20990 in it...

Maybe someone here got an idea on how to study a number for it's hidden special properties. I'd be very grateful for any help, thank you in advance! :)

math,"Examples where ""taking a step backwards"" is helpful","For a project I'm looking for examples in math where it's useful to ""take a step backwards.""

Computation example: the distributive law $a(b+c) = ab + ac$, which we can interpret as a pair of rewrite rules. If we assume that distributing $a(b+c)$ -&gt; $ab + ac$ is the forward direction [1], then factoring is running the distributive law backwards. Factoring is obviously incredibly useful, e.g. in finding closed forms for (convergent) geometric series, or finding roots to polynomials.

Proof-based example: [sometimes it's easier to prove a stronger statement than a weaker statement.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1007256/examples-where-it-is-easier-to-prove-more-than-less) Considering statements / theorems as vertices in a directed graph, where a forward [2] edge from A to B means ""A implies B"", deciding to prove a stronger statement is taking a step backwards in this graph. 

What are some more examples of ""taking a step backwards?"" Computational / algebraic tricks would be the most helpful for the project, but all examples are welcome.

[1] Justification of distribution being the forward direction: computationally speaking, it's easier to match patterns of the form $a(b+c)$ modulo associativity and commutativity than patterns of the form $ab + ac$. Anecdotally, students usually can easily identify situations where they can distribute, but it's harder for them to identify situations where they can factor.

math,When did you start to feel good at math?,"I don't know where to begin writing this. I did my undergrad in Math and Biology. I always thought I'd be more of a biology person when I began undergrad, but as time went on I realized that the things I liked about science actually boiled down to math. While I took courses that I absolutely loved like Abstract Algebra and Probability Theory (even Multivariable Calc was taught so theoretically that I loved every second of it), the math major wasn't the most rigorous and I didn't even take Real Analysis. I'm so embarrassed to admit that, because it's so fundamental. Nevertheless, I graduated with an A- average and did a math thesis in Fluid Dynamics.

I've then got my PhD in mathematical biology. While I was technically in a biology department, my dissertation and my research is all about graph theory. I've come up with a new construction in graph theory and proved theorems in research (not always perfectly, and I second guess myself so much it's impossible to get to the finish line efficiently). My PhD research group wasn't the most uplifting environment; my advisor was increasingly absent over the years, and while we have a good relationship and I respect him a lot, I always had the sinking feeling that he didn't respect me as much as other members in the group. When I look back at what I learned, I can see that I have managed to accumulate a real expertise in my area. However, compared to what I want to be able to do as a mathematical researcher, there are so many other fields I want to know (expand into geometry &amp; topology), as well as some basic areas I need to get more solid in (e.g. real analysis, measure theory). And I have had my spirit crushed by my advisor more than once.

I've just started an applied math postdoc, which I feel has been going well, but I can't help but still feel doubtful of my skills and frustrated that I don't get things quicker. I have to get papers out, but I also want to learn more fields of math. I have genuine passion for math and honestly have felt happier in the few months of my postdoc than I ever did during the entirety of my PhD, but I feel like the stress and burnout has been getting to me over the last few days.

My question is: when do you start to feel good at mathematics?

n=2 -&gt; ~.45
n=3 -&gt; ~.13
n=4 -&gt; ~.03

As n increases, I would expect to get less eigenvalues in F (the degree of the characteristic polynomial increases, so the probability that 1 solution lies outside of F increases). Similarly, as q increases, I would expect to get more eigenvalues (there are more ways to solve the eigenproblem). 

However, I wouldn’t necessarily expect this value to converge as q increases.

My third question is if there is any relation between all of these sets of functions. The way people talk about fourier series/transforms and the way people talk about infinite polynomials are completely different - using different methods and terms etc. But in the end they both, in a way, do the same thing (make a large range of functions from a sum of set of others).

math,Determinant trick,"In Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, he uses what he calls the ""determinant trick"" to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.   He does this by working with matrices with elements from a subring A' of endomorphisms A\^n-&gt;A\^n corresponding to ""multiplication-by-ring-element"".  This allows actions by a homomorphism \\phi in A\^n to be treated as multiplication in the ring A'\[\\phi\].  Then he multiplies the matrix \\phi\*I\_n-N, where N is the matrix of the homomorphism with respect to a basis of the free module (regarded as having elements in A'\[\\phi\]) by the adjoint matrix to conclude that the determinant is zero in A'\[\\phi\] and hence, the characteristic polynomial applied to \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] (or N, remembering that multiplication by \\phi in A'\[\\phi\] corresponds to action by \\phi, and working with the chosen basis in A\^n) is also zero, because the map

\\Psi:A\[x\]\\to A'\[\\phi\], x \\mapsto \\phi

commutes with det(as a function on A'\[\\phi\] valued matrices) and det(as a function on A\[x\] valued matrices).

It seems to rescue the bogus proof of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (substituting N\*I\_n into x\*I\_n in x\*I\_n-N) by turning the unwieldy application of the characteristic polynomial to a matrix into the nicer application of the characteristic polynomial to a single element in the ring A'\[\\phi\].

This argument seems to be applicable in general to finitely-generated modules, and is used by Atiyah and MacDonald in the proof of Proposition 2.4.

Could somebody check if my understanding (after two hours of pondering yesterday and another two hours just now) is correct?

math,Is there a geometric relationship between certain points and lines in barycentric coordinates?,"I've been playing around with barycentric coordinates recently, and a question came up that I couldn't find an answer to.

Suppose we are working with barycentric coordinates with respect to an arbitrary triangle. Given a triple of numbers (a_1, a_2, a_3) such that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ≠ 0, we have a point (a_1 : a_2 : a_3) in barycentric coordinates. Also, if a_1, a_2, and a_3 are not all equal, we have a line consisting of points (x_1 : x_2 : x_3) such that a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0.

Does anyone know if there is any geometric relationship between a point and corresponding line defined this way? If we go up to higher dimensions, does this geometric relationship still hold between a point is its corresponding hyperplane?

As an example of the type of thing I mean by a geometric relationship, if we were instead working in cartesian coordinates, we have that the vector from the origin to (a_1, a_2, a_3) is normal to the plane defined by a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0. This relationship gives us a way to go between a plane and corresponding point (up to a scaling factor) without going through the coordinate system.",Best_Measurement_496,1gtkt2o,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gtkt2o/is_there_a_geometric_relationship_between_certain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gtkt2o/is_there_a_geometric_relationship_between_certain/,2024-11-17 19:00:21,1,1.0,1,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gtkt2o

math,Is Topology too difficult for me right now?,"For context, I'm a high school student doing self-study. After learning some basic discrete math and introducing myself to proofs, I felt ambitious enough to tackle Munkres' Topology. It was a massive jump in abstraction at first, but eventually I got over it and gained some momentum. That all broke down once I got to the section on the generalized product topology and onwards; I could barely comprehend what was going on with those sections, and the exercises were hell to get through (I'm not even sure my solutions are correct). Come today, the section on the quotient topology is going smoothly -- the proofs are proofing, the geometric intuition is intuitioning, etc. Until I get to the exercises. I sat there for hours trying to crack the 2nd one, which I only managed after finding an online solution to peak at. I'm currently struggling with the 3rd one under similar circumstances.

math,Is there a version of Vector Calculus that works in all dimensions? Why isn't it taught instead of Vector Calculus?,"Hey y'all,

Over the past few months I've had this growing... frustration(?) with Vector Calculus as it's usually taught in a Calculus 3 course, and I'm coming here because I kind of want to spill my thoughts about it in the hopes that someone else understands why I'm feeling this way and can offer some guidance.

(Also, just to be clear, I'm not posting this because I struggled with vector calculus or thought it was ""too hard,"" I honestly found it to be just fine)

I think most of my frustration stems from the fact that vector calculus is an exclusively 3-dimensional theory. The definitions of surface integrals and curl, as they're given in a typical course, only make sense in 3D, and this bothers me, because it feels to me like there shouldn't be anything ""special"" about 3D, right? Any R\^n can be treated as a vector space, so why was a theory of calculus created in such a way that it only works in R\^3? As an example of what I'm talking about, the fact that we represent the curl of a vector field as another vector field seems kind of like a ""coincidence,"" if that makes sense? Because it's been mentioned on numerous occasions that curl in other dimensions requires a different number of parameters (in 2D, curl only requires 1 parameter, and in 4D, it requires 6) and it just so happens that, in 3D, curl is described in 3 parameters. 

Is there a theory that serves the same purpose as vector calculus but that doesn't have this shortcoming? If there is, why is Vector Calculus so ubiquitous? I would love to live in a world where, for example, E&amp;M and Maxwell's Equations were taught using some other theory that's less reliant on 3D coincidences.

math,Are complex eigenvectors for nonconjugate eigenvalues orthogonal?,"For a complex eigenvalue conjugate pair, their eigenvectors will not be orthogonal. This is because if v = a + bi (a and b are vectors) and u = a - bi, then v · u = (a + bi) · (a - bi) = a · a + b · b, which is clearly non-zero since we established v and u are complex and thus have nonzero b.

(EDIT: Apparently, I was using an alternate inner product for complex numbers than most mathematicians would use. So apparently a + bi and a - bi can be orthogonal according to other inner products. Thanks u/lucy_tatterhood! Also, I meant to write I was only considering real-valued matrices.)

But what I'm wondering is for nonconjugate eigenvalues, are their corresponding eigenvectors orthogonal? For example, with the matrix:

A =  
\[0 1 0 0  
\-1 0 0 0  
0 0 0 -1  
0 0 1 0\]

nonconjuate eigenvalues do have orthogonal eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are (-i, 1, 0, 0), (i, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, i, 1), (0, 0, -i, 1), and we can see orthogonality with the nonpairs. But that could be do to how I structured this matrix. Afterall, this matrix was skew symmetric. Though I've tested with a non skew-symmetric matrix like

B =  
\[√3/2 -1/2 0 0  
1/2 √3/2 0 0  
0 0 √2/2 -√2/2  
0 0 √2/2 √2/2\]

and a similar result happened. But maybe I'm getting these orthogonal eigenvectors because my matrix has 0s separating the dimensions. But maybe because every rotation can be broken down into rotation of orthogonal planes, this result with nonconjugate eigenvalues eigenvectors being orthogonal will keep happening? I'm not sure.

The reason I've been thinking about orthogonal eigenvectors is I realized recently that ALL eigenvectors being orthogonal for distinct eigenvalues implies real eigenvalues (due to conjugate eigenvalues implying nonorthogonality, as shown earlier, meaning we can't have complex eigenvalues), which then by the Spectral Theorem implies a symmetric matrix. So I'm trying to learn more on what my idea of partial orthogonal eigenvectors (orthogonal for nonconjugate pairs) implies in terms of the matrix structure.

  
(EDIT: My conclusion that all eigenvector are orthogonal for distinct eigenvalues implies real eigenvalues realized on a non-commonly used inner product for complex vectors. So my conclusion was false.)

math,State Machine as a Binary Matrix?,"I'm a CS nerd, but I know enough about linear algebra to know that anything can be represented as a vector if you're brave enough. 

I want to make a hyper-condensed model of a Boolean logical circuit, using a series of 0 1 matrix operations to transform the inputs. 

While I've been able to find one explanation about binary matrices being used as logic gates and another about automata being mappable to a polynomial matrix, I'm having trouble figuring out how to bridge that to map automata onto a boolean matrix.  And with Google being what it is nowadays, even finding those two was hard enough on its own.

Does anyone know how I'd be able to map a finite state machine onto a binary matrix? Or a series thereof?


EDIT: For example, a Set-Reset latch would be modeled as the stateful expressions `Q_n=!(R_n+Q'_(n-1))` and `Q'_n=!(S_n+Q_(n-1))`, where S and R are inputs, but I can't seem to get myself to understand how to translate that to a binary vector or matrix.

Ideally, I would like to be able to repeatedly multiply the transformed vector and the matrix to continue ""ticking"" the circuit. 

Even if we deviate from linear algebra to another mechanism for deriving meaning from a set of numbers, I'd love to hear it. My current option is essentially 32^({layers of abstraction}) times larger per single binary value, which I just feel is wasteful.


EDIT 2: So when looking back at this, I realized that I'd basically need a matrix with one degree for every wire. And since most circuits don't have anything to do with each other, I'd end up with a hundred thousand wasted zeros.

It might be better to do a combination of a tree and a matrix then, using the tree to narrow down the required inputs and then the matrix to actually perform the computation.  That or just stick to a linked graph form of a circuit since that's the most intuitive way to do it, and then a bitwise matrix or something to serialize and compress it.",bythepowerofscience,1gt7etf,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gt7etf/state_machine_as_a_binary_matrix/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gt7etf/state_machine_as_a_binary_matrix/,2024-11-17 06:20:31,16,0.87,16,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gt7etf

math,are any mathematicians interested in the glass Bead game?,"for those without context, Herman Hesse's final novel was about a ""glass bead game"" that provided a utopian world a universal language for math and music. the main character of the story maps this mathematical language to human history (and other seemingly less mathematical disciplines) using the Chinese I Ching.

the novel has its obvious flaws, but what he describes sounds to me very very much like Langlands -- only more ambitious in that it includes music and some of the other sciences

so i'm interested in hearing what mathematicians think of the novel and the game as a language that bridges math with history and politics.

i'm sure anyone here who read Glass Bead Game has also read other fictional works that describe similar ""universal languages"", and i am interested in those too

math,How do I make the time to get better?,"I’m an undergraduate at a good institution with a strong math program in the United States. My question is how do you guys do it? I love math but there’s so freaking much math and not enough time to get good at it. My semester classes are fast paced and confusing. While I’m able to take time after class to digest concepts and do the problem sets, and I’m doing fine grade wise, I feel like I’ve missed the essence of what I’m learning. I’m able to do the problems but I don’t have the feeling I’m understanding anything. The class in taking rn is basically Calc III + an intro to analysis class where all kinds go different concepts are mixing together and I feel that don’t have time to deeply understand how these things relate or why they do. Linear algebra was a prerequisite for this class and so was regular calc iii and we’re doing a section on differential geometry and its mixing concepts from both in a way I’m not comfortable with. On top of that, my professor, who I’m sure is brilliant at their research, gets so caught up and excited in what they’re teaching that they’re extending it to topics beyond the scope of the course and expecting us to understand how it relates to many things. Physics, for example, isn’t a prerequisite for this class, but no we’re talking about relativity. The math makes some sense but I feel wildly unprepared. Others seem to have no issue and ask “insightful” questions the professors love.

ii) Or, a kiddish excitement or satisfaction at having the opportunity to do math in the first place (so not really a joy at the process of thinking through problems and coming up with solutions themselves, but a joy at the mere idea of doing math).

math,Contour integrals around non isolated singularities?,"In my, nearly nonexistent, free time, one of my current side interests is finally going back and properly learning some complex analysis. In particular, I’d like to have a better handle on contour integration.

Now, I of course took a complex analysis course in my undergrad and so I am familiar with standard Cauchy-Gorsaut, Jordan’s Lemma, and Residue methods. These all work for the standard meromorphic functions that one sees in a course like that.

But what about functions such that the set of singularities has cluster points or perhaps contains a continuum? A simple example would be something like

f(z)=(e^(1/z)-1)^(-1) or

g(z)=tan(1/z)

Neither of these are meromorphic as z=0 is both singular and a cluster point of other singularities. Now, I actually don’t know any minimal conditions for complex integrability like one might have in the theory of Riemann or Lebesgue integration. But assuming that such a function can be integrable, how could one compute a contour integral around a cluster point or a continuum of singularities?

math,Local/global maximum of a polynomial lies on the greatest interval between x-intercepts,"Apologies if this is too low level for this subreddit.  I ran into this theorem that I just can't believe I haven't heard before.  If a global maximum lies between any two zeros of a polynomial function, it will lie on the greatest interval between *x*\-intercepts.  Is this true?

So for example, the function *f*(*x*) = -*x*^(4) \+ *x*^(3) \+ 20*x*.  Without graphing, we know that *f* has a global maximum between *x* = 0 and *x* = 5 *because* the *x*\-interval \[0, 5\] is greater length than the interval \[-4, 0\].

Obviously I can draw a continuous function where this is not true, but perhaps that is not a polynomial.  What is the proof here?  It is just for certain polynomials?

math,Do you think the standard axiom-definition-theorem presentation in textbooks hurts learning?,"Do you think the standard axiom-definition-theorem presentation of material in mathematics textbooks pedagogically sound? I am thinking of books that take this to the extreme such as Landau's Foundations of Analysis and Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis. It certainly makes sense from a logical point of view.

Yes, you can understand the definitions, the theorems and their proofs but reading such books doesn't leave you with a sense of you could discover all these stuff yourself if you had given enough thought. What do you think?

  
Edit: A point of clarification. I do not propose that we do away with definitions, theorems, and proofs etc. Clearly these vital and indispensable to doing proper mathematics. In fact, I despise the informal style of so-called ""applied"" mathematics texts (such as Introduction to Linear Algebra by Strang) that are full of hand-wavy arguments and imprecision. The kinds of texts I have in mind are those that follow a strictly definition-theorem-proof style with no explanatory passages or motivating examples in-between. To those who categorize these as only reference material, I would like to point out that regardless of the intension of the author, such books do end up being used as textbooks in classes.

math,"Why are estimated ""centers"" sometimes bimodal?","For a project I'm working on, I've been trying to find the most central point in each country, which I defined as the point inside the country that has the smallest mean distance to all other points in the country (I believe this is equivalent to the centroid if the shape is contiguous and convex, but the centroid can lie outside the country, whereas this point can't). I couldn't calculate this directly, so I estimated it with a Monte Carlo method as follows:

1. Generate 1000 points in the shape randomly according to a uniform distribution
2. Find the point that has the lowest average distance to all the other points, take that as the central point
3. Repeat 200 times
4. Take the average of the 200 central points

Much to my surprise, some countries (like Slovenia) had a unimodal distribution, while others (like North Macedonia) had a bimodal distribution.

To make sure this wasn't a mistake in my code, I tried it again with a different number of points in each trial (step 1). The distribution of central points oscillates between unimodal and bimodal as the number of points increases. I then ran the same algorithm on an ellipse in the plane, and this time, the distribution was sometimes unimodal, sometimes bimodal, and once even trimodal.

math,"Typo in R. Milner's 1975: ""PROCESSES: A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF COMPUTING AGENTS""","**I will try to give as much context as possible to enable as many people as possible to answer but it is likely that only people with knowledge in denotational semantics and/or process algebra will be able to answer this question.**

Milner defines a process as a member of the Scott domain

`P = V -&gt; LxVxP` (1)

with `V` the domain of values, `L` the domain of locations and `P` the domain of processes. A domain of functions from values to a triplet &lt;location, value, process&gt;. Intuitively, it means that a process will receive a value and produce a location, a value and a new process (its continuation).

Let `w_1` and `w_2` be values and `s=pw_1` and `t=p'w_2`. From the previous definition (1), `s` and `t` are triplets so that each value in the triplet have the following types:

`(s)_1 : L, (s)_2 : V, (s)_3 : P`

Same goes for `t`

We say that a process returns a result when its continuation contains the special member `l` of `L`  
When defining parallel composition of processes `p` and `p'` receiving a pair of values `&lt;w1, w2&gt;`, Milner states that the rough idea is that if either `p` or `p'` reached a result, reduce the other one and return the pairing of the two results. If none is completed, ask an oracle to pick which process to reduce"".

I thus expected a definition of the type :

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) := 
    
    if ((s)_1=l) {
      // since p is complete, we sequentially compose p' with the result of p 
      (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2 
    } else if ((t)_1 = l) {
      // since p' is complete, we sequentially compose p with the result of p'
      (p * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1
    } else {
      // we ask an oracle to decide to reduce either p or p'
    }

using the notation of the paper for conditionals, we should get 

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) = 
    ((s)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2,
    ((t)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1,
    oracle_decision
    

but the paper gives us 

    (p || p')(w_1 x w2) = 
    ((s)_1=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;(s)_2, u&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_2,
    ((s)_2=l)  ⊃ (p' * λu.&lt;l, &lt;u, (t)_2&gt;, ⊥&gt;)w_1,
    oracle_decision

with `(s)_2 : V` I think the `(s)_2` is a typo, that what Milner meant was `(t)_1` but I can't seem to find any erratum of any sort and papers tracing the history of process algebra don't bother explaining this particular definition of parallel composition as it is dropped in the following paper by R. Milner.

I'm working my way through Axler's Measure, Integration and Real Analysis.

My question is, why is it sufficient that *P* is a finite partition and not a countably infinite one?

In Chapter 2A, Axler defines the Outer Measure over a set *A* is as the infimum of all sums of the lengths of **countably** many open intervals that cover the set *A*.

math,Maximum Number of Near Orthogonal Unit Vectors in a High Dimensional Space,"Suppose we have a set V of k unit vectors in an n-dimensional space, where k &gt;&gt; n and both are large (at least on the order of hundreds in this case). All k vectors are mutually near orthogonal: -ϵ &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ with i ≠ j and 0 &lt; ϵ &lt; 1.

The goal is to find a function of n and ϵ that yields the maximum possible k.

From [this stackexchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4680506/what-definition-of-nearly-orthogonal-would-result-in-in-a-10-000-dimensional), we get: n ≥ C \* ln(k) / ϵ^(2), where C is a constant currently accepted 8 (ignore what the post says about C - assuming [the proof on page 6/7 of this](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/OBDA_spring16/material/random_projections.pdf) holds, 8 is the best available right now). Further, from that equation we move things around to get the desired k ≤ exp(n \* ϵ^(2) / C).

So problem solved right? Well, maybe. That post gets the equation from [this response](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/24864/almost-orthogonal-vectors/24873#24873) which was to essentially the same question. That response was written by Bill Johnson, who in turn references the [Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) for which he is a namesake.

So problem definitely solved, surely?! After all, one of the creators of the lemma themselves directly answered this question. The problem is: if you read about the lemma on wikipedia or the various other available sources, it becomes increasingly confusing how one is supposed to make the jump from the equation being used by the lemma as a condition for the existence of a linear map to the same equation being used to get a lower bound on the dimension size n needed to allow for k near-orthogonal vectors. Specifically, the lemma shows that V can be reduced in dimension from some N to some lower n so long as the equation holds, where the n is the same as used above in the equation but now V is of R^(N) instead of R^(n). **So, how was this jump made?**

Further, I could find no information on how this equation was derived in that form, which is a problem: I am looking for a generalization of this equation with -ϵ1 &lt; Vi • Vj &lt; ϵ2, both ϵ1 &amp; ϵ2 being between 0 and 1 but not necessarily the same value.",OblivionPhase,1gpyz8k,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpyz8k/maximum_number_of_near_orthogonal_unit_vectors_in/,2024-11-12 23:37:48,32,0.85,32,0,19,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpyz8k
math,The Sandwich Problem (Open Discussion),"Suppose you have a square sandwich of area 1 with an infinitely thin crust along the edges. You remove a constant area from the sandwich such that it has area 1 at t = 0 and area 0 at exactly t = 1. This area can be removed in any way you'd please so long as dA/dt = -1. For example, you could remove it in an expanding strip from one side of the square to the other, two strips from both sides converging to the centre, an expanding circle centred at the middle of the square, etc. 

The method by which you choose to remove the area is called strategy S and can be as complex or as simple as you'd like.

Let P^(S)(t) be the crust-less perimeter of the sandwich at time t when using strategy S. That is, the total perimeter of the shape subtracted by the perimeter with crust on it at time t when using strategy S. 

Find the strategy S that minimizes the value of the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of P^(S)(t) with respect to t.



Some examples:

The integral has value 1 for the strategy where you remove an expanding strip from one side.

The integral has a value 2 for the strategy where you remove two expanding strips from opposite sides that converge in the centre.



From a bit of discussion with my friends, we've found that a good way to start is removing an expanding quarter circle from one of the corners, but it's unclear how to proceed once the quarter circle is inscribed within the square.

math,Branches of Algebra,"Hi everyone,
I started my Master's not long ago, and I'm mainly interested in algebra (I really enjoyed the courses in Galois theory and commutative algebra).

From what I saw, a lot of the research done in algebra in my university uses a lot of calculations, asymptotics and big O notations, which really surprised me as there were no such things in the courses I took.

Does every topic in algebra (which relates to Field theory) uses a lot of calculations? I don't really enjoy that type of proofs (I remember taking a seminar in number theory, where the theorems where really interesting, but the proofs were just a bunch of inequalities thrown together, like in Dirichlet's theorem, which I really didn't like)

Is there a branch of algebra (especially field theory) that doesn't have as much of these calculations, and generally has more elegant proofs?

math,How Does an Infinite Number of Removable Discontinuities Affect the Area Under a Curve?,"Hey everyone! I am currently redoing Calculus 2 to prepare for Multivariable Calculus, going over some topics my lecturer did not cover this past semester. Right now, I am watching Professor Leonard’s [lecture ](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=V9z1wMUcNE_L9REs)on improper integrals and I am at the section on removable discontinuities [1:49:06](https://youtu.be/g-M8FHslgdk?si=TWEzTwTz3diLYk88&amp;t=6546).

He explains that removable discontinuities or rather ""holes"" in a curve do not affect the area under the curve. His reasoning is that because a hole is essentially a single point and a single point has a width of zero, it contributes zero to the area. In other words, we can ""plug"" the hole with a point and it will not impact the area under the curve. This I understood because he once touched on it in some of his previous video, I forgot which one it was.

But I started wondering what if a curve had removable discontinuities all over it, with the holes getting closer and closer together until the distance between them approaches zero? Intuitively to me it seems like these ""holes"" would create a gap. But the confusion for me started when I used his reasoning that point each individual point contributes zero area, therefore the sum of all the areas under these ""holes"" is zero? 

If the sum is zero then how do they create a gap like I intuitively thought? or they do not?

How do I think about the area under a curve when it has an infinite number of removable discontinuities?

math,"Which Of These Probabilities Is The Important One To Know? (Bayesian Belief Networks, Probability)","Hello Friends,

I am teaching a class on Bayesian belief networks and relevant sampling techniques. I've always found this to be a pretty dry subject compared to others that we study, so to make it more fun I designed a video game to play with the concept. In brief, you are a paranormal investigator trying to determine if visiting aliens are hostile or friendly. To do this, you have a relatively complex (15 nodes and about 25 edges) BBN, and the first part of the game is to query the BBN to get a sense of when the aliens tend to visit the town. The second part is an investigation where you interview people who claim to have seen the aliens and describe their behavior as friendly or hostile. Your job is, using the insights you gained from the first step, to determine if the eye-witness report is credible or dubious, and your judgment on the aliens if determined by a majority vote, ie did most credible witnesses describe them as hostile or friendly?

**My question is about defining credibility. I have two possible answers to this:**

**A witness is credible iff P(Aliens|evidence) &gt; P(Aliens)** \- or in other words, the posterior probability given their account of events is greater than the prior probability of alien visitation.

  
**OR**

**A witness is credible iff P(evidence|Aliens) &gt; P(evidence|\~Aliens)** \- relating the probability of their account to aliens being present or not being present.

These two conditions are clearly related by Bayes rule:

P(A|evidence) = P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/P(evidence) = 

P(evidence|Aliens)P(Aliens)/(P(evidence|Aliens)\*P(Aliens)+P(evidence|\~Aliens)\*P(\~Aliens))

All the terms are there and related to each other, but it need not be the case that if one condition is met then the other is necessarily met.

One assumption about this is that we are trusting the evidence the NPC is giving us, but we doubt their claim that they actually saw the aliens. That assumption is fine for me. We also are not evaluating the probability that someone saw aliens given that they say they saw aliens, and that is also fine with me.

What do you think? Or could there be another way we can evaluate credibility?

(Tangent) The game in its more simple form (without the interview mechanic) was a real hit last year, really transforming one of the most boring lectures into one of the most fun ones. The students also learned a lot because they get to actually see and explore things that they previously only heard about - like we say rejection samplers are wasteful because most of their samples are not used. Ok, how many samples are wasted? We say Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers are extremely expensive compared to other approaches - ok, how long do they take to run on a graph like this? With algorithms like these, getting to actually explore them and see them at scale is key, and I think that actually using these objects and algorithms does a lot for learning.",ProdigiousMike,1gpccdv,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gpccdv/which_of_these_probabilities_is_the_important_one/,2024-11-12 04:13:49,13,0.79,13,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gpccdv

To visit the woman in Brooklyn he takes a train on the downtown side of the platform; to visit the woman in the Bronx he takes a train on the uptown side of the same platform. Since he likes both women equally well, he simply takes the first train that comes along. In this way, he lets chance determine whether he rides to the Bronx or to Brooklyn. The young man reaches the subway platform at a random moment each Saturday afternoon. Brooklyn and Bronx trains arrive at the station equally often—every 10 minutes. Yet for some obscure reason he finds himself spending most of his time with the woman in Brooklyn: in fact, on the average, he goes there nine times out of 10.

math,Why study so hard when AI can do the work for you?,"I love math olympiad- as a student I have pored hours into this subject, loving it for the creativity and logic needed to solve each problem.

When I heard about AlphaGeom that was referred to early 2024, I was shocked- AI has developed to the stage that it can solve questions with international olympiad level of difficulty.

Then came an article in July, praising AI for being able to achieve a high silver medal in the IMO.

At that point, I was just coping- I thought ""Oh, it solved the Algebra, Number theory, Geometry questions by blindly bashing and trying many options, but its unable to solve the combinatorics questions as it is bad at logic. Humans will forever beat AI in terms of logical reasoning."" It was true that this model solved all the questions in the IMO except the two combinatorics questions.

But I was wrong. In late 2024, OpenAI developed a new AI chatbot model o1 that, on average, solved 11/15 questions in the AIME (A math competition in the US). That's already better than me: and most of those problems are combinatorics questions.

Of course, right now these models aren't that good in combinatorics yet, but it will be able to surpass even most IMO medalists in combinatorics, in the coming years.

If AI models already beat most humans in the area of logical reasoning, whats the point of studying so much math olympiad if an AI will destroy you in it?

Why even study math in the first place then, if an AI would be much more effective than us? I'm losing motivation to study because of this...

math,Curious about forms of solutions for differential equations.,"I'll preface with I don't study differential equations and have at best a scattered understanding of parts of the theory.

When teaching or studying intro DE's, we pretty universally cover the Laplace transform as a method of solving constant coefficient linear IVPs. Some courses will also go over power series solutions to equations with nonconstant coefficients and, if they're lucky, possibly the Method of Frobenius.

Here's what I'm curious about: The motivation and ideas leading to the development of the Laplace transform itself are almost *never* taught. Things like the historical study of various integral forms and the extension of power series to a continuous indexing variable.

**Is there any well-developed study of solutions to DEs where, instead of a power series solution, we look for a solution in the form of an integral transform?**

I tried working out a few possibilities, but it seems to fail for various reasons depending on the form of the differential operator and even the form of the inhomogeneous term. For example, if we take something like a second order operator with polynomial coefficients and some forcing term g,

y''-2xy'+x^(2)y = g(x), y(0)=a, y'(0)=b

we can guess a solution of the form y=&amp;int;_0\^&amp;infin; f(t)x^(t) dt where f is an unknown function. This would be a continuum-indexed analogue of a power series solution. After substituting this into the DE, we can do some simplifying calculations and write the left side as the Laplace transform of some polynomial multiple of f. Using the properties of &amp;Lscr;, we can recast the original DE as a new DE whose solution is the Laplace transform of this unknown function f.

What seems to happen in some surprisingly simple cases is that this simply leads nowhere. It seems to be the case that if the function g is not chosen fairly carefully, then the equation expressing g as a Laplace transform of f simply has no solution. The issue is that the function g(e^(-s)) must tend towards 0 as s approaches &amp;infin; in order to be in the range of &amp;Lscr; and this simply is not the case for many reasonable choices of g.

So what gives? Why is it that a power series solution to the above equation is perfectly viable, but this integral transform solution appears not to be? And is there a better guess for a transform that *will* work? Could we perhaps try something like a ""basis"" of delta functions? I'd really like to know more about this sort of thing if it's out there.",OneMeterWonder,1gog0ff,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gog0ff/curious_about_forms_of_solutions_for_differential/,2024-11-11 00:58:53,27,0.85,27,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gog0ff

math,Looking for Good Math Typing Software,"Due to nerve damage in my hand, it makes it very difficult to grip a pen for extended periods of time. I'm looking to get back into math and eventually go back to uni for a math degree. However, given this problem, and the extreme amount of writing which is required to study math, it's a challenge that I have had difficulty finding a solution for outside of TeX-styled markdown.

Is anyone aware of a more intuitive math typing software which would allow me to to type something like:

2x^2 + 3x + 4

or something similar, and get the equivalent TeX-formatted output in real time so I can study on my computer as opposed to on paper or by typing TeX for each simplification of an equation that I'm performing?

math,Zachary Tseng's Website Updates?,"This might be a niche question - but I remember around &gt;10 years ago, I frequently visited a website made by Prof. Zachary Tseng who had a lot of notes on differential equations (exercises, explanations, breakdown of different subtopics). I enjoyed them so much that even way into my academic career, I ended up constantly going back to that site to refresh my knowledge on diff eqns. The website had a super easy user interface with wonderful printability. (silly me to not download everything back then)

However, I recently went to the site again but found out that it has been removed by the university he was teaching at with no forwarding address. Does anyone know how can I find that again?

As often occurs, I am finding that in needing to find a way to explain things to my students, I've found better ways to explain things to myself. This is the way I plan to arrive at the idea of singular vectors, and I haven't ever quite seen it shown this way before:

Evidently, the ""suggestions"" lead us to see that Av\_i and Av\_j have *remained orthogonal* after transformation by A. We can then re-define the u's to be the resulting orthonormal basis for the column-space of A, and get U \\Sigma = AV. From there, it is easy to show that the sigmas are the squareroots of the eigenvalues of A^(T)A and it all falls into place.

math,"If you could go back and reteach yourself math in childhood, what would you do differently? ","Hi all and thank you greatly in advance for any input. 

I’m a dad homeschooling my 4 y/o who seems to have a strong receptivity to math. They know their times tables through 10, can mentally perform three digit addition and subtraction problems with multiple carries quite fluidly, do various puzzles well, and generally appear to have a very strong conceptual grasp of everything we do together and why operations work out the way they do. FWIW I’m no tiger dad—I couldn’t care less how advanced my child is, I just want to help them along in their development as best I can. Nor am I trying to make any claim about my child’s abilities—I just try to do a little bit every day with them, be enthusiastic and engaging, and over the course of their childhood it’s snowballed into them being pretty far along for their age. 

As we get further along in arithmetic I find myself at a bit of a crossroads. My sense has been that one of the best things I could do with them is drill arithmetic problems/puzzles and leverage the incredible retention powers of childhood to memorize things like addition/subtraction math facts and times tables with the hope it’d strongly develop their number sense and save them a lot of time later. But I’m wondering about how far to take this: should I have them start memorizing squares and cubes through 30 or something? Should I try to get them proficient handling larger and larger numbers? Or should I focus more on introducing new concepts? 

I’m not a mathy person myself—it’d be generous to say I’m capable through basic highschool math—so I’d love some perspective from people who are highly numerate and consider math a passion: if you could go back, how would you like your math education to have been conducted? What could you have been taught early that would’ve really helped you along on your journey? What was not so helpful? I’d just really love any and all perspective of others on the other side of this mountain I never traversed so I can help my child along their journey as usefully as I can. Thank you so much!

\[The following paragraph provides context, skip to the next one if it doesn't matter\]  
I really loved math in high school and was gunning for a B,Sc in mathematics in a top university, but a tumultuous period of life kept me from applying myself to the subject for multiple years and I soon got horrifyingly bad at the most elementary areas of the subject. Now I'm doing an online degree that I *really* need to finish if I'm to live my dream of not being homeless, and part of it was an elementary course in discrete mathematics which I had been ignoring for the entire semester with a week till the final exam. I fumbled through the course material and escaped a failing grade by two marks, and it's been eating away at me how fun and interesting all the problems looked if only I were to put in the effort to build my ability up from its current uselessness. Following that line of thinking for a few months, I've now got a somewhat reignited ambition for a career in mathematics

Now, if I were to try and enter the field in any serious capacity, I'd need to do it outside of my actual degree. Once that's over I'll be competing with people who, unlike me, did not drop the ball through their secondary and tertiary education, and have proven themselves and trained at levels I am nowhere near, and might possibly never reach for my age range. I'm 23, I'm quickly losing ""fresh meat"" status as an academic in my country. I got sloppy, and now doors are closing fast

So I figure if I'm to have my hopes crushed, best have them crushed early.

I am a Master student and currently my research interests are analytic/additive number theory and extremal combinatorics. My previous background also includes computer science (CS), so I also enjoy tinkering with computers and programming, for instance, recently I got my hands on homelab and trying to play with LLMs (large language models).

As mentioned in said post, my goal is to become a professor at a university, which means I'll likely follow the usual path of PhD -&gt; postdoc -&gt; tenure-track position. However, I often worry that the time I spend tinkering and programming -- usually in the evenings -- might be ""wasted"", since I could instead use that time to skim/read papers.

So I was wondering that for those of you currently in graduate school or who have gone through this stage, *if you’re producing and publishing research in good journals, do you still manage to find time for personal hobbies? Would you say that it depends more on time management and so on?*

math,How invested should I truly be in courses? (Rant),"TLDR: Is it worth it to sacrifice ALL of my time to learn the subjects super well or should I do as my classmates and just get a passing grade and not give a damm about the material?

Hello. Second year undergraduate here, at a college with a relatively hard curriculum. I have 5 courses every semester, with 25h per week of lectures. On top of that, I devote 5h per day to studying, more on the weekends. I basically have no free time, its classes in the morning, lunch, studying in the afternoon/evening, then going to the gym, dinner, study some more, rinse and repeat. 

I feel like many of my colleagues have more free time. I usually study to the point of fully understanding the subject, quite a bit deeper than what was taught in class, this involves researching on my own, reading books outside of the curriculum and such, so in the end I am very satisfied with the outcome, as I truly love math.  But this comes with a price that is basically my entire life during that period. Students from other degrees spend most of their time having fun, with hobbies, socializing, etc.
I dropped all of my hobbies.

Even half of the students in my own degree study just to pass and don't care about learning profoundly about what they are being taught. I dont know why but the idea of not learning the math perfectly gives me so much anxiety. Just thinking about not knowing a certain part of the degree or dropping some electives in future years makes me really nervous.

Im starting to think I might be going a bit too hard, this might be some completionist syndrome type of thing.

While I love math, I'm not sure it is worth the best years of my life, Im studying in a different city, famous for its college scene, so I feel like Im wasting so much.

And then there is the dilemma of choosing whether to sacrifice my youth completely with a Masters and PhD or to go into finance or tech which is what I actually should do (for the life I want in the future) and feel like I failed at math.

math,Do you think math is an easy degree?,"I’m in my third year of my math degree at a strong university taking the most rigorous math courses (e.g. I have complex analysis, PDE, and abstract algebra right now) and while I wouldn’t say it’s a breeze, compared to some of my peers in other programs, I feel like school is going very well. 

My friends in engineering, business, life sciences, etc. are all following the stereotypes of pulling all nighters to study and having no free time, but I don’t really relate. I am also under the impression that my classmates in math are more or less the same (i.e. they do not find school as hard as many non-math people do). Do you think this is something unique to math majors?

I have a few theories as to why this might be the case:

1. The material in math is so difficult that there is an upper limit to how fast the courses can move, so if you are good at math it’s easy to keep up (although this seems a bit contradictory)
2. People in math are naturally smart and good at school (egotistical but I do notice a correlation)
3. People generally don’t pursue math unless they are very very good at it

I’m curious to hear whether my experience is common among math majors and if people have any other explanations for this.",Warheadd,1gmnu14,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gmnu14/do_you_think_math_is_an_easy_degree/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gmnu14/do_you_think_math_is_an_easy_degree/,2024-11-08 17:21:52,436,0.85,436,0,264,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gmnu14

math,I want to REALLY understand geometry. What books do I need?,"(Sorry, the title is a bit ridiculous.) Context and current place: I am a statistician &amp; data scientist by trade - calc, linear algebra, tensor nonsense, yep all good. I had a proof class in undergrad but it's been so long I forgot all of it. So I'm going through *A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics,* which promises to remind me of what I've forgotten.

But I really like prime numbers, and I had a teacher decades ago who said, ""all math is geometry,"" and I want to play around with both of those things. So I've decided I'd like to dive very, obnoxiously deep into geometry. I assume it will take me years. That's ok. I'm quite bored. It may pay dividends at some point by connecting back to my understanding of the operations of neural networks, who knows.

Does anyone know a series of books or some set of books (videos won't work, I need to be able to do problems till I understand it) that would be useful? Minimal cost is preferable, but usually this crap is textbooks so I can accept some pain. A lot of math textbooks are truly very poorly written, though, or written with the intention of a professor doing most of the work (so, poorly written).

They convey the intuitions behind the abstract objects. You want to make it look elegant. You don't want every equation to be three times as long.

But if we have hundreds of DiffGeo textbooks WHY CAN'T ONE OF THEM JUST WRITE DOWN EVERY F-ING DETAIL FOR ONCE. No, you DON'T get to ""choose coordinates x\_j"". Maybe it could be useful to just, like, maybe distinguish the dozen types of derivatives you have defined not just for one page after the definition, but maybe, uuuhm, till the end of the textbook? All of these things are functions, all of these objects are types, and have you maybe considered that actually precisely specifying the functional relationships and clarifying each type could be USEFUL TO THE STUDENT? Especially when you're not just sketching an exercise but demonstrating FUNDAMENTAL CALCULATIONS IN THE THEORY. How hard is it to just ALWAYS write the point at which stuff happens?

You just need to make sure they are. No big ideas, no originality.

But lots and lots of reading and verification. So much that basically nobody wanted to do it and my advisor basically decided that I should do it and made that my entire PhD instead of giving me a chance to make original contributions.

here is a screenshot of the theorem in question:

where the ""positive part"" is defined as T\^+ = 1/2 (B+T) where B = (T\^2)\^(1/2).

my question is: why is the ""positive part"" used?

If we consider just the operator T\_lambda itself, then the projection onto the nullspace of T-lambdaI is just the projection onto the ""eigenspace"" (with the caveat that lambda could be a non-eigenvalue spectral value i.e. in the continuous spectrum of T) corresponding to the spectral value lambda; this to me is somewhat reminiscent of the finite-dimensional case; which involves a sum over projections onto the eigenspaces of T.

So why is the additional definition of the ""positive part"" of this operator needed?

I noticed that it had a few papers in it but didn't think much of it until I got home and pulled out the papers. To my surprise, it includes the following:

* A handwritten letter from January 1995. It said ""FEDORYUK. According to Sergai Slavyanov, Fedoryuk died when he fell off a railway platform and landed on the back of his head. Might have been pushed? Mightc have had hangover?""
* A printed out email with a bunch of people from Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Duke, etc. (i can provide the names but i dont wanna dox people from like 30 years ago) just saying that they saw a sticker on a truck that said ""JESUS IS COMING: LOOK BUSY"" that weekend. A few of the recipients have passed away but a couple are still alive and well.
   * I have no idea how this ended up at my university (UMN)
* A few summaries of the book from Springer.
* A handwritten summary that has the table of contents.
* What I find most interesting: Inside the book, someone wrote ""To professor F.W.J Olver with compliments from the author."" Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything from Fedoryuk himself :(
* The book was valued at $130 at the time and I feel like a thief when I found out because it was free

math,Pictures of Spec Z[X],"I've been reading Reid's Undergraduate Commutative Algebra, and it's been a really enjoyable read.  I appreciate the effort he puts into motivating the development of ring and module theory.  The use of first person is unusual, but this is one of the few cases where I don't mind seeing so much of the author's personality.  And Atiyah and MacDonald's exceedingly terse text feels somewhat more penetrable after reading this book.

That said, the book teases and hints at a lot of advanced math, which is cool but frustrating.  For instance, in the opening chapters he draws a couple of pictures of things like Spec k\[X,Y\] and Spec Z\[X\].  He tells the reader that it's okay if you don't understand these pictures at this point.  

I feel like a novitiate and I'm being shown a Zen riddle by a master, who tells me that I will understand it someday when I'm enlightened enough.  What does it take to really understand these pictures?  Do algebraic geometers each have their own way of visualizing prime spectra?

math,How to measure credibility? ,"When thinking about people making good and bad predictions, I got to wondering how one could design a system of rating people's predictions and the corresponding observation about whether they were right.  

To make things simple, let's say that a person has a probability distribution p over a random variable X, which is a prediction of a future event.  So for example X could be a roll of a die with support {1,2,3,4,5,6} and they believe the die is biased with probability distribution 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/2.

We roll the die once and the outcome is observed.  

How do we rate the credibility of the person based on their probability distribution and whatever the observed result is?  I.e. how can we assign them a score for their prediction, with the following obviously desirable properties.

1. They earn a positive score when their prediction seems to agree with the outcome, however that is measured.

2. If they assign to event X=i the probability 50%, then they neither earn nor lose points if X=i occurs.

The score should somehow reflect the value of the person as a source of information and prediction.  The two points above are not the only important considerations -- another would be informativeness of the prediction.  For example, if someone predicts that the sun will come up tomorrow, that's not very informative, so you shouldn't earn many points when the sun rises.  But I'll think about how to incorporate those kinds of considerations later.  

Is this the kind of thing people have already studied?

math,Is Seifert-van Kampen comparable to inclusion-exclusion?,"My understanding of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem is that for two spaces U and V, pi_1(U \cup V) can be written as a free product of pi_1(U) and pi_1(V), modulo pi_1(U \cap V). Intuitively, the free product is the naive way of combining the fundamental groups of two spaces, but it leads to overcounting the loops, so we then rein in our guess by quotienting out the stuff we double counted.

math,Reading Recommendations in “Institutional” History of Mathematics,"It's not a big secret that good books on the history of relatively modern mathematics are few and far between. Sure, there are some memoirs, autobiographies, overviews of some particular fields, collections of anecdotes, and a few books on the history of mathematics in general, but little of what professional historians would call a serious history text — something that would concern the institutions, politics, economics, and other extra-mathematical contexts involved in the development of modern mathematics as a historically-grounded enterprise. 

This probably shouldn't come as too big of a surprise given the comparatively small number of academic mathematicians, the seemingly parochial, obscure, esoteric nature of the field in the eyes of historians, and the fact that few of the working professionals would have enough of historical “knack” to write a reliable history.

Yet still, there are many questions that could be easily asked and less easily answered regarding the every day matters of institutional mathematics.

How would they justify themselves to the government in the matters of, say, funding? How would they justify themselves to the universities? How did they attract students to the programs? What were the typical career paths of math students in, say, mid-20th century? What was the demographics of math departments: age, class, gender? What was expected to know from a freshman, a bachelor, phd candidate? When, why, where the pure math programs were created? How do external factors come into play — is it an accident, for example, that planned-economy era soviet mathematicians were dominant in optimisation and probability? And so on, and so on, and so on.

If you have any readings that could shed some light on those matters, any resources, even if indirect (personal diaries, biographies, statistics, old reports, etc), I'd be immensely thankful if you share them here.

math,Is it just me or is stochastic calculus extremely difficult?,"Some background: I’m a master’s student in mathematics, and during my bachelor’s degree, I took a course on stochastic calculus. I took it because I enjoyed both measure theory and measure-theoretic probability theory and was interested in seeing how they are used, for example, in mathematical finance. However, I found the course more difficult than any other that I had taken up to that point, so much so that I decided to drop it halfway through. Concretely, I had a hard time keeping track of all the very technical definitions and developing an intuition for the presented concepts.

Fast forward to my master’s studies, and I chose to take a course on numerical methods for mathematical finance, with only measure-theoretic probability theory as a prerequisite. Halfway through the course, we started discussing the basics of Brownian motion, stochastic calculus and SDEs, and once again, I found myself struggling in the same way I did during the stochastic calculus course.

All of this has got me wondering if maybe stochastic calculus “isn’t for me.” Has anyone else had similar experiences?",Fresh_Job5475,1gllkp4,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gllkp4/is_it_just_me_or_is_stochastic_calculus_extremely/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gllkp4/is_it_just_me_or_is_stochastic_calculus_extremely/,2024-11-07 08:06:06,94,0.94,94,0,40,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gllkp4

math,How to disicpline myself in higher mathematics?,"I'm in my final year of undergraduate mathematics, though it is only my second year as a mathematics major (long story short, I switched majors a few times). What sparked my interest was how beautiful I found the subject of calculus to be, but, while currently suffering through a course in abstract linear algebra, I am beginning to realize two things especially: (1) how naive I was of the abstract logical structures underlying mathematics, and (2) how mathematically immature I am. The former is a wonderful surprise; the latter, not so much. When I discuss the homework problems with my classmates, I'll discuss my prolonged and awkward-but-successful proofs, and most of the time they'll laugh and show me their 3-line proof, making it seem trivial. It is good that I am surrounded by people more experienced in higher mathematics, and it has only made me hungrier for improvement. I'm often pessimistic due to my frequent inability to focus, but I want to change my mindset and gain confidence.

My most conspicuous shortcoming: problem-solving, the heart of mathematics itself. I'm poor at it, and I want to be better. So, how would you suggest I go about improving this skill? I've taken courses in calculus (my first love in mathematics) and differential equations, real analysis, abstract algebra, and linear algebra. I feel like my knowledge of mathematics is sparse, so I'd like to develop a routine familiarity with the major reappearing concepts, motifs, and whatnot. Above all, I want to practice, practice, practice. Where can I find problems to solve? Of course, there are textbook exercises, but what are some other resources?

math,effective remaining area in circle packing,"I'm working on a problem where I'm packing circles of unequal radii sequentially into a rectangle

because I'm doing this sequentially, it would help if I can somehow the capture of how much effective area is remaining after I place a certain number of circles into the rectangle

for instance, for 4 circles I could:
1. pack all 4 in 1 corner
2. pack 2 in 1 corner, pack 2 in another
3. pack all 4 right in the centre of the rectangle

for all 3 methods, the area that remains afterward is the same, but methods 1 and 2 are clearly superior because the area that remains still allows for more circles of larger areas to be placed, whereas method 3 prevents that (i.e. the effective area that remains is reduced)

so, is there a way I can capture this notion?

math,Math app recommendations for kids with learning disabilities,"Hello,

I work at a K-12 special education school. Kids are low to low-moderate and have some form of ADHD/ADD, are on the spectrum, or have dyslexia/dyscalculia to some degree.  Our math program is in need of restructuring and is a subject students struggle with the most, so I've been tasked with compiling a list of math software apps and looking into a good few options. The highest level we go to is Algebra 1 and Geometry in high school. Some problem areas:

* Elementary - developing number sense/numeracy. Our lowest kids have difficulty adding/subtracting without counting
* Middle school - fractions are the biggest thing that confuses students
* High School - lack of basic arithmetic knowledge/numeracy. Some kids in geometry can't do basic operations with fractions.

Either way, across the board, numeracy and basic arithmetic is something that is a struggle for some of our students.

The tricky part is not every student starts in elementary. Because we're an NPS, districts send their kids to us from all different grade levels and knowledge (but they all have some form of learning disability). We may get kids enrolling as early as 1st or late as 12th grade. So some of those basic numeracy skills need to be honed for our high schoolers who are really behind.

Here is a working list of apps I've been looking into. I'd love any additional feedback on some apps that you've worked with or are familiar with--any other suggestions not on the list are welcome!

Of course, critical feedback is more than welcome. There are so many of these out there it can be hard to choose, but I wanted to cast a wide net because we are different from your traditional public school.

* **Banzai** \- seems more applied (financial literacy) with real-life focused problems
* **Beestar** \- parents can monitor performance online. also gives motivational recognitions every week to encourage students
* **GeoGebra** \- was looking into an option for geometry and this was the top result
* **Illustrative Mathematics** \- has built-in assessments and hands-activities, review-focused
* **Gimkit/Prodigy** \- very gamified, can create own questions and students have to answer them to proceed in the game or get 'energy' etc.
* **iReady** \- Good as a diagnostic tool. Helpful in knowing a student's grade level and gaps in knowledge
* **IXL** \- great for review and practice. Not as visual as other apps
* **Khan Academy** \- particularly looking into Khan Academy Kids for K-8 but seems like a strong resource for geometry
* **Nessy Numbers (Woodin)** \- seems good for building numeracy/number sense 
* **Splashlearn** \- very visual and engaging
* **Zearn** \- K-5, seems good for early math review/practice",shuai_bear,1glccdh,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glccdh/math_app_recommendations_for_kids_with_learning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1glccdh/math_app_recommendations_for_kids_with_learning/,2024-11-06 23:25:25,11,0.87,11,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1glccdh

Most of us were originally enrolled 3 courses, but pretty much all of us have since dropped to 2 due to being overwhelmed. Even taking just 2 courses is comparably difficult to my undergrad where I was able to manage 5 without too much difficulty.

math,An interesting problem related to elections,"I've been thinking of this question for a few months now, and all the talk about the elections have only made me think more about this, so here it goes.

Let's say there's a two-party system in a country, where P1 and P2 are the parties. Let's say I define a quantity called ""vote density"" for each of these parties, p1 and p2 - p1(x,y)dx dy would be the number of votes that the party P1 receives in an infinitesimal rectangular area of side lengths dx, dy, at the point (x,y), divided by the total population in that infinitesimal area- similar to a 2d probability density. The vote density p2(x,y) is defined in an analogous fashion. In general, there could be less than perfect voter turnout, so the sum of these voter densities, p1+p2 would be less than or equal to 1 for all (x,y).

Now let us say that the elections in this country work by splitting the country into smaller constituencies/counties. Whichever party gets higher votes in a particular county is declared the ""winner"" of that county, and whoever wins in the majority of the counties is declared the winner and forms the government. Further let us assume the vote density functions p1 and p2 are known, and that the county borders are given.

1) Let us define the total vote share of a party to be the integral of its vote density function. Can it be possible for party P1 to have a lesser vote share than party P2, but still win the elections - maybe in a way where P1 loses heavily in a select few counties and wins marginally in a larger number of counties, by virtue of which, the total vote share of P1 is lesser, but it is still declared the winner. What are the conditions for this to happen? 

2) Related to my above question, let's say the total vote share of P1 is less than that of P2. Can I always come up with a bordering of the counties such that P1 still manages to win? Or is there any ""critical vote share"" for P1, which if it fails to reach, no design of country borders can help it win? If yes, what is this critical vote share? If no, how do we construct such a county bordering?


3) Now let's say we only know the total vote shares of both the parties, and not the vote density functions themselves. I want to design my counties in such a way that leading in the vote share correlates to winning the elections - I wish to avoid a system where a party like P1, which has lower vote share, gets a ""rogue"" win due to a poor design of borders. Can I come up with an optimal county design which minimizes the chances of these ""rogue"" wins? If yes, under what conditions, and how do we design it? Does the chance of these rogue wins also depend on the voter turnout? That is, does a higher value of p1(x,y)+p2(x,y) result in lesser chances of rogue wins?


4) Do these questions also have answers for multi party systems?


Do any of these questions come under any particular field as such? Are there any resources to read more about these ideas? Also, I guess I haven't been too rigorous in formulating my problem, but I've tried to keep it as intuitive as possible.

math,"Next ""step"" after studying Ext groups.","I'm presenting to a small group of fellow graduate students on homological algebra in a few days. The loose structure is that we take turns studying a concept and then presenting it to the group. We've generally been trying to follow Gelfand and Manin's Methods on Homological Algebra, though we've jumped around the book a bit, and some have taught concepts in different ways than what is presented in the book. So, our structure is pretty loose, if that makes sense.

Two weeks ago I talked about chain complexes and resolutions (with an emphasis on projective resolutions). Last week, someone built off of this defining Ext using projective resolutions and proved that any two different projective resolutions give isomorphic groups. Now, my question: Where should I take it from there?

Gelfand and Manin don't define Ext groups until they construct the derived category. This construction is obviously quite in-depth, and it would take me weeks, if not a month, to parse through the details, build up the derived category, then redefine Ext groups and progress the class further. So, the deeper meaning behind my question is: Is there a good place to take the class from our current ""naive"" definition of Ext groups without diving head-first into the category-theory side of things? Or is the next natural progression going to entail us fully embracing category theory, in which case it makes sense to take several weeks carefully defining the derived category?

I emailed the professor who technically ""runs"" the class (mostly, he only attends and lets us run things). He suggested I could discuss taking the category of complexes and considering morphisms up to homotopy. Then, talk about the mapping cone of a morphism. This feels to me like we'd still be embracing the category theory of things, but side stepping a lot of important details. In this case, it feels better to me to follow Gelfand and Manin and begin constructing the derived category, since that's where we'd be winding up anyway.

So, my question seems to be: Is the next natural step to embrace category theory head-on, let it take what time it may? Or is there a natural way to continue the class without embracing the category theory of things? (Thus far, people have been avoiding heavy doses of category theory).",DevilDuckTy,1gko2wd,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gko2wd/next_step_after_studying_ext_groups/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gko2wd/next_step_after_studying_ext_groups/,2024-11-06 02:25:35,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gko2wd

Asking on behalf of my 2, almost 3 year old. 

He is speech-delayed and recently diagnosed with ASD. He is absolutely obsessed with numbers and addition/subtraction and has been for the past 1.5 years.

Some other things he likes are organising cereal into sets of 5s / 10s / 20s etc. He’ll count the sets, add them together, and move them between different containers. He counts/organises everything around the house; shoes, articles of clothing, squares on the window pane etc. I’ll give him a bunch of vegetables to play with while I’m making dinner and he’ll add the potatoes, take some away etc. Also loves shapes and moves his little magnet triangles together to make “diamonds” and so on. He refers to everyday objects as shapes , eg he calls my phone the “rectangle” and his playpen “hexagon” and coins are “circles” 

He also loves planets and everything related to
space. He gathers balls of various sizes (basketballs, golf balls, bouncy balls etc) and lines them up, pretending they are the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus etc. up until Pluto. He seems to know a bit about each one like Saturn has “icy rings” and Neptunes “windy”, Mars is the “red one”. I got him play dough and he mixed colours together and made little planets out of it. I had to google what the planets actually looked like and he was actually spot on. I think he maybe learned this from watching Blues Clues, not entirely sure tbh because he can’t speak in sentences and only has a handful of words. 

But anyways, I feel like 95% of the games he plays are focused around maths/space and I’d like to encourage that, but struggling to come up with how. I ask him questions but he can’t answer me. 

Would really appreciate any ideas/suggestions on what I could do with him, or even where to begin as a grown adult to improve my math skills to, in turn, help him? He is so eager to learn.

math,Emailing a Professor Regarding their Research ,"Hey all,

I'm currently a 3rd year student in a mathematical sciences degree. Recently, my course received a talk with regards to pursuing a PhD after finishing our 4 year degree, and one of the main points highlighted was to start looking for potential areas of research that interest you.

A class that has really caught my attention though is numerical methods for PDEs. My professor for this class has mentioned before that the contents align closely with her research, which is something that's grabbing my interest for potential post graduate research.

My question is, would it be acceptable to simply email her and ask more about her research, mentioning that I'm really interested in her class and would be interested in pursuing this topic further?

math,XMJR,"So, just to warn you, the content of this post is admittedly a very low-stakes issue and in fact I'm not even sure about exactly what the question I want to ask is.

Basically the thing is: what the heck is the XJMR community? By XJMR I mean www.econjobrumors.com.

It has happened to me a few times, when googling some math related topic, to bump into a post in XJMR. Over time I started to develop a sort of zoologic interest in the species that seems to populate that forum, or more specifically the sub-forums concerned with academic mathematics.

If I had to describe my impressions of the community that inhabits those sub-forums in a couple of sentences, I would say that they seem to share two traits that I find it hard to imagine together in a single individual, namely: they seem to be pretty shallow, superficial people who have a hard time taking seriously any life pursuit that is not money or women; *and* they seem to spend lots of time researching and gossiping about the mathematics academic job market (even though they are mostly, if not only, ""outsiders"").

Am I the only one who finds this combination peculiar? As an example, some time ago there was a topic about some rumour that Ashwin Sah, the renowned combinatorics star under Yufei Zhao, was moving to industry. People were speculating about why that was, and one of the comments was:

""Combinatorics is a low-prestige field. Mostly just tricks, not big ideas. At some point a man realizes that any endeavour in life which doesn't make big money, get women or achieve high-status is basically pointless, and I'm glad AS came to this realization at such a young age.""

So here we have somebody who is shallow enough to believe that ""any endeavour in life which doesn't make big money, get women or achieve high-status is basically pointless"", while at the same time making clear that they have some non-trivial inside knowledge of math research. Now, don't get me wrong; I don't think that combinatorics is a ""low-prestige field"" because there are no ""big ideas"", but it does have that reputation and it's an opinion that only someone familiar with the math research community could possibly have.

So... who exactly are these people? Why do they care so much about who gets hired in what math department, when they could be looking up fancy cars to get them dates with hot women, which seems to be pretty much all they care about otherwise?",superkapa219,1gkzgsv,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gkzgsv/xmjr/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gkzgsv/xmjr/,2024-11-06 14:15:12,1,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gkzgsv

math,"I've developed mathematics for a non-human mind from my comic, and I'm interested in what you think about it.","This is a story about sapient distant descendants of rats, known as packers, living on Earth millions of years after the extinction of humans, began to develop mathematics using cognitive mechanisms never intended for such tasks. Due to an evolutionary quirk, multiplication came more naturally to them than addition, and their mathematics reflects this.

Packers write numbers as shapes, with each number having a corresponding number of corners.

[image 1](https://preview.redd.it/61t02k8j69zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1fae9d1bf27db3b92204ddf232a16c3c342136)

And they write large numbers as nested shapes. The number inside is multiplied by the number outside.

[image 2](https://preview.redd.it/captnd1l69zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a5af6c2f4567a1b4c83754262935d35bf79fcc)

Examples of some numbers:

[image 3](https://preview.redd.it/upi30ghm69zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=818901801ec0fcda31f066daea04e76d1aa10a53)

Packers haven't invented 0 yet. They haven't even invented 1! In fact, they don’t need the concept of ""one"" much in their system. There's no need to say ""I ate one fish"" when they can simply say ""I ate fish"". (The fact that it's easier for them to multiply than to add has also had an impact).

Packers can't yet write large prime numbers, like 101 or 10,501, because they would have to draw a huge shape to represent them! Even writing 17 or 19 would be quite difficult if they only used convex shapes.

https://preview.redd.it/o4k6zjmo69zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=708e3f9013be63a36fb7b20f00ae6a2e3894407d

So packers use non-convex shapes too!

https://preview.redd.it/09rhm6m279zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c16fddd812e615691430d348b487c76066dd86ca

Many years later, some packer noticed that large prime numbers look suspiciously symmetric.

https://preview.redd.it/kew2kov479zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0331a79a552a630d3f54dbcf354f71d7e4352ab

So this packer improved the notation system and made it clearer.

https://preview.redd.it/arzughp579zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=267a0cb8f79ff45fe165b874b4157a6e98b00f9f

Later, another packer simplified this system even more, deciding that there was no point in writing the same shapes twice.

https://preview.redd.it/1kcldqm679zd1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122aebe0aab3fc7eb30ebb7762b3e4e26ad925c1

This packer was the first in their culture to declare that ""a dot isolated from a number"" should also be considered a number. The packer called this dot ""the wonderful number that's less than two"".

Many years later, another packer made an important innovation: the ""dot isolation"" could be repeated multiple times as long as the result remained odd. When the result became even, it could undergo a ""two isolation"" (division by two). The final result will be a series of dots and twos.

Here's an example for the number 60:

This invention led to the creation of a binary system based on one and two, which had a significant impact on the technological advancement of packers.

math,I plotted the complex roots of an arbitrary cubic polynomial on the complex plane.,"[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cy3agqh4du](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cy3agqh4du)

The result is kind of fun to watch. Roots collide, split, and repel as the coefficients vary. If anyone wants to tinker, let me know if there are any interesting axes to jointly vary coefficients by that produce interesting behaviors. The following are the same code, but just with different combinations of varying parameters/different offsets, and I would be interested in seeing if varying specific expressions (e.g. the discriminant) would produce illuminating paths for the roots.

(I also found out today that Desmos has a complex plotter now... would have been helpful a while ago lol but this seems to be pretty stable regardless.)

math,Books that explain Limits 'intuitively',"I am reading Prelude to Numbers and Mathematician's Delight by W.W Sawyer. And thanks to some internet troll I discovered Professor Gowers's blog where I stumbled upon [this article ](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/what-maths-a-level-doesnt-necessarily-give-you/#more-4693)which concludes with ""...the general principle that if you forget about understanding what’s going on and concentrate on mechanical manipulations, you’ll forget how to do even the mechanical manipulations."" 

1. This led me to wonder if there are books that intuitively build the idea of limits (and the implications of this idea and so on) without requiring the student to have encountered Analysis.   
  
2. Alternatively, I was wondering if there are books/pathways that circumvent limits entirely by approaching calculus through some other way. Maybe nonstandard calculus?   
  
3. Or is there a way to introduce someone not at the undergraduate level to Analysis in a way that helps them understand Limits better?! I am groping in the dark so maybe this is all very absurd to even ask. 

So far, from the r/math FAQ I found ""Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach"" by Keisler"" which might fit the bill. 

Lastly, I realize that Mir Publishers, AMS, Dover among others have books that intuitively build various mathematical ideas. I was hoping to hear about your favorite books of this nature (could be about any topic, not just calculus or limits).

math,Mathematics Summer School ,"I am surprised by the fact that there is so little opportunity for interested people to do mathematics over the summer. It is incredibly busy during term time but in summer there is a void with nothing to do. It is particularly bad in the UK where active lectures and seminars only run for 20 weeks a year(the rest is self study but I would still prefer more term time). I remember feeling a great hunger for studying in summer but I had nowhere to go apart from books and internet, and while they are a good way to study, they can't replace a live community and education. There are some math related opportunities in summer around the world but the list is honestly not very inspiring.

I want to setup an online summer school for people interested in doing more maths over the summer. It would involve courses mostly for school students and undergrads. But I don't think graduates and postdocs would find this useful since they are likely too busy with their own projects. It would also try to create a sense of community with discussions, group projects, and active engagement(which could all be done very easily with discord). I expect that the courses would be run by more experienced people who want to earn some cash, such as graduates or late undergrads, but all people should be welcome to run their course, including professors and postdocs. A big part of it would probably have to be volunteering but at the same time, I could expect a few dozen students from all over the world to enroll in a 5 week course(say) for a hundred bucks, which would make some good money for whoever's running the course while lecturing for only 3 hours a week.

People from less mathematically specialised universities could catch up with maths they are missing on, like analysis courses, while people from more specialised places could delve in topics that their university doesn't have courses in. High schoolers could get into olympiad mathematics or get a taste of university mathematics.

math,Spot it - but with three cards?,"Most of you probably know the math behind the ""[Spot it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobble)""/""Dobble"" game. If not, read about it [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36798/what-is-the-math-behind-the-game-spot-it).   
tl;dr: The cards are designed after the finite projective plane of order 7. Each card is equivalent to a line, each symbol on the card to a point and because two lines meet in exactly one point, two cards (=lines) will always have exactly one symbol (=point) in common.

Over the weekend I was thinking how to make this game harder. **Can you have n cards with k symbols on each of it such that the intersection of any three cards is exactly one symbol, but the intersection of only two cards is more than one symbol?** I read a lot about [Block design ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design)and [Combinatorial design ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design)and I am still not sure how to tackle this problem. I don't think a ""t=3-block design"" is what I am searching for because this would just make each triple of symbols occur on only one card - this is not what I am searching for.  
  
The only non-trivial solution I could think of is 4 cards with 4 symbols: 123, 124, 134, 234. If you pick any three cards here, all of those will have all symbols except one, so the intersection is 4-3 symbols.   
I have a gut feeling that larger solutions might not be possible, because for large n, there are many more way to choose 3 cards out of n as there are for choosing 2 cards out of n and therefore, the ""intersection is 1 symbol""-condition is much more restrictive.

So, are there larger non-trivial solutions you could use to design a similiar, harder game? What exact ""combinatorical design"" term do I need to search for?

math,Question about a reducible complexity,"I'm a high school student who was thinking about tetration, pentation, etc. the other day and was curious if there was a more precise way to define them. I spent some time and came up with the recursive function f(n,k,a,b), where the function obeys the following rules:

1. f(n,k,a,b)=f(n,1,a,f(n,k-1,a,b)

2. f(n,1,a,b)=f(n-1,b-1,a,a)

3. f(1,1,a,b)=a+b

I'm pretty happy in general; the function derives multiplication, exponentiation, etc. on its own with the form f(n,1,a,b), with n=2 equaling a\*b, n=3 equaling a\^b, etc. However, the k is just a result of my process in reducing the function and is not in the input. Is it possible to come up with a new function that does the same thing with a domain of only three dimensions?

An example of a question before the reformation:

&gt;*""(b) A sphere spinning in equilibrium on top of a rough horizontal cylinder is slightly disturbed; prove that the track of the point of contact is initially a helix. (c) If the sphere has a centrally symmetrical law of density such as to make the radius of gyration a certain fraction of the radius then, whatever the spin, the track is a helix so long as contact lasts. (Marked at 200; a second part about further details carried another 105.)""*

There're more from Gower's website but I can only put 20 images here. Is this some sort of AI?

I originally noticed something strange when I saw every single comments under Terrence Tao's blog got 16 dislikes.

The Victor Porton guy from one of the image seemed a little off. But I don't see how he would be motivated to do this.

Who's actually behind this all? Why do they do this?

**Update:**

I got a screenshot of the username who made the comments that were deleted on Terrence Tao's website. They seem to be still spamming there but some precautions seems to be taken. When I hit refresh these comments go away.

For a long time I avoided it due to its notoriety and read Vakil's *Rising Sea* and Liu's *Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves* instead, but both of them never clicked for me. Vakil's book has way too many exercises that disrupt the flow of the book, and somehow I feel like I never know where he is trying to go. I've only read the first few pages of Liu's book, but I remember it being extremely dense and confusing to read. After struggling with AG for so long, I decided to bite the bullet last summer and read Hartshorne from the start, doing most of its exercises. And I regret so much not doing this earlier because this book really changed how I see AG. To me his style of writing is so much clearer than the two authors before, and I also found most of his exercises really enjoyable to work on. I've only read up to the middle of chapter 3, but this is already much further than I got in the other two books.

The logic behind this is choosing one number, raising it to the power of another number, and now the power becomes the base (the power becomes the second number).

But now, after discovering TGView, which already does something similar with visualizing mathematical relationships, I’m wondering if my project brings enough unique value to keep going.

math,Set Theory Multiverse vs Mathematical Truth - Philosophical Discussion,"#

I've been thinking about the set theory multiverse and its philosophical implications, particularly regarding mathematical truth. While I understand the pragmatic benefits of the multiverse view, I'm struggling with its philosophical implications.

The multiverse view suggests that statements like the Continuum Hypothesis aren't absolutely true or false, but rather true in some set-theoretic universes and false in others. We have:

- Gödel's Constructible Universe (L) where CH is true
- Forcing extensions where CH is false
- Various universes with different large cardinal axioms

However, I find myself appealing to basic logical principles like the law of non-contradiction. Even if we can't currently prove certain axioms, doesn't this just reflect our epistemological limitations rather than implying all axioms are equally ""true""?

To make an analogy: physical theories being underdetermined by evidence doesn't mean reality itself is underdetermined. Similarly, our inability to prove CH doesn't necessarily mean it lacks a definite truth value.

Questions I'm wrestling with:
1. What makes certain axioms ""true"" beyond mere consistency?
2. Is there a meaningful distinction between mathematical existence and consistency?
3. Can we maintain mathematical realism while acknowledging the practical utility of the multiverse approach?
4. How do we reconcile Platonism with independence results?

I'm leaning towards a view that maintains objective mathematical truth while explaining why we need to work with multiple models pragmatically. But I'm very interested in hearing other perspectives, especially from those who work in set theory or mathematical logic.",wenitte,1gh5997,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gh5997/set_theory_multiverse_vs_mathematical_truth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gh5997/set_theory_multiverse_vs_mathematical_truth/,2024-11-01 13:22:10,26,0.71,26,0,79,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gh5997

math,When is the “path length” function continuous?,"Every once in a while, a “proof” that pi = 4 makes the rounds on the internet. The gist is that you inscribe a circle in a square, and then slowly collapse the square path around the circle while keeping it rectilinear, so the square path keeps a total length of 4. Since it converges uniformly to the circular path, people assume that the path lengths must converge as well, and thus pi = 4.

Of course, the mistake here is assuming that just because the paths p_n converge to p, the lengths length(p_n) converge to length(p). It’s common that stronger modes of convergence guarantee stronger properties of the limit, like convergence in probability vs. almost everywhere. For these paths, we at least have uniform convergence. My question is: does there exist, or can we describe, a mode of convergence for the paths that actually does guarantee convergence of the lengths, i.e. makes the length function continuous?",hydmar,1ggjmh9,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ggjmh9/when_is_the_path_length_function_continuous/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ggjmh9/when_is_the_path_length_function_continuous/,2024-10-31 17:10:29,52,0.87,52,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ggjmh9

math,Dealing With Imposter Syndrome,"I'm currently a pure math undergrad student with a minor in comp sci. My ultimate goal is to work for a couple years after I'm done with undergrad and go for a PhD in applied math. I recently changed from comp sci to math because I love the subject. Also I don't like the way math is taught in engineering like courses. 

This is my first semester as a pure math undergrad and I'm getting imposter syndrome. It's a different cohort in these classes even compared to engineering. I know it's just ego but it's throwing me off. I'm not doing poorly, all A's and B's despite taking 15 credit hours and raising a young family. But it's the first time I've had peers so similar in ability and interest around me (and honestly I have one friend who is actually a genius). This makes me feel like I'm not talented enough to get into a PhD program because I hear they are really competitive. That thought is devastating to me. It took me a long time to figure out what I want to do, it would hurt so much to not have the ability to do it.

math,A potential looser definition of a limit,"Consider the following (extremely contrived function): f(x) = 1 if floor(x) is a perfect square, else 0.

By the normal definition of a limit, the limit of this function is not 0 as x approaches infinity. However, in some sense, it does seem like this function is approaching 0. The non-zero parts get spaced further and further apart as x increases. 

Also, for this function, the limit of (integral from 0 to x) / x does approach 0 as x approaches infinity. This looser definition of a limit seems to hold for most functions that traditionally approach 0 as well, and doesn't seem to hold for most functions that obviously don't approach 0 (i think), which makes me think that I might be on to something.

math,Are there Electoral College totals that are not possible?,"A couple days ago I saw a humourous tweet talking about someone's prediction for the upcoming presidential election, to the effect of: Harris - 1, Harris - 2, Harris - 3, etc. (the joke being that the user was just going to list all the numbers between 1 and 538). But that got me thinking, are there any numbers that cannot be reached with the current Electoral College breakdown? Don't worry, this is not a political post. 

For this discussion, we will ignore the way that Nebraska and Maine divide their Electoral College votes (I don't think this adds much in terms of complexity to the problem, but I didn't want to think too much about it). I am also ignoring faithless electors. With that being said, it is clear that one cannot get 1 or 2 EC votes (with the above caveat). ~~Similarly, one cannot get 485 to 537 votes (since 484 is all the states minus California). You similarly cannot 445 to 535 (since 444 is the total count without California and Texas).~~
Edit: It has been brought to my attention that my logic here is flawed. Thank you all for pointing it out. One can achieve e.g. 535 by winning all the states except for Wyoming. The running theory is that 1, 2, 536, and 537 are still impossible, unless we consider Maine and Nebraska, in which case everything works.
 And I am certain that there are more numbers which one cannot hit, but I'm not sure, and I'm not sure if there is an efficient means to check.

 As described, I believe that this is just a variation of the[ subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem), which does not bode well for finding a solution. I have written up some inefficient Python code that I fear will not end, since it just checks all possible sums. I have also considered trying to implement the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I'm not sure that could even help. My question then is, is there a quick (re: polynomial time) way to figure out which values are IMPOSSIBLE to hit, or perhaps a way that I can prune out some of the states (for instance, if they were superfluous) which could make a brute force quicker? Any advice is greatly appreciated. This has been eating away at me, and I have more pressing things to worry about, haha!

Edit: Thank you all very much for your thoughtful discussions! Another (possibly interesting) question to ask is what is the fewest number of electoral votes one can move around to make some number inaccessible.

math,Wikipedia’s class existence theorem for NBG,"On the wiki page for [NBG set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory#Class_existence_theorem), it states and proves the Class existence theorem as:

Let ϕ(x1,…,xn,Y1,…,Ym) be a formula that quantifies only over sets and contains no free variables other than x1,…,xn,Y1,…,Ym (not necessarily all of these). Then for all Y1,…,Ym, there exists a unique class A of n-tuples such that:∀x1⋯∀xn\[(x1,…,xn)∈A⟺ϕ(x1,…,xn,Y1,…,Ym)\].

Dealing with tuples seems to overcomplicate things though, and this is the only source I have seen this theorem stated like this. Is this not equivalent to the tupleless version:

Let ϕ(x,Y1,…,Ym) be a formula that quantifies only over sets and contains no free variables other than x,Y1,…,Ym (not necessarily all of these). Then for all Y1,…,Ym, there exists a unique class A such that:∀x\[x∈A⟺ϕ(x,Y1,…,Ym)\].

Since, if we want a class of n-tuples that satisfy some predicate ϕ, we can just instead use the predicate ""∃x1,...,∃xn\[x=(x1,...,xn) ∧ ϕ\]"" (basically, we tack on the statement ""x is an n-tuple"" before ϕ).

math,Exploring Solvable and Unsolvable Equations with Python's SymPy,"As an applied scientist, I learned to ""solve"" y = x² and get x = ±√y. But I was never taught that you can't solve y = x −c sin(x) and get a nice equation. (That's always bugged me. Why isn't it taught?)

To really understand closed-form solvability, you apparently need advanced mathematics (e.g. Galois theory). Instead of that, I cheated and used Python's free SymPy package to search for unsolvable equations.

What surprised me:

* Kepler’s Equation, y = x −c sin(x), is wonderfully simple.
* Lambert’s W function is invaluable when your mathematical model includes exp or log (but not both).
* SymPy is excellent but may not match WolframAlpha in some cases.
* Mixing trigonometric functions with other terms frequently prevents closed-form solutions.
* When closed-form solutions remain out of reach, we can rely on plotting and numerical methods.

I've written up details in a (free) article: [Explore Solvable and Unsolvable Equations with Python | Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/explore-solvable-and-unsolvable-equations-with-python-661ac11f4f20).

math,Are “Applied Math” graduate courses usually rigorous/proof-based?,"I know the distinction between applied and pure math is somewhat arbitrary.

But I always thought this was a little odd. For x^(-1.01) and x^(-0.99), the power rule works just fine, but the functions we get look completely different from log(x), even though the closeness of the exponents to -1 leads me to believe that the antiderivatives should look similar.

Putting aside any irrational numbers represented by a symbol like pi or sqrt(2), is there any way to refer to an irrational number in decimal form through speech or through writing?

If they go on forever and are without a pattern, any time we stop at a number after the decimal means we have just conveyed a rational number, and so we must keep saying numbers for an infinitely long time to properly convey a single irrational number.  However, since we don't have unlimited time, is there any way to actually say/write these numbers?

Would this also mean that it is technically impossible to select a truly random number since we would not be able to convey an irrational in decimal form and since the probability of choosing a rational is basically 0?

math,"I realized ""inventing math"" as a child isn't really *that* impressive","If you read any biographies of famous scientists, you probably stumbled upon the ""he/I invented this thing as a child out of curiosity, only to realize it was already a thing"" and it's usually followed up by the narrator explaining some complex idea that the mathematician/physicist stumbled over like operator calculus.

I would read/hear these anecdotes in amazement, kinda pondering how much better these geniuses were than the rest of us which mostly absorb things we're taught in school and don't care about anything else. Honestly, it would kinda depress me, knowing that all the great people were inventing calculus in 4th grade while I was making redstone chicken farms in minecraft.

Then I stopped to kinda think about it. Then it hit me, I, and probably most of you, got pretty close as well. For example, I distinctly remember thinking about circles in 4th or 5th grade (whenever it is you learn how to calculate the surface of a square/rectangle). I thought about this annoying stupid circular shape and how you could never calculate its surface because of its disturbing smooth perimeter.

It annoyed me to such an extent that I tried to figure out a way to do it. I thought about what the closest thing to a circle was for which I could calculate an area, and well, it was a square. Not very close, but it would do. So I put my square in the circle, and noticed it filled up most of it but the edges were missing. So I tried putting the cubes in a sort of circular shape, and ended up with 13 cubes filling the circle. It still didn't fit, but I sort of realized that the smaller the cubes got the better the ""pixelized"" circle would align to the perfectly smooth one. 

Of course I didn't know it at the time, but I got pretty close to getting the idea of limits and how some values can approach others to the point where they are practically the same thing.

When I reached the limit of my own capacities at the time, I approached my teacher with the idea and she told me it wasn't something we should be doing now and that my efforts would be better spent elsewhere. So I kinda forgot about it until our current calculus teacher mentioned the rearrangement proof for the area of a circle. While little-me's idea was a lot less elegant I was kinda there.

I don't think it was that brilliant of an idea, honestly. I just wish someone would've pushed me to do stuff like that more often and really look into them.

math,Can you formulate Fourier analysis without complex numbers?,Multiplying complex numbers leads to rotations which can be easily seen by simply multiplying (a+bi)(c+di). But can we completely get rid of the imaginary numbers and still get all the results of Fourier analysis? The main idea of Fourier analysis is that any shift transformation has complex exponential eigenfunctions. But for a vector v=x+y where v is in the top right quadrant a counterclockwise rotation requires the length of x to decrease while the length of y increases. Typically the y dimension is imaginary but if we view complex numbers as just a 2D vector with real components then multiplying a vector by a complex number is just the tensor product of vectors correct forming a 2x2 matrix correct? We can see this from distributing (a+bi)(c+di) that the imaginary components combine to be real and the mixing of real and imaginary turn imaginary. This is essentially non-zero off-diagonal entries in a matrix since components in one space are affecting the other space. Wouldn't this mean that any construct involving e^ix can be reformulated in terms of simple tensor products of vectors where every number involved is real?,LemonLimeNinja,1gdexdf,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdexdf/can_you_formulate_fourier_analysis_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdexdf/can_you_formulate_fourier_analysis_without/,2024-10-27 16:30:33,38,0.9,38,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gdexdf

h(x, y) = 5f(x, y)- 1f(x−1, y)+ 2f(x+ 1, y)+ 8f(x, y−1)- 2f(x, y+ 1)

is h linear in this case?

Actually what I know is that to call a function linear, we should show it's homogeneous and additive.

So I tried to show it's homogeneous with following: for some constants a and k, if h(ax,ay) = a\^k h(x,y) , then it's homogeneous. But I stuck on h(ax, ay) = 5f(ax, ay)- 1f(ax−1, ay)+ 2f(ax+ 1, ay)+ 8f(ax, ay−1)- 2f(ax, ay+ 1) and I don't actually know how to remain.",T742617000027,1gdb4wq,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdb4wq/is_a_filter_linear_in_image_processing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gdb4wq/is_a_filter_linear_in_image_processing/,2024-10-27 13:37:34,9,0.85,9,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gdb4wq

If math is your favorite subject to the point where you’d consider becoming a mathematician, what sparked that passion?

math,Representation theory feels magic,"The way I understand representation theory is that we can study a group by seeing how it behaves on vector spaces. When studying groups in the abstract this is fine, but things start to feel a lot less natural when this is used in physics or other real world applications.

For example spinors came into existence by looking for representations of SO(3) on two dimensional spaces. To me it is sort of a miracle that a 2D representation of SO(3), a group originally motivated by rotations in 3D space, can describe elementary particles. SO(3) is just one example, there is also SU(2), SU(3), the Poincare and Lorentz groups, and many more where the group can be useful in representations other than its standard representation.

I asked my professor about how long we should expect each homework problem to take and it was implied that sometimes it could take days.  It has indeed taken me quite some time  to “solve” many of the problems.  I use quotation marks because more often than not, I have to rely on other sources to help me solve them.  I am curious as to if I am the only one who has struggled in this regard.  Is it indeed normal to wrestle with a problem for days?  Should I be able to solve all of these problems on my own without external consultation?  I struggle to envision myself having come up with many of the solutions to said problems.  When my professor has gone over a few of them, the answers seem to come so naturally to him.  

I feel guilty for having to rely on external help as it feels like one should be able to figure the problems out by oneself.

Also, is it common for math exams in advanced courses (such as those at the graduate level) to be based off of the homework?  I have an upcoming test in my real analysis course and am concerned as to how to prepare.

math,Generating ternary pseudo-gray code,"I'm trying to generate a full factorial list of different combinations of input states to use for unit testing some logic. The reason this is ternary and not binary is that what I'm actually interested in testing is the different combinations of transitions of each input. So I've defined by states is: 0 = rising, 1 = falling, 2 = high. I've not included a low state because in the case that one or more inputs is remaining low, the problem would be reduced to lower order. The reason I've called it pseudo-gray code is that the previous state of an input limits what it's next state can be (i.e. an input cannot be falling or rising for two consecutive codes).

The rules could be summarized as follows:

|Prev State|Next State|
|:-|:-|
|0 (rising)|1 or 2|
|1 (falling)|0|
|2 (high)|1 or 2|

I believe it may still be some form of gray code since after the transition rules are enforced, only one state should be changing and the full list at the end should have no repeats.

For example, a case with 2 inputs is fairly straightforward to construct manually:



|States|
|:-|
|00|
|21|
|10|
|02|
|12|
|01|
|20|
|11|



Note that there is no 22 case because I'm only interested in cases where at least one state is changing, though I think that is not a hard requirement as that case could easily be removed after the fact. I believe it wouldn't be too difficult to manually generate this for 3 inputs, however, I will need to generate these combinations for at least up 6 inputs and the problem grows quite quickly.

I realize trying to treat this as gray code may not be the best approach and that this may better posed as some sort of directed graph problem, so I'm certainly open to any suggestion on better approaches.

So I guess my primary questions are: is it reasonable to treat this problem as a gray code generation problem? If so, is there anything like this I'd be able to reference to come up with an algorithm that fits my needs? If not, what would be a better approach to take for this problem?

Bonus question: It's possible in the future I'd be interested in extending this to include more states, i.e. m-ary states with n inputs. Does a pseudo-gray code approach or some other approach lend itself better to that extension?",MadRoboticist,1gbagck,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gbagck/generating_ternary_pseudogray_code/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gbagck/generating_ternary_pseudogray_code/,2024-10-24 19:01:03,6,0.71,6,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1gbagck

math,Logic (and sometimes mathematics) being subsumed by computer science ,"I've recently got a feeling that logic is slowly being subsumed by computer science.

Also, at some new courses I'm assigned to (or know others who are) which should be mathematics courses, people want to smuggle in computer science, for example they made probability theory course which should cover AI and deep learning, while ignoring the fact that we are mathematics department and have no idea on how AI or deep learning works, let alone how to teach it to students in one course.

math,Beauty in Numerical Analysis?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently taking my an undergraduate course in Numerical Methods, and while I find the general concept fascinating, the course so far feels very focused on the technical and computational aspects. The deeper, more interesting insights have so far only briefly been touched on by the professor. Building models/simulations is one my passions, so Numerical Analysis seems like it would really mesh well with my interests, but I'm kind of getting turned off by it at this point.

To balance out the perspective I'm developing, I would love to hear about any examples of mathematical beauty and interesting results others have encountered in Numerical Analysis. If possible, I'd also appreciate a ""big picture"" explanation of what we're truly aiming to achieve here.

I feel like it is more accurate to write (f*phi\^-1)*(phi\*g) and differentiate these functions with normal chain rule.

math,Question about 3 different but related sums of reciprocals,"So the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_sums\_of\_reciprocals) lists these three known sums:

A. The sum of the reciprocals of the [perfect powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_power#Examples_and_sums) (including duplicates) is 1 .  
  
B. The sum of the reciprocals of the [perfect powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_power#Examples_and_sums) (excluding duplicates) is approximately 0.8745 .  
  
C. The [Goldbach–Euler theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%E2%80%93Euler_theorem) states that the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers that are 1 less than a perfect power (excluding duplicates) is 1 .

I might be interpreting these three facts incorrectly, but does this imply that taking some function ""unique(x)"" and apply it to the terms in series A is somehow perfectly undone by taking each term in the denominators of the resulting series (B) and subtracting 1 from each? At least in terms of their sums.

Why do these two operations appear to be so perfectly matched? Is there some symmetry I don't see?

math,"So, what the hell even is geometry?","Stats/probability guy here. Naturally, I'm pretty removed from the more abstract areas of math. I recently came across [this picture of Spec(Z\[x\]) ](https://pbelmans.ncag.info/assets/mumforddrawing.jpg)from Mumford's Red Book. Reading up more about schemes in algebraic geometry, I struggled to understand how they can be considered geometric objects. Not knowing much about AG, I always thought that it just studies the geometry of zeros of polynomial equations. But having seen the post-modern approach with schemes and the like, it seems like I simply had no idea what *geometry* really means. 

  
Ask any middle schooler what geometry is, they all will give the same answer: shapes! Euclidean geometry studies shapes and lines on R\^2 (which is a nice model for Euclid's postulates). Relaxing some of these postulates brings us to spherical/hyperbolic/whatever geometry which still seems geometric in nature. Generalizing further, we have differential geometry, which studies ""curvy shapes"". Algebraic geometry studies curvy (?) shapes defined through polynomials? Sure, pretty geometric, makes sense. But wait. It also studies rings? And [things that look like a bunch of points and some weird line that goes through those points](https://i.sstatic.net/XIR2d.png)? 

So, one can say that geometry studies 'rigid' objects in spaces. Let's take that to mean topological spaces, which provide the most general notion of ""space"" and being able to tell points apart. Can we get a unifying definition of geometry out of this? 

  
[nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometry) provides a pretty good starting point: 

&gt;the term *geometry* is used in much greater generality for the study of *spaces* equipped with extra “geometrical” structure of a large variety of sorts

Let's ignore the tautology and say that geometry studies topological spaces with some extra structure. What are the implications of this?

1) Euclidean, hyperbolic, differential, etc geometry is still geometry because R\^n / manifolds / whatever are topological spaces with additional structure. Sure, I agree with this

2) Algebraic geometry is geometry (yes, even the scheme kind). Besides the (Zariski I guess?) topology there is an additional structure on schemes. 

3) Metric spaces are geometric in nature. There's the metric + the induced topology. Sounds about right. 

4) *Literally everything that isn't topology is geometry if you're pedantic enough?*  Ok, how did we get here? Take any ""set with extra structure"" and put a topology on it, say the discrete one. Boom, there you have it. 

Even without the boring point above, there are many things that are topological spaces with extra structure that  isn't geometric in nature. 

Do we have a better definition of geometry that includes all the fields of math that have geometry in their name, and excludes all others? I know I'm grossly overthinking this, but what even is geometry?

I am not interested in how the tetris blcoks will fit (that will be the job of the person who has to use my application). I only want to know the width and height of the space that can perfectly fit all of them. Also, is there an algorithm that can do the reverse? Meaning, given a grid square of some size, it can provide me all different combinations of distinct tetris blocks (two tetris blocks are distinct if they can never be the same via rotation, reflection is not allowed) that can fit it? This will allow me to generate random tetris puzzles in my application.

To clarify the last bit, here is an example:

math,Restriction Sheaf in Hartshorne vs Other Sources,"In Hartshorne, the restriction sheaf of a sheaf F on a topological space X to a subspace Z is the \*deep breath\* sheafification of the inverse image presheaf of the inclusion of X into Z, and is denoted as F|\_Z (but for now I'll denote it as i\^-1F as Hartshorne does for the inverse image presheaf of a continuous map to distinguish them).

On the other hand, I've seen that if Z is an open subset, then the restriction sheaf F|\_Z is defined by F|\_Z(U)=F(U) if U is contained in Z.

Why are i\^-1F and F|\_Z isomorphic if Z is an open set? I guess one way to do it would be to construct a natural transformation from the inverse image presheaf to F|\_Z and then check that the induced map from the universal property is an isomorphism.

math,Practicing for AIME (1-2 years)?,"For reference, my AMC score last year was 55 with little experience.  I am a sophomore now with better understanding of these competitions.

Right now, the way I am practicing for making AIME is going through past AMCs, going through the problems, and spending time on them.  I aim to do at least 3-4 problems per session total, and I try to learn something new with each problem to make sure that I am not repeating only what I know.  I have also learned a bit from the AOPS vol. 1 textbook, but I no longer have access to it now.  I also go to math competitions my school hosts very often, and I learn from the mistakes I made on those.

The thing is, I am very fond of doing competition math and I enjoy it, but I can only invest maybe 30 min - 1 hour everyday for it due to other commitments. Some days I might not be able to do it, and it’s probably something I can put 2-4 hours a week in for.

My questions are:

1. Is this enough to make AIME in 1-2 years?  I likely won’t be able to do 3-4 hours a week pace in 11th grade, but I can for sophomore year.
2. Is the AOPS textbook necessary for making AIME, or will learning from past problems suffice?
3. Will it require more than 3-4 hours a week, or if this time is properly utilized, will it be enough?

math,How do people enjoy math,"Before I get downvoted, I came here because I assume you guys enjoy math and can tell me why. I’ve always been good at math. I’m a junior in high school taking AP Calculus rn, but I absolutely hate it. Ever since Algebra 2, math has felt needlessly complicated and annoyingly pointless. I can follow along with the lesson, but can barely solve a problem without the teacher there. On tests I just ask an annoying amount of questions and judge by her expressions what I need to do and on finals I just say a prayer and hope for the best. Also, every time I see someone say that it helps me in the real world, they only mention something like rocket science. My hatred of math has made me not want to go into anything like that. So, what is so great about anything past geometry for someone like me who doesn’t want to go into that field but is forced to because I was too smart as a child.

Edit: After reading through the responses, I think I’d enjoy it more if I took more time to understand it in class, but the teacher goes wayyyy to fast. I’m pretty busy after school though so I can‘t really do much. Any suggestions?

It is a ""pay to play"" program in a no-name uni, the program has the bare minimum of OS, algorithms, databases, and networks. The professors are very smart (my current professor for computer theory is a Yale phD). But the program's structure is weak. I requested to have some math course to be counted towards degree completion, such as disc math and linear algebra, but it was denied by the program coordinator

I chose CS because of the program course requirements: comp architecture, algorithm design and comp theory. Yes, it only has three required classes the rest is filled with designated electives

There is another degree, Applied stats and DS that has stats learning/methods, linear algebra, math stats and probability. But it has no extensive programming homeworks/projects

What would you do? Switch to ASDS and request credit transfer of the comp theory/archi/theo or stay in CS and take the math electives.

That said, now that I have a reasonable conceptual grasp, my goal is to find a book to serve as a follow-up that can help to really nail down the rigorous aspect.

I've seen a few threads similar to this question, but most of them seem concerned with books for the topics *after* those covered in Abbott, so I'll clarify exactly what I'm looking for and what I'm trying to avoid. 

I'm not interested in moving on yet to more advanced topics; I really would like a book that goes over the fundamentals, just perhaps in more depth than Abbott. However, I also would like to avoid a complete retread of what I've already covered; ideally it would introduce a handful of new topics alongside a more challenging treatment of the basics.

* Real Mathematical Analysis by Charles Pugh

math,Software tools for mathematics research collaboration,"Hello r/math,

I was recently having a conversation with a graduate student where they admonished the disorganization between themselves and their advisor. From what I gathered, there were several reasons for this but the most major one was that their advisor travels quite a bit and they frequently resorted to zoom calls to talk about progress.  

I wanted to give some advice, but I realized that I myself didn't have a perfect solution (their advisor supposedly cares *a lot* about getting scooped), so I figured this might be a good discussion to have on r/rmath. 

* What tools do you use to keep track of research in a distant, albeit private, collaborative environment? 
* How do you keep track of things like dead-ends? An interesting answer to this question might go beyond typing up meeting notes in a tex file.
* How do you share sources? For example, collaboratively marking up a PDF of an article you found on  arXiv.

The demonstrations in class also seem slow. 

Bizarrely, I'm not supposed to be good : selection process toward higher-level schools are reliable, and I failed them. The fact that I come from a majoritarly Mathematical background must play however.

math,Advice on ways to get to know professors?,"Let me preface by saying that I know that this has been asked plenty, yet the advice is always typical and I've still been struggling with being able to properly establish a connection with my professors.

The most commonly touted advice is to go visit professors during their office hours, often being prepared to perhaps discuss their research or the like --it doesn't exactly work that way for nearly all my mathematics and statistics courses. On average, my classes have 200-300 people in them; the office hours are once a week, 1 hour long, and therefore filled with people. Almost certainly there will be a long line to your front and your back; the professors need to operate like a conveyor belt: ask your question, get an answer, step out of line --there is no time to ""chat"", discuss, or anything. Admittedly, I've seen this advice work for some of my friends as they have been able to cultivate stronger relationships and converse with their professors via office hours. However, these friends are not in mathematics; commonly I see this in Philosophy departments, which I feel that by the nature of the subject itself, makes those who teach it more likely to be open to conversation.

Granted, I still go to office hours nevertheless; it's helped in the fact that the professors now recognize me and know my name, but that's about it.

Now of course the next step is to email them, though most of my professors have strict policies against that too. Technically, according to some of my syllabi, I can't even send an email regarding questions on course content; only things of upmost personal emergency are to be expected. Not to say that it hasn't stopped me from trying: I've emailed a few professors, all giving no answer. It is both especially irritating and demotivating; I've been polite, followed up nicely, and wasn't even asking for anything! It's not that I'm  trying to inject myself into their research or pester them for letter of recommendation; I genuinely just wanted to strike up a conversation, pick their brain, and ask them a few questions about a cool subject that we both have a common interest in.

The absolute last option that I see available, which I admittedly I haven't tried, is to arbitrarily drop in at their room on campus. However, I feel that such an unsolicited interruption might do more harm than good.

All of this is particularly concerning for me as it is very barring. In the event that I actually would need a letter of recommendation, I don't realistically see how any of my professors would know anything about me to even ""recommend"". Furthermore, my school offers the ability to take independent reading/research courses that I would definitely be interested in, except I would need to be in touch with a professor who agrees to launch and supervise the project in the first place.

I certainly don't want to come off as being overly defeatist, but I'm definitely reaching a level of frustration.

I'm not attempting to know my professors for solely an opportunistic goal. At this point, I genuinely just want to speak to someone experienced in the field; someone to ask for some kind of help, advice, touch base with, discuss ideas, whatever it may be. Perhaps a professor isn't even best suited for this role, though in any case, the importance of building a network is clear.

I was curious if this can be generalized to the case when we interpret the sum as some other summation method, rather than the limit of the partial sums, and can this be used to find an analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series? For example is there an abscissa of [Cesàro summability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_summation)? I'm particularly curious about the case of [Abel summability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_series#Abel_summation).

In general, [Abel's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%27s_theorem) guarantees that the Abel sum agrees with the limit of the partial sums when a series converges, and otherwise, provided that the function defined in the region of Abel summability is analytic, it should agree with the unique analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series by the identity theorem.

So, my only concern is that the Abel summable region would not form a half-plane or that it would not define an analytic function. When we consider the [Dirichlet eta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_eta_function), it seems like this has an abscissa of Abel summability of -∞, and this corresponds to an analytic continuation of the series to the whole complex plane. In other words, this is a nice example where everything works out like how I'd intuitively expect, but I'm not so sure if this should always be true in general.

Abel summation and Dirichlet series have been well known for over a century, and this is not a super deep question, so it seems overwhelmingly likely that this would have been discussed before, but I couldn't find any references. I checked G.H. Hardy's book Divergent Series, but he does not really focus much on analytic continuation. I was curious if any of the people on here knew a little more and could maybe give me a reference.",DominatingSubgraph,1g7hkpq,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g7hkpq/do_dirichlet_series_have_an_abscissa_of_abel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g7hkpq/do_dirichlet_series_have_an_abscissa_of_abel/,2024-10-19 20:12:09,16,0.9,16,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1g7hkpq

The conjecture has to do with symmetric functions, a topic I haven't personally studied much, but combinatorics conjectures tend to be a form of ""somebody noticed a pattern that a lot of other combinatorialists have tried and failed to explain"". I couldn't state the conjecture from memory, but I definitely hear it talked about frequently in seminars. Feel free to chime in on the comments if you work closely in the area.

math,I'm tired of having to look things up,"I'm a first year PhD student that comes from a weak undergraduate program. Since my college's math department was so small I have self taught most of the math I know. Over the past three years I have read books on measure theory, functional analysis, and algebraic topology. Lately I have been studying harmonic analysis along with my core graduate courses. The way I learn is I read a book and supplement it with lecture notes, other books, and searching online until I feel like I very intuitively understand why a definition is the way or it is or why we expect a theorem to be true. 

The problem is my proof skills are really bad. Today a friend of mine asked me to help him prove x\^3 is continuous using epsilon and deltas and another problem he had was to prove that a certain sequence is cauchy and I had to look both of them up and it is very embarrassing. Once I see the solution then its usually obvious to me and I can get it quickly.

From the books I read I know most of the major theorems/definitions by heart and for most of them I even have a feeling ""why"" they should be true or why they're important but I have no idea how to prove almost any of them. I'm talking about everything from the mean value theorem to the spectral theorem. I have a hard time following all the steps in most proofs in my textbooks and I have to search on google why a certain step is true. I wish I could sit down and prove things myself but I'm not very good at it if I can't use google even for very simple undergraduate problems. I have a hard time doing proof exercises in books from all levels such as basic linear algebra all the way up to graduate books.

For instance, the flow of a vector field can be described by an exponential. Or more abstractly, exp(d/dx) shifts a function by 1 unit, which “undoes” the derivative operator (up to a shift), a la the fundamental theorem of calculus.

I can give more examples, but generally it seems like exponentiation is performing a sort of integration. More precisely, exp(X) can be described as “the place you end up after moving with velocity X for one second”, which is exactly integration. What’s going on here?

math,Why do enjoy math? How do you reignite interest in math?,"I'm a senior in college and I've grown somewhat disinterested in the classes I'm taking. I used to really love math and learning but I find it hard to engage with material like I used to. I'm not really entirely sure why. I still like talking about math and can sometimes find that joy again when I talk about past personal projects related to math, but it's hard to maintain that enthusiasm.  
  
Academically, losing this excitement is not good for me because I end up putting less work into the classes I'm taking. I always tried hard in classes not to get a good grade but because I enjoyed learning the material so it's tough when that's not so much the case anymore.  
  
I honestly don't really understand why I was so interested in learning math. It kinda feels a bit silly to be honest. Objectively it feels like math should be a really dry subject. Sure, a lecturer might be able to bring the material to life if they have enthusiasm and present it like a performer, but that enthusiasm isn't an essential part of the material. You can make any subject interesting if you're good at presenting. 

Maybe if I just talk to other people about the material as if I'm excited about it that will help me find joy in it.

math,Normal numbers,"I've just seen [this lecture](https://youtu.be/G3MwnMo7tio?si=_pV-AdNFZaukEFqn) by dr. Joseph Vandehey about normal numbers.

At the beginning he states that ""almost all real numbers are normal"" and I'm still trying to make sense of that.

He gave this very convincing demonstration that shows that the probability of picking a normal number at random is 1. He used a D10 dice to generate a number, and showed that the number would be normal.

However, using intuition alone I am convinced that the cardinality of normal numbers is equivalent to that of abnormal numbers (I think they are called that...).  
  
My thinking is that the cardinality of the set of numbers with a decimal expansion only including the digits 0 through 8, all of which would not be normal, is the same as the that of the set of numbers with all digits, both being uncountable. I have no proof of this claim, but am quite certain that it holds.

If this is true then can we really say that ""most numbers are normal""? And if not, how do we reconcile this equivalence of cardinality with the demonstration of the probability of randomly picking a normal number being 1? Are there sets with equivalent cardinalities but with different ""densities""? Or is this demonstration simply flawed?

Lots of theorists in computer science especially emphasize mathematical rigor. More so than a theoretical physicist who focus on the physics rather than math.

In fact, the whole field is pretty much just pure mathematics in my view.

There is strong overlap with many areas of pure mathematics such as mathematical logic and combinatorics.

A full list of topics studied by theorists are:
Algorithms
Mathematical logic
Automata theory
Graph theory
Computability theory
Computational complexity theory
Type theory
Computational geometry
Combinatorial optimization

Because many of these topics are studied by both theorists and pure mathematicians, it makes no sense to have a distinction in my view.

When I think of applied mathematicians, I think of mathematicians coming up with computational models and algorithms for solving classes of equations or numerical linear algebra.

math,Relearning how to learning for Grad School. Any tips?,"Hi! I'm a first year PhD student studying Applied Math and I think I could use some advice/wisdom if you all had some to give. I'm coming straight from undergrad and the transition into grad level coursework has been...bumpy. There are two main problems Im encountering: not knowing how to apply concepts in more general applications and not understanding how to use lecture times. 

In undergrad, much of the information I learned felt very natural and intuitive probably up until my last semester. I sort just ""downloaded"" the information. I do think that in the last year I got into a bad habit though. I could read through my professors' notes and my notes and, even if I didn't 100% understand a concept, I knew I'd see problems similar the ones done in class in both homework assignments and exams. I think what this resulted in was a habit of knowing ""how"" to do problems but truly knowing ""what"" I was doing. Now, the relationship between lecture, homework, and exams are drastically different. Lectures introduce topics and provide proofs. Homework problems are substantially more complex than what should be able to be done using pure lecture material, and exams lie somewhere in the middle. 

I'm not bothered by this shift, but I'm not sure how to adjust. Now, I find myself not simply being confused in lecture, but 100% lost with nothing seeming ""relatable"" or ""intelligible"", and where I once got clarity in doing the assigned homework, I now find even more confusion because of how difficult they are. 

Again, I'm not upset. I knew that pursuing a PhD would be hard, I would just like some advice on how to pivot my approach to learning materials because what I did before definitely doesn't work anymore. I still enjoy the concepts once I finally do understand them, but I always find myself falling several weeks behind the pace of the new material. If you have any advice, I'd be very appreciative.

math,Mathematical intuition as a science,"I have often wondered how to convey (to non-mathematicians) what exactly mathematical intuition is, and I think I now have a somewhat satisfactory explanation. Let me know your thoughts on it.

The idea is that theorems (basically all proven statements, including properties of specific examples) are like experiments, and the intuition one forms based on these 'experiments' is a like a (scientific) theory. The theory can be used to make predictions about reality, and new experiments can agree or disagree with these predictions. The theory is then modified accordingly (or, sometimes, scrapped entirely).

As an example consider a student, fresh out of a calculus course, learning real analysis. He has come across a lot of continuous functions, and all of them have had graphs that can be drawn by hand without lifting the pen. Based on this he forms the 'theory' that all continuous functions have this property. Hence, one thing his theory predicts is that all continuous functions are differentiable 'almost everywhere'. He sees that this conclusion is false when he comes across the Weierstrass function, so he scraps his theory. As he gets more exposure to epsilon-delta arguments, each one an 'experiment', he forms a new theory which involves making rough calculations using big-O and small-o notation.

The reasoning behind this parallel is that developing intuitions involves a scientific-method-like process of making hypotheses (conjectures) and testing them (proving/disproving the conjectures rigourously). When 'many' predictions made by a certain intuition are verified to be correct, one gains confidence in it. Of course, an intuition can never be proven to be 'true' using 'many' examples, just as a scientific theory can never be proven to be 'true'. The only distinction one can make between various theories is whether (and under what conditions) they are useful for making predictions, and the same goes for intuitions.

All this says that, in a sense, mathematicians are also scientists. However they are different from 'conventional' scientists in that instead of the real world, their theories are about the mathematical world. Also, the theories they form are generally not talked about in textbooks; instead, textbooks generally focus on experiments and leave the theory-building to the reader. Contrast this with textbooks of 'conventional' science!",thereligiousatheists,1g4yuon,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g4yuon/mathematical_intuition_as_a_science/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g4yuon/mathematical_intuition_as_a_science/,2024-10-16 13:02:50,47,0.77,47,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1g4yuon

math,Taking notes,"I'm a first-year math grad student, and I'm trying to settle on the best way (for me) to take notes throughout my program.

I love the ease of flipping through physical notebooks Especially with an ink pen—it’s soothing to write on and is easier on the eyes. But managing multiple notebooks can become a hassle with time.

On the flip side, digital notes are much easier to organize and manage, but I find it frustrating to scroll back and forth between sections. I also feel like I lose some context because I can only see part of the page at a time. I want to create a good, consistent system for my grad school notes that I can use for my own reference and that others might find useful.

math,What should be taught first: metric spaces or topological spaces?,"This question comes from remembering the time I was studying General Topology in the degree. In this course, the first chapter we were taught was topological spaces (where basic notions of open sets, closed sets, basis for the topology and neighbourhoods were introduced). Later, in order to present one of the most important kinds of topological spaces, metric spaces were the topic of the second chapter.

I understand this ordering since metric spaces can be understood as a particular case of a topological space. This follows the canon in the current mathematical education were the more general case is explained firstly and then the concrete one. Not only that, but the concept of open ball arises naturally once you learn about  open sets and basis for a topology.

  
On the other hand, I remember losing any kind of motivation, goal or direction while firstly studying topological spaces, so by the time metric spaces arrived, It was too late to simply understand what was going on. Also, I would say metric spaces has the advantage of being easily depicted visually, so fundamental notions of topological spaces can be slightly described in advanced with a geometric representation in mind.

math,An optimization problem about elevators.,"Can we make a mathematic model about;

1)There is an apartment with 10 floor (nonone lives in entrance)

2)Every floor has equal number of rooms and equal number of people in every room.

3)There are 2 elevators.

4)Elevators travel the same time between every floor.

5)At ANY TIME during daylight and night doesn't matter, there may be people want to go inside apartment or want to go outside (there is no rush hour. Totally homogenous).

6)Inside apartment noone visits each other.

7)There is no stairs; everyone have to use elevators.

  
SO; We want a software that sends elevators to exact 2 floors (2 elevator for 2 floors but can be same); our goal is to minimize the total wait time of every people collectively. Not for a single person or single floor but we need to optimize the total wait time for everyone.

math,Envy-free cake cutting (Selfridge–Conway procedure),"\[THIS POST WAS CONCERNING A BUG AND HAS BEEN SOLVED\]  
Hi,

I'm working on an automatic representation of the Selfride-Conway procedure, just for the fun of it.

I suppose that the players have a preference for each infinitesimal slice of the cake and that their envy of a share is simply the integral between the two cuts:

https://preview.redd.it/inhk7ri9piud1.png?width=555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e20287490dc1668fb2916d00a61da8b8614bb3b

(Nota: The three total integrals are equals)

To cut a piece in three, a player P starts at the left and the right and looks for when the integrals are equal to a 1/3, compares the errors and picks the one with the lowest (A00). The remains are cut into two pieces as equally as possible (A02 is slightly bigger than A03).

Then we apply the algorithm by evaluating the integrals for each player on each proposed piece. In the figure below, the colour intensity represents a player's envy for each proposed piece. It works great up to the trimming part.

https://preview.redd.it/3tyegfoeoiud1.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=828a0350e150c57308ea7400b8d68021e8701001

PB (in this case P3) cuts the trimming in 3 pieces of equal value to his/her eyes (A21, A22, A23), so no matter what the others pick PB will be envy-free.  
Then PA (in this case P2), picks its favourite trimming piece (here A21, which becomes P21) and thus is envy-free.

Here comes my problem, what if the last piece chosen by PA (P2) was also P1's favourite? It forces P1 to choose its second-best choice and thus P1 has envy towards PA (P2).

Shouldn't this procedure guarantee a total envy-free solution in the end? If yes, I must have misunderstood a step but I can't tell which one.

I hope you'll be able to help me.",Nadran_Erbam,1g2owmz,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g2owmz/envyfree_cake_cutting_selfridgeconway_procedure/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1g2owmz/envyfree_cake_cutting_selfridgeconway_procedure/,2024-10-13 12:48:50,7,0.89,7,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1g2owmz

Some reflections I enjoyed:

On the involvement of modern AI tools, which weren't up to his expectations:

&gt;Day 13 (Oct 8)

&gt;Modern AI tools, so far, are the ""[dog that didn't bark in the night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_Silver_Blaze)"". We are making *major* use of ""[good old-fashioned AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI)"", in the form of automated theorem provers such as [Vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_(theorem_prover)); but the primary use cases more modern large language models or other machine learning-based software thus far have been Github Copilot (to speed up writing code and Lean proofs through AI-powered autocomplete), and Claude (to help create our visualization tools, most notably [Equation Explorer](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/), which [Claude charmingly named](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/.E2.9C.94.20What.20shall.20we.20name.20our.20interactive.20equation.20tool.3F) ""Advanced Equation Implication Table"" initially). I have also found ChatGPT to be useful for getting me up to speed on the finer aspects of universal algebra. I have been told from a major AI company in the first few days of the project that their tools were able to resolve a large fraction (over 99.9%) of the implications, but with quite long and inelegant proofs. But now that we have isolated some particularly challenging problems, I believe these AI tools will become more relevant.

On his massively collaborative mathematics dream coming true:

&gt;Day 14 (Oct 9)

&gt;I am also pleased to see a very broad range of contributors, ranging from professional researchers and graduate students in mathematics or computer science, to various people from other professions with an undergraduate level of mathematics education. This is one of the key advantages of a highly structured collaborative project - there are modular subtasks in the project that can be usefully contributed to by someone who does not necessarily have the complete set of skills needed to understand the entire project. At one end, we are getting important insights from senior mathematicians with no prior expertise in Lean; we are getting volunteers to formalize a single theorem stated in the blueprint that requires only a relatively narrow amount of mathematical expertise; and we are getting a lot of invaluable technical support in maintaining the Github backend and various user interface front-ends that require little experience with either advanced mathematics or Lean. Certainly most of the contributions coming in now are well outside of what I can readily produce with my own skill set, and it has been a real pleasure seeing the project far outgrow my own initial contributions.

On how this sort of massively collaborative AI-assisted math looks like big software development, with everything that comes with that:

&gt;Day 14 (Oct 9)

&gt;We are encountering a technical issue that is slowing down our work - at some point, the codebase became extremely lengthy to compile (50 minutes in some cases). This is one scaling issue that comes with large formalization projects; when the codebase is massive and largely automated, it is not enough for every contribution to compile; efficiency of compile time becomes a concern. [This thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/slow.20build) is devoted to tracking down the issue and resolving it.

&gt;Day 15 (Oct 10)

&gt;These secondary issues, by the way, were caused by fragility in one of our early design choices... These sort of ""back end"" issues are hard to anticipate (and at the start of the project, when the codebase is still small and many of the tools hypothetical, implementing these sorts of data flows feels like overengineering). But it seems that it is possible to keep refactoring the codebase as one progresses, though if the project gets significantly more complex then I could imagine that this becomes increasingly difficult (I believe this problem is what is referred to in the software industry as ""[technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)"").

On speed vs promisingness of approaches to tackling problems:

&gt;Day 12 (Oct 7)

&gt;There was some [quite insightful discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Future.20of.20Using.20ATPs) about the different ways in which automated theorem provers (ATPs) can be used in these sorts of Lean-based collaborative projects. ... the speed of the ATP paradigm may have come at the expense of developing some promising human-directed approaches to the subject, though I think now that the pure ATP approach is reaching its limits, and the remaining implications are becoming increasingly interesting, these other approaches are returning to prominence.

On ""bookkeeping overhead"" requiring standardization, not an issue in informal math:

&gt;Day 6 (Oct 1)

&gt;Much of the time I devoted to the project today was over ""big-endian/little-endian"" type issues, such as which orientation of ordering on laws (or Hasse diagrams) to use, or which symbol to use for the Magma operation. In informal mathematics these are utterly trivial problems, but for a formal project it is important to settle on a standard, and it is much easier to modify that standard early in the project rather than later.

This reminded me of the late Bill Thurston's reflections in *On proof and progress*, similarly mentioning the need for standards to do large-scale formalization:

&gt;Mathematics as we practice it is much more formally complete and precise than other sciences, but it is much less formally complete and precise for its content than computer programs. The difference has to do not just with the amount of effort: the kind of effort is qualitatively different. In large computer programs, a tremendous proportion of effort must be spent on myriad compatibility issues: making sure that all definitions are consistent, developing “good” data structures that have useful but not cumbersome generality, deciding on the “right” generality for functions, etc. The proportion of energy spent on the working part of a large program, as distinguished from the bookkeeping part, is surprisingly small. Because of compatibility issues that almost inevitably escalate out of hand because the “right” definitions change as generality and functionality are added, computer programs usually need to be rewritten frequently, often from scratch.

&gt;A very similar kind of effort would have to go into mathematics to make it formally correct and complete. It is not that formal correctness is prohibitively difficult on a small scale—it’s that there are many possible choices of formalization on small scales that translate to huge numbers of interdependent choices in the large. It is quite hard to make these choices compatible; to do so would certainly entail going back and rewriting from scratch all old mathematical papers whose results we depend on. It is also quite hard to come up with good technical choices for formal definitions that will be valid in the variety of ways that mathematicians want to use them and that will anticipate future extensions of mathematics. If we were to continue to cooperate, much of our time would be spent with international standards commissions to establish uniform definitions and resolve huge controversies.

Terry's low-key humor:

&gt;Day 12 (Oct 7)

&gt;Meanwhile, [equation 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65) is proving [stubborn to resolve](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.2065.20-.3E.20Equation.20359) (I compared it to the village of Asterix and Obelix: ""One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders...""). 

&gt;Day 14 (Oct 9)

&gt;There is finally a breakthrough on the siege of the ""Asterix and Oberlix"" cluster (or ""village""?) of laws: we now know (subject to checking) that the ""Asterix"" law 65 does not imply the ""Oberlix"" law 1471!

math,"Dyscalculic amd really struggling with arithmetic, is there a solution?","I have read that there aren't really any known treatments for dyscalculia (it is real btw, I keep hearing it isn't) but it is becoming a major issue in my life in particular my private economy.

It wasn't something people knew about in school but I had good patient teachers, then had to take special classes and even got a special tutor, pretty much all because of my struggling with arithmetic.

How it manifests:
I basically can not think in absolute quantities, it is very difficult for me to not substitute one number for another that feels more comfortable, so for example 3 often turns into 4, it feels like there's leeway the way there is with everything else, and there isn't. 
I also never could learn my multiplication tables, and I do a particularly stupid thing of confusing things' relationships to nearby multiples I know (10 usually) meaning: I often mix up 8 and 2, because 2 is the difference to 10, same for 6 and 4, this is probably related to my brain invariably thinking all quantities are malleable and that this includes the making of any given 10, even ones that I imagine as a crutch.

This has caused me many problems, I am allegedly intelligent and so everyone always wondered why I almost failed every year of schooling with decent to great grades in other subjects and invariably failures in math.

I took classes after ""finishing"" school, hoping to get into first biochem or whatever else fascinated me and then gradually wanting to just get any diploma at all, but can't attain the requisite grades in math. I struggle with time because I confuse nearby hours, 30 mins and 15 mins and similar intervals, I therefore have long been unemployed which makes things significantly worse as money is tight now, which I can't keep track of either.

I understand many here likely aren't neurologists, and I know there's no pill, but I really want to grasp this so I can start actually functioning at last; I am in my 30s, so I feel like it's long overdue. 
Is there an alternative to rigorous tutoring which clearly does not work for me?

math,Since when is computer science considered physics rather than mathematics?,"The recent physics Nobel literally got me puzzled. Consequently, I've been wondering... is computer science physics or mathematics?

I completely understand the intention of the Nobel committee in awarding Geoffrey Hinton for his outstanding contributions to society and computer science. His work is without a doubt Nobel worthy. However, the Nobel in physics? I was not expecting it... Yes, he took inspiration from physics, borrowing mathematical models to develop a breakthrough in computer science. However, how is this a breakthrough in physics? Quite sad, when there were other actual physics contributions that deserved the prize.

It's like someone borrowing a mathematical model from chemistry, using it in finance for a completely different application, and now finance is coupled to chemistry... quite weird to say the least.

I even read in another post that Geoffrey Hinton though he was being scammed because he didn't believe he won the award. This speaks volumes about the poor decision of the committee.

Btw I've studied electrical engineering, so although my knowledge in both physics and computer science is narrow, I still have an understanding of both fields.

math,Surreal numbers and generalizing the construction of the reals one cardinality higher,"I've recently been thinking about [surreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number#) and was thinking about the way that you could describe the set of reals as the topological completion of the ring of surreal numbers you get from finitely many steps, and was wondering if anyone has spent time thinking about the field you get of all surreal numbers defined in countably many steps?

It seems natural enough to define a metric (albeit with a larger-than-real codomain) on this thing similarly to the standard metric on the reals, and from there one could talk about Cauchy sequences and do some sort of topological completion. This isn't very productive though, as two sequences here aren't equivalent unless they are eventually equal. Then it seems the most natural to define sequences as having the set of countable ordinals as their domain, and do a Cauchy completion this way.

It seems like I'm essentially trying to redefine the number systems with the set of countable ordinals replacing the set of finite ordinals (natural numbers). The biggest difference that I can see on the surface is that the set of countable ordinals isn't isomorphic to the set of positive ""integers"" in this context, so I definitely can't expect all the facts of arithmetic to transfer over seamlessly the way they seem to when you do weird [model theory tricks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_analysis)

math,Visualizing four dimensions,"I'm a PhD student in geometry/topology, so naturally I tend to have a very visual approach to math. But every so often, I find I can't imagine enough dimensions to be able to accurately picture something. Of course, there are often all sorts of workarounds, for example:

- Functions from a 2d space to a 2d or 3d space can be pictured as a ""mapping"" from one to another. This is useful e.g. in complex analysis and topology.
- Higher dimensional spaces can often be accurately represented by lower-dimensional cartoons. This is what they do in complex algebraic geometry, where all the pictures are half the dimension of what they're trying to depict.

But these workarounds don't always apply when the situation becomes sufficiently complex. On the other hand, I've heard all sorts of stories of mathematicians being able to get an intuitive feeling of higher-dimensional spaces (in particular, a certain mathematician with the initials WT). However, any attempt I've made to visualize the fourth dimension seems to have been completely in vain.

Does anyone know anything about how one might be able to ""visualize"" (or at least get a better understanding of) the fourth dimension?

math,probability of a 1D random walk not having exceeded +/-*n* after *t* steps? (Needed to solve an umbrella problem...),"[edit] - I thought the asterisks in the title would produce italic formatting. Please ignore them.

See title: is there a simple calculation for this? I was thinking of this in the context of the following little problem: let's say you travel between home and work twice a day. There's some probability it's going to be raining for each trip, all independent. If it's raining, you take an umbrella, and if it's not, you leave the umbrella wherever it is. If you own one umbrella, you will quickly find that one day you are out of luck, because you need the umbrella but it was left at the other place. But maybe if you start off with 6 umbrellas, 3 at each place, you will get through the year without ever getting wet -- sometimes one will end up at the other place, but there's a safety cushion with more umbrellas, and if you're lucky there will always be at least one umbrella at each end.

Say there's a 20% chance of rain each trip, and 260 work days in the year (so 520 trips). Every January 1 you get to redistribute your umbrellas equally, to restart the process. How many umbrellas will you need at the beginning of the year to have a 95% chance of making it through the year without getting wet? 

Seems like it could be modeled by considering there will be 104 rainy trips (20% of 520), each of which will bring the number of umbrellas at one end up or down by 1. If you start with 3 umbrellas at each end, this number can't get below 0 or above 6. So: what are the chances that a 104-step random walk along the number line will not exceed +/-3 at any point?

(I think we're going to need more than 6 umbrellas.)",gliese946,1fzfihc,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fzfihc/probability_of_a_1d_random_walk_not_having/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fzfihc/probability_of_a_1d_random_walk_not_having/,2024-10-09 00:55:25,16,0.78,16,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fzfihc

A traveling salesman who lives in city A wants to visit all cities from B to P over the course of a week, though not necessarily in alphabetical order, and return to A at the end. He plans to enter each city exactly once. The blue lines are the only roads connecting the 16 cities. The traveling salesman may use only a straight route between any two cities; he is not allowed to turn at the intersection of two streets. How many different routes are possible?

This puzzle is originally from Henry Ernest Dudeney’s 1917 book Amusements in Mathematics.

math,"[2410.04189] Primes of the form $p^2 + nq^2$ | Ben Green, Mehtaab Sawhney","arXiv:2410.04189 \[math.NT\]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04189)  
Abstract: Suppose that n is 0 or 4 modulo 6. We show that there are infinitely many primes of the form p2+nq2 with both p and q prime, and obtain an asymptotic for their number. In particular, when n=4 we verify the \`Gaussian primes conjecture' of Friedlander and Iwaniec.  
We study the problem using the method of Type I/II sums in the number field Q(-n---v). The main innovation is in the treatment of the Type II sums, where we make heavy use of two recent developments in the theory of Gowers norms in additive combinatorics: quantitative versions of so-called concatenation theorems, due to Kuca and to Kuca--Kravitz-Leng, and the quasipolynomial inverse theorem of Leng, Sah and the second author.

Alex Kontorovich on X: Major breakthrough on arxiv today: Ben Green and Mehtaab Sawhney push “Type II sum” techniques using Gowers norms, quantitative “concatenation” theorems, and the “quasi polynomial inverse theorem” to settle whole classes of major open problems about whole numbers! Their formulation is that, as p and q range over the primes, the expression p\^2 + (2q)\^2 is itself also prime infinitely often. (You can generalize it to p\^2+n q\^2 where n=0 or 4 mod 6). Mehtaab gave a beautiful lecture on this here at Princeton a few weeks ago...

I then plan to take each of the possible states and (attempt) to create a manifold of it with tangent spaces representing states in the puzzles that can be obtained from a single operation (twisting or making a modification on the board). From there I plan to utilize geodesics to find the best path (or algorithm) to the desired space. All this, to my knowledge, is fairly explored territory. What I plan to attempt from here it to see if I can utilize manifold intersection that could possibly create an algorithm to solve a Rubik’s cube and sudoku puzzle at the same time. I know manifolds are typically more associated with lie groups than others like permutation groups and that this idea stretches some abstract topics a little too thin than preferable. I also don’t know whether this specific idea has been explored yet. Is this idea feasible? Do I need to go into further depth? Are there any modifications I need to make? Please let me know. Edit: It has come to my attention this may not be entirely possible since manifolds contain infinite points and Rubik’s cubes and sudoku puzzles only have finite spaces.

When looking at math stock images, they seem to try to look complicated, some successfull at that, others not. However, they all seem very shallow.

math,What are your favourite theorems in geometry?,"Could be any theorem related to geometry. It could even be results that have some bearing on geometry and topology. 

Personally, my favourites are: 

**1. Pythagorean theorem (elegant and absolutely fundamental as it defines the Euclidean metric, which  can be easily extended to define other geometries, which eventually lead to the development of Riemannian  geometry)**

**2.Gauss Bonnet theorem**

**On the algebraic side:**

**1.Grothendieck Riemann Roch theorem**

**On the topological side:**

**1.Donaldson theorem, existence of exotic spheres in various dimensions, existence of infinitely many exotic copies of $R\^4$ etc.**

**2.h cobordism theorem**

**And on the more applied side (in the sense applied outside geometry):**

**Maybe Gromov's non squeezing theorem that is applied extensively in PDE. Or maybe the rich collection of theorems around Hamilton's Ricci flow that have lead to vast swaths of development in analysis, topology and even physics.**

So what are your favourite theorems? It doesn't matter how basic or how esoteric it may be. Goemetry is probably the one field in math with the widest reach, being absolutely essential in all areas of math, and crucial in physics, computer science and other areas. So I'd really love to see a dump of great theorems and results in geometry, not only on the pure side, but applied math side like engineering or CS or maybe finance, and even in completely separate fields like biology or cognitive neuroscience.

math,Kobon Triangles - optimal arrangement for k=19 found!,"Kobon Triangle Problem - optimal arrangement for k=19 found with 107 triangles! (previously unknown)

The Kobon Triangle Problem asks for the largest number N(k) of nonoverlapping triangles whose sides lie on an arrangement of k lines.

Before this, the largest value k for which an optimal arrangement was known was k=17, with 85 triangles. 

k=19 has an upper bound of 107 triangles, but the best known arrangement had 104 triangles. This arrangement I found has 107 triangles, and so has the maximum number of triangles possible!

I can only do one attachment, the image itself, so I can’t link my GitHub which has the code I used to find the arrangement. But here it is:

https://github.com/Bombardlos/Kobon_Triangle_Workspace

compile_mirror was used to find this arrangement in pure numerical form, then a separate program rendered 19_representation.png, and finally I made 19_final by hand. I also have compile_11, which is an algorithmic proof that k=11 CANNOT reach the current accepted upper bound of 33 triangles, and so the current best arrangement with 32 triangles is actually optimal. With the right equipment, it could ALSO find whether there is an arrangement for k=21 which meets the upper bound in a reasonable amount of time, but my laptop sucks and I don’t wanna cook it TOO badly lol.

I actually found the arrangement about a week ago, but it was with an algorithm that abstracts it really far away from the physical model. It took me awhile to turn a representation of the model into the model itself, and I had to do it largely by hand. I actually bought ribbon and wall tacks to be able to arrange part of it, since the first visual representation used VERY unstraight lines. I could move around the ribbons at certain points and restrict their movements with tacks, eventually sorting them into much straighter lines. Finally, I took a picture, opened a Google Slides file, uploaded the pic, turned the opacity down, and drew line objects overlayed on top of the pic. Did some more adjusting, and the final image is just a screenshot of the Google Slide 😂",bigBagus,1fx08k3,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fx08k3/kobon_triangles_optimal_arrangement_for_k19_found/,https://i.redd.it/ygdm3ovx40td1.jpeg,2024-10-05 21:00:16,242,0.99,242,0,23,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,Image Post,,t3_1fx08k3
math,Does this idea work for generalizing the cross product to n dimensions? ,"I haven't really found much (useful) online for this so I came here as a last resort. I am working on programs for visualizing 4d and above from complete scratch (my language doesn't have anything for matrices or vectors built in) so I've been doing some research in linear algebra, mostly 3B1B's essence of linear algebra series. The only issue is that he never mentions 4d with anything important for my uses, and a lot of places are saying the cross product just doesn't work in 4d and above (accept for 7d for some reason???) and I just want to know why, when (atleast extrapolating from 2&amp;3 dimensions) there's a decent pattern that seems to make natural sense for any (whole) dimension.

I want to be clear, I am not an expert. I do math as a hobby so if I'm spouting bullshit, please feel free to roast me in the comments. However, if you think of the idea of the 2d cross product, the idea is you take the area of the parallelogram that those vectors make. If these are {u1, u2} and {v1, v2} then the cross product is u1*v2-u2*v1. When I do this, I think of it as sort of an x, where you multiply the items that are in line and subtract the lines from eachother. This technically isn't the actual cross product, but I see it used enough that it might as well be an honorary 2d cross product even if it's literally just a determinant. 

The 3d case is similar, but we're getting a vector out, so we need three numbers, so we do it three times. We do a very similar process for the 2d (determinate) case. We do our x multiplication, but we start in the middle. Weird, but whatever. We put that as the first number, then shift our x down. Since the two bottom points (the lower numbers getting multiplied) were at the bottom and now just moved down, we just overflow them to the top. This means that in a sense we go from u2*v3  to u3*v4, overflows to u3*v1 and u1*v3. Subtract and put that in the vector, then repeat. You move the x down, overflowing when the points go below the end of the matrix and shove it in. These may seem very disconnected, but they are insanely similar in practice.

A procedure that gives you both of these results is start on the second to last number in the vector, and do the x multiply subtract oporation, then shift it down overflowing if necessary. Repeat until you shift to your original place and stop.
This is the exact procedure with 3d, but in 2d it also gives the same results. The first number in a list of two number IS the second to last one, and the reason you only get a number and not a vector is because there's only that single x you can make. In the 3d case you can shift down three times before they fully overlap, leading to a list of 3 numbers, a 3d vector. This also leads to a natural extension into 1d. If you think about the parallelograms area, in 1d it will be 0. Take two 1d vectors (just numbers) of {a} and {b}, this procedure asks for a*b-b*a, a*b=b*a and any number minus itself = 0, so you get the very natural conclusion that the area of a 1 dimension shape comes to 0. So with a procedure that seems to work great with 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, why not just keep going? The 4d case pretty much means that {u1, u2, u3, u4} x {v1, v2, v3, v4} = {(u3*v4-u4-v3), (u4*v1-u1*v4), (u1*v2-u2*v1), (u2*v3-u3*v2)} and while I haven't done enough to tell if this makes sense in a 4d geometry kind of way, this feels super natural and can be extended to any number of dimensions. 

I understand somebody else definitely came up with this idea before me, but I haven't heard much discussion about and and it feels like the most natural way to extend the cross product further.

math,idea about automated theorem proving,"hi math community, i am interested in automated theorem proving. I think that using language model to generate Lean code to do automated theorem proving is a promising path towards it. Specifically, using language model, supervised by both replay buffer from monte carlo tree search and supervised training with artificially generated math proving Lean code.

As for one proving step, the sampling space is almost infinite, so using a subset action space similar to *Sampled MuZero* to do node expanding in MCTS. I have a rudimentary idea about it, but might not have the time/computing power to implement it. Feel free to provide any feedback/correction to my idea, and hopefully it can be somewhat useful for further research.

math,Basic subspace topology clarification.,"So, take something as simple as the open interval (-1,1). It is a connected interval, because it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets. However, open here means open on the subspace topology. 

If you try:

{(-1,0] U (0,1) }

0 is a boundary point of the half-closed interval (-1,0] and so therefore it's not an open set, because it contains a point that is not an interior point. 

However, if you take the disconnected set of closed intervals, say [-1,0] U [2,3]  then you can describe it as a union of disjoint non-empty sets that are open on the subspace topology. 

I'm currently just accepting this (that these intervals are open on the subspace topology) without having a real understanding of why. On the standard topology, the sets [-1,0] and [2,3] are closed, so does anybody have an intuitive argument as to why they are open on the subspace topology?

math,Interest in an Open Math Community Site?,"Hey everyone,

I worked on a side project a couple of years ago and am thinking about picking it back up. It was an online app for mathematics and people interested in math. 

So here's kind of where the functionality is. Every user has a channel (much like youtube) and there they can create math challenge problems that other users can solve. On a user's channel they can create math quizzes that other users can take. They can also create math based flashcards that other users can import and study.

There is also an ability to post mathematics questions to the math question library. Here the questions can be solved for karma points other users and the solutions upvoted and discussed. (though this part is the least polished).

  
The feature that I was working on when I stopped working on the project was the ability to add an existing math book and create metadata such as solutions to the problems at the end of the chapter, flash cards, so for instance, you could create Calculus 1 - 4th Edition and then solve problems in the various chapters and add flashcards for sections, etc.

  
The whole point would be to make this completely open source and freely available. Some other features I was thinking about:

1. Math equation / theory database and built on search capabilities.

2. An browser editor for actually drawing and typing up (latex) mathematics.

  
Is anyone interested in this or something like this? If so I'm interested in picking it back up and building it out more. Please let me know what you think. Do you think this would be useful and helpful? Any other ideas?

For those interested more in the story, a link can be found here to a reddit post on r/AskHistorians about it.

A Banach space is a vector space that is complete with respect to a norm. If we wish to weaken this further it would be natural to look at vector spaces that are complete with respect to a metric or equivalently with respect to a family of seminorms. I would think that this is how we would define Frechet spaces, but the actual definition contains a little more. Depending on which definition of a Frechet space we use we also require that the metric is translation invariant, that the space is locally convex, and/or that the space is Hausdorff. Why do Frechet spaces need these extra condition whereas Hilbert and Banach spaces do not?

Also on Wikipedia they say there is no natural notion of distance between two points of a Frechet space since many different translation-invariant metrics may induce the same topology. Isn't this also true for Banach spaces where many norms may induce the same topology?

(After a little scribbling, I convinced myself that it does indeed fit the categorical definition, while it's obviously not surjective.)

math,Monte Carlo Simulation Without Historical Data,"This came to me as I was exploring some stuff at work, and while my gut instinct says it's pointless, I've yet to find much online to support one direction or the other.

As a part of our work, we look at risk for projects, both in dollars and time. As it currently stands, we brainstorm a list of potential risks, then go through and assign a probability of it occurring (usually as a range, say 10-20%), a cost if it does occur, and a time/schedule impact if it does occur.

None of these values are based on any solid historical data other than people's experience.

This list of risks then gets taken and put into a Monte Carlo simulation (uniform distribution for the risk range) for both dollars and time independently, and then the 65th or 70th percentile is usually used as the risk dollars and risk time.

So my question comes down to: **is it valid to use Monte Carlo simulation when all of the independent variables are ""man-made"" guesses?**

To me, it feels like you are creating a distribution of outcomes from a distribution of guesses, making it seem like there is more data backing the outcome than is really there. Taking the min/mean/max of each of the risk ranges and multiplying it by the dollars/time would seem to give a more honest answer as to the risk estimation, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the validity of this method.",notbrandonzink,1ftzmiv,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ftzmiv/monte_carlo_simulation_without_historical_data/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ftzmiv/monte_carlo_simulation_without_historical_data/,2024-10-01 21:27:37,2,0.63,2,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ftzmiv

math,Is there an intuition for how the dot product work when sampling continuous functions?,"On the surface I understand how a function can be represented as a vector and the inner product as an infinite dimensional dot product, but as I think deeper about it I start to lose the thread:

If we have a function f(x) and we sample the function at a point X we get f(X) and we can draw a vertical vector from X to f(X) then place that vector on an axis in a separate space. Then we sample the function at a point X+1 we get f(X+1) and draw a vector then place that vector on an orthogonal axis in the new space. Say we do this for 10 sampling points. We end up with a 10-dimensional space where each dimension in this space has a basis vector with length of the sampled point. The sum of all these basis vectors should give a vector approximating the original function. If we have another vector in this space and we take a dot product we should just multiply all the similar components and sum them. I understand all this.

But what if the sample points are spaced 0.5 instead of 1? If we sample f(x) over the same interval we get 20 sample points meaning a 20-dimensional space where each dimension has orthogonal basis vectors and the approximation of the function would be more accurate. HOWEVER If we were just given this vector space and didn't know it was sampled from a function, the dot product with another vector in this space is simply the same process of multiplying all the similar components and summing them so we get answer 'A'. But since we know that the vectors we sampled have spacing 0.5 the dot product should be HALF since \sum_{i} x_{i}y_{i}∆x  and ∆x=0.5 so we get a different answer 'B'. I don't understand how despite this being a standard vector space with orthogonal basis vectors, all dot products in this space must me multiplied by 0.5.",LemonLimeNinja,1ftphz1,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ftphz1/is_there_an_intuition_for_how_the_dot_product/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ftphz1/is_there_an_intuition_for_how_the_dot_product/,2024-10-01 14:30:21,2,0.67,2,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1ftphz1

math,Coastline Paradox: A New Perspective,"I wanted to generate some discussion on a paper I read recently that I found interesting, titled ""Coastline Paradox: A New Perspective"": [https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/b0945648-218d-4b51-a53e-1eea3a90cf95/content](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/b0945648-218d-4b51-a53e-1eea3a90cf95/content)

The author is a civil engineer by trade, with a specialty in coastline management. To better model and manage coastal erosion in his homecountry of Australia, he necessarily needs to measure coastlines. Although the coastline paradox dictates this as impossible/meaningless, in practice the author uses modern imaging techniques to measure coastline lengths all the time. He uses these measurements to build coastal erosion models that are accurate, and he uses the models when designing his engineering projects. In turn, these engineered structure successfully prevent coastal erosion as his models predict.

I had a chance to talk to the author, and he told me he wasn't trying to pick a fight so much as start a discussion. He said when he first entered his field, he was surprised at how often other engineers and government leaders would avoid the types of problems he was trying to solve, citing the coastline paradox as evidence that it wasn't possible. He also pointed out to me that there's a range of legal and geopolitical issues that are exacerbated when people can handwave away the notion that coastlines have a definite length or boundary.

I thought it was admirable of him to try to start a wider conversation about this, especially given how entrenched the coastline paradox has become.

math,Approximating Functions with Sinusoids ,"Hello r/askmath ,

I have a question about what is the most efficient way to approximate a repeating function (think square wave form) with a set number of Sinusoids. 

Ex. Approximate square waveform with 3 Sinusoids.

So at first I thought to just use the first 3 terms in the Fourier series for the waveform which does give a pretty good approximation. However, I am not sure it is obvious that this is the best set of Sinusoids to use when limited to just 3. Obviously the Fourier series gets better and better the more terms you add but for just the first 3 terms is it the best?

This made me wonder if I vary the frequency or amplitude of the 3rd sinusoid for example might I get a better fit? Or is the best set a totally different set of 3 sinusoids. 

More generally, Is there a way of solving for the best fit parameters (amplitude, frequency) for a set of N sinusoids? 

Also does this best fit change depending on the figure of merit like for example using a mean squared error or a mean absolute value?

Anyways just curious, if anyone here has any answers for this question. Thanks.

math,"Imre Lakatos's ""Proofs and Refutations"" is awesome and you should read it if you want to do research","I saw someone on this subreddit mention Lakatos's [*Proofs and Refutations*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/proofs-and-refutations/575FC8A6B4FAB79E649EDF5FBB9C6E10), and I wish I had this book when I was in graduate school. In short, it's a mathematical philosophy book that discusses the relationship between theorems, proofs, and counterexamples. While it's a philosophy book, it feels very practically applicable, as it's examining how one generates mathematical knowledge.

In the book (which is a dialogue regarding the Euler-Descartes conjecture among ""students"" who seem freakishly intelligent to the point of being laughable; their names are all Greek letters), he illustrates how mathematical discovery differs significantly from how it is presented in papers and in mathematics classes (even at university or post-graduate level). In presentation, a mathematician will present a set of axioms and definitions from which an interesting theorem later emerges. Often these assumptions and definitions seem bizarre on first glance; one of my favorite examples is ""uniform integrability"" in probability theory and statistics, which pops out of nowhere then gives you useful results. However, the process for reaching this point centers around a proof and its relationship to counterexamples that may emerge. Sometimes a proof comes first, with the mathematician devising definitions and assumptions that allow the proof to yield a useful result. Other times a conjecture appears, some facts are collected that fail to refute it, then a proof is proposed. But usually these strange lemmas, definitions, and assumptions are back-fit to make a proof work.

A proof essentially decomposes a theorem into a series of verifiable lemmas that justify the statement of the conjecture. If a counterexample is found (and Lakatos says you need to look for them), the ""proof"" can suggest what was wrong in the justification, and thus what revisions need to take place to have a ""true"" statement (I put in quotes because Lakatos seems to doubt that we can always rule out the possibility of a future counterexample).

When I was in grad school, I remember writing a proof for a conjecture and sending it to my advisor via e-mail (he was on travel, as he often was). He replied with a counterexample, I studied why it was a counterexample and where my ""proof"" went wrong, and then I abandoned the idea. If I had read this book back then, I would have better known how to address the counterexample to still potentially have a useful result in the end. Sadly, while I recall the statement I made, I have lost my ""proof"" and my advisor's counterexample, so I cannot try that out. (I am no longer in academia.)

While the relationship between proof and theorem is the central point of the book, his dialogue discusses a number of interesting and, in my opinion, highly practical issues in research mathematics, such as assumptions being underinclusive, the issue of ""monster-barring,"" and others. He also has an interesting discussion regarding the history of mathematics, how hostile mathematicians in the 19th century and prior were to counterexamples and monsters (along with why this hostility existed; cranks with bad theorems were apparently common) which led to bad ideas persisting for long periods of time. But if there's one thing to take away from the book, it's Lakatos's method of proofs and refutations (the title of the book), a dialectic method proceeding like so:

1. If you have a conjecture, set out to prove and refute it. Inspect the proof carefully to prepare a list of non-trivial lemmas (proof-analysis); find counterexamples both to the conjecture (global counterexamples) and to the suspect lemmas (local counterexamples).
2. If you have a global counterexample discard your conjecture, add to your proof-analysis a suitable lemma that will be refuted by the counterexample, and replace the discarded conjecture by an improved one that incorporates that lemma as a condition. Do not allow a refutation to be dismissed as a monster. Try to make all ""hidden lemmas"" explicit.
3. If you have a local counterexample, check to see whether it is not also a global counterexample. If it is, you can easily apply (2).
4. If you have a counterexample which is local but not global, try to improve your proof-analysis by replacing the refuted lemma by an unfalsified one.

This is a process I did not fully understand while I was in grad school, and I wish I did. Most of the classes concerns developing a useful background of mathematical facts, which is part of being a researcher, but not enough on its own. Formulating and studying conjectures is an entirely different process that needs tools separate from proving a statement given to you. And I was not given a book like this that discussed the issue well (though my department did give away free copies of [*A mathematician's survival guide*](https://bookstore.ams.org/gscm/), which I do appreciate). I hope that others will give this book a look if you are interested, and I will try to apply its ideas myself.",NTGuardian,1fsfek7,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fsfek7/imre_lakatoss_proofs_and_refutations_is_awesome/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fsfek7/imre_lakatoss_proofs_and_refutations_is_awesome/,2024-09-29 21:34:29,212,0.98,212,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fsfek7

math,How Do You Visualize Math in your Head?,"I hope this doesn't come across as pseudointellectualism. I think it doesn't as it's well known that how information is presented to you affects how well you remember it. For example, flash cards are shown to improve retention of information better than just reading it so there are de facto methods of learning that are just more effective than others (statistically speaking).

I've found that as I went through undergrad my ability to visualize information in my head has decreased and I think this is because I conditioned myself to only visualize math when staring at the information on a piece of paper because instead of visualizing it in my head I visualized it on the paper I was looking at using my actual eyes..  I struggle to visualize moving along simple graphs in my head for example whereas I didn't before. This is a problem because it means I'm struggling when the information isn't infront of me and becomes a bottleneck in how fast I can think about stuff since my eyes can only focus on so much at once.

Well I've been trying to improve on that and I am wondering, when YOU visualize something like an equation, do you visualize it all at once or do you think about it sequentially? For me, I'm visualizing white on black background, and when I visualize a singular number it's easy to visualize it all at once, as well as something simple like a fraction with one denominator, however, when I start thinking about something more complicated, like 1/(1/r1+1/r2+...+1/rn) in my mind it gets a bit more complicated and I can choose to either visualize it sequentially, which is how I find myself doing it in the past, or I can try and do it all at once, but doing it all at once really feels like I am just switching back and forth between two different pieces of information. I'm wondering if the latter is superior, because thinking of it sequentially makes me feel like a computer just doing sequential steps whereas I'd think seeing it all at once would allow me to actually visualize my end goal better.

I've read about some people who visualize actual spatial libraries in their head to retain huge amounts of info and I am just wondering if there is a better way to go about remembering a bunch of information.",TRIPMINE_Guy,1fsfyr8,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fsfyr8/how_do_you_visualize_math_in_your_head/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fsfyr8/how_do_you_visualize_math_in_your_head/,2024-09-29 22:00:20,54,0.92,54,0,40,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fsfyr8

math,Inverse images in Lawvere's treatment of the category of sets,"I am reading through Lawvere's &amp; Rosebrugh's Sets For Mathematics and have gotten a little hung up on the inverse image section.

*x ∈ i ⇔ f x ∈ j*

This is intuitively obvious for sets, but not obvious (to me, at least) when ""part"" and ""∈"" are understood in the categorical language being used in this text. For instance, why should there exist any mono from *U* to *X* let alone alone a mono with the above property? So, is this actually one of the axioms of the category of sets and just not stated explicitly as such? Or can it be shown by the previously introduced axioms?

math,Can this prime number formula be proven?,"I've been tinkering with prime numbers today and found a pattern of sorts. It won't predict the next prime number but maybe it will reduce the possible numbers to check. Or the reason for this pattern is extremely obvious in its existence and I'll learn something. Anyway, here's what I found that worked for primes 11 to 43 inclusive;

(Please excuse my lack of math notation ability)

For the 5th Prime (11) and higher Primes, the following can be true:  
  
nth Prime = ((Prime#(n-2)) \* Prime#2) ± (Prime#(n-1) ± (Prime#(n-3) ... ± (Prime#(1) &amp; Optional ± 1.

Basically the 5th Prime equals the 3rd Prime multiplied to 3 and then ± all the remaining lower primes (excluding the 2 primes used in the multipication at the start). Sometimes have to ± 1 due to the amount of remaining odd prime numbers. The trick is confirming which lower primes should be added or subtracted.

E.g.:

11 = 5\*3 -7 +2 +1  
13 = 7\*3 -11 +5 -2  
17 = 11\*3 -13 -7 -5 -2 +1  
19 = 13\*3 -17 +11 -7 -5 -2

So is there a higher prime where no matter the combination of ± remaining primes, it can't total to that prime?

math,"Is there a theory of intervals with ""negative intervals"" (first endpoint &gt; second endpoint)?","I'm designing and programming interval types for my game engine, which works with both real-valued and integer-valued intervals.

The main use for these intervals is checking whether they contain a specific value. Sometimes I also compute unions and intersections of intervals, producing a potentially disjoint ""interval set"". Another use case is enumeration, supported only by integer intervals.

Now, I encountered a case where I would like to express an integer interval whose values are enumerated in reverse order: e.g. if the ""normal"" interval `[1, 3]` produces values `1, 2, 3`, the ""negative"" interval `[3, 1]` produces a list `3, 2, 1`.

However, simply allowing intervals to have their first endpoint be greater than the second makes set operations on them very confusing. For example, the union of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 6]` is `[1, 6]`. But what is the union of `[1, 3]` and `[6, 2]`? What would the order of enumeration be for such a thing?

My only idea is to make these ""negative"" intervals completely incompatible with normal ones and disallow unions and intersections between them. While they can be trivially converted from one to the other, this would force me to have twice as many interval types (and I already have a bunch: `RightOpenRealInterval`, `ClosedIntegerInterval`, etc).

Is there an existing theory that describes such intervals and operations on them in a consistent way? Or is my solution of having two incompatible interval ""worlds"" (normal and negative) the only sensible way to approach this?

math,What are the connections between analytic number theory and abelian varieties (or Diophantine geometry)?,"Dear all,

It's more or less well-known that abelian varieties are some kinds of generalization of elliptic curves and they are important objects in the studies of diophantine geometry and (algebraic) number theory. For instance, in Bombieri--Gubler's famous ""*Heights in diophantine geometry*"", chapter 8 devotes itself into abelian varieties.

There is a seminar on abelian varieties at our school next semester, which looks quite promising and interesting. However, personally I am more interested in analytic/additive number theory and hope to do research in these fields in the near future.

I have googled relevant keywords but was to no avail. *So I was wondering what are the connections between analytic number theory and abelian varieties? Arxiv and/or journal links are welcome!*

math,Applicability of van Holten's algorithm for symmetries in classical mechanics,"Copying this over from [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/474456/applicability-of-van-holtens-algorithm-for-symmetries-in-classical-mechanics) in the hopes of getting an answer here -- thanks in advance for looking at this dense question!

&amp;nbsp;

**Background**

van Holten's algorithm (see e.g. [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1204]) and [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1204)) is a way of constructing or recognizing dynamical/hidden symmetries in classical mechanics by looking for Killing tensors on the configuration space $M$

&amp;nbsp;

For the case of a particle of charge $q$ in an electromagnetic field, we have a Hamiltonian

`[; H = \frac{1}{2} g^{ij}(\mathbf{x}) \Pi_i \Pi_j + V(\mathbf{x}) ;]`

where

- $g_{ij}(\mathbf{x})$ is the metric on the configuration space $M$ (whose co-tangent bundle $T^{*}M$ is the symplectic manifold that is the phase space of the system), which in general depends on $\mathbf{x}$,

- $V(\mathbf{x})$ is the potential energy of the system, which depends only on the position in configuration space $\mathbf{x}$

- $\Pi_{i} = p_i - qA_i$ are the kinematic/gauge invariant momenta, as opposed to the canonical momenta $p_i$

- $A_i$ is the vector potential, $\nabla \times \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}$.

&amp;nbsp;

The standard Poisson brackets are modified to

`[; \{ x^i, x^j \} = 0 \quad \{ x^i, \Pi_j \} = \delta^i_j \quad \{ \Pi_i, \Pi_j \} = q F_{ij} ;]`


where $F_{ij} = \frac{\partial A_j}{\partial q^i} - \frac{\partial A_i}{\partial q^j}$ is the (magnetic) field strength tensor.

&amp;nbsp;

Via Noether's theorem, a continuous symmetry of the system is associated with a charge $Q$, which is a constant of motion when Hamilton's equations are satisfied. This is equivalent to the Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian vanishing:

`[; \{ Q, H \} = 0 ;]`

van Holten demonstrates that if this charge $Q$ can be expanded in the momenta $\Pi_i$ as

`[; Q = \sum_{k=0}^N \frac{1}{k!} C^{i_1 \dots i_k}(\mathbf{q}) \, \Pi_{i_1} \dots \Pi_{i_k} ;]`

where the coefficients $C^{i_1 \dots i_k} = C^{(i_1 \dots i_k)}$ are fully symmetric under exchange of any pair of indices, then if for some $p &lt; N$, we have an expansion coefficient satisfying the relation

`[; \nabla^{(i_{p+1}} C^{i_1 \dots i_p)} = 0 ;]`

then the momentum expansion of $Q$ terminates at order $p$. Here $\nabla$ is the covariant derivative associated with the Levi-Civita connection constructed from $g_{ij}(\mathbf{x})$. The above relation generalizes the Killing condition for vector fields on $M$ to higher rank tensors -- hence $C^{i_1 \dots i_p}$ is known as a Killing tensor (or more accurately, are the coefficients of such a tensor).

&amp;nbsp;

To see this, plug the above momentum expansion of $Q$ into $\{Q,H\}= 0$. After some manipulation (e.g. using the metric compatibility condition $\nabla_i g_{jk} =0$), we find that requiring terms to vanish order-by-order in $\Pi_i$ yields

&amp;nbsp;

`[; C^i \frac{\partial V}{\partial x^i}= 0  ;]`

`[; \partial_iC  = q F_{ij} C^j  + C_i^{~j}  \frac{\partial V}{\partial x^j} ;]`

`[; \nabla_iC_j + \nabla_j C_i = q \left(F_{ik}C^{~k}_l + F_{lm} C_i^m\right) + C_{il}^k \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x^i} ;]`

`[; \nabla_iC_{jk} + \nabla_j C_{ki}  + \nabla_k C_{ij}  = q \left(F_{im}C^{~~m}_{ij} + F_{lm} C_{ij}^{~~m} + F_{jm}C_{il}^{~~m}\right) + C_{ijl}^{~~~m} \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x^m} ;]`

&amp;nbsp;

and so on. The $r$-th order term in this series of constraint relates the (derivative of) $r$-th order coefficients $C^{i_1 \dots i_r}$, to the $r+1$th order $C^{i_1 \dots i_{r+1}}$ and the $r+2$-th order $C^{i_1 \dots i_{r+2}}$, and so if the $p$-th order coefficient is a Killing tensor, then the $p+1$ and $p+2$ order coefficients must vanish as the potential $V(\mathbf{x})$ and field strength $F_{ij}$ are arbitrary.

&amp;nbsp;

If the rank of the Killing tensor is greater than one, we call the symmetry associated $Q$ a /dynamical/ or /hidden/ symmetry. If the rank is one (i.e. we have a Killing vector), and we satisfy another consistency condition, then $Q$ is associated with a /kinematic/ symmetry. An example of the latter is angular momentum in rotationally invariant systems, while an example of the former is the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector in the 3d Kepler problem.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTION**

In the references listed above, there is no consideration of a system in the absence of an (electro-)magnetic field, i.e. $F_{ij}=0$, $A_i =0$. Does the series of recurrence relations still allow us to terminate the expansion of $Q$ at finite order?

&amp;nbsp;

I would think not, as the vanishing of the field strength and vector potential mean the canonical and kinematic momenta coincide. The corresponding expansion of $Q$ and order-by-order constraints required by the vanishing of the Poisson bracket mean that $r$-th order term relates only the $r$-th order and $r+2$-th order terms, so if $C^{i_1 \dots i_p}$ is a Killing tensor only the higher order coefficients whose rank is $p+2, p+4, p+6 \dots$ are forced to vanish.

&amp;nbsp;

But this would seem to limit van Holten's algorithm to a particular class of system. Is their a way to see that this is not the case, i.e. the Killing tensor condition and truncation of the $Q$ expansion works for a wider class of systems?",nonreligious2,1fqmy3w,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fqmy3w/applicability_of_van_holtens_algorithm_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fqmy3w/applicability_of_van_holtens_algorithm_for/,2024-09-27 12:50:14,1,0.67,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fqmy3w

math,What's up with symmetric matrices?,"I'm a first year PhD student taking an algebra course which has made me revisit a lot of linear algebra concepts I haven't thought in years, and one of these things are symmetric matrices. They have some very nice algebraic properties such as their eigenvectors all being orthogonal but I think there is something deeper going on that I haven't figured out. 

(1) The transpose of a matrix is a pullback map between dual spaces. That is if A: X -&gt; Y is a linear map between vector spaces then A\^T: Y\* -&gt; X\*. Why is it such a big deal for the linear map and its pullback to be the same, especially if we take X = Y = R\^n? 

(2) Is there any geometric interpretation of symmetric matrices? For symmetric matrices the fundamental theorem of linear algebra states the column space is orthogonal to the null space. I found an old stackexchange question that related this to orthogonal projections and symmetric matrices somehow being irrotational but I didn't understand it.  

(3) Other than algebraic reasons, why we would expect the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix to be orthogonal? Is there anyway to visualize this?

(3) Lastly, while searching around I found out that numerical analysts really care when a matrix is symmetric. Why is that?

math,Ramble on strength and truth,"Math is weak and so it is strong:

Math only says trivialities (e.g: in the sense of Russell), and it is because of this that we trust its results.

Intuitively, the more you speak, the more likely it is for you to say something false. So in a sense, the less you can say, the more true you are. (In big quotation marks.)

Category theory I feel takes this a bit further.

For instance, how many polymorphic functions are there of type `x → x`? Only one: the identity.

However, there are possibly many once you fix an `x`.

Category theory I feel parametrizes its proofs and definitions so much that it may end up with not so many examples (up to isomorphism) of what it wants to talk about.

This might be a bit confusing. After all, for instance abelian categories are strictly more general than modules. And still generally speaking, the more general a definition becomes, the less properties it has.

A trivial example: If you have an actual implementation of the natural numbers, say the one given in set theory `0 := ∅, S(n) := n ∪ {n}`, you have properties regarding this implementation like ∅ being a natural number or that 2∈3, and so on. You can't say any of this of a natural numbers object, even if you are in `Set`.

(I hope this example doesn't deviate the conversation from the more general thesis.)

It is in this sense that I think of category theory as even ""more true"" than (usual) math: its parametricity helps as a guide by clearing details and its intuitively ""foundation-free"" presentation gives an astounding robustness.

It assumes less than Z(FC+...) and it is because of this that I trust it the most.

---

A note on category theory using set theory as a foundation:

As far as I'm concerned, nobody has written down such a ""foundation-free"" presentation of category theory nor is it exactly clear what does it mean, but I'm sure most category theorists think of category theory this way, as a theory in and of itself. (And I mean *theory* in a deeper way than just the notion of first order theory.)

However one can think of Z(FC) as just a bootstrapping tool for compiling category theory. If you don't use the full strength of Z(FC) and can compile category theory in itself, that should be enough foundation, and the initial bootstrapping part can be abstracted away to any other foundation. (As is being done in type theory: HoTT, etc...)

---

A final note on truth and strength:

A turing complete language is false in the sense of Curry-Howard, and yet it is ""truer"" than Z(FC), which is excessively platonist (e.g: powerset axiom, replacement, ...), in the sense that even if false, can be perceived and seen in the real world in a computer.

Dozens of hours of confusion would have been avoided if I didn't have to stumble upon this lemma myself on the Wikipedia page.

  
Let X and Y be random variables. Then Y is σ(X)-measurable if and only if Y is a function of X.

More precisely, let T: (Ω, 𝓕) → (Ω', 𝓕') be measurable. Let (E, 𝓑(E)) be a nice metric space, like Polish or something. A function f: (Ω, 𝓕) → (E, 𝓑(E)) is σ(T)-measurable if and only if f = g ∘ T for some measurable g: (Ω', 𝓕') → (E, 𝓑(E)).

This shows that σ-algebras do indeed correspond to ""amounts of information"". My god. Mathematics becomes confusing when isomorphic things are identified. I think there is an identification of different things in probability theory which happens very commonly but is rarely explicitly clarified, and it looks like

P(X ∈ A | Y) vs. P(X ∈ A | Y = y)

The object on the left can be so elegantly explained by the conditional expectation with respect to a σ-algebra. What is the object on the right? This happens sooooooo much in the theory of Markov processes. Try to understand the strong Markov property. Suddenly a stochastic object is seen as depending upon a parameter, into which you can plug another random variable. HOW DOES THAT WORK? Because of the Doob-Dynkin lemma. P(X ∈ A | Y) is σ(Y)-measurable, so there indeed exists a function g so that g(Y) = P(X ∈ A | Y). We define P(X ∈ A | Y = y) = g(y).

  
Next up in ""probability theory your prof doesn't want you to know about"": the disintegration theorem and how you can ACTUALLY condition on events of probability zero, like defining a Brownian bridge.

math,Intuition behind the functional in Lebesgue decomposition ,"Hi,

I was wondering whether someone has some intuition about the evaluating functional that is used to proof the Lebesgue decomposition theorem using the functional analytic proof.

So we have two finite measures mu and v and want to decompose v into one absolutely continuous and one singular part wrt to mu.

The proof works in the L2 space with respect to the sum measure mu + v. By noting that the function that takes a function h from L2(mu+v) and returns the Lebesgue integral of h with respect to v is a linear and continuous function into the reals, we can use Riesz representation theorem to obtain some g in L2(mu+v) that represents this function via the inner product, i.e. integral h dv = integral h*g d(mu+v). 

One can then show that (1-g) can also be used to evaluate integral h with respect to the other measure mu. 

Given these equalities, one can show that g is in  [0, 1] almost everywhere with respect to the measure mu + v. 

We then define E as the pre-image of {1}  of g and can show that it is a null set wrt to mu.
Finally, we can define the absolutely continuous part of the decomposition as v(A \ E) and the singular part as v(A intersection E).

You can then show that this is actually a decomposition of v and that these two measures are absolutely continuous and singular wrt to mu. Finally, we also get that the function g/(1-g) for all x outside of E and 0 for x in E is a density of the absolutely continuous part of the decomposition with respect to mu.

I get all the steps of this proof, but I am not quite sure if there isn't some intuition behind g that I am missing. We see that if v(E) would be 0, we have v(A) = v(A \ E) + v(A intersection E) = v(A \ E), since 0 &lt;= v(A intersection E) &lt;= v(E) = 0. Since v(A\E) is the absolutely continuous part of the decomposition, this implies that E, i.e. the points where g is 1 are the ""problematic parts"". And if v would already be absolutely continuous with respect to mu (like in the Radon-Nikodym theorem), we'd have that E is a null set. This gives me some intuition about where g is 1, but where is it 0? And what does it say when g is a real number strictly between 0 and 1. I'm also curious why  the ratio g/(1-g) is a density of the absolutely continuous part of the decomposition with respect to mu. 

Is there any intuition behind all of this or is it really just a construct to proof the theorem?",arg_max,1fpr2hf,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fpr2hf/intuition_behind_the_functional_in_lebesgue/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fpr2hf/intuition_behind_the_functional_in_lebesgue/,2024-09-26 08:04:54,6,0.88,6,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fpr2hf

math, Aspiring PhD Student Looking for Advice on Combining Math and Sports in Research,"Hi everyone! I’m a senior majoring in math and planning to apply for PhD programs to start next fall 🤞.

We can also talk about chaos, lyapunov exponents, etc in this approach. While in ergodic theory, there are measure theoretic ideas which seems to kinda mirror ideas in the topological approach. Here we define also a type of (strong) mixing, measure-theoretic entropy, ergodicity, etc and we find a sort of ergodic hierarchy (which I think is kinda similar to how topological transitivity is weaker than topological mixing). However, I think we call two dynamical systems in this approach equivalent if we can find a measure persevering map between them.

I'm an undergraduate math student taking a class on probability theory with a professor who is quite accomplished in the field. He's an excellent probabilist and an excellent mathematician. We had a lecture with him today, and after it ended, I was talking with one of my friends, we'll call him Carl, who mentioned that he was reading an algebraic geometry textbook by Alexander Grothendieck. (I don't remember which book; it must have been the one without an english translation) He pulled the book out, and was joking with another friend of mine that he was going to use it to test their French. The professor of the class, being French himself, heard this and walked over to ask what Carl's book was. He picked it up, grimaced, turned to the cover, then handed it back to Carl and said, (I've blurred the first phrase due to profanity)

""&gt;!This is shit!&lt;. Why are you reading this?"" Then, after a pause, ""This almost killed math!""

Carl was left somewhat dumbfounded, and I didn't know what to make of this. So my question to you all is: why was he so strongly opposed to the use of this book? Is there a controversy surrounding it? How could this book or its methods have almos \*killed math\*? What's going on here?

math,Centering group theory pedagogy around representation theory,"
Having completed my undergraduate algebra sequence last year, and taken some elective courses in representation theory and finite fields, I’ve come to develop some thoughts on how algebra is taught at the university level.

Our standard sequence consisted of two courses: one course on group theory, and another course teaching the basics of rings, fields and Galois theory. The basic idea is that a student who takes the sequence should understand fully the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, and thus the reasons for the unsolvability of the quintic, while learning about the concepts that modern algebra has made central to contemporary mathematics (closure, homomorphisms, normal subgroups/ideals, quotients, (implicit) functorality, etc…).
While I think this standard sequence does a decent job of teaching these concepts, it does at times seem a tad unmotivated.

For example, in my introductory group theory class, many of the first examples were about the symmetries of polygons (this was the motivation for introducing the dihedral group, and eventually tied to the introduction of the symmetric group). While this was nice, it seemed like a bit of an “isolated” set of examples: we briefly covered them and moved on to what seemed like pure symbol-pushing abstraction. The concepts of homomorphism, quotients, etc… were then introduced in almost a purely formal way. I felt as though I was able to prove the statements, but I didn’t understand them. 

This was especially true when it came to theorems like Cayley’s — arguably this theorem was the birth of functorality (in a sense, Yoneda’s lemma is just a generalization of it), but it was treated in my course as little more than a formal tool. The same occurred when it came to understanding group actions — the examples seemed abstract and contrived. I don’t think I really understood the significance of Cayley’s theorem or group actions until I learned about representation theory — where we can use group elements to “permute” spaces of interest (also broader concepts like groups acting on topological spaces), when many of the concepts began to hit.

It seems to me that unless you are introducing groups, rings and fields all in the same course (centered around the “number theoretic” pedagogy of Galois theory), that it might be more pedagogically interesting to introduce groups as objects that can “act” on others in cool ways to analyze different problems. Most students taking a first group theory course have already seen quite a bit of linear algebra, so why not teach group theory through representation theory? Arguably even Galois’ original use of groups was to understand how roots of polynomials are “permuted”, to me this seems consistent with this “representation theoretic” emphasis. Not only would students be able to reinforce the linear algebra they learned this way, but they’d get a better sense of why groups are really important and so central to modern mathematics — it’s a common complaint at my school that the objects studied in analysis just seem a lot more “tangible”, and I don’t even necessarily think it’s true!

As far as rings and fields go, such courses could retain the pedagogical goal of proving the Galois correspondence, but if the first course in group theory has a representation-theoretic emphasis, they could also interpret modules and maybe even a bit of the general representation theory of associative algebras. It just seems to me that the me richest concepts in algebra come from algebraic structures “acting” on various objects, and I don’t know why this isn’t emphasized in undergraduate courses more. It certainly doesn’t seem significantly more difficult than what is taught (you could easily link the tricky study of say, conjugacy, to irreducible representations for example), and would make algebra a lot more motivated, in the same way people know that the “why” of studying analysis comes from the need to formalize concepts from calculus.

I didn't expect to take about *eight* hours to cover Chapter 2, Dependent Type Theory. I'm trying to explain everything my mentees are unfamiliar with because most of them are new to propositional and first-order logic, let alone type theory. So, I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish the book before my mentoring ends. I'm okay with my progress; my mentees already look busy learning Lean's type theory while doing their main jobs.

Lastly, each of us will create a git repository containing solutions to some of the exercises in ""Theorem Proving in Lean 4."" Mine is [tpil-solutions](https://git.sr.ht/~chabulhwi/tpil-solutions). It doesn't have any solutions yet, but you can check out the [quiz](https://git.sr.ht/~chabulhwi/tpil-solutions/tree/master/item/docs/en/quiz/chapter02.md) I made for Chapter 2.

math,Yay! My maths department introduced a new course on elliptical curves,"I just thought this was cool to share, because the department I study in recently has significantly shifted its focus primarily to more of an 'analysis' research focus, and hence to more of those courses. Slightly unfortunately though this caused a bit of neglect to algebraic options- for example the university flip-flops every few years on whether to offer graph theory (currently not). Meanwhile for whatever reason we actually have a standalone functional analysis and set theory research grouping. However, the head of algebraic research has expanded upon on of the topology courses and created one on elliptical curves (mostly because he's interested on the interface between curves and K-theory in algebraic cryptography). Cool nonetheless.",_pptx_,1fnukqi,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fnukqi/yay_my_maths_department_introduced_a_new_course/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fnukqi/yay_my_maths_department_introduced_a_new_course/,2024-09-23 20:30:19,32,0.9,32,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fnukqi

math,AMA: I am a PhD dropout under John Baez,"First thing I'll say is, I know John Baez has a pretty big online presence for a mathematician, but to my knowledge he isn't on reddit (at least as of the mid 2010s). But if he somehow comes across this... like if one of his current students sees it and feels like telling him about it... well, this is a bit awkward, but hi, John! I hope you're well and your research projects are going well, and I have nothing but positive thoughts and feelings for you.

In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fkcbjm/ama_request_one_of_terrence_taos_mediocre_but_not/) I commented on a whim that I'd do an AMA as a PhD dropout under John Baez if people were interested. As it turned out, quite a few people were interested. So, as promised, here's my AMA.

I've been debating a bit in my mind if I'll try to remain anonymous for this. It doesn't seem like there's much point trying, as any clever enough person who reads this thread and my comment history will probably be able to figure out my name, for example by looking at all the co-authors of papers with Baez on [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org) and doing some detective work. I think what I'll do is this. I won't outright volunteer my name, and I'll ask on good faith for anyone who goes to the trouble to figure it out for some reason to not post it here. That said, if somebody goes ahead and does, it's not really a big deal to me; it's not like I did anything criminal and I'm in hiding. It's just not a happy story I have to tell, and I'm not particularly eager to dox myself. But I will answer all questions as honestly as I can.

Here's the REALLY short version. I'll elaborate more in the answers.

I was a pretty solid, but not exceptional, undergrad math student who was accepted to a PhD program in math at UC Riverside. When I got my acceptance letter, I had another look at their math department faculty page, and saw the name John Baez. The name sounded familiar. I realized I had enjoyed a number of his online articles as an undergrad (once a physics major, switched to math). I was tremendously excited to possibly get to work with this guy.

We briefly met before the start of my freshman year, but Baez was away for most of that year (he would regularly travel to a summer position in Singapore, and I think that whole year he was on sabbatical or something). I started attending his research group meetings in my sophomore year.

I did really well in my first several years. I also was a regular user of cannabis and alcohol during that time. It didn't seem to affect me too much, or at least, I had it pretty well under control for a while. I passed all of my written qual exams on time (a few of them, admittedly, just barely). As objectively as I can say from my extremely biased point of view, I think I was a slightly above average math PhD student. Some subjects (analysis, and any abstract algebra higher than group theory) were pretty rough for me. Others (topology, graph theory, differential geometry) I was strong in. Baez had background in mathematical physics, but had in recent years made a switch to category theory, having a vision of a 'green mathematics' where categories can play a significant role. I didn't know much of anything about categories, but I thought Baez and his vision were awesome, so I dove in.

Around here, between my 3rd and 4th years as a PhD student, I took a summer road trip to Las Vegas that would have a drastic negative impact on me for years to come.

Things were going well, I was a young man who'd passed his written quals and was beginning research in category theory. I had a complicated relationship with various substances, but had it mostly under control (or so I believed, and still believe). But the trip to Vegas awakened some latent darkness in me. I played blackjack and poker all night until I went broke around 7 am. The adrenaline rush from the high to the low was beyond compare for me. And I believe I developed an overnight gambling problem right then and there (which is thankfully under much better control now, more than 10 years later).

I've written a lot already, and you've got a basic sense of the circumstances now, so let me compress the rest. My gambling and substance problems got worse as the pressure to do good research work increased. I started to regularly go to casinos local to UCR (San Manuel and Morongo) to de-stress from life as a math grad student - combined with increasingly stupid and reckless substance use. As you'd imagine, my math productivity plummeted, and John finally got to the point where he was no longer willing to be my PhD advisor.

I withdrew with a Master's in math (I completed the requirements for it on my way toward the PhD), moved back home with my parents, and have been gradually reconstructing my life ever since.

I've left out a lot of ugly things in this compressed version. For example, during the course of my gambling, I got into a loan problem (both street corner 'payday loans' and more substantial bank loans) that eventually got so bad, I ended up declaring bankruptcy. Also, my substance and gambling issues got even worse after withdrawing from UCR. But it's not all miserable! I'm in a much better place now.

Thanks for reading and for your questions! I hope this is valuable for people, especially anyone in any remotely similar situation as I was in (academic student struggling with addictions).

math,[Reference Request] Is studying Brownian Motion and basic stochastic calculus possible without measure theory?,"Hello all,
I'm in my final year of uni in (applied mathematics) and I've been self studying stochastic processes for a while, mainly for the fun of it since I've taken precious few statistics and probability theory courses. 

I'm extremely interested in the topic of Brownian Motion ( arguably the central area of stochastic processes ) but in doing some research about possible resources for further study, I've hit the extremely tall wall of measure theory. I haven't taken a course on measure theory, I do not enjoy analysis much and the Prof was rude and unmotivated during the first few classes so I dropped the course and don't really plan on taking it again.

So my questions, is there any way to get into the basics of brownian motion without knowing measure theory? Or, alternatively, is there any treatment of the subject that introduces the bare minimum of measure theory before getting into the subject? 
Are there any other prerequisites for what I'm trying to achieve besides basic probability theory and basic stochastic processes?

math,Is classical/geometric mechanics still an active area of research? ,"I am not a mathematician. My background is in physics and engineering. I’ve always loved classical mechanics but was under the impression it was pretty much a done and closed subject. However, a couple years ago I discovered what some refer to as “geometric mechanics” (I do not mean geometric algebra). As best as I can tell it is a (re)formulation of classical analytical mechanics  in the coordinate-agnostic language of differential geometry. It also seems to “elevate” classical mechanics to a similar mathematical framework as some modern mathematical physics? 

My question is simply, is this an active field in math or mathematical physics? I can indeed find recent papers on things ranging from  geometric formulations of Hamilton Jacobi theory to geometric formulations of regularized celestial mechanics. The authors seem to primarily be mathematicians or physicists. I have become quite obsessed and have invested a lot of time teaching myself differential geometry for the purpose of understanding this. But I know absolutely nobody working in the area and have no idea if it something worthwhile in terms of future research or just a niche area with some eccentric people who like classical mechanics and geometry. 

Anybody have thoughts on this?

I was wondering if anyone here is aware of history books that talk about other civilizations using math theorems before they formalize by Europeans. For example, we reference the equation a^2+b^2=c^2 as the Pythagorean theorem because Pythagoras proved it. However there is evidence Egyptians and Babylonians using this theorem before Pythagoras proved it.

Another example is the case of the quadratic formula. Mathematician Al-Khwarizmi is generally agreed upon to have develop this formula yet we do not call it “Al-Khwarizmi theorem” and I haven’t heard of them until I did a google search. I’d like to learn more about the mathematician we don’t regularly credit despite their massive contribution to the field.

math,I cannot find a way to prove that a/an ODE/PDE is not separable. Is there a proof in Analysis regarding it? ,"What I want can be well told with this example: 

u_(xx) + u_(xy) + u_(yy)=0

If in this equation we let u = A(x) B(y) and substitute back into the equation:
A'' B + A'B'+ AB'' =0

In which A and B are not separable.

However, if we let u = e^(rx +sy) and solve, we would get the solution to be 
u= e^(-sx) cos (root 3 x) e^(sy)
v = e^(-sx) sin (root 3 x) e^(sy)

and these solutions are indeed in the form A(x) B(y).

Therefore, we couldn't separate them yet the solution comes out to be in that form. Does it mean ""if we cannot separate them"" doesn't imply ""they are not separable""?

For example, a matrix is invertible based on its determinant (or reduced form doesn't have row of zeroes, or any other method), we don't actually invert it yet we can say about its invertibility. 

Same is the case with integrability. 

However, I have not found any analytic proof of separatibility. Can someone please guide me to a proper resource for enquiring into this matter or if you can answer yourself I shall be grateful?

math,Hurst exponent and mean reversion: assumptions,"When trying to find algorithms for determining if a time series is mean reverting, I came across one that uses the so-called Hurst exponent. The idea is that a time series is mean reverting if this exponent is less than 0.5. Now, a simple algorithm for computing it uses linear regression, the coefficient being the slope of a certain best fit line (https://robotwealth.com/demystifying-the-hurst-exponent-part-1/). 

However, it is not clear to me under what conditions the algorithm is working. Apparently, it is based on an asymptotic formula for the variation of the difference of a time series and its k-th lag, namely that this is asymptotically a power of k. 

My question is under what assumptions on the time series this holds. I suppose that the above algorithm always gives something - but what if the best fit line is a terrible approximation? Could it be that the slope is still less than 0.5, leading to the false conclusion that the time series is mean reverting?

math,Is it harmful for long term progress to try to read about things that are currently too advanced for you?,"I have specific things that I'm interested in and that's why I want learn math. I'm revising a lot of the basics that I once studied back in college but forgot and I'm also working through 'How to prove it'. 


On top of this I often like to read (say Wikipedia articles or online textbooks, reddit comments, etc.) about things that are currently beyond my skill level to truly understand but are ultimately what I'm working towards.

&amp;nbsp;

However, I've been told by a math major that doing this is not merely useless but actively harmful, because it's going to lead to me internalizing concepts in the wrong way or having preconceptions about certain concepts that are going to be very difficult to unlearn once I get to a point where I can rigorously approach these subjects. 


My long term goal is to be able to study and truly understand the material in Lee's ITM (or some other equivalent) but what I'm currently doing (that may be a problem) is that when I see a technical definition I examine each word in the definition and go down the Wikipedia rabbit hole where each term leads me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I certainly don't think this is useful in terms of actually understanding, but it's fun to see how far I can go and I enjoy getting some level of exposure to concepts of theorems that hopefully I'll get to actually study one day.  Is this approach wrong?

math,Definition of Associative Algebra,"Hi, i am self learning some parts of math as a hobby and i came across the Wikipedia page of associative algebra which states the following:

*« In mathematics, an associative algebra A over a commutative ring (often a field) K is a ring A together with a ring homomorphism from K into the center of A. »*

I already know the definition of an algebra using  vector space with an other binary operation acting as multiplication but i have no idea how the definition from Wikipedia is related to this. Could some of you point to me how to understand it ?

Thanks for your time 

Edit: i am familiar with every words of the definition, i only have trouble with the underlying idea ",soupe-mis0,1fk3i0r,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fk3i0r/definition_of_associative_algebra/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1fk3i0r/definition_of_associative_algebra/,2024-09-18 20:59:21,32,0.92,32,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1fk3i0r
