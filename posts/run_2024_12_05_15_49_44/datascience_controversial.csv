datascience,Sales Engineering vs Data Science vs Product Management,"Hi, I’m at the beginning of my career. Currently, my main focus has been to get into data science (product side), then maybe in the future decide to become a PM or stay in DS, depending on the role and company I get. Recently, I came across a company hiring for a Sales Engineer position. The company is a SaaS for data science, so I researched the role and felt I would like it. I do enjoy working with people, presenting things, and public speaking if required. I’ve heard the pay is pretty good in sales engineering too.
However, I was wondering if I didn’t like it after a few months or years, would it be possible to come back to product or data science? I do like the data science field as I’m curious about finding insights, solving problems, and on the product side, improving user experiences and creating new features. I’ve been looking for an opportunity since last year and haven’t been able to land a job, not even as an analyst. So my fear is if I get into sales engineering (I’m only interested in this particular firm for this role), would it be hard to get back into the industry? I’m currently working as a volunteer data science to maintain visa, so not like I will be leaving actual DS job. Also, I don’t know if I will get the role for SE as well, but wanted to decide as I have someone who will refer me and i feared that it would look bad when I ask them for referral for data science role (in future as they don’t have any open role now for DS). 
Also, in the long term, I was thinking if money is the biggest driver for me, which would be better? Additionally, I’m an international on a STEM visa in the US. So, how hard is it for other firms to sponsor a sales engineering role?
Thanks!

so If anyone here works as a DA or BI , can you please direct me to projects online that you find close to what you work with ?

datascience,Should I leave out job experience?,I worked as a civil engineer for 5 years before getting a Hydroinformatics position (primarily data analysis with some elements of machine learning applied to wastewater) and and am looking to move into an official data science position. I haven’t gotten any hits while applying to various roles but I’ve been leaving out my engineering experience since I don’t want to work in anything related to engineering. Wondering if this is a bad idea and if I should just put the experience back on my resume? ,GoldenPandaCircus,1h70jyq,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h70jyq/should_i_leave_out_job_experience/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h70jyq/should_i_leave_out_job_experience/,2024-12-05 04:13:31,9,0.76,9,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Career | US,self,t3_1h70jyq

datascience,Data drift detection methods aside from changes in model performance metrics,"Hi all,

As the title implies, I've been relying on (somewhat near) real-time monitoring of model performance metrics to see if data drift has happened in my use-case. 

I'm wondering if you know other more sophisticated/advanced methods to detect data drift. Would love to hear any kind of methods, whether they target detection of covariate/feature drift, target/label drift or concept drift. 

Even better if you can share any Python or R implementations to carry out the above data drift checks.

Thanks in advance!",YsrYsl,1h6wmn2,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h6wmn2/data_drift_detection_methods_aside_from_changes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h6wmn2/data_drift_detection_methods_aside_from_changes/,2024-12-05 01:00:25,34,1.0,34,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h6wmn2
