I started with JavaScript and spent about 6 months learning it and building projects. Recently, I started learning C to understand low-level concepts like memory management and pointers. My goal is to reach an intermediate level, build some projects, and then eventually move on to learning Rust (though I’m still figuring out exactly why I want to learn it).

At the same time, I plan to keep improving my JavaScript/TypeScript skills and continue building web projects.

Does this sound like a solid learning path, or am I just jumping around too much?

Then the music just stops. The window also is labeled ""MainForm"" for some reason. I even tried running it on a Windows XP virtual machine (I used VirtualBox) and it did the same thing, except the music was much slower and very corrupt. The issue is exactly the same no matter where I download it from. This game came out in 2001 and 3D pinball space cadet, which came out in 1995, works just fine.
