movies,"What particularly violent scene from an already violent movie really messed you up, or stuck with you over the years?","Every now and then people talk about gnarly scenes that kind of come out of nowhere (like that one near the end of Bone Tomahawk) but what about scenes from movies that are already violent, but stand out anyway? For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.

movies,Gangs of New York revisted,"I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn’t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn’t remember anything about it.

Holy hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.

Leonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.

Daniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.

We’ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.

One of his killings (and you’ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I’ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).

The production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.

movies,Can someone please give the vocabulary to express something that I've been observing in movies?,"Hello! I'm gonna try to make this quick and express myself as clearly as possible. How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?

For example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley. It's like they're rendered too colorful and too dull at the same time, making them lack life or something.

What is that? Does anyone else get that feel? What are the words to describe this distinction? Because every time I talk about it I don't get the sense that people actually see what I mean, since I'm not solely talking about the cinematography, I don't think, it's more of a *feeling* of emptiness and fakeness.

Just a random daydream earlier about how amazing 1993 was with both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List being directly by the same guy. Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovakia,"Hello there!

A bit more than 24 hours ago, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Serbia, and to be honest, as an outsider, I'm absolutely surprised. Not so much about the fact, that *A Serbian Film* didn't win (okay, a little bit about that too), but more about how much hate it got especially by - as it seems to me - the Serbs themselves. As a result, instead of this very unappetizing film, ***Balkanski špijun*** (engl.: *Balkan Spy*) has now won the contest.

But no sooner has a new movie earned its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) than we move on to the next country. Now it's all about **Slovakia** and as the 41 times before, there are only two rules to have in regard in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,I love the “Love is the Drug” scene from Sucker Punch where Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino sing the song in an elaborate musical.,"I unironically think it’s one of the best scenes Snyder has directed, and I legitimately think he should direct a flamboyant musical. It’s crazy this was cut out of the theatrical version

It’s just got so much style in that 4 minute sequence. Great choreography, costumes, and most of all, showmanship. The whole movie is pretty much Oscar Isaac auditioning for his later role in Ex Machina. He’s a hell of a dancer, and has a great voice during this scene.

I recently learned that there was a lot of footage cut from this film that’s not even in the extended cut.

So my question is this, why isn’t this film popular? At first glance, it appears it should have been a hit. I’m not saying you should necessarily compare it to the greatest dramas of all time, but it definitely deserves more recognition than it received.

movies,The 12 Die Hards of Christmas,"Inspired by a comment in a different thread I have concocted this list of movie plot descriptions. Each entry is a different Christmas movie and *probably* isn't Die Hard. Despite how they may sound. This is all just for fun and my own amusement. Hope you all enjoy.

1. Working class hero is terrorized by upper class villain who steals money during Christmas

2. Lone individual hiding nearby attempts to ruin a group's Christmas time plan.

3. Estranged father from New York has trouble reconnecting with his son due to shenanigans involving a high rise.

4. Father has Christmas plans for his family but they go awry following an argument with his wife culminating in a violent police raid of the building he's in.

5. Thieves rob a vault at Christmas time but their getaway plan is derailed by unexpected interference.

6. Thieves attempt to rob a building and are repeatedly thwarted by a particular unexpected occupant.

7. After facing down an intruder on the roof a father must reluctantly rise to the challenge to be able to reconnect with his family.

8. An unexpected man's identity is unclear but he may just be the hero everyone needs.

9. Father who wants to make Christmas nice has to deal with an unexpected foe culminating in a fight on top of a building.

10. A father wishing to reconnect with his family must deal with unexpected troublemakers at Christmas.

11. A sizable group of trouble makers enact their plan at Christmas time. The police are helpless to stop them and an interloper has to step up.

12. A team of Thieves plan a Christmas time heist but things go bad when the police arrive sooner than expected.

If you want a hint here is a list of the answers in alphabetical order:

movies,Film Schools education,"Hello, everyone. I’m curious to know if film schools worldwide generally lack in providing quality film education, or if it’s just the one I’m attending in Turkey that is subpar. My experience has been rather disappointing, as many professors here seem to lack even a basic understanding of fundamental concepts like the three-act structure, blocking/staging, or shot sizes.

For example, I recently had marks deducted because my professor claimed that a close-up shot I used was actually an extreme close-up. To clarify, the shot was indeed a close-up, quite similar to the iconic ""Here’s Johnny"" shot from The Shining. When I challenged this, asking him what he would consider a shot focusing on just the eyes, mouth, hand, or nose, he said it was a ""cut-in"" shot. Frankly, I’ve never encountered ""cut-in"" as a term for a shot size in any academic or professional context—it refers to a type of edit, not a shot size.

Additionally, the instructors often make us analyze critically panned films, urging us to focus on basic themes and cookie cutter lessons rather than on the craftsmanship of the art—be it the editing, the screenplay, or the visual aesthetics.

Is this the standard for film education globally, or is the Turkish system uniquely flawed? I'd love to hear your insights.

movies,Italian cinema: a brief summary from my POV,"# This is a summary of my thoughts on Italian cinema and its evolution, with a FOCUS ON ITS DECLINE AND RETURN. I’d love to hear other perspectives and expand the discussion. What do you think?

* **Golden Age:** The triumphs of Italian cinema.
* **Decline:** The exploitation of cinema and loss of relevance in the 1980s.
* **Mediaset Monopoly:** How Mediaset and generalist TV took over.
* **Internet &amp; Streamers:** The rebirth driven by the internet and streaming platforms.

# Golden Age

Italian cinema has always been a global powerhouse. During the silent film era, Italy produced massive historical epics, featuring hundreds of extras and drawing from its rich history (from the Roman Empire to *The Divine Comedy* and beyond).

During World War II, Italian cinema shifted toward propaganda, moving away from artistic creativity to serve political power.

After the war, *neorealism* was born. While Hollywood was stuck under restrictive production codes, Italian filmmakers were telling raw, universal stories about post-war struggles—groundbreaking narratives that resonated far beyond Italy’s borders.

# Decline: The Exploitation of Cinema

In the '60s and '70s, Hollywood abandoned its production codes, and by the '80s, the advent of visual effects caused a major shift. The U.S. soared to new global heights in filmmaking, far surpassing Italian cinema.

Italy, meanwhile, struggled to modernize. The loss of the neorealist pioneers left a vacuum, and new filmmakers turned to short-sighted strategies. They leaned into low-budget projects that mimicked blockbuster aesthetics, piggybacking on Hollywood trends to squeeze out quick profits. This led to a drop in quality and, more importantly, respect from audiences. Italian cinema became synonymous with mediocrity.

# Mediaset Monopoly

Around the same time, television was rising as a dominant force in entertainment, pulling audiences away from theaters. By the late '80s, Mediaset was founded.

Through the '90s and 2000s, Mediaset capitalized on this shift, creating a cultural monopoly. Anything produced or aired by Mediaset was consumed by the vast majority of Italians, if not the entire audience.

Mediaset cultivated its own *star system*, building celebrities rather than artists. The cultural output during this era? Talk shows, game shows, reality TV, and low-quality films and series—cheaply produced and aimed purely at generating profit and mindless entertainment.

# Internet &amp; Streamers: A Rebirth

With the rise of the internet, younger generations shifted their attention online, leaving behind the Mediaset-dominated culture that had shaped Italy for decades.

By the 2010s, platforms like YouTube had become major hubs for youth entertainment. Around 2018, streaming services started cutting into Mediaset’s once-dominant share. Netflix led the charge, followed by Prime Video and Sky. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram later became central sources of creative content.

Today, Mediaset’s cultural monopoly is largely a thing of the past, especially among younger Italians. While older generations (those from the '70s and '80s) still keep their TVs tuned to Rai or Mediaset for programs like *Wheel of Fortune* with Gerry Scotti, younger people see traditional TV as outdated. It’s not personalized, it feels repetitive, and it’s not delivering high-quality content.

After 40 years of cultural decline—from the exploitation of cinema to Mediaset’s reign—streamers have brought international standards to their Italian productions. They effortlessly outcompete the trashy, generalist programming of traditional TV. Meanwhile, social media is fostering a new wave of original, satisfying, and artistic content.

A fresh *star system* is emerging, centered on genuine artistic quality rather than the superficial generalism that defined past generations.

movies,About Smile 2,"
SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN THIS MOVIE 





I took an edible and watched “Smile 2” (yeah i know that was stupid) and I’m really just whelmed about. Not over, not under, but just kinda “meh”. The performances were great. Naomi Scott absolutely killed it. I think the thing that’s making me think about it and making me wonder if it would have worked was if in the marketing and advertising for the movie, the audience didn’t know that she was a pop star. I mean the joke as soon as the movie was announced was that it’d be someone at a concert in front of a bunch of people, but I just keep thinking what if the marketing led us in a completely different direction making the audience think that she was maybe just a daughter to someone with money and the final “twist” of the movie was us finding out that she was some famous pop star that offs herself in front of thousands. I just feel like that ending would have been a lot more of a shocker added on. I obviously don’t know how that would work but who knows.

movies,A small defense of Live Action Remakes,"So everytime a trailer or poster for a new live action film drops, there are three types of generic negative comments rehashed again and again. They're kinda irritating so I'm just gonna get them out of the way first before I make my actual case for Live Action Remakes


**""wow another cashgrab""**

Yes movies are made to make money, obviously there are passion projects but making money is the goal even for a lot of passion projects. Literally 99% of movies are cashgrabs

**""Who asked for this""**

This one is the most annoying. Nobody asked for The 1982 remake of The Thing either and it became a classic, and before you bring out the pitchforks, I'm not comparing The Thing to the shitty Lion King remake or whatever. It's just to show that something being made with zero demand isn't a fucking critique. These remakes also make a boatload of cash, so it isn't even all that accurate. Anyway this is the dumbest bottom of the barrel comment imaginable. 

**""stop ruining my childhood""**

Your childhood is still there, you can still watch them at anytime. A live action adaptation doesn't delete the existence of those films or ruin the continuity. Heck a certain amount of those classic Disney film even have shitty DVD sequels or TV shows we'd rather forget about 


OK we're done, now for my actual argument. This isn't a defense of the quality of live action remakes, they still have way more misses than hits. I personally only digged one of them which is the Jungle Book. However, this negative attitude where people believe **it shouldn't be made** is what I'm vehemently against. Movies SHOULD be made, even bad ones. Stories have a right to be showcased in whatever medium imaginable 

Like take Aladin for example, it's generally believed to have originated in Arabia, through folk tales, then it became a book, then an animated movie, then a Broadway show, probably missing a few sequential steps but you get the gist of it. A live action movie is simply the next step, a new medium. Saying it shouldn't have been made is like saying it shouldn't have moved to Broadway, or even be made into an animated film.

Live action remakes are just another form of recreational storytelling, sure a lot of it has to do with making more money but it's still part of the human desire to experiment with new avenues and tools. Saying it shouldn't exist because you don't like it doesn't make sense. Do you think fan films shouldn't exist cause most of them are shit? If your answer is no then imagine Disney remakes as an expensive fan film of a fan film of a book or tale.
