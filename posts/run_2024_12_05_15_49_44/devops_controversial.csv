devops,New to automation,"Hi maybe someone can help me here.

So in short, where I work we have to set up all these Cisco devices, and weâ€™re using gitlab to build the scripts (according to how the device is supposed to connect to others). Itâ€™s all in python and Iâ€™m wondering if maybe gitlab is being used maybe not to its full potential? I feel we should be using maybe ansible, but there is some logic being done of reaching out to a web server to get IP info then plug all that stuff in. Iâ€™m finishing my degree in software engineering and Iâ€™m wondering if thereâ€™s a better way to maybe use my knowledge or make the process more straight forward?

devops,Im i in a bad position?,"How employable doest this sound?

Hello all, as of the beginning of this year I have worked as a Junior Software Dev with Java in the financial sector.

But in the company the management is creating a toxic environment - working long hours is encouraged, stress is through the roof sometimes.

I was told the other day that i need time be faster, because i work on the most important thing (I donâ€™t know why they gave it to me) for the sprint/release and they expect me to not make mistakes when things are so important.

The company is under 100 employees and the team consists of 3 seniors a mid dev and me. 

If you read me previous post you can see another struggle i had on the workplace. This drives me crazy because i really love the craft of programming and was very exited in the beginning, but as time passed this jobs seems to drain all the motivation and passion. And i REALLY HOPE not every job is like that. 

Also for almost a year as a Junior i had 0 pair programming and almost none mentoring by seniors. Only code reviews with passive aggressive chats with my manager. Other team members seem to not care a lot about my state, like they see Iâ€™m struggling but it feels like they are okay with me struggling 
ðŸ˜€

My question here for the people that have been in a similar place - is every place like this?
And also Iâ€™m i employable having the following knowledge.

Java professional exp: 1year.(backend)

Python self learning: 3-4 months doing projects/scripts.

JS: can manipulate the DOM, write basic FE(no framework).

Also i know how to work on terminal and love working on Linux kernel.",JustIDontKnowAnymore,1h6k15p,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6k15p/im_i_in_a_bad_position/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6k15p/im_i_in_a_bad_position/,2024-12-04 16:21:11,0,0.5,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6k15p

SCA tools would be anything that identifies software components and vulnerabilities in them, ex: grype, sonatype, black duck, snyk, etc.

We are security researchers interested in how you use SCA tools. If you are willing to share your experiences with us, we'd be happy to talk to you. We're conducting interviews (\~45min) to understand your experiences.

Ultimately, we really want to understand:

* How you integrate SCA into software pipelines and any challenges that come with that.
* How you interpret the SCA reports and what actions are taken after.
* Challenges you run into with SCA, your opinions, and how you would like to see them be improved

devops,Jenkins Workflow Question,"Hi, I am a solo software engineer for a microscopy company. I own a pretty significant number of services and applications, and so far have just been relying on Github Actions to run my unit tests, integration tests, and releases.

I am identifying the need to finally have some kind of CI/CD pipeline. I am familiar with the concept after working at Amazon, but now I need to develop a pipeline myself.

My question is about what kind of workflows are possible in Jenkins. For some context, I have the following:

- A Django API
- An auto-generated Python client  for the API
- A package of Domain Models which are sent to/from the Django API
- A repository package that abstracts the REST API client and makes it simpler to use

These constitute a set of ""core"" services and packages, which all rely on each other to work. It is possible to change one of these packages/services without needing to modify the others, however, sometimes a feature change in one project will require all of the other projects to change.

For example, if I add a ""Food"" table to the Django API, I also need to add a Food class to the domain models, and a FoodRepository, and there will need to be new tests added as well.

Is there a way to design my workflows as a directed acyclic graph where each of my services/packages has a list of repositories that are downstream of it, and so all of those services are tested when a change is made? Many of these programs feed into each other as well, so there is a need for the output of one test to be used as the fixtures of the next test in some cases. For example, if the ""core"" services pass their tests, a script would populate a local database for use with all of the desktop applications that rely on the ""core"" services. Then if I see one of the desktop applications breaks, I know that this feature change requires the desktop app to be updated as well. Let me know if what I am asking for even makes sense.",ShagohodEnjoyer,1h6wpgg,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6wpgg/jenkins_workflow_question/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6wpgg/jenkins_workflow_question/,2024-12-05 01:03:57,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6wpgg

devops,Curious About DevOps and SRE as a Backend Developer â€“ Where Do I Start?,"Hey Reddit!

I transitioned from mobile development to backend development this year, where I shipped some relatively simple applications. Along the way, I discovered that what excites me most, aside from building the backend itself, is maintaining the infrastructure: spinning up VMs (with containerized apps) with Load Balancers using Terraform , monitoring the application to identify bottlenecks, ensuring infrastructure security, and so on. This is the project that I actually worked on recently: [https://github.com/diasmashikov/go-compressor](https://github.com/diasmashikov/go-compressor) You can even access it from the web (https://www.gofilecompress.com)

Currently, I am using GCP and Terraform for infrastructure tasks, and Iâ€™ve been learning as I go. However, I feel like I lack a solid foundation in DevOps and GCP concepts. So, hereâ€™s my question:

* Where can I learn the basics? Is there a single book that covers fundamental, applicable principles of DevOps or SRE? Or is learning tied to a particular cloud provider? Should I focus on certifications for a specific cloud provider like GCP or AWS, and would that help me learn more effectively? (Of course, I would supplement this with hands-on projects.)
* Regarding platforms, Iâ€™m currently using GCP, but Iâ€™ve noticed that AWS seems to be more widely adopted globally. Would it make more sense to invest time in learning AWS instead?

And overall, what resources or strategies would you recommend to help me become proficient in DevOps or SRE?",Investorator3000,1h6kow1,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6kow1/curious_about_devops_and_sre_as_a_backend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h6kow1/curious_about_devops_and_sre_as_a_backend/,2024-12-04 16:47:29,1,0.67,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6kow1
