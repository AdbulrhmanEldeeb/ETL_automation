programming,Am I Stuck in Shiny Object Syndrome?,"I’ve been learning programming for a while and wanted some advice.

I started with JavaScript and spent about 6 months learning it and building projects. Recently, I started learning C to understand low-level concepts like memory management and pointers. My goal is to reach an intermediate level, build some projects, and then eventually move on to learning Rust (though I’m still figuring out exactly why I want to learn it).

At the same time, I plan to keep improving my JavaScript/TypeScript skills and continue building web projects.

Does this sound like a solid learning path, or am I just jumping around too much? How do you balance learning new languages while deepening your skills in the ones you already know?",fizzy-piss42,1h7ao53,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h7ao53/am_i_stuck_in_shiny_object_syndrome/,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_object_syndrome,2024-12-05 14:41:25,1,0.53,1,0,11,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h7ao53
programming,Google app-script help,"Hi, I want to take a piece of data from a google sheets cell and then post it to discord- this part I have working- its the moving down 1/2 rows each time the program is run(e.g when I click run it outputs data in cell a in row 1, program ends then click the run button again outputs cell a in row 2 etc etc - I tried coding a counter which didn’t work- I have no experience in JavaScript - got some experience in Python and Lua… please can someone help me with this probably simple task?


I have posted the code below obviously removed the discord webhook- there are indented lines - probably not showing as this is a copy and paste on a phone…
