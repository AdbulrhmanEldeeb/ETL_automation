learnprogramming,Is it too late for me? ,"I‚Äôm 25 years old male and English is not my native language 

I never really finished studying I drop out of school due to support my family financially early in my life. Ever since then I‚Äôve been working at the jobs that I don‚Äôt really like.. or earn enough to do it anyway for the sake of money. 
lately I don‚Äôt want to work anymore at all I‚Äôm tired mentally doing something that i don‚Äôt really like and even if I want to continue working just for the sake of money I certainly dont make enough either ‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve always have been passionate about programming/coding ever since I was teenager I never studied programming myself and nobody ever taught me anything about programming as well.. but every now and then I do some research on programming and deep down I know that I love it and I get excited whenever I learn something new about programming.

I have 3 questions that I would like to know about it please! 

1 Is it possible to learn programming by myself learning from internet?

2 And how long will it take to start understanding and being able to do something or create something in programming. for someone let‚Äôs say practices and studies about 2-3 hours daily by themselves? with (help of internet ofc)

3 and how much experience a person needs. to be able to get their first job as a programmer( not high paying degree salary ) just enough to make things go smoothly and also to motivate them to keep studying and learn programming further? And hopefully become full time programmer 

yes there gotta be regional differences about job opportunities and salary but let‚Äôs say (give it or take) kinda theory :)",vieps,1h74f6j,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h74f6j/is_it_too_late_for_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h74f6j/is_it_too_late_for_me/,2024-12-05 08:15:47,0,0.48,0,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h74f6j

learnprogramming,Deciding which language to learn,"Hi, sorry for the generic question that's probably asked a lot. I'm wondering about any advice that relates to my situation.

I'm in the midst of trying a carrer change. I've always wanted to work in IT, and now have the time and savings to make the push. 

I have a good grasp of the logic behind programming, but I don't know how to program. I'm proficient in Excel (not VBA though) and have dipped my toe into Python, JS, CSS and HTML before, but my knowledge is mostly very basic and not usable in these languages. 

I'm trying to decide what to learn that is a good mix of the following:

- creative and versatile
- time-efficient to learn and land a junior job after several months of high intensity learning (4-6h per day)
- pays well down the line as you get better

I started Jonas'course in JS yesterday but am now having second thoughts on whether I should do JS or the other two. JS certainly seems the most ""fun"" to me, while Python comes off as the most versatile and useful, while SQL seems the easiest to start work in asap and is related to my excel job from before (which included a caveman version of data reports and interpretation).

So currently I'm considering JS, Python and SQL, so I would highly value and appreciate any opinions on the pros and cons of these three relating to the above points, or any personal experiences with learning them - how long it took, how long until you got a job using them etc. Or any other recommendations for other languages are also welcome.

Please share your experiences and help me out a bit :')

learnprogramming,Insights from a career switcher who's helped 100s of people transition into engineering,"I interviewed Brian Jenney, a software engineer who learned to code at age 30 after leaving behind a difficult past of addiction. Since making the career change, he's been a Senior Engineer and manager at several companies large and small (e.g. Clorox).

Over the past 3 years, Brian interviewed 500+ developers, so he has deep insights into the challenges that job seekers face. Here are his top takeaways and suggestions:

# You need a stronger technical foundation

Too many aspiring engineers become *framework developers* instead of *software developers*. They fail to understand core programming concepts beyond their preferred framework (e.g. React or Angular). Without a solid technical foundation, you cannot achieve career stability.

You should be able to make educated guesses about **how** various frameworks or abstractions work. What's happening behind the scenes when you deploy an application on Vercel? What problem is your framework trying to solve, and what are some of the tradeoffs?

Spend the time to go beyond tutorials and deliberately break systems to truly master a programming language, framework, or application.

# Find time, even when you have none

The most common failure reason is that we lack time to dedicate to coding and job-searching. Here's what you should do:

* **Plan out your main task the night before**, so you have less decision fatigue when you start working.
* **Identify your most productive time of day** and protect it (hint: it‚Äôs usually the morning).
* **Work in sprints**. Humans have short supplies of motivation, so we need to work in ""seasons"" or sprints. Decompose your problem into something manageable and set a deadline.

# Build in public (the right way)

If you don't have a 4-year CS degree, you need to spend extra time and energy to de-risk yourself as a candidate. The best way to do this is to **build in public** by sharing your progress and (more importantly) learnings over time. This has 3 benefits:

1. A track record of contributions will improve your prospects by showing your persistence.
2. Building in public holds you accountable to your goals and helps you communicate more effectively, a key skill for software development.
3. Public sharing lets you connect with like-minded people and build a supportive community.

If you're in doubt about which platform to pick, choose LinkedIn (it's the dominant professional network, and it's where recruiters spend most of their time.)

# The chicken and egg problem of gaining experience

Career switchers are very likely to face the classic conundrum: ""*In order to land a job, you need experience. But to get experience, you need a job.*"" Here's how to get past this impasse:

* Seek out freelancing opportunities, which are relatively easier to start and can lead to valuable connections. Open source is overrated and has a much higher barrier to entry.
* Turn a side project into a legit business. You will be surprised how easily you can actually sell software on the internet and own your destiny.
* Finally, be willing to work for ""free"" as long as you're getting compensated in other ways, e.g. credibility, referrals, or experience. Set clear deliverables so you're not exploited.

Finally, remember that career switchers also have unique advantages in the job market. Your past experience will undoubtedly make you a better fit for certain employers. Lean into that.",rahulkpandey,1h6ltcn,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6ltcn/insights_from_a_career_switcher_whos_helped_100s/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h6ltcn/insights_from_a_career_switcher_whos_helped_100s/,2024-12-04 17:31:44,128,0.89,128,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1h6ltcn

I'm finding that when it console logs exampleArr, it still shows it as ""\[-1, -1\]"".

But why? I thought arrays can be  passed into functions and then updated within them?

Does it have something to do with the fact that exampleArr is defined within a function (rather than being defined globally in an entire script file)?

learnprogramming,"Learn programming by contributing to active open-source project, any skill will work","I maintain some popular OSS projects, and overal ove a lot to open-source community (proof https://github.com/buger)

Plus for me OSS was one of the key pillars of my career, on Github from day one and etc.

A lot of people ask me regularly how to actually get into commercial programming, to find some projects, build portfolio and etc. What I usually answer is that getting into Open Source is the great deal - you can test your skills on some real projects, and in parallel build portfolio.

However it is very tricky to find the project to contribute. Large projects like Node, Shadcn, and Rust are already overwhelmed with contributions and can't handle their pull request queues. Also there is another insight that hit me hard.

Contributing to these large projects is incredibly time-consuming. Sometimes it takes hours just to figure out how to build the project, and I'm engineer with 20 years of experience. And let's be honest - most of us just have a few hours we want to spend on something meaningful.

For me it is about a joy to pair with someone who is in need and can actually benefit from your help. To have some fast feedback look, and actually ship. The are so many smaller projects out of there that provide something meaningful to the world, or just fun.

I have built¬†[https://helpwanted.dev](https://helpwanted.dev/)¬†\- a place where people looking for some fun, or test their skills can find projects with active maintainers, actually looking for help. And in my view it is a perfect place to start your career.

While building this, I found some cool projects I never knew existed, and I would ever find the other way:

‚Ä¢ Animal Shelter Manager

‚Ä¢ Salam Language: First coding language for Persian/Arabic speakers

‚Ä¢ Korean Train Set for OpenTTD  
  
My latest experience - I have submitted 3 PRs, and got the response on each within a few hours. How cool is that?

The site has some AI magic to give you quick summaries about projects, issues details, and complexity scores. Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

In the spirit of Christmas, wanted to share my love for the OSS community. No 1000 PRs in queue**, just pure joy of contributing**, and helping someone who actually needs help.

As another example, you could create a list forest by making a list of trees.... in this case, you effectively have a list of the data type tree, if I am understanding correctly.

learnprogramming,Redirecting websites with HSTS preloading to localhost,"Hi all! I'm trying to make a focus app for Windows. I want to give a url like [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) and redirect it to localhost, where I have a webpage telling me to focus.

I tried to do this using the hosts file in Windows, and it works for non https websites. However, for https websites it gives me a connection refused. There are many (see at the bottom) links about the hosts file not working properly. 

  
I checked with chatgpt, and it says that what I'm trying to do is impossible for websites with HSTS preloading such as [google.com](http://google.com) in chrome browser.

  
Is there any way to do this? Maybe with browser extensions, even though I want a solution that works for all browsers?

learnprogramming,Looking for insight around best practices to consider before diving into a SPA from scratch.,"I'm new to software dev and want to try my hand at my first SPA from scratch, but I wanted to ask some more senior folks what are the current industry standard best practices, a checklist of them, to run through to make sure I'm doing it the right way?

Things like efficiency, security, etc.. what do the pros do before starting a build and what do they make sure is included in their code before anything goes live?

I guess some more examples would be things like rate limiting, making sure youre in a venv etc..

again, I'm very new and have learned a lot in the past few months but just wanted to see if anyone more experienced wouldn't mind sharing their input here before I dive in.

learnprogramming,Small business using VB - Switch or let it die?,"Let me jump right in. For nearly 10 years now I've been working with my father designing/supporting niche business web apps written in VB. My father recently passed away, and now that the business is mine, I'm wondering if it's even worth continuing. I'm a little familiar with C# but I'm not looking forward to making the switch, nor do I have the funds to hire help (it's a very small business).  To be honest, I.T. is not my passion - I mainly took this job because, let's face it, the perks of working in a family business are unparalleled.

On the other hand, if I shut the business down, I feel like my qualifications for a new job in this industry are zilch at this point.  I call myself a ""kindergarten programmer"" because I'm sure they will be teaching what I do in kindergarten someday  - it's just VB, HTML and CSS. I'd have to either go back to school or change careers entirely. I'm 48.

What would you do if you were me? I know there are VB to C# converters but how much of a pain is it to do, really? Would anyone buy a business that is so small and uses such ancient technology?  Am I correct in thinking that my work experience is worth diddlysquat on the job market today?

learnprogramming,Doubted of my abilities,"Hello everyone!

Currently, I am a 9th grade student and a person of the beautiful country of Vietnam :)

I want to share a story with everyone, as well as hope to receive some advice or encouragement (am I asking too much lol)

My wish is to get into a top school in the city I live in, and of course with my passion for programming (IT), my wish is to pass this subject.

But recently, I feel like I am not doing well:

\- There are many problems that I cannot solve (thinking for a long time and have no solution). Even some of them when I know the answer are surprisingly simple!

\- I can do some problems, but the problem is that I cannot handle all the test cases, only a few of them. Some of the questions I know why I made mistakes and made mistakes, some I don't even know where I made mistakes (I even thought the test was wrong lol). This is also the most difficult thing for me because of course when taking the test I can only submit my questions once but most of the questions I don't get a full test.

\- That's the most frustrating thing for me, I feel like I'm not making any progress and just standing still, this makes me especially worried and almost lose confidence in myself.

Have any of you here gone through or are going through this stage? Have you ever felt a loss of confidence, doubted your abilities? Have you ever felt discouraged and wanted to give up?

That's probably how I feel right now, so I need some advice and sharing from you.
