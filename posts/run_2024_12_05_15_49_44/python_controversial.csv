Python,Python binary which runs everwhere,"I wanted to share some insights about an interesting project called [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) that I've been exploring.

# What is python-build-standalone?

The **python-build-standalone** project produces fully usable Python installations that include most extension modules from the standard library. The key feature here is that it minimizes runtime dependencies.

# Why Use It?

1. **Portability**: The distributions are designed to work on any system for the targeted architecture, making it easier to deploy Python applications in diverse environments.
2. **Customizability**: Users can include build artifacts and rich metadata, which allows for downstream repackaging. This means you can create a custom Python distribution tailored to specific needs—great for embedding Python in larger binaries.
3. **Sister Project - PyOxy**: For those interested in enhancing their Python interpreter with Rust code, there's a related project called PyOxy that builds on these standalone distributions to create single-file executables.

# Getting Started

If you’re interested in trying out python-build-standalone, you can find the documentation [here](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/). The documentation provides detailed instructions on how to build your own standalone Python distributions and includes examples of how to customize your builds.

# Use Cases

This tool is particularly beneficial for:

* Developers who need to distribute applications without requiring users to install Python or additional libraries.
* Projects that aim for a minimal footprint on user systems.
* Scenarios where embedding Python within other applications is necessary.

Happy coding!

Python,What are dataclasses so famous?,"As the title says, I've read the whole documentation more than once and have used them plenty of times. But in practice for me it's just a way to avoid writing an __init__ method. This is a good QL improvement, I guess, but now means that my code uses another dependency and extra complexity for what?
I won't argue the merits of options like hash and frozen, but i don't find myself needing that functionality that often. So I return to my genuine question, why has the community so quickly adopted and recommended the use of dataclasses? I'm referring to articles and YouTube videos about them.

Python,Agent-Based Modeling library Mesa releases version 3.1,"Hi everyone! After our huge [Mesa 3.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gn5q8z/mesa_30_a_major_update_to_pythons_agentbased/) release, we're proud to announce Mesa 3.1 less than a month later. It contains some major spatial improvements and groundwork for new control and data collection features.

- https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.1.0

### What's Agent-Based Modeling?

Ever wondered how bird flocks organize themselves? Or how traffic jams form? Agent-based modeling (ABM) lets you simulate these complex systems by defining simple rules for individual ""agents"" (birds, cars, people, etc.) and then watching how they interact. Instead of writing equations to describe the whole system, you model each agent's behavior and let patterns emerge naturally through their interactions. It's particularly powerful for studying systems where individual decisions and interactions drive collective behavior.

### What's Mesa?

Mesa is Python's leading framework for agent-based modeling, providing a comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models. It combines Python's scientific stack (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib) with specialized tools for handling spatial relationships, agent scheduling, and data collection. Whether you're studying epidemic spread, market dynamics, or ecological systems, Mesa provides the building blocks to create sophisticated simulations while keeping your code clean and maintainable.

### What's new in Mesa 3.1?

This release adds experimental support for Observables and Computed, enabling a more reactive and responsive programming model for agent-based simulations. The new `Observable` and `Computable` classes allow developers to declaratively define attributes that automatically emit signals when their values change, and compute derived values that update dynamically. This lays the groundwork for more advanced event handling and data visualization features in future releases (#2291).

The experimental cell space module has been updated with full support for n-dimensional property layers. These allow agents to easily interact with and modify spatial properties of the environment, such as terrain, resources, or environmental conditions. The new implementation provides a more intuitive attribute-based API and ensures tight integration with the cell space architecture (#2512).

Mesa now includes built-in support for logging using the standard Python `logging` module. This provides developers with a flexible and powerful way to add structured diagnostic and debug output to their simulations, without the need for custom logging solutions. The logging system is integrated throughout the library, including the new SolaraViz visualization system (#2506).

Creating multiple agents with varying initialization parameters is now significantly easier with the new `Agent.create_agents` class method. This factory function supports both uniform and per-agent parameters, simplifying the code required to set up a simulation with a large number of heterogeneous agents (#2351).

In addition to the major new features, this release includes a number of smaller enhancements and bug fixes that improve the overall developer experience. These include removing deprecated functionality, cleaning up examples, and addressing various edge cases reported by the community. Mesa 3.1 requires Python 3.11 or higher.

Python,HandiRokuRemote (Open Source) - Control your Roku with only your hand gestures,"###What My Project Does
This is a Python application that lets you control your Roku device with nothing but hand gestures! Using Mediapipe's Hand Landmark Detector, it tracks your hand, identifies gestures, and sends commands to your Roku via its External Control Protocol.

Check out the [demo gif](https://imgur.com/zVbX1T6)

Features:

*Real-time hand tracking: Gestures like ""thumbs up"" control volume or navigation.

*Cross-device support: Works with any Roku device on the same network.

*Easy setup: Plug in a camera, and you’re ready to go.

###Target Audience
The target audience is anyone who's ever lost their TV remote, but probably more likely fellow tinkerers and anyone interested in computer-vision.

###Comparison
As far as I can tell, there is no comparison. I've looked around and haven't found anything that does what this does. I guess the only comparison is a regular remote (but you lost that earlier, remember?)
