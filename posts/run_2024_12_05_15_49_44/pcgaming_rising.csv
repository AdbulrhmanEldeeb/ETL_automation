pcgaming,"I'm working on a new game ""Roguebound Pirates"", inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates! If you've played Pirates!, I would love to hear what your favorite features were in it.","I was thinking about new game ideas and somehow I always kept going back to nostalgic memories of playing Sid Meier's Pirates! I feel like there hasn't been a similar game since, so why not make my own and try to scratch that same itch?

I'm trying to strike a good balance between making my game unique (for example my game will have a focus on deep ship customization by letting the player have full control over what kind of weapons &amp; equipment the ship has and where they are placed) and still scratching that nostalgic Pirates! itch. To help with this, I would love to hear what you enjoy the most in Pirates! Hopefully I can add those features/aspects to my game also.

If you are interested in the project, I just opened a Steam page for it:

**Now the full version of the game includes:**

* 3 characters
* 56 skills
* 23 evolutions
* 7 artifacts (after consumption, gives the character a mutation)
* 5 boosters

*I hope we managed to surprise some of you with a new combination of mechanics.*

**A bit of narrative that is implied:**

Imagine that you defeated a very dangerous enemy - elite techno-zombies, tore out his heart and absorbed it. As a result, you got a mutation. Which one? - You don't know in advance, but now it's part of your deckbuilding.

By the way, you can get several mutations in one run.

**Rules**: To enter, simply comment below with your favorite kind of soup (I'm cold and its lunch, don't judge) **And which ONE of the THREE games you would like**. One key per person (except for Remnant which includes DLC). NO DUPLICATE POSTS, I will be checking. I will distribute the keys via **Reddit messages** after 24 hours of this post being live. Please know how to access your messages in Reddit, as people love to say I haven't given them the key because they don't know the difference between Reddit messages and Reddit chat. 

Best of luck! This will be my last giveaway for 2024, but I have some additional keys ready for next year. 

Shameless plug: [My small Steam review curator group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Synik_GR), only join if you want to.
