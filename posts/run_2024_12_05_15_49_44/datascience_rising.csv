datascience,Data drift detection methods aside from changes in model performance metrics,"Hi all,

As the title implies, I've been relying on (somewhat near) real-time monitoring of model performance metrics to see if data drift has happened in my use-case. 

I'm wondering if you know other more sophisticated/advanced methods to detect data drift. Would love to hear any kind of methods, whether they target detection of covariate/feature drift, target/label drift or concept drift. 

Even better if you can share any Python or R implementations to carry out the above data drift checks.

Thanks in advance!",YsrYsl,1h6wmn2,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h6wmn2/data_drift_detection_methods_aside_from_changes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h6wmn2/data_drift_detection_methods_aside_from_changes/,2024-12-05 01:00:25,33,1.0,33,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h6wmn2
datascience,Should I leave out job experience?,I worked as a civil engineer for 5 years before getting a Hydroinformatics position (primarily data analysis with some elements of machine learning applied to wastewater) and and am looking to move into an official data science position. I haven’t gotten any hits while applying to various roles but I’ve been leaving out my engineering experience since I don’t want to work in anything related to engineering. Wondering if this is a bad idea and if I should just put the experience back on my resume? ,GoldenPandaCircus,1h70jyq,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h70jyq/should_i_leave_out_job_experience/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h70jyq/should_i_leave_out_job_experience/,2024-12-05 04:13:31,9,0.76,9,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Career | US,self,t3_1h70jyq

datascience,Jane Street Interview Experience,"I'm a senior Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer with 7 years of experience and a Kaggle Grandmaster. I just finished the first round of interviews at Jane Street. I think I did okay—I managed to come up with a somewhat decent solution, although I got stuck a few times.

I don’t really understand the rationale behind asking LeetCode-style questions for MLE positions. The interviewer was nice, but when I asked about the responsibilities of MLEs at Jane Street, he had no idea. I’m not sure how to feel about this process, but it doesn’t make much sense to me.",BurnerMcBurnersonne,1h69y9e,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h69y9e/jane_street_interview_experience/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h69y9e/jane_street_interview_experience/,2024-12-04 06:41:58,202,0.94,202,0,46,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Career | Europe,self,t3_1h69y9e
datascience,Which of these two jobs should I take?,"I have the opportunity to take two jobs. One is for a senior BI analyst at a medium-sized sports betting company ($500M revenue) and the other is for a “reporting analyst” position with a large asset management firm (&gt;$1B revenue).

Here is my dilemma: 
- The BI analyst one involves a lot more data science  methodology and probably offers more direct advancement in this field

- The reporting analyst one is mostly focused on outreach and data collection (calling member banks and whatnot) to report investment data to supervisors 

- however, I would prefer to work in the financial industry long term as I enjoy economic data more and enjoy the idea of working within capital 
Markets and economic planning. I’m worried that if I take the sports betting role, I wont be able to pivot into this field later on.

I would appreciate any and all advice.

datascience,Why hasn't forecasting evolved as far as LLMs have?,"Forecasting is still very clumsy and very painful. Even the models built by major companies -- Meta's Prophet and Google's Causal Impact come to mind -- don't really succeed as one-step, plug-and-play forecasting tools. They miss a lot of seasonality, overreact to outliers, and need a lot of tweaking to get right.

It's an area of data science where the models that I build on my own tend to work better than the models I can find.

LLMs, on the other hand, have reached incredible versatility and usability. ChatGPT and its clones aren't necessarily perfect yet, but they're definitely way beyond what I can do. Any time I have a language processing challenge, I know I'm going to get a better result leveraging somebody else's model than I will trying to build my own solution.

Why is that? After all the time we as data scientists have put into forecasting, why haven't we created something that outperforms what an individual data scientist can create?

Or -- if I'm wrong, and that does exist -- what tool does that?",takenorinvalid,1h5z7w7,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5z7w7/why_hasnt_forecasting_evolved_as_far_as_llms_have/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h5z7w7/why_hasnt_forecasting_evolved_as_far_as_llms_have/,2024-12-03 21:49:24,188,0.89,188,0,105,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h5z7w7
