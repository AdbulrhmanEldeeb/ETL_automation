books,I love finding rare old books but then it’s so difficult to read that English - Robinson Crusoe 1965 copy,"I found this rare gem 1965 edition, it’s in pretty good condition and was really cheap at 2nd hand shop.

But the page spacing is really not eye friendly, sometimes it doesn’t stop with periods and often don’t use capital letters. And above all the level of English makes it more difficult as it doesn’t feel like “common tongue” anymore. I often think about the meaning of the words more than the actual story.

I don’t want to give up this copy but at the same time I feel like I’m not actually enjoying it like I would with a modern one.",xSypRo,1h75h45,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h75h45/i_love_finding_rare_old_books_but_then_its_so/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h75h45/i_love_finding_rare_old_books_but_then_its_so/,2024-12-05 09:35:42,46,0.77,46,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h75h45

books,A Year of Reading to a 5 Year Old,"My son turned 6 this fall and this is the first really consistent year I've spent reading chapter books with him.  I've looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I'd look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old's perspective.

**The BFG** by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this.  I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it's fun.

**Charlie and the Chocolate Factory** by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit.  We've been chasing this high all year.  As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets.  The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment.  (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)

**Fantastic Mr. Fox** by Roald Dahl - A lot shorter than I was expecting and probably my kid's least favorite Dahl.

**James and the Giant Peach** by Roald Dahl - Kid liked it fine, it was my least favorite Dahl and there are a lot of voices to do if you do that.

**The Wild Robot Trilogy** by Peter Brown - We finished the 3rd one about a week before the movie came out by coincidence.  The first 2 are really good and my son was constantly asking if we could read just one more chapter since the chapters are short.  The 3rd one is fine but it's not as connected as the first 2 are.  It felt more like an afterthought.  

**Stuart Little** by E.B. White - I thought this was a pleasure to read as an adult.  The kid enjoyed it although he was startled by the abrupt ending.

**The Horse and His Boy** and **The Silver Chair** by C.S. Lewis - This concluded Narnia for us, I think.  We've read everything but The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle.  I loved Narnia as a kid but it's rough for this age.  There are some very talky and slow parts that my kid just didn't get.  He really like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which we read last year but otherwise, Narnia is maybe better left for an older kid.

Next on my list of possibilities are The Hobbit, Charlotte's Web, and Doctor Doolittle.  I've also considered the Redwall series, but it might be too old for him still.  I'd love suggestions for 2025 if you've got something that was fun for both reader and kid!

books,"I'm sorry, I just finished East of Eden... ","And I have no one to talk to about how much I loved it.   
  
I used to read a lot as a kid and in spurts throughout my adulthood. After about 2 years of starting but never finishing a book I have read 15 in the past year. Mostly really disturbing horror and transgressive stuff with some modern/post modern lit peppered in.

East of Eden's grand scope, memorable and lovable characters(Samuel Hamilton and Lee come to mind) and beautiful descriptions along with Steinbeck tackling some really challenging human topics spoke to me.

books,Unreliability in Penance by Eliza Clark,"I really enjoyed this book and am continuing to think about it, but I'm realizing there isn't a lot of payoff for the framing narrative/unreliable narrator-- the points where he's being self-serving or antagonistic are usually pretty clear during his first-person sections and the interviews he conducts, and looking for distortions or lies in his invented sections hasn't borne anything for me. It seems like Clark is using him as a justification for the more straightforward prose sections &amp; as a good conduit for the themes (e.g. the reveal at the end that he &gt;!obtained and published the girl's first-hand accounts illegally!&lt;), but that overall his perspective doesn't influence the 'truth' of the story Clark is telling very much. Did anyone get a different conclusion from reading those prose sections more closely, or from the book generally?",udibranch,1h776z5,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h776z5/unreliability_in_penance_by_eliza_clark/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h776z5/unreliability_in_penance_by_eliza_clark/,2024-12-05 11:37:01,5,0.78,5,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h776z5
