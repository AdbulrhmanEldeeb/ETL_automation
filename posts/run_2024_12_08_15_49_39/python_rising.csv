Python, RedSage is a terminal-based pair programming assistant that integrates with LLMs. Opensource. ,"Need a junior developer that can program with you? I built one in Python.

What my project does?

After installing the program, you can start RedSage right from your terminal. It‚Äôs an AI-powered pair programming assistant that connects to LLMs like OpenAI and Claude to help you write code, explain concepts, and even review your changes in real-time. 

Comparisons:

Unlike complex IDE plugins, RedSage is lightweight and works directly from the command line, giving you intelligent code suggestions, context-aware explanations, and seamless Git integration without the overhead. Think of it as having a junior developer by your side, but with no setup hassles and a super-fast workflow. Perfect for anyone looking for a simple, yet powerful coding companion.

Conclusion: 

I'd like your feedback and project direction. It's entirely built in Python and available on Github. The link i above.

Python,Python .gitignore,"I'm sure a lot of you have done this:

1. Start new project
2. Need that generic Python `.gitignore` file on GitHub
3. Google ""python gitignore"" (though you probably typed ""gitingore"")
4. Click link and click raw
5. Copy all and paste in your local `.gitignore`

And I'm sure a lot of you probably just use curl and have it memorized or have it in your shell history or something (`fzf` ftw). But I can't be bothered to learn curl properly, and I got tired of the manual steps, so I just created a function in my `.zshrc` file:

    function pgi {
        curl -JL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/refs/heads/main/Python.gitignore -o .gitignore
    }

So now I can just run `pgi` whenever I start a new project, and boom, precious seconds of my life saved.

That's it, that's all I have, thanks for reading. I'm sure some of you have ever better solutions, but that's mine.",EarthGoddessDude,1h8rc4g,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h8rc4g/python_gitignore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h8rc4g/python_gitignore/,2024-12-07 12:20:52,92,0.79,92,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,self,t3_1h8rc4g

Python,Flet vs Streamlit PWA and conceptual questions,"I'm new to flet, but I'm experienced Flutter developer plus I'm a Generative AI Engineer and worked with streamlit or Gradio. I have some conceptual questions.  
Q1. If flet uses Flutter, then why does the flet Flutter plugin require a URL? Why cannot the flet UI ""live"" all together in Flutter?  
Q2. Since there's a URL needed anyway, what's the advantage of using it vs for example having a Streamlit UI displayed in a PWA?  
Q3. Let's say I develop a personal assistant in flet. Can the assistant access my location, heart rate, my camera (for multi-modal Gen AI), microphone and speakers (for voice assistant functionalities)?",MrCsabaToth,1h8nzyy,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h8nzyy/flet_vs_streamlit_pwa_and_conceptual_questions/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1h8nzyy/flet_vs_streamlit_pwa_and_conceptual_questions/,2024-12-07 08:15:44,10,0.73,10,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8nzyy
