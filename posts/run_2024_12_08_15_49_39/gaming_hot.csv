gaming,Bring Back Good Co-Op Games,"Marvel Rivals came out. Was pretty cool for like 15 minutes and then I just felt kinda bored and a little sad. 

I’ve been playing games since the 80s and idk, I’m just tired of PvP stuff. Really missing the cooperative games of old.

I remember stuff like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or Left 4 Dead or Gauntlet Legends or Halo or even Destiny or the arcade beat em ups like X-men or the Simpsons or Turtles game when it first came out and these games were just so epic and fostered such great teamwork and camaraderie. Helluva dope feeling and rush having to work together to win. Especially back in the days of arcades, nothing cooler than actually assembling 4 people dedicated to pulling it off.

Idk. Everything just feels so competitive, battle royale, hero shootery, and it’s just beginning to feel unnecessary and kinda forced and stale.

Maybe I’m just feeling nostalgic and outta touch lol but I feel like bringing these kinds of great co-op games back in a modern sense in actual abundance would really inject some love and positive vibes back into the community while also, bringing in a whole new demographic of gamers looking for something less demanding and stressful than PvP gaming which I feel like is just low key bloating the market at this point.

P.S. this is no dig Marvel Rivals or to gamers that enjoy these games, I’m just getting this off my chest lol sorry it’s late, I’m high, rant over.

lol nope just a husband, father, business owner and student. I’ve been playing games since the 80s. I know major titles and indie games exist guys no offense lol. Mostly all the ones that have been named so far are not new names to me or games I haven’t tried at some point that just didn’t capture my interest.

Edit: Idk why I’m getting downvoted so much lmao are you taking offense to the fact that I just don’t like the games you’re suggesting as much as you or others do or haven’t played them? 

Idk I think I’ve been pretty respectful about the games I have talked about, even the ones I may not care for as well but idk. Either way, I’ve played Indie game guys. I’ve played games like stardew valley (well technically my wife played and I watched) or warhammer (specifically the vermintide one) and that was honestly years ago. Maybe I’m wrong but, those I don’t feel like are recent games (came out this year) and when I did watch/play them, they weren’t my cup of tea. I guess I should have been specific (like when I mentioned Destiny, I meant specifically the first one as I played 2 and did not care for it as much).

I’m almost 40 and a pretty avid gamer blessed to be able to play a PLETHORA of games over the last few years through different means (work, personal life, events), with 2 kids and a wife who are all also gamers either various taste whether that be in console (we have most past and present) or game type. I do not live under a rock, maybe a more a pineapple under the sea and my only burden is the business of life but, I’ve still found time to do my gaming and follow my hobbies (for business/pleasure) so I’m not completely out the loop.

I’ve had some great suggestion here to help solidify the push to try certain titles (maybe the art style has been putting me off or mechanics or story didn’t capture me) that I have been putting off or stayed away from. And I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and even opinions but let’s not trip on each other off of video games. The post was meant to just be light hearted and random, not this deep dive into my personal gaming preferences or an attack on others interest lol. 

From one gamer to another, let’s try to foster more positivity and cohesion so we gamers don’t always have to carry the title of toxic and negative and build a more appealing and inviting community.

I was lulled into a false sense of security because the last two games I played were Metaphor and P3R both which have some level of auto-saving.

I was starting my playthrough of SMTV and going around and eventually get to this one red enemy that they warned me were strong. Well the first red one I fought I defeated easily so I thought it was no big deal. Engage this second one and in it's opening move it hits my whole team with an Almighty attack and wipes me out in one go.

I lost 2 1/2 hours of gameplay lol. First time in a long time I've lost that much gameplay it nearly brought tears to my eyes lol. I had gathered so many demons and leveled them. *sigh*

I know SMTV Vengeance adds some new stuff so I don't know if these red enemies are new or not, it's been so long I forgot most of the original game.

Anyway...make sure to regularly save. What's making me kick myself is I recently had passed a save point and I'm in hindsight mode of WHY DIDNT I SAVE?!

Needless to say I learned my lesson the hard way. At least it was early in the game.

gaming,Nintendo Switch Lite or Xbox Series S for my kids' Christmas ,"I have three kids(9, 6, 6), one already has a Switch lite.  
I went to a pawn shop and they have two Switch Lites going for $75 each or an Xbox Series S going for $149.

Our household uses both Gamepass and Nintendo online subscriptions.  
I already personally have a Switch and Xbox Series X, so the kids could use my Gamepass subscription or even play on my Xbox maybe, but I want to get them something they can play whenever they want.

My kids mostly play Minecraft on their Amazon tablets.

Which one should I get? My wife is worried our oldest would take over the Xbox, but there are tons of Gamepass games on there. All three seemed to work fine when I tested them, one of the Switches had some cosmetic damage(like a bite or indention in the corner??) and the Xbox seemed a bit dusty in the vents, but I'm sure I can clean that and put a case on the Switch.

I feel odd buying used stuff for Christmas presents, but these seem like really good deals.

Should I even get either option? I'm a bit worried something could be wrong with either system.  
There was something sticky on one of the switches, but I was going to clean it up real good if I got it.

The Xbox I also don't know how to check if it's banned already and I would have to get controllers.

Player hit Goblin with a heavy attack inflicting 10 damage

Goblin hit Player with “Fireball” but Player managed to block 5 damage. Etc

I know that sounds like MMO stuff, but we all played WoW and various other MMOs for years and years and now we are in our late 30s and cannot commit THAT kind of time. 

  
Up next on the roster is Warhammer 40k Roguetrader, which is a lot like BG3 I think - story, strategy, and RPG elements, but misses that one itch to scrath of PvP.

gaming,Game console just for LAN?,"EDIT: Some people keep saying other companies CAN do this already. Yes they CAN but they aren't. There are many reasons why they don't but that is a different discussion. 

Also, to reiterate, I'm talking about a game console, not a PC. This means a curated OS specifically engineering for local play, controller driven, self contained system. 

The difference here isn't just the console but the licensing relationships and inhouse development studios that enable this console to function as intended. 

=================

Would you be interested in a game console that was specifically marketed for local multiplayer?

priced similar to a switch, and whose games are specifically made with couch co-op, local system link multiplayer, and LAN parties in mind. 

This specific market segment has been long abandoned and I believe there is a desire, especially among older and much younger gamers, to play games together. 

The system would leverage existing local multiplayer title licenses along with building a strong portfolio of purpose developed games. The idea would be to leverage inhouse studio licensing at higher rate fees for 2nd party systems to help cover the cost of the console. The inhouse studios would also help ensure continuity of local multiplayer cross-console play.

gaming,Need advice for a christmas present,"I need some advice on which game to get my nephew.

I remember when I was a kid with my 8-bit NES and my family was always happy when they 'got a videa game' for me for Christmas. The problem is, they usually didn't know anything about games and had terrible taste. I don't want to be that guy.

So my nephew - 12, m - is getting a PS5 from his parents. He's historically gamed on the Switch, and he (and I) LOVES the Legend of Zelda series. We've played BoTW and ToTK together, and regularly share tips, tricks, and advice.

I want to get his something for his PS5 that he'll enjoy, I'm looking for: open-world, lots of content to explore, appropriate levels of violence and language (he'll be playing it in the same room as his mom/my sister; I don't want it to be over the top), and fun. Something that someone who loves Zelda will be into.

gaming,Choices matter hell...,"I have a very big issue with this type of games.

It's not a rule, but more often than not it completely breaks the game for me.

My problem with those games, is that in most cases you get locked out of part of the content, based on the decisions you made.

In my opinion this is a very poor game design, artificially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs, if you want to see complete content.

As I never do more than one playthrough of any single player game, I feel somewhat robbed of a full experience.

Another complaint that I could log, is that at their launch many of these games are not balanced well enough, meaning if you pick a ""wrong"" side, you might be underpowered, compared to others.

This inherently leads me to not playing them until at least one or two major patches land, or I might skip them completely, if they fall off my radar.

If I am being completely honest, I would also have to blame my OCD, for wanting to see, and do, everything there is in every game I play, and wanting to min-max my character(s) each time.

Anyone else out there, with similar issues?   

Edit: based on early comments, I want to elaborate.  
For me it would be a much better game design if your choices dictate on which side of the situation/discussion, your character ends up, not completely lock you out of certain content.",OhforfsakeMJ,1h8qecr,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h8qecr/choices_matter_hell/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h8qecr/choices_matter_hell/,2024-12-07 11:16:50,0,0.21,0,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8qecr

gaming,Marvel Rivals unpopular opinion ,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, I've been waiting since the first play test for the game to release, but between godwaful matchmaking and low-key pretty unbalanced hero's, I think I'd rather play overwatch 

Sure, there's something to be said about running around as spider man punching dudes into the sky and webbing them up, or using Loki's decoys to escape and punish people, but overall the balance on character abilities feels extremely lacking. 

Like why is punishers ultimate so broken, but scarlet witch needs to be within slapping distance to get a kill with it, while having a huge red **SHOOT HERE SIGN** on top of you. Making it early impossible to use even if you get the drop on people.

That's not to me to mention the amount of times Hawkeye has one shot me across the map, or how groots stun ability lasts like 10x as long as Wanda's.

But my initial thoughts are more so about how great of an initial “free to play, GaaS package” this game is starting out as.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs.

gaming,What are some sleeper hit games that people should give more attention to?,"For me, it’s probably Teardown and Children of the Sun.

Teardown is a game where you can destroy anything and everything. It’s the perfect vandalism/heist game too. But I do not recommend the DLC’s. Most are hit or miss. But there is a modding community that frequently makes new content for others to play.

As for Children of the Sun. It’s a game where you have one single Sniper Rifle bullet, and you must make the bullet change trajectory to kill multiple enemies. 

Think of it like the Sniper Elite games, but it’s also a puzzle as well. You have to find out the best path and use shortcuts to your advantage.

Again. It doesn’t matter how long a game has been out. I have a right to interact on a subreddit, spoiler free, without being mobbed for asking people to stop blatantly spoiling plot points. 

That is literally what spoiler tags are for. Instead I get literal screenshots of the endings to games or casual plot points in random comments.

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't buy weapons or armor. Like its predecessors, you also heal out of combat, KOed characters revive after a fight, and in this game, your healers can be revived KOed characters an unlimited number of times during a fight. As a result, a lot of commonly seen RPG items aren't in this game removing a lot you can spend money on.

There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.
