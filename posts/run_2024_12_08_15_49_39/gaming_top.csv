I was lulled into a false sense of security because the last two games I played were Metaphor and P3R both which have some level of auto-saving.

I was starting my playthrough of SMTV and going around and eventually get to this one red enemy that they warned me were strong. Well the first red one I fought I defeated easily so I thought it was no big deal. Engage this second one and in it's opening move it hits my whole team with an Almighty attack and wipes me out in one go.

I lost 2 1/2 hours of gameplay lol. First time in a long time I've lost that much gameplay it nearly brought tears to my eyes lol. I had gathered so many demons and leveled them. *sigh*

I know SMTV Vengeance adds some new stuff so I don't know if these red enemies are new or not, it's been so long I forgot most of the original game.

Anyway...make sure to regularly save. What's making me kick myself is I recently had passed a save point and I'm in hindsight mode of WHY DIDNT I SAVE?!

Needless to say I learned my lesson the hard way. At least it was early in the game.

gaming,Nintendo Switch Lite or Xbox Series S for my kids' Christmas ,"I have three kids(9, 6, 6), one already has a Switch lite.  
I went to a pawn shop and they have two Switch Lites going for $75 each or an Xbox Series S going for $149.

Our household uses both Gamepass and Nintendo online subscriptions.  
I already personally have a Switch and Xbox Series X, so the kids could use my Gamepass subscription or even play on my Xbox maybe, but I want to get them something they can play whenever they want.

My kids mostly play Minecraft on their Amazon tablets.

Which one should I get? My wife is worried our oldest would take over the Xbox, but there are tons of Gamepass games on there. All three seemed to work fine when I tested them, one of the Switches had some cosmetic damage(like a bite or indention in the corner??) and the Xbox seemed a bit dusty in the vents, but I'm sure I can clean that and put a case on the Switch.

I feel odd buying used stuff for Christmas presents, but these seem like really good deals.

Should I even get either option? I'm a bit worried something could be wrong with either system.  
There was something sticky on one of the switches, but I was going to clean it up real good if I got it.

The Xbox I also don't know how to check if it's banned already and I would have to get controllers.  
The Switches I would need protective cases, screen protectors and games are more expensive outside of gamepass.

EDIT- How would I go about thoroughly testing these systems?",RageInducedGamer,1h9bewy,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9bewy/nintendo_switch_lite_or_xbox_series_s_for_my_kids/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9bewy/nintendo_switch_lite_or_xbox_series_s_for_my_kids/,2024-12-08 05:02:25,0,0.39,0,0,47,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9bewy

gaming,Question about FFVII REBIRTH,"Hey Hive Mind, 

My partner and I are playing Rebirth and are both big on getting every piece of loot in any game we play. 

This game feels way more open world so far, but does it work like Remake where we hit a point and can no longer go back to old parts of the world? Do we have to do all exploration of the world/loot hunting as the story progresses, or can we just open world travel to check out areas after the story moves us to another part of the world?

That said, I love the game. But I can't seem to find a remake like this priced right. I mean, when the SNES came out, Super Mario All Stars was a thing. But it quickly dropped into an affordable price range due to the fact there wasn't a new game at its core.

So my question is, is the remake worth it. Answer with a price point you would pay for it.

I would pay 20 for it.",thecton,1h95ma5,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h95ma5/is_the_new_mario_rpg_worth_the_hype/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h95ma5/is_the_new_mario_rpg_worth_the_hype/,2024-12-07 23:47:35,0,0.3,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h95ma5

gaming,Game console just for LAN?,"EDIT: Some people keep saying other companies CAN do this already. Yes they CAN but they aren't. There are many reasons why they don't but that is a different discussion. 

Also, to reiterate, I'm talking about a game console, not a PC. This means a curated OS specifically engineering for local play, controller driven, self contained system. 

The difference here isn't just the console but the licensing relationships and inhouse development studios that enable this console to function as intended. 

=================

Would you be interested in a game console that was specifically marketed for local multiplayer?

priced similar to a switch, and whose games are specifically made with couch co-op, local system link multiplayer, and LAN parties in mind. 

This specific market segment has been long abandoned and I believe there is a desire, especially among older and much younger gamers, to play games together. 

The system would leverage existing local multiplayer title licenses along with building a strong portfolio of purpose developed games. The idea would be to leverage inhouse studio licensing at higher rate fees for 2nd party systems to help cover the cost of the console. The inhouse studios would also help ensure continuity of local multiplayer cross-console play.
