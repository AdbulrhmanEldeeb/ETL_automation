datascience,How to find freelance opportunities - what is the most typical troupe of project you do as freelance ,"Hi all,

I have 5+ years of experience. I’m based in Europe

Lately I’m thinking switch from full time employee to contractor, doing freelancing and working for different companies at the same time.

I think that freelancing for data scientists is harder than freelancing for software developers. I imagine a front end developer can easily get a project to build form scratch a website, or add a functionality to the existent one. Data scientists instead need already data and infrastructure to perform their job.
