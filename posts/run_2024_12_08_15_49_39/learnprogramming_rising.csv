learnprogramming,Help with building a basic programming language.,"
I have always wanted to try making my own programming language .i know its quite a difficult endeavor even if a simple one , but anyways i wanted ur guys help . It might be an amazing moment for u also if u helped me do it, atleast u could always boast the u had some hands in making a programming language.
If u have some free time and can collaborate with me to make it then we can do that on github . if not then ur advice will be greatly appreciated. I mean i dont know a heck about it right now. 


My basic idea is to make a simple Ai bot making programming language. it might be feasible or not but it would be great if it would a simple one . Hope u all enjoy ur free time helping me...

learnprogramming,Is the programming dream a harsher reality?,"TLDR: did your enthusiasm for coding die or fade once you got employment, or did you find the same joy as when you were doing more independent learning challenges?

I started doing the Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python course. And I absolutely love it. I made the blackjack challenge without searching for any of my code just of what I learnt previously and it was such a cool feeling. (First small project in that course)

I’m trying to get back into it, now with a more focused approach of getting a job as a goal and learning enough to do some pretty cool projects ideas I have. But I’m scared what if I spend this 1-2 years of the young part of my life (I’m 23). What if it’s not at all like what I’ve been enjoying, to actually work as a developer. What if I just hate the actual corporate job side of it. 

Right now I love the challenge of coding and visualizing how everything works. The building blocks you need to place to connect it all in your head. I love the thought process of this. I’m just scared that it’s not going to be all that in terms of work. And that I’ll be left thinking “oh well now I learnt all this and now I’m getting a good salary I can’t just leave this”.

I guess what I’m hoping for is that I keep thinking it’s a fun puzzle and that I keep enjoying it. What I’m scared of is becoming miserable and hating my job. Should I just try my entrepreneurial ideas instead? Or should I pursue this which I feel is more tangible.

learnprogramming,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6vx,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9l6vx/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:54,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9l6vx
learnprogramming,How to program renderer for a volumetric display?,"I'm working on a volumetric display using a 64x64 LED panel rotating at 900rpm to create a persistence of vision effect. I need help writing the software to render images for it as I'm unsure how to go about it.

My current plan is to render a 3d model like an obj file, and take individuals slices/planes at 6 degrees intervals as a plane rotates through it. These could then be stitched together with ffmpeg into a 900fps video and played on the rotating display. 60 frames per rotation, 15 rotations per second, 246k pixels.

The display should support this refresh rate as it updates the pixels 2 rows at a time at 1920hz.

My question is what's the best way to go about this, what should I program it in and how? I'm looking into python and trimesh at the moment as that has a voxelise feature which could help, and a slice feature built in. Is there already existing software that could do this for me?

My ""makefile"" (actually just a bash file) looks like this: `gcc -O -Wall -W -pedantic --std=c17 -o game main.c -lSDL3 -lm`

It compiles fine, so I guess my installation of SDL3 was successful. The CMake script put it in `/usr/local/` instead of just `/usr/` where apt put SDL2.

libSDL3.so.0 is in here: 

    /usr/local/lib$ ls -a

learnprogramming,Why isn't my code unzipping the file given by the user? ,"I am writing a batch file that encrypts/compresses and unencrypts/decompresses a file. When the user chooses to unencrypt/decompress, the program does unencrypt it, but it does not decompress it, and I cannot figure out why.

Here is the section in question:

    SET /P FILEPATH=Please enter entire filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt: 
    ECHO 
    SET /P UNENCRYPTED=Please enter filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt, but without the final extension. For example, filepath.backup.zip.aes becomes filepath.backup.zip:
    
    aescrypt.exe -d %FILEPATH%
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET FILE_PATH=%%~dpF
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET FILENAME=%%~nxF
    cd %FILE_PATH%
    TAR -xf %FILENAME%
    

I tried first to strip filename.backup.zip.aes of its last extension so I could unzip that by doing this:

    FOR %%F IN (%FILENAME%) DO SET UNENCRYPTED=%%~dpnF
    TAR -xf %UNENCRYPTED%
    

Then I tried to unzip that, but it didn't work.

After that I tried taking the .zip extension off of UNENCRYPTED and putting it back on in the tar command like this:

    FOR %%F IN (%FILENAME%) DO SET UNENCRYPTED=%%~dpnF
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET NOEXTENSION=%%~dpnF
    TAR -xf %NOEXTENSION%.zip
    
    

but I got the same result.

Finally I decided to prompt the user a second time for the filepath without the last extension, as shown in the current code, but it doesn't work either.

&gt;Problem Description:

You have a restaurant at a beachside which has N dining tables. Each dining table has only one chair so each table can accommodate only one person. These dining tables are along a straight line parallel to the beach at positions x1 ,...,xN.

C customers are currently queued up outside the restaurant since you have reopened the restaurant after a long time due to the pandemic. You need to assign the dining tables to the customers such that the minimum distance between any two customers is as large as possible in order to take care of the precautions considering the current pandemic situation. (Consider all C customers dine at the same time)

Find the largest minimum distance possible.


&gt;Input Description:

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and c (2 ≤ C ≤ N).
The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 1000000000) - The elements of the array W.


&gt;Output Description:

For each test case, print the answer: The largest minimum distance.

learnprogramming,Question about my website,"I am creating a website where it is possible for each user to have a kind of archive in which to store only certain types of files (.wav and .mp3).  
First I was thinking about storing the files in a database.  
Subsequently I thought that this system was not very efficient so I decided to always use the database but this time putting only a text string that points to the absolute position of the files involved (Example: D:\\Songs\\Song.wav).  
I'm not sure if this system is good; the problem is that this site will be public (rightly so), I would need a sort of protected virtual archive directly connected to the website page where it is possible to put and extrapolate the files (which on the page will appear as audio in scalar order while in the archive the files will be divided into folders and subfolders based on the name of the user and the file so as to make the collection and storage of files more orderly and efficient).  
So my questions are:  
Is there a better way I can use the database to point to folders or some other better way to store files? If my system is otherwise acceptable, could you tell me about a virtual archive service that can do what I requested?

int start\_node = start - 'A';

int cur\_path\[30\], best\_path\[30\];

int best\_cost = INT\_MAX;

bool visited\[30\] = {false};

cur\_path\[0\] = start\_node;

visited\[start\_node\] = true;

branchAndBound(G, n, cur\_path, best\_path, 0, best\_cost, visited, 1);

result += (char)('A' + best\_path\[i\]);

result += ' ';

}

result += start;

return result;

}



Heres the testing code on my school web:

  
int G\[30\]\[30\];  
fin.open(""Trave\_In.txt"");  
int n=12;  
for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++){  
for(int j=0;j&lt;n;j++){  
fin&gt;&gt;G\[i\]\[j\];  
}  
}  
string output=Traveling(G,n,'A');  
cout &lt;&lt; output;  
fin.close();



The input consists of an integer n, a nxn matrices which can have negative edges and a char for start vertex. My code works fine for n = 12 and n = 14 but with n &gt;= 16 it exceeds time limit. Can someone help me fix it?",veryniceboi69fuck,1h9etfd,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9etfd/help_me_optimize_code_solving_travelling_salemans/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h9etfd/help_me_optimize_code_solving_travelling_salemans/,2024-12-08 08:57:12,0,0.5,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Debugging,,t3_1h9etfd
