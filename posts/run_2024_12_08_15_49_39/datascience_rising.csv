datascience,How to find freelance opportunities - what is the most typical troupe of project you do as freelance ,"Hi all,

I have 5+ years of experience. I’m based in Europe

Lately I’m thinking switch from full time employee to contractor, doing freelancing and working for different companies at the same time.

I think that freelancing for data scientists is harder than freelancing for software developers. I imagine a front end developer can easily get a project to build form scratch a website, or add a functionality to the existent one. Data scientists instead need already data and infrastructure to perform their job.


- How do data scientists find freelance jobs, I’m based in Europe which platform/website do you use?
- What is the most typical project you worked on?
- How is the market now, is there a good demand?

datascience,Is the data job market as badly affected as software engineering?,Everyone knows the market is bad right now for software engineers. Probably as bad as it's every been.

datascience,Classification threshold cost optimisation,"Say you’ve selected the best classifier for a particular problem, using threshold invariant metrics such as AUROC, Brier score, or log loss. 

It’s now time to choose the classification threshold. This will clearly depend on the use case and the cost/ benefits associated with true positives, false positives, etc. 

Often I see people advising to choose a threshold by looking at metrics such precision and recall. 

What I don’t see very often is people explicitly defining relative (or absolute, if possible) costs/ benefits of each cell in the confusion matrix (or more precisely the action that will be taken as a result). For example a true positive is worth $1000, a false positive -$500 and the other cells $0. 

You then optimise the threshold based on maximum benefit using a cost-threshold curve. The precision and recall can also be reported, but they are secondary to the benefit optimisation and not used directly in the choice. I find this much more intuitive and is my go-to.

Does anyone else regularly use this approach? In what situations might this approach not make sense?",hazzaphill,1h8dlz9,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h8dlz9/classification_threshold_cost_optimisation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h8dlz9/classification_threshold_cost_optimisation/,2024-12-06 22:29:01,29,0.92,29,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8dlz9
