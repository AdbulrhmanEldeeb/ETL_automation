books,Stoner by John Williams is absolutely devastating me,"I got sucked into it a few weeks ago...then I got to the part where Edith is gone and he bonds with his daughter, and then Edith comes home...it hurt so much, I had to stop.

I finally came back to it now after weeks only for the Charles Walker stuff to be some of the most intense and stressful stuff I've ever read. I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with that, but I'm in my first year of grad school and intend to continue in academia as a queer person; the thought of being absolutely screwed by department politics and the vindictiveness of those with more social power is horrifying. I think I'm going to have to take a step away from it again.

I've been struggling with depression for about a year and  a half now, and it's made it difficult for literature to get me to feel anything.

I‚Äôve read 2 books by Bret Easton Ellis,‚Äî The Shards and Lunar Park‚Äî and they both made me wish I could‚Äôve read them with a book club or something because they‚Äôre so fascinating. His ‚Äúautofiction‚Äù approach is something that I don‚Äôt see done almost ever and it adds a whole new layer of intrigue onto everything he touches. Not a fan of him as a person but I love his books. 

Mason &amp; Dixon by Thomas Pynchon. This book is an epic, sprawling adventure with an entire fan wiki dedicated to the historical references contained within it. The only book I‚Äôve ever annotated of my own free will. Unexpectedly, though, I think about it constantly not because its crazy plot but because it is deeply, deeply beautiful and moving. I never would‚Äôve thought a silly little book about the two guys who drew the boundaries between states would have this profound of an emotional impact on me. I was MOVED!!!!!!!!

books,2024 Book Spending ,"I haven‚Äôt seen a post like this in a while - just curious how much bookworms spent this year as we approach the end of the year. 

Please chime in with how much you spent for the year or any comparisons you find interesting! 

Last year I spent about $400, but this year I‚Äôm approaching $1000 on books. I‚Äôm genuinely curious where this falls among the masses, is this a lot? Average? 

This amount includes my monthly audible and KU subscription (about $26 per month or $326 on subscriptions for the year, then about $700 for physical books and the random e-book or audiobook deal). I intermittently buy new books and always love to find something secondhand. I sometimes go a month or two without buying then get a shopping bug and stock up. 

I started a Booktube channel this year which I don‚Äôt feel like has influenced my shopping habits as I tend to be somewhat conservative, but clearly something changed this year. More self reflection needed to see what really drove my spending. 

I am somewhat happy to say I‚Äôve read a fair amount of what I‚Äôve purchased so far. Hoping to improve this next year by prioritizing my shelves, utilizing the library more and shopping second hand or deals when I need something.

books,An apocalyptic pandemic as imagined in 'The Scarlet Plague' by Jack London (1912) - a short and gripping novel.,"It is quite difficult to choose some words to begin this review. Let's say that the novel gripped me with its fast pace. An almost cinema-like dynamism - the descent of civilization into chaos, through a combination of visceral panic and despair, spred like a fire, devouring everything around - and *a fire* it was, as the onset of *Scarlet Plague* brought forth the innate instincts of self-destruction - murder, looting, arson. For, if once the unexpected symptoms appear, it takes the microbes only hald an hour to turn a healthy man into rotting corpse, people seek either salvation - fruitless endeavors, as it turned - or accept their fate and set the world ablaze as a final act of will. 

A dystopian, magnate-ruled society of the 21st America (as it was imagined by a *Belle Epoque* writer) could not withstand the catastrophe. A rigid class system to be torn down, all of the intricacies of progress to be annulled by a single flash of Plague - in just a week! No wonder that the narrator, now an old, sickly man, the last alive witness of *the end*, recalls the events of the long ago with tears and trepidation. 

Jack London imagined an absolute catastrophe, that would leave a score of people alive - deserting all knowledge of civilisation and turning to a primitive way of life within a geberation. One might consider this interpretation a little naive - but the tale nevertheless retained its strong grip on me from the first moment to the last. And it is short - no more than eighty pages.

books,"The Practice, The Horizon and The Chain by Sofia Samatar ","I'm going to need you all to give The Practice, The Horizon and The Chain by Sofia Samatar a try. 

If you enjoy Octavia Butler, Philip K Dick, Margaret Atwood, Karen Lord, Anne Leckie, Hugh Howey, Becky Chambers, Jane Harpman. If you have ever worked in Academia. Then you should consider trying this book. For a literary SF book it is pretty accessible and readable. The prose is wonderful but economical and has a beautiful clarity to it. The subject matter is hard hitting and deeply political. 

I was immediately engaged, saw that it was quite inexpensive as an e-book, downloaded it and read the whole thing in one day. I did have to take breaks just to assimilate the emotional overload, but I couldn't stop reading it. I'm not sure if it is my book of the year, but it certainly in the top three.

books,No Spoiler Review: The Riyria Revelations by Michael J Sullivan,"First time poster, I generally read a series every week to two weeks depending on other tasks and felt like sharing so those wondering if they should grab that whole series at the bookstore or just the first book can make a more informed decision. 

The Riyria Revelations is a three book series following the thieving duo of Riyria; Royce and Hadrian. They are contracted for a job that turns their lives, and the world, upside down. Enjoy a twist on familiar fantasy themes, succinct but detailed combat sequences, and world building that rivals RR Martin and Anthony Ryan in scope if not detail. 

I don't like star reviews, because books deserve more than that. 

I rate this as a Good Read. The books are thick, detailed, and have just enough uniqueness to let them stand apart from the traditional fantasy fare. 

The plot was convoluted but tied up nicely with several twists that caught me off guard. Despite being self published, the quality of editing is superb, and I feel that it gives the writing more authenticity. If you love Tolkien's work with description, Sullivan accomplishes the same effect with dialog between the characters that pulls the reader deeper into the story and the arcs of the various characters. 

I loved this series for the storytelling through dialog and Sullivan's take on the traditional fantasy peoples of elves, goblins, dwarves, and humans. 

If you're a fantasy fanatic or even a casual consumer, this is a fantastic series that you should definitely grab as a set. If you're looking to jump into fantasy I would recommend picking up something a bit shorter, but it's not quite as beefy as The Raven's Shadow series or Night Angel Chronicles. Regardless, I would put this on the ""To Read"" shelf. 

If you've read this series, what other things would you say about it? And if you pick it up, come back and comment what you thought. 

Cheers

books,"Faust's Death (Faust Part II, Goethe)","I have been reading Goethe's second part of his most famous verse tragedy ""Faust"", and I have always been fascinated with the Faust's final scene in the fifth act (*Grosser Vorhof des Palasts; The courtyard of Faust's palace).* In this scene we see a blinded Faust (he was blinded in the previous scene by the personification of Depression; ""*Curae""* in latin) walking towards Mephistopheles and his ""Cronies"" (Lemuren; Lemures, ancient roman spirits of death); he quickly lounges into a long speech about progress, happiness and utopic desires (which most 20th century writers and philosophers have interpreted as a ""capitalistic"" desire which Faust tries to apply towards his subjects). During this speech he pronounces the ill-fated words of his deal (*""verweile doch, du bist so sch√∂n!; ""stay a while, you are so lovely!"")* and promptly falls on the ground, dead. I have always loved this scene because of its beautiful nature and because I love Goethe as an author in general. What do you guys think?

Anyway, I think I'll leave a copy of Faust's last speech right under here: ""*Ein Sumpf zieht am Gebirge hin, Verpestet alles schon Errungene; Den faulen Pfuhl auch abzuziehn, Das Letzte w√§r das H√∂chsterrungene. Er√∂ffn‚Äô ich R√§ume vielen Millionen, Nicht sicher zwar, doch t√§tig-frei zu wohnen. Gr√ºn das Gefilde, uchtbar; Mensch und Herde Sogleich behaglich auf der neusten Erde, Gleich angesiedelt an des H√ºgels Krat, Den aufgew√§lzt k√ºhn-emsige V√∂lkerschaft. Im Innern hier ein paradiesisch Land, Da rase drau√üen Flut bis auf zum Rand, Und wie sie nascht, gewaltsam einzuschie√üen, Gemeindrang eilt, die L√ºcke zu verschlie√üen. Ja! diesem Sinne bin ich ganz ergeben, Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schlu√ü: Nur der verdient sich Freiheit wie das Leben, Der t√§glich sie erobern mu√ü. Und so verbringt, umrungen von Gefahr, Hier Kindheit, Mann und Greis sein t√ºchtig Jahr. Solch ein Gewimmel m√∂cht ich sehn, Auf freiem Grund mit freiem Volke stehn. Zum Augenblicke d√ºrft ich sagen: ‚ÄûVerweile doch, du bist so sch√∂n! Es kann die Spur von meinen Erdetagen Nicht in √Ñonen untergehn.‚Äù ‚Äî Im Vorgef√ºhl von solchem hohen Gl√ºck Genie√ü ich jetzt den h√∂chsten Augenblick.""*

*English version:* A swamp lies there below the hill,

Infecting everything I‚Äôve done:

My last and greatest act of will

Succeeds when that foul pool is gone.

Let me make room for many a million,

Not wholly secure, but free to work on.

Green fertile fields, where men and herds

May gain swift comfort from the new-made earth.

Quickly settled in those hills‚Äô embrace,

Piled high by a brave, industrious race.

And in the centre here, a Paradise,

Whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,

And though it gnaws to enter in by force,

The common urge unites to halt its course.

Yes, I‚Äôve surrendered to this thought‚Äôs insistence,

The last word Wisdom ever has to say:

He only earns his Freedom and Existence,

Who‚Äôs forced to win them freshly every day.

Childhood, manhood, age‚Äôs vigorous years,

Surrounded by dangers, they‚Äôll spend here.

I wish to gaze again on such a land,

Free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand.

Then, to the Moment I‚Äôd dare say:

‚ÄòStay a while! You are so lovely!‚Äô

Through aeons, then, never to fade away

This path of mine through all that‚Äôs earthly. ‚Äì

Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,

Now I savour it, that highest moment.
