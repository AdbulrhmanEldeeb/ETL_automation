math,Very confused - please help,"I'm having difficulty understanding who is ""right"". A furious discussion has been provoked in one of my class discussion boards and the professor insists he is right, but we have pointed out he is not and it may well be we are wrong but don't get his understanding. He said that the expressions (I am typing it exactly as he showed us, with brackets and all):

\[(-4)\^2\]\^(1/2) is NOT the same as \[(-4\^(1/2)\]\^2. He says that the latter expression ends up being -4.

OK, but, The square root of negative 4 is indeed 2i. But that would be written as (-4)\^(1/2) ‚Äî that is, negative 4 in parentheses with the exponent of 1/2, or 0.5, outside the parentheses. Only then does the exponent apply to everything inside the parentheses, including the minus sign. Otherwise it just applies to the ‚Äú4‚Äù no?

The latter expression never asks for the square root of negative four. It asks for the negative of the square root of four. The expression is the same as ((-4\^(1/2)))\^2.  Put that into a C compiler, a Python interpreter, or Wolfram Alpha, and the answer is the positive real number four.

However, the professor insists we are wrong and does have a textbook to back it up...but what do you all think?

math,Feeling Lost in My Math Journey: Seeking Guidance to Reignite My Passion,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics (Honors) at the University of Delhi, and I‚Äôm in my 5th semester (third year). While it‚Äôs a decent university, the curriculum and academic environment aren‚Äôt exactly top-notch (although the professors are good). In my fourth year, we‚Äôll focus on research, but right now, I‚Äôm struggling with what I want to do after graduation.

Here‚Äôs my story: I‚Äôve always been passionate about mathematics and video editing (I‚Äôm a tech enthusiast). I‚Äôve always wanted to change how people perceive and approach mathematics, especially inspired by 3blue1brown‚Äôs YouTube channel. The way he explains concepts so smoothly really resonated with me, and I thought, ‚ÄúI want to do something like that.‚Äù

However, I feel completely lost now. I shifted my focus from mathematics and started taking a lot of video editing courses. I didn‚Äôt attend many of my classes and, as a result, my GPA has dropped to 6.5. For the past semester, I‚Äôve been trying to rekindle my love for math, for that I participated in a national level workshop about Numerical Optimisation  but I feel like I‚Äôm failing at it. As a Gen Z student, I‚Äôm constantly on social media, which doesn‚Äôt help in staying focused. I want to dive back into mathematics, but I‚Äôm not sure how to balance everything or even what my next steps should be.

I have no clear idea about my career path after this, and I feel stuck. I genuinely want to become great at mathematics again and eventually make a difference in how mathematics is taught and managed, especially in India, where things aren‚Äôt structured in the best way.

Any advice or thoughts on how to get back on track with my passion for math, manage my time better, and figure out my career direction would be greatly appreciated!

math,I am so burned out and I don't know why :( I worry that I've lost my passion for math ,"* I am a senior and I am only taking one math course right now. It's just a numerical linear algebra course.
* I have really not liked this course and I feel no desire to study for it. I don't understand why I feel so blah. The material is quite important and useful, but I think the material isn't particularly well-motivated, especially given that every method has been developed to solve a practical problem.
   * For example, I guess when we talk about Krylov subspace techniques, we could mention the motivation of projection methods is to efficiently solve very large sparse systems arising from finite element method.
* I don't understand why I feel so bored and unmotivated. I think it may have to do with the teaching structure, as my instructor was absent for several lectures and has been quite busy this semester. I felt really quite frustrated as I have other courses during office hours and the instructor was only able to meet during office hours, but I guess this is on par for the course for a graduate course.
* Normally I am quite happy to study in whatever spare time I have, but I feel like I've lost my passion and I struggle to want to study.
* I am constantly confused, also, and I am doing poorly in the course. It's a graduate course and I currently have a B; to me, that indicates a deficiency in my effort level and / or my understanding. Maybe my linear algebra background is too weak.

This semester, I applied to graduate school and I've been working on research projects, hence my mind was elsewhere for much of the semester. But I feel so frustrated and I am scared that I've lost my passion for math.

I'm taking a graduate course in analysis next semester because I'm interested in statistics. I really really care about understanding the concepts from this course.

math,Groups -- and Generators without Closure?,"I'm doing a project in music theory, and it has unexpectedly veered into Group Theory. I have been reading about it and I get the gist of it, but some of the definitions are unclear. I don't have a definitive textbook on the subject. Can you help?

Take for example the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}, which describes all the tones in the 12-TET Chromatic scale. We also define the operator of ""addition modulo 12"". I know that it is a Group because it satisfies the criteria:

* Closure
* Associativity
* Identity Element (it is 0)
* Invertibility

And this set definitely has a Generator. The generator could be 1, 5, 7, or 11 -- all the numbers that are coprime with the modulo. I've read that this is a ""generator set"", ie {1,5,7,11} is the set of all generators.

A Group with a generator is called a ""cyclic group"". And I've also read the definition ""a cyclic group has a single generator element"". Well, my Group has multiple generators. I take this to mean that we're only using one generator at a time... we aren't finding members of the Group by applying 1 or 5 or 7 any way we wish. We pick one generator, use it to generate the set, then put it back when we're done.

Furthermore, this is a ""finite cyclic set"" because of the modulo. It doesn't go on forever down the yellow brick number line.

Another definition says ""a group is cyclic if there exists an ùëé‚ààùê∫ such that every element of G is a power of a. By ""power of"" I assume that means a repeated application of the operator ""addition mod 12"". By this definition, the set {1,2,3,...,11} is cyclic.

So far that all makes sense, and... if I've made any mistakes please let me know and correct me!

OK Here's where things get a bit unclear for me, and where I think I might be wandering astray.

The Major Scale is represented by a set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}. We'll use the same operator ""addition mod 12"".

This isn't a Group! It fails the Closure condition -- because we can add 4 + 2 = 6, and 6 is not in the set. It passes Associativity and Identity. But then it fails on ""Inverses"".

And yet... in the Music Theory literature there is a lot of theorizing around Generators where the Major scale is used as an example. From any tone in the set {0,2,4,5,7,9,11}, you can add (or subtract) 5 or 7 enough times to find every other member of the set. Those of you who have studied music and the ""circle of fifths"" know what I'm talking about here.

But wait, forget about subtracting. We can create a path for the generator 7 if we start on the 5 and end on 11. It just can't go any further than that. According to what I've read in Group Theory, generators can't be stopped like that, but in Music Theory, they can?

Does the Major Scale fulfil the criteria ""there exists an ùëé‚ààùê∫ such that every element of G is a power of a""? It almost does, but it's more like a + x\^n not a\^n 

So what's the deal here? There are sets (with the addition mod 12 operator) that are not Groups, but they are cyclic, they have a Generator, Or at least, something that behaves like a Generator, but it can't be applied forever in both directions; there is a start and end to its generation pattern. Are there words for this that I haven't learned yet? Group-like things that have a Generator, but no Closure?

I'm writing this for an advanced academic audience so it's very important that I get all the words correct, and that I'm not glossing over the mathematical details with some vague hand-waving.

math,Dealing with meta-theory in research,"How important is it to understand the limitations of current techniques when coming up with new ones?

Whenever I approach a new (to me) topic in math, there always seem to be a few core standard arguments and lemmas that get repeatedly used to obtain many of the best-known results.

When approaching open problems in these areas, it often seems natural to try to try these methods to exhaustion. As these are open problems, such naive applications are almost inherently doomed to fail as they would have been discovered and published long before.


However, it usually leaves a nearly equally difficult problem of determining why such techniques don‚Äôt work‚Äîwhat I‚Äôm referring to as the ‚Äúmeta-theory‚Äù. 

Some examples of these ‚Äúmeta theory‚Äù arguments do include your classic peano or ZF independent statements, but they can also be more grounded in a particular approach. For instance one of the classic techniques for determining if a polynomial has nontrivial integer roots is to consider residues mod n (Hasse principle). However, the equation 3x^3+4y^3+5z^3=0 has solutions mod n for every n, but has no solutions in the integers.
Such a result shows that this elementary technique is fundamentally limited.

Another example in information theory is the existence of non-Shannon-type entropy inequalities. (entropy inequalities that can be derived solely from the non-negativity of mutual information.) 

I find these kinds of results very intriguing and yet very difficult to understand the full implications of. This is particularly because they can show that the current/basic techniques are not enough to solve certain problems. However, it they can sometimes be almost as challenging as the problems they are intended to help solve, as even formalizing what it really means to be (or not be) obtainable using a set of methods can be extremely difficult.

When mathematicians develop new tools to solve open problems, how well do they understand the limitations of the current techniques? I find it difficult to believe that people randomly stumble across new techniques without already having a pretty good sense of what a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù proof would have to look like, although im sure it happens rarely.

Does reasoning about the limitations of current techniques generally come before the creation of new ones?

math,Building Probabilistic Intuition and Working Towards Applied Knowledge of Random Flights and Rough Paths,"**Background**

I hold a B.S. in math and CS, and recently graduated with my M.S. in CS. My day job consists of writing code for monte carlo integration and importance sampling. 

I‚Äôm looking to continue some of my M.S. research in my spare time, and pursue some new directions that I didn‚Äôt have time to build the background for in grad school. This background lies specifically in the domain of short random walks, random flights, and the theory of rough paths. 

My (formal) experience consists of:

1. Undergraduate probability theory
2. First semester real analysis
3. The first half of Durrett‚Äôs *Essentials of Stochastic Processes*
4. Two graduate topics courses in probability theory, which very loosely followed Alon &amp; Spencer, Bollobas, and Winkler‚Äôs collections of puzzles. 

I stress that since I work on the applied side of things, I‚Äôm not looking to understand results in these domains well enough to prove them myself. So while I have my own understanding of things like the pushforward measure‚Äôs usage in my own contexts, I have not yet needed to truly understand or learn the definitions for a sigma algebra. 

**In summary**
1. Given my background, what resources should I use and how should I best approach learning about random flights and rough paths?
2. What other interesting resources are availible to further my intuition about probability, stochastic processes, and related domains?

math,Need advice regarding math (book recommendations + general advice),"I haven't been interested in studies for quite a while till now though I didn't used to be like this before . It's been more than five years since I haven't excelled in a subject as I used to. The truth is I didn't care much then (I was busy being distracted.) Well, now, I'm not- at least I think I'm not.

I liked math a lot back then simply because I was good at it(I think). Though I got perfect scores or near perfect scores, I stopped doing even the moderate amount of work later. Everything seemed to get boring and I really did not like the Math curriculum at all. I got an A for my GCSEs though(which I think that happened because I volunteered to help a friend and since I did volunteer, I had to learn the stuff myself before tutoring another). Even though I said the curriculum is boring and all, at the time I tutored, I really had a great time sharing the little knowledge I had, giving tips I didn't even know I knew of. It was like tutoring math gave me a purpose, it made me feel very alive and content with the very little I did.

There were times I got eighties or lesser then, lower than any time before. Sometimes when I was slipping off my grades, I'd just have this need out of nowhere the day before the test and I'd spend the night on math and get a 90 or 95 out of 100 again. I think I did it to prove myself something, to remind myself I'm not dumb - or I don't know. It was purely because of this little voice in my head that echoed 'never enough' and I wanted to scream back that I'm not. My way of doing that was math paper I guess. I want to try this time, truly try. Though I love math, at the moment I'm unable to study it for my A/Levels. 

Everyone around me says that I'll get all As and get into med school. They all want me to be a doctor. It's not that I don't like becoming one, it's that I love math more.  So, I thought I'd learn it as a hobby.

 And I want to have a fresh perspective toward the subject and truly enjoy every second of it. I'm used to people around me saying 'of course, she's smart, she'll definitely ace her A/levels', 'I know her, she's capable of doing much more'. I really don't like it when people have set their expectations high for me, I really do not like pressure. I want to study because I want to, because I enjoy it, not just to write an exam and get into med school. And the other thing is that even though people say that kind of things and I'm used to hearing them, I don't feel special at all. I think I'm very average actually. The friend I tutored, she said that I'm a lot better than her private math tutor(a degree holder) and made her enjoy learning it(which she stressed ""I used to think math and enjoy doesn't belong to the same sentence'). I don't want to brag about myself or anything, I am really glad I was able to help her(she has an A too). Is it normal to not feel special though people around you imply you are? And how to handle this type of pressure?

 Can someone please recommend me a list of books I need to have to self-study math from the very beginning or intermediate level to advanced? Though my foundation isn't so bad, I'd rather start it all again from zero if necessary. They don't need to be conventional textbooks (I'd more like it if they weren't), any book you really think that's worth reading is fine for me.

I'd be really grateful if someone can give me a list of all the books that are needed to learn math while enjoying it. I'm open to any advice you think I'll need too. Thank you so much for making it this far.",ELara1729,1h8xbgw,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h8xbgw/need_advice_regarding_math_book_recommendations/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h8xbgw/need_advice_regarding_math_book_recommendations/,2024-12-07 17:22:48,1,0.99,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h8xbgw
