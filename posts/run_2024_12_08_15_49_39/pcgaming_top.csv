pcgaming,"Ubisoft, Why Do Your Games Stop Working After a Year?","I’m done. I’m absolutely done with Ubisoft. Over the years, I’ve spent hundreds—probably thousands—of dollars on their games. I’ve built a library of some of their best franchises: *Assassin’s Creed*, *Far Cry*, *Watch Dogs*. These are games I *wanted* to love, games I poured hours of my life into. But what’s the point of owning them when they just stop working after a year?

Here’s what I’ve dealt with repeatedly:

* **Ubisoft Connect**: More like Ubisoft *Disconnect*. Every other update breaks something. Games that ran fine one day refuse to launch the next, and troubleshooting is like banging your head against a wall.
* **DRM Nonsense**: I’ve paid for these games—full price in most cases—and yet they can’t verify licenses? How does that even happen? Why do I feel like a pirate for trying to play games I legally own?
* **Servers, Servers, Servers**: Why does every Ubisoft game, even the single-player ones, seem to rely on servers? And when those servers inevitably go down or get shut off, good luck trying to access your progress or even start the game.
* **Updates That Break Everything**: Instead of fixing bugs, updates sometimes *add* new ones. Or they tank performance, making games unplayable. I shouldn’t have to *fear* clicking ""Update.""

And just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, in the past month alone, I’ve lost access to *Ghost Recon Breakpoint*, *For Honor*, and even *Battlefield 1* and *Battlefield 2042*. That’s FOUR games I can no longer launch no matter what I try. At this point, it feels like a ticking time bomb before the few games I still have that work also join the pile of dozens that don’t.

Speaking of Battlefield, let me throw EA into the mix, too. Their games are plagued by the *same* issues: DRM problems, launcher headaches, server reliance, and updates that break what didn’t need fixing. It feels like these companies are competing to see who can frustrate their customers more.

And what’s with the unnecessary third-party launchers? If I bought a game on Steam, I should be able to launch it *from Steam*. Why do I need Ubisoft Connect or EA Play or whatever other launcher shoved down my throat? It’s clunky, unreliable, and adds yet another layer of potential failure. Enough is enough!

It’s not just their old games, either. Ubisoft’s new games have been circling the drain in terms of quality. Remember when their titles felt groundbreaking and polished? Now it feels like every new release is rushed, bloated with microtransactions, or half-baked. They’re more focused on squeezing money out of players than creating games that work reliably or stand the test of time.

I’m tired of wasting my time, energy, and money trying to keep Ubisoft games functional. Gaming is supposed to be fun—not a second job where I’m troubleshooting errors or waiting on forums for a patch that may never come.

At this point, I’ve made up my mind: I’m not buying another Ubisoft or EA game. Not now, not ever. What’s the point of owning their games if I can’t trust them to work a year down the line? Why should I invest my money in companies that clearly don’t care about their customers once they’ve made the sale?

And I know I’m not alone in this.

* Have you had your games just stop working randomly?
* How do you deal with DRM, launcher issues, and server reliance?
* Do you feel like these companies are prioritizing cash grabs over long-term quality and support?

Honestly, Ubisoft (and EA), get your act together. You’re making incredible games—why are you ruining them with this garbage? You’re alienating loyal customers like me who actually *want* to support you.

I’m fed up, and I’d love to hear from others who’ve been through the same thing. Is it just me, or are these companies actively driving away their fanbase with these problems?

pcgaming,Bad optimization vs poor optimization the real reason.,"This is not asking for tech support or providing it, please don't auto delete this mods :-)



There's this age old argument of whether games are optimized well or not by developers and I think I have the simple answer that I don't see being talked about. It maybe so obvious that it doesn't need mentioning, but then again it may be so obvious that no one sees it.

Since the PS3/360 generation of gaming fidelity became more important to developers than fluidity and response time. If optimized well 30 frames per second (33.3ms) 6ft from your TV with a wireless controller could be satisfying and to those new to gaming that generation is was just normal. In the PS3/360 era, PC gaming was just a drop in the bucket of the market share too. Every generation there's a leap in fidelity potential and despite the demand for 60fps on consoles it was always an after thought until this generation. Now it's kind of a frustrating joke.

Because games are still being made with a render bandwidth of 33.3ms at the base level, that's where the majority of games start. For those who don't understand, developers know at 30fps they have 33.3ms to render a frame which is double the amount of time (bandwidth) to render 60fps (16.6ms.) So they design and optimize the game around the flexibility that 33.3ms provides. If a game like that sticks to a solid 30fps it is actually optimized well and functioning as intended.

But enter performance mode though... All modern performance modes are doing is trying to scale back the fidelity on a surface level usually just by cutting back on the resolution and level of detail. But with games full of lighting, Ray Tracing and effects based around using all 33.3ms of render time your CPU has available 60fps is just not possible for most CPUs.

Some games however are designed to run within a 16.6ms render time on console, usually less graphically intensive games. But sometimes we get standout games like the new Indiana Jones, CoD (I don't like CoD but it performs very well,) Hogwarts Legacy (had some PC issues at launch, but super optimized for a UE4 game,) Dragon Age 4, Helldivers 2, Evil West, Stellar Blade (proof will be in the PC launch,) and Resident Evil 4 Remake to name a few.

The list of games that run a 30fps well and not 60fps is much longer, but there's a few games that have issues that don't even stay at 30fps.

We also have the new standard emerging that is 40FPS/25ms which feels so much better than 30fps but not at good at 60fps. Maybe that's a new baseline we should hope for going forward? But it only works if you have a 120Hz display. But if they target 25ms render time it provides a potential Frame Interpolation (Frame Generation) target of 80fps/12.5ms which can feel like 60fps. I could live with that instead of being stuck at using FG to go from 30fps to 60fps on PC. But I'd prefer if developers would push the limits and figure out how to best utilize 60fps/16.6ms.

I believe poor optimization is when games crash and or can't hit their intended target framerate (which is rarely 60fps) and bad optimization is the unwillingness to give gamers what we've wanted for 3 console generations now which is 60fps. I honestly don't care about 4K, render to a super clean 1080p or 1440p and bilinearly upscale with the GPU - go play TLOU Remastered on a PS5 and tell me if you can really see a difference between performance or fidelity modes. Poor PC port though, that was just a botched/rushed job. But this 4K and faux 4K (FSR - looking at you) is stealing precious render time that could be spent making the game more stable.

Most games are well optimized they just have poor optimization limits.

pcgaming,is it common to lose interest in a game after completing the main storyline?,"I'm honestly new to playing modern AAA games, I used to watch gameplay videos a lot but now that I have somewhat of a proper rig to game on, I noticed that I lose interest in games after the main story. when the main story is still ongoing I do the side missions and stuff a lot, I like it then but once the story concludes I don't want to do the side missions anymore, maybe I feel like there are too many other good games to dive into to waste my time on side missions after the main game ends? Also, I feel a bit sad when the main story ends, which is of course a common thing for everyone when something they like comes to an end.

I recently played Arkham Knight and I haven't seen the knight fall protocol in action yet as I lost interest after the identity reveal. And I just finished Spiderman 1, it's 70 completed and now I'm downloading the Miles Morales one. I really liked the Spiderman game maybe even more so than Arkham Knight.
