webdev,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6sm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:46,2,1.0,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9l6sm
webdev,Do you know where i can find a solid Full Stack Pre-built Chat App? (next.js &amp; shadcn),"Hey everyone!
Iâ€™m working on a chat app built with Next.js/Supabase/Shadcn (Tailwind + Radix), and currently, the UI is built from scratch, using Supabase (with their websocket). 
It works, but Iâ€™m looking for something more solid in terms of both backend and frontend (logic and UI)

â€”FRONTENDâ€”
Iâ€™m searching for a library or package that:
- Provides a ready-to-use and robust UI for a chat app (paid options are totally fine).
- Handles common behaviors efficiently, like:
1. Fetching older messages while keeping the scroll position intact
2. Auto-scroll to the bottom when a new message arrives
3. Maybe even built-in gestures or animations to improve the UX.
- It's highly customizable, similar to shadcn: I want to copy/paste components into my project and have the freedom to tweak them directly, rather than being tied to a rigid external library.

â€”BACKENDâ€”
If it's already related to the package/library it would be great, otherwise if you have any valid alternative to the Supabase architecture with their websocket please let me know

Do you have any recommendations or experience with something like this?

I feel like I am losing my damn mind on this project. Im working off of some older, bloated code that has had so much scope creep it's turned into this monstrous ball of mud. I worked on a lot of the project, but the devs before me left some really weird design patterns and its garbage to work with. Not to mention, I'm integrating with some really old and crappy .net APIs that pretend to be REST but arent.

Every time I open my code editor to work on this project I feel like I suddenly get so sleepy and feel 0 motivation. If I try force myself to work on it and sift through the mess of code and functions I start to feel like Im going insane and want to have a full blown panic attack at what a mess everything is.
