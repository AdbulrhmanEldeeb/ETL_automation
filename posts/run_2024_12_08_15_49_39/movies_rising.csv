movies,"In The Count of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviezel, I believe that after so many lies from Fernand and Mercedes, I believed that at the end of the film, Edmond became a misanthrope.","The adaptation with Jim Caviziel appears to be an unintentional parody of the book.

The scene of French high society going to an unknown foreign nobleman's party and him descending from a balloon seemed like a parody of the book. French high society was closed off and the Count acting like a nouveau riche would bring the contempt of the French elite to him. The Count needed someone to open the doors of high society for him. This scene had a comedic tone like the Monty Python movies.

Albert is kidnapped by Luigi's gang and a stranger with a sword appears out of nowhere and saves him, giving a lame excuse when it was supposed to arouse suspicion that the kidnapping was set up.

And the mediocre revenges of the terrible 2002 film. The Count uses the treasure to attract Fernand and Danglars , but it is such an obvious trap that anyone would suspect it and not fall for the trick.

And the way the Count makes Villefort confess to his crime, what an amateur thing. An experienced man like Villefort would never confess his crime with such an amateur trick as the one in the 2002 film.

It would be much better if the Count hired Luigi Vampa 's gang to execute Danglars and Villefort like Michael Corleone executed Moe Greene, Tattaglia and Barzini in the Godfather . And he strangles Fernand like Clemenza strangled Carlo Rizzi . Contrary  the logic of the book to inflict prolonged suffering on his adversaries, but it would be a smarter way for the count to get rid of his enemies.

And Edmond reconciling with Mercedes was hilariously poorly written. She was married for years to the man who sent Edmond to a dungeon and you would think there would be a happy ending for them. She shows him a ring and Edmond starts crying saying something worthy of a comedy: “Don't steal my hate, it's all I have.”  Only in the movies do these absurdities happen. In a realistic situation, he would never forget that Mercedes was married to Fernand for years and had sex with him, while he rotted at the Château D' If . And he thinks that even if she claimed she was pregnant with his child, that would not erase or justify to Edmond Mercedes' marriage to Fernand. And worse, she lied and deceived. Wouldn't this help Edmond become a misanthrope like Gullinver ? Even the woman he loved proved to be an untrustworthy person.The couple reconciles and there is no resentment on Edmond's part for his former fiancée marrying Fernand or for having lied or deceived. And Albert discovers that he is the count's son and everything is fine, no trauma or questioning on Mercedes' part.

I thought that in the end, Edmond, tired of all the lies and deceit he had lived, would become a misanthrope like Gullinver . After all, the people close to him had proven to be untrustworthy. He would start to avoid human presence. Gullinver at the end of the book avoids the presence of his family In Livor, Mercedes was an honorable woman and that is why Edmond respected her.",cleopatraandcaesar63,1h9kgw4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,2024-12-08 14:53:16,0,0.29,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h9kgw4

movies,"How much do you think James Bond entering the public domain, will change his movies going forward?","In 2035, all of Ian Fleming's original James Bond 007 novels, will enter the public domain. This means that anyone can make projects about these original books, including film adaptations. We've already seen non-Eon Productions Bond films in the past with Casino Royale 1967, and Never Say Never Again, but this will be a whole different ball game. 

There are of course restrictions, like studios not being able to use anything made up for the movies, like the iconic opening gun barrel sequence. 

But what do you think? With Eon notoriously prioritizing other projects like Othello over the highly anticipated Bond 26, could it be a good thing that other studios will get a crack at Bond?

movies,"""Hammering the door shut"" in The Hateful Eight is one of my all time favorite bits in any movie. Any other movies with comedic bits as a side story that get more ridiculous as the movies goes on?","Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.

It just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying ""jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore"" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. 

Of course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic.

movies,Should long movies have intermissions?,"I recently watched Wicked. It's a great movie, check it out if you got the time. But it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. A 10-minute intermission would be cool. It would allow the audience to get up, get some more popcorn, and use the washroom. That being said; not all movies need one. If the movie is just 90 minutes long, an intermission would not make any sense. So only movies that are longer than 120 minutes (might) need one.

movies,Equalizer 3,"So I put Equalizer 3 on last night. I watched the two first movies some time ago and honestly can't remember much from them other than I kind of enjoyed Denzel using wits to make life miserable for some bad guys. Classic action stuff.

The third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.

Some ups and downs:
+Denzel glooming
+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again
+Nice location
-Boring villain
-Slow pacing
-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie

I came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him. He then negotiated that number down to three and this movie is the result.",MrIzeMan,1h9h99e,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9h99e/equalizer_3/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9h99e/equalizer_3/,2024-12-08 11:51:32,31,0.79,31,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h9h99e

I feel like a lot of the criticism of his ability comes from people who have only seen Morbius and Suicide Squad

But it’s well known that he seems like a huge pain in the ass. His method thing seems really annoying for his costars, and also just wastes a lot of time. Leto seems to have a lot of confidence in his formula, not realizing most of the roles that made him famous were just relatively normal dudes. Now he wants to prove himself as some kind of “eccentric method genius!”

After a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven’t been very successful recently.

Also, I know David Ayer seemed to like his weird process, which I suppose makes sense considering Ayer got along with Shia Labeouf very well. However, what I find funny is when you look at the behind the scenes for the Suicide Squad, the cast seemed legitimately very close.
