webdev,Grey vs Gray,"Just curious what developers prefer the spelling of Grey vs Gray.  
I know this is very mundane, but when creating class names, I keep struggling with \`grey\` vs \`gray\`. I have noticed that other frameworks are also mix matched. I know that the U.S. prefers \`gray\` and the rest prefers \`grey\`, but from a pure developer perspective, what do you prefer and think is most common in the developer realm. There are also others that use something like \`muted\`, etc, but I prefer to be more specific about the name of the color.  


Thanks,

webdev,Do you know where i can find a solid Full Stack Pre-built Chat App? (next.js &amp; shadcn),"Hey everyone!
I’m working on a chat app built with Next.js/Supabase/Shadcn (Tailwind + Radix), and currently, the UI is built from scratch, using Supabase (with their websocket). 
It works, but I’m looking for something more solid in terms of both backend and frontend (logic and UI)

—FRONTEND—
I’m searching for a library or package that:
- Provides a ready-to-use and robust UI for a chat app (paid options are totally fine).
- Handles common behaviors efficiently, like:
1. Fetching older messages while keeping the scroll position intact
2. Auto-scroll to the bottom when a new message arrives
3. Maybe even built-in gestures or animations to improve the UX.
- It's highly customizable, similar to shadcn: I want to copy/paste components into my project and have the freedom to tweak them directly, rather than being tied to a rigid external library.

—BACKEND—
If it's already related to the package/library it would be great, otherwise if you have any valid alternative to the Supabase architecture with their websocket please let me know

Do you have any recommendations or experience with something like this?

I'm a high school student and a newbie full-stack developer working on building a website. Right now, my approach for modals is to define them in the HTML and then feed them values dynamically from my JavaScript when needed.

Whats the best practice here? Should I stick with my current method, or would switching to dynamically generating modals with JavaScript be a better choice?

webdev,Best Tech Stack for Engineering Notes/Pages with Equations and Graphs?,"Hey all,  
I’m looking to build a website focused on engineering content, with lots of notes, equations, and visual content (graphs/images). My goal is to make navigation between pages *super fast*.

# My Experience

* I’ve worked with static and dynamic site generators like Astro.js, Gatsby, and Next.js.
* I’ve built single- and a few-page websites before but nothing too big yet.

# What I’m Thinking

* **Content Type:** The site will have lots of equations (thinking LaTeX in Markdown for simplicity and readability) and visual content like graphs and images.
* **Speed:** Priority is speed, especially when loading pages.
* **Approach:** Considering Astro.js for a fully static site to keep things fast, but I’m open to suggestions.

# Questions:

1. Is LaTeX rendered in Markdown a good approach for displaying equations? Any better options?
2. For images and graphs, what’s the most efficient way to handle them while keeping performance in mind (e.g., CDN, image formats like WebP)?
3. Should I consider other frameworks or approaches besides Astro.js for this use case?

Would love any advice or insights from people who’ve worked on similar projects!

Thanks in advance!

webdev,The Google Calendar API is getting on my nerves...,"So I use ClickUp as my task management tool and Google Calendar to organize my day. I wanted to view all my daily tasks on my calendar and the inbuilt GCal integration that comes with ClickUp is buggy. So, being a developer I decided to put my skills to use.

I wrote a script that fetches all my open tasks from ClickUp that have a start date or a due date. It then fetches all my existing events from GCal. All the tasks fetched from ClickUp are created as events on GCal. The previously fetched events from GCal are all then deleted. This runs as a CRON every one hour on AWS Lambda (once an hour to stay within the free tier of AWS, ClickUp and Google APIs)

This runs flawlessly for a few hours after which the Google Calendar API that fetches all events from the calendar starts returning 0 events even though I have existing events on the calendar. As a result, older tasks don't get deleted from the calendar and I now have more than 20 duplicates of each task on my calendar.

Weirdly enough, if I delete the calendar and create a new one and pass the new calendar ID it again starts working flawlessly. This lasts for a few hours after which the same thing starts happening again. The Google Calendar API starts returning 0 events even though there are existing events.

Let's start with Chat GPT and other chat bots that are separated from local data, is the code produced by these bots yours or theirs? Who owns the copyright? If it's theirs can you make enough changes to now own the code?

When it comes to AI integrated into an editor like VS Code, it says in on the VS Code website that your data (i.e your code) will be sent to Microsoft for them to feed into their model. I guess they have to do that to make it work at all, but again what is going on with copyright and security here? Do Microsoft now have access to your entire codebase, API tokens etc and do you have full ownership of the code it helps you write? This seems like a huge level of trust for a commercial non-partner operation to agree to, not to mention obvious security issues.

Are there any local AI models used by code editors that don't send your code to the likes of Microsoft?

I feel like I am losing my damn mind on this project. Im working off of some older, bloated code that has had so much scope creep it's turned into this monstrous ball of mud. I worked on a lot of the project, but the devs before me left some really weird design patterns and its garbage to work with. Not to mention, I'm integrating with some really old and crappy .net APIs that pretend to be REST but arent.

Every time I open my code editor to work on this project I feel like I suddenly get so sleepy and feel 0 motivation. If I try force myself to work on it and sift through the mess of code and functions I start to feel like Im going insane and want to have a full blown panic attack at what a mess everything is.

webdev,Consulting on a web dev niche technology vs overall web dev services?,"Hi all,

I am in the process of spinning up my own consulting / development shop and I am stumped on one thing and I would appreciate some advice from the group...

Should I focus my consultancy on the niche technology that I know very well (MyNicheTechConsulting.com) and only do work in that tech / framework, or should I broaden out to do whatever people need and will pay me for?

There is a part of me that thinks that focusing on the niche will pay off down the road, and that doing overall tech consulting will find me building wordpress sites for people, competing against every other firm on the planet.

That said, I hate to leave money on the table and if a potential customer needs X, Y, or Z I should be willing to provide X, Y, and Z.

I am asking this question mostly in the context of what services do I list that I offer on my website. I CAN do X, Z, or Z but part of me thinks 'marketing specialization"" on the website would pay off in the long term.

webdev,Tracking order section in a wordpress website ? ,"I am creating a website using WordPress. Basically as for now, the website is free and I am also using WooCommerce in the website. I am not a web developer. I don't have much knowledge. I am just building a website through WordPress and WooCommerce with the basic knowledge im getting through tutorials from here and there.

So my question is that I want to add a tracking service to my website. I am not sure of which delivery service will be used later. The question is that if I add a tracking order section into my website and the section includes the customer to add a tracking ID or whatever tracking data that the user enters, is it supposed to lead to the delivery service's own platform on which they can track the order? Is there any coding or plugins involved in such a thing if I want to include it into my website?
Or how does this whole process of creating such a tracking section goes on about? Any help would be really appreciated since I have zero knowledge about web development as a whole. :)

webdev,"Help! P2P Video Call App with React, Express, and Socket.io - Remote Stream Not Working","Hi all,

I'm building a P2P video call app using React, Express, and Socket.io. I've gone through several articles and tutorials, and I believe my setup is close to working, but I'm running into an issue. Everything seems to be functioning well, but I'm not receiving the remote video stream. There are no errors in the console, but the remote video doesn't display.

# Setup:

* **React** on the frontend for UI and WebRTC implementation.
* **Express** and **SocketIO** on the backend to handle signaling and peer connections.
* **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication (using STUN server for ICE).

# Logs:

From the server logs, I see that the peer IDs are being set successfully, and messages are being passed between peers.

Logs from Server: 

    [2024-12-08T08:34:19.378Z] Received message of type 'setPeerId' from Ub0_7yT_57X6Ngd7AAAS

    [2024-12-08T08:34:23.419Z] Received message of type 'candidate' from two_2x42mksyr6v

As you can see, the peers are getting connected correctly, but the remote video stream isn't showing up on the client-side.

# Steps I've Tried:

* Ensured that the remote video element is being updated with the incoming stream.
* Checked that the RTC connection is correctly handling the tracks.
* Verified that the signaling messages (offer, answer, and candidates) are being sent and received properly.

# My Question:

Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this issue? Why isn’t the remote video stream displaying, and what could I be missing in the WebRTC setup?

Any help is appreciated!

webdev,Suggestions for developing a simple interactable line graph front end for an econometric model,"Hi I'm a total noob when it comes to web dev but I'm pretty technically savvy and can devote time to self teach. I have an econometrics model which I developed in R that queries Google Trends at a daily interval and then produces an output value using this data. I want to build a simple attractive web front end to display the output of this model in a line graph, that has some basic interactivity (change timespan, zoom in / out, mouse over line to see data value etc.). 

My needs aren't very esoteric / complex, so the simplest tool for the job would be great. What is the best way to do this for someone who is a bit of a web dev noob? I've looked at streamlit and shiny but I'm not sure if these would be the right tools for the job. The model is not very computationally expensive so can run on basically anything and requires very little storage. It would be a bonus if I could run it in some sort of containerisation system like Docker for portability. I'd appreciate any help!

webdev,Is my text too hard to read? Personal blog website,"Looking for feedback from people, I built a personal blog page and was wondering if my text is too hard to read?

Talking about this site of mine, the contents of the blog posts: [https://bryanhogan.com/blog](https://bryanhogan.com/blog)

I know that there are some optimizations that I could do to improve readability, but do people actually notice that? Like:  

- Reduce font weight - Often white text on black background has a perceived stronger font weight than black text on a white background.
- Allow for a light and dark mode toggle. (Dark and light mode toggle definitely would help some people, but how many, is it worth the time implementing it?)
- Reduce brightness of text - Text too bright on a dark background may be harder to read.

Do you think these changes could actually help here?

webdev,Looking for feedback! - Making (grant) expense tracking less painful,"**LINK:** [**https://grantkeeper.com/**](https://grantkeeper.com/)

Hey everyone 👋

After struggling with spreadsheets and scattered receipts while reporting to funders (mainly Innovate UK), I built GrantKeeper - a simple tool to help UK organisations manage their grant expenses and reporting.

It lets you:

* Upload and organize receipts/invoices
* Automated data extraction
* Track expenses and automatically handle currency conversion
* Export Excel with all your data and files
* Collaborate with team members on financial reporting

**Screenshots**: [https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png](https://i.imgur.com/HVcPsNb.png) / [https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png](https://i.imgur.com/odeqJUq.png)

I've already worked with others receiving grants and it's turned a task which typically takes weeks into hours (and I want to make it better!)

I'm curious how others currently handle their expense tracking? Are you using spreadsheets, accounting software, or some other solution? Have you tried other specialised tools, and if so, what was your experience?

I know similar stuff exists, but in this case I've decided to start by targeting a niche before thinking about expanding it for more general use cases.

webdev,Feedback wanted,"Hey everyone! 

I’ve been working on a fun project called [whothatpokemon.com](https://whothatpokemon.com) which is just a browser based game inspired by the iconic “Who’s That Pokémon?” challenge. I mainly built it as I'm looking to eventually teach others how to code and wanted a project that can be enjoyable to build. I know this has been done before in this community and I've added my own sort of twist to it. You can compete against friends online to see who can guess the most correctly. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes (currently limited to 1 on 1 matches).

I’d love to get your feedback on any of these areas:

* Gameplay: Is it fun and engaging? Is it too easy? I let my cousin who is a Pokémon fanatic a try and had to take the phone away from him because he was guessing them all too easily lol.
* Design: I tried to keep this area as cleaned up as possible but I'm also not a designer so it was a bit hard to be creative in this aspect.
* Features: What could make it better or more exciting?
* Bugs: If you run into anything that's not supposed to happen, please let me know. It also hasn't had any users yet since this is the first time mentioning it, so I was hoping this could be some sort of stress test as well.

  
I’m open to any ideas to improve the game or even expand on it (like leaderboards, new modes, or generation specific challenges).

If you do have some spare time please check it out, and let me know what you think. I’d really appreciate your input as I work on making it better.

webdev,Meet CSSformalize: Simplify Your Form Styling Workflow,"Hi [r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)!

Styling HTML forms can often feel like navigating a minefield. Achieving consistency across various states—such as active or focus—requires meticulous attention to detail. It's all too easy to miss a crucial style or struggle with the myriad of browser-specific prefixes like -webkit- or -moz-. This complexity can turn what should be a straightforward task into a tedious chore. Recognizing these challenges, I was motivated to create a solution that streamlines the entire process.

Thus, CSSformalize was born—a comprehensive open-source CSS framework designed to transform the way native HTML forms are styled. By leveraging CSSformalize, developers can effortlessly generate elegant and consistent form elements. This framework eliminates the need to memorize complex styles or write repetitive CSS code, offering a much-needed shortcut for both seasoned developers and newcomers alike.

I installed my SSL certificate (Wildcard) on the VPS server, but I can still only display/access the pictures via http, which is not allowed (mixed content).

In an effort to also assign the SSL certificate to the subdomain I included the subdomain in the config file likethis:

server {

listen 443 ssl;

server\_name  [domain.com](http://domain.com) [subdomain.com](http://subdomain.com);



ssl\_certificate /etc/ssl/\[\].cer

ssl\_certificate\_key /etc/ssl/\[\].key





location / {

proxy\_pass http://localhost:3000;

proxy\_http\_version 1.1;

proxy\_set\_header Upgrade $http\_upgrade;

proxy\_set\_header Connection 'upgrade';

proxy\_set\_header Host $host;

proxy\_cache\_bypass $http\_upgrade;

}

}



Sorry for this question, but I just reinstalled the whole server and still face the issue. It used to work for one week but now the pictures are no longer displayed with the links in my .tsx code ""https""",trashyboner,1h8uotg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h8uotg/question_how_to_make_my_ionos_web_service/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h8uotg/question_how_to_make_my_ionos_web_service/,2024-12-07 15:22:06,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8uotg
