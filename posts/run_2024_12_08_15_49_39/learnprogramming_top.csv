learnprogramming,Is the programming dream a harsher reality?,"TLDR: did your enthusiasm for coding die or fade once you got employment, or did you find the same joy as when you were doing more independent learning challenges?

I started doing the Angela Yu‚Äôs 100 Days of Python course. And I absolutely love it. I made the blackjack challenge without searching for any of my code just of what I learnt previously and it was such a cool feeling. (First small project in that course)

I‚Äôm trying to get back into it, now with a more focused approach of getting a job as a goal and learning enough to do some pretty cool projects ideas I have. But I‚Äôm scared what if I spend this 1-2 years of the young part of my life (I‚Äôm 23). What if it‚Äôs not at all like what I‚Äôve been enjoying, to actually work as a developer. What if I just hate the actual corporate job side of it. 

Right now I love the challenge of coding and visualizing how everything works. The building blocks you need to place to connect it all in your head. I love the thought process of this. I‚Äôm just scared that it‚Äôs not going to be all that in terms of work. And that I‚Äôll be left thinking ‚Äúoh well now I learnt all this and now I‚Äôm getting a good salary I can‚Äôt just leave this‚Äù.

I guess what I‚Äôm hoping for is that I keep thinking it‚Äôs a fun puzzle and that I keep enjoying it. What I‚Äôm scared of is becoming miserable and hating my job. Should I just try my entrepreneurial ideas instead? Or should I pursue this which I feel is more tangible.

learnprogramming,Why isn't my code unzipping the file given by the user? ,"I am writing a batch file that encrypts/compresses and unencrypts/decompresses a file. When the user chooses to unencrypt/decompress, the program does unencrypt it, but it does not decompress it, and I cannot figure out why.

Here is the section in question:

    SET /P FILEPATH=Please enter entire filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt: 
    ECHO 
    SET /P UNENCRYPTED=Please enter filepath of the file you wish to decompress and unencrypt, but without the final extension. For example, filepath.backup.zip.aes becomes filepath.backup.zip:
    
    aescrypt.exe -d %FILEPATH%
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET FILE_PATH=%%~dpF
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET FILENAME=%%~nxF
    cd %FILE_PATH%

I tried first to strip filename.backup.zip.aes of its last extension so I could unzip that by doing this:

    FOR %%F IN (%FILENAME%) DO SET UNENCRYPTED=%%~dpnF
    TAR -xf %UNENCRYPTED%
    

Then I tried to unzip that, but it didn't work.

After that I tried taking the .zip extension off of UNENCRYPTED and putting it back on in the tar command like this:

    FOR %%F IN (%FILENAME%) DO SET UNENCRYPTED=%%~dpnF
    FOR %%F IN (%UNENCRYPTED%) DO SET NOEXTENSION=%%~dpnF
    TAR -xf %NOEXTENSION%.zip

learnprogramming,Using an IDE to learn C++,"When the question ""How to learn C++?"" shows up online, one of the top answers always seems to be something along the lines of ""get an IDE"" or ""download MS Visual Studio"".

VS was used in the college course that I followed when learning C++ and I'm relatively sure it slowed down my learning process by years. Specifying include search paths, libraries and their directories, compile options, etc. seemed all like black magic that you have to enter in the right menus.

The right way seems glaringly obvious now... To learn C++, use Linux (or WSL on Windows) and whatever combination of compiler and editor, e.g. gcc + nano.

At least during the first few weeks (or months) when learning about the basic syntax, header files, oop, templates and the STL, compile your code manually. Look at what the preprocessor produces, maybe even take a look at the created Assembly, run the linker manually. Once this gets too repetitive, switch to CMake to automate those building tasks.

Then later, If you apply for a job at a place that uses a specific IDE, take a week to get familiar with it.

I'm not sure if this system is good; the problem is that this site will be public (rightly so), I would need a sort of protected virtual archive directly connected to the website page where it is possible to put and extrapolate the files (which on the page will appear as audio in scalar order while in the archive the files will be divided into folders and subfolders based on the name of the user and the file so as to make the collection and storage of files more orderly and efficient).  
So my questions are:  
Is there a better way I can use the database to point to folders or some other better way to store files? If my system is otherwise acceptable, could you tell me about a virtual archive service that can do what I requested?

learnprogramming,"Trying to run LASSO ML in R to find important predictor variables, but imputation won't work??","Hey everyone. I'm basically working in R with a big dataset with about 8500 observations and 1900 variables. This is a combination of several datasets and has lots of missingness. I'm trying to run lasso to get r to tell me what the best predictor variables for a certain outcome variable are. The problem is, I'm first trying to impute my data because I keep getting this error (after the #impute missing data line):

Can anyone tell me how to solve this? Chatgpt was telling me I needed to remove variables that have too much collinearity and/or no variance, but I don't see why that's an issue in the imputation step? It might be worth mentioning, in my code I haven't explicitly done anything to make sure the binary dependent variable is not imputed (which, I don't want it to be, I only want to run lasso on variables for which the dependent variable actually exists), nor have I removed identifier variables (do I have to?) the code below is what I've been using. Does anyone have any tips on how to get this running?? Thanks.

I only know the basics of C and python and I cannot find the solution to such questions with my limited knowledge of loops, arrays, conditional statements, recursion, etc., especially on a time limit ( I'd need a day to solve there on my own LOL ) here's a sample question to explain what I'm referring to:



&gt;Problem Description:

You have a restaurant at a beachside which has N dining tables. Each dining table has only one chair so each table can accommodate only one person. These dining tables are along a straight line parallel to the beach at positions x1 ,...,xN.

C customers are currently queued up outside the restaurant since you have reopened the restaurant after a long time due to the pandemic. You need to assign the dining tables to the customers such that the minimum distance between any two customers is as large as possible in order to take care of the precautions considering the current pandemic situation. (Consider all C customers dine at the same time)

Find the largest minimum distance possible.


&gt;Input Description:

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ‚â§ t ‚â§ 10) - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N (2 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 100000) and c (2 ‚â§ C ‚â§ N).
The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ‚â§ Xi ‚â§ 1000000000) - The elements of the array W.


&gt;Output Description:

For each test case, print the answer: The largest minimum distance.

I am currently using a BluRay Disc Creator program. Unfortunately, there are very limited customization features in this software for what I am looking to do. Thankfully, there are THEME folders that allow further customization by changing the replacing the preset images. I contacted the developers of the software and they have been able to help me with some small things (adjusting resolution / sizes for the software to accept), but there are some issues they said they can't resolve for some reason. They created a variation of one of the THEME folders for me that included a XML file and a DAT file. Normally there is just a DAT file that is gibberish and can't edit. I believe the developer made a mistake and forgot to delete the XML file after they converted it to DAT format for the software to read. The XML file contains lots of additional styling info that I should be able to tinker with. I asked the developer if they could tell me how to convert the XML file to the DAT file after I have changed some styling options. Unfortunately, they declined saying they do not want people to tinker with that kind of file. I already have the XML file that I can edit and the DAT file that shows gibberish that it was converted from.  
Couldn't I use the DAT file to translate the XML file and vice versa?

\^That's the command itself. As for what's going on...

Context:

I'm making a game where text characters are used for graphics- you play as a capital X, there's an enemy capital M to avoid, periods are used to mark empty spaces and the command above is my attempt at getting the game to recognize walls (marked with #).

    title M-Quest (test bench ver.)
    set x=2
    set y=2
    REM ^Them thar be the player coordinates. X and Y values on a grid, simple as.
    REM Disclaimer, the grid for this demo is only 2x2 spaces. The version I'm working on is 10x10. In the code below, you'll notice I have individual ""set"" commands for each pair of coordinates rather than using two ""for"" commands. Don't ask me why it runs faster this way, it just does. Trust me, I ain't happy about it either, since it makes expanding the game grid a pain. For a 2x2 grid, I only gotta set 4 variables. For 10x10, that's 100 variables that need individually set in three places- :roomGen, :screenSet, and :screen. Apologies, but limiting your play area in this demo ver saves me 288 very boring lines of code, and makes finding the VERY IMPORTANT comments coming up way friggin' easier.

    :roomGen

    set rx1,ry2=.
    set rx2,ry1=.
    set rx2,ry2=.

    :screenSet

    set sx1,sy2=%rx1,ry1%
    set sx2,sy1=%rx1,ry1%

    REM Behold, you can see now! Note that one of the SCREEN variables gets changed- the one you're at- but the reference variables aren't touched. When you move, :screen will only show you where you currently are, but it will NOT reset the screen variables to what they should be when you're not atop of them. Without :screenSet, moving from x1,y2 to x2,y2 would cause BOTH of those screen variables to display on the screen as an X, since sx1,sy1 was never reset. TLDR, :screenSet exists to clear the screen, :roomGen exists to tell :screenSet what a clear screen even looks like, and :screen exists to draw the screen. Note that the reference values in roomGen aren't for show- changing those changes what the room actually is. If you wanted to add walls, NPCs, or items, you'd change the corresponding reference value in :roomGen to make that happen.

    :collision
    REM The game gets here just fine.
    if !rx%x%,ry%y%! EQU # goto backup
    REM A pause command inserted here will never be executed- the game window has already closed.
    goto screenSet
    :backup
    REM A pause command inserted here will never be executed- the game window has already closed.
    set /a %backAxis%=!%backAxis%!!%backWay%!1
    REM Oddly enough, this command (when placed in :screen for testing, prior to the creation of :collision) worked perfectly fine. Whichever way you went, you would correctly go the opposite direction every time the screen refreshed until new values for backAxis and backWay were set.
    goto screenSet

Anyhow, if you'll excuse me, I deleted what I *thought* was the OneDrive backup of this game from what I *thought* was OneDrive... and turned out to be my actual, on-PC documents folder.

And then Notepad live updated, clearing all text from the entire program at once. Worst part is I've gotten in the habit of shift+deleting files which means no recycle bin backup, and what I've covered in this demo doesn't include save file creation for each room, entering into new rooms, monster behavior, or basically half the rest of the game... so I gotta get to re-writing that now. Thanks in advance!

learnprogramming,Applying as a Canadian in the USA,I was wondering as a canadian applying to the USA for jobs when it asks if I'm legally authorized to work should I say yes or no. Because Candians can get a TN visa which is not the same as an H1 visa which all I have to do is show the offer letter at the border. ,legend67521,1h939ks,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h939ks/applying_as_a_canadian_in_the_usa/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h939ks/applying_as_a_canadian_in_the_usa/,2024-12-07 21:54:09,0,0.33,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h939ks
learnprogramming,Chat GPT Pro ,"Has anybody bought Chat GPT Pro? I already own Chat GPT Plus, but I was thinking of buying it to learn harder concepts regarding functional programming for exams, whether that be walking me through tougher topics or providing exam-type questions that just can't be readily available online. I just wanted to get somebody's thoughts on whether it's worth the upgrade before purchasing.",Stunning_Muffin6557,1h97y4g,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h97y4g/chat_gpt_pro/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h97y4g/chat_gpt_pro/,2024-12-08 01:45:52,0,0.3,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h97y4g
