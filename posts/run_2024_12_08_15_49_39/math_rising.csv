math,Is quadratic factorisation possible for matrices?,"I have a square matrix A such that A^2 +A-2I=0
Can I turn the expression into (A-I)(A+2I)=0?

And if so why? I understand that does not mean that A=I, A=-2I, but why does the factorisation work? After all even in square matrices it is not necessarily true that AB=BA so how can different multiplication from the left or right lead to the same correct result?",ProblamBeMe,1h9h3zk,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h9h3zk/is_quadratic_factorisation_possible_for_matrices/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1h9h3zk/is_quadratic_factorisation_possible_for_matrices/,2024-12-08 11:41:09,22,0.79,22,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1h9h3zk

math,I am so burned out and I don't know why :( I worry that I've lost my passion for math ,"* I am a senior and I am only taking one math course right now. It's just a numerical linear algebra course.
* I have really not liked this course and I feel no desire to study for it. I don't understand why I feel so blah. The material is quite important and useful, but I think the material isn't particularly well-motivated, especially given that every method has been developed to solve a practical problem.
   * For example, I guess when we talk about Krylov subspace techniques, we could mention the motivation of projection methods is to efficiently solve very large sparse systems arising from finite element method.
* I don't understand why I feel so bored and unmotivated. I think it may have to do with the teaching structure, as my instructor was absent for several lectures and has been quite busy this semester. I felt really quite frustrated as I have other courses during office hours and the instructor was only able to meet during office hours, but I guess this is on par for the course for a graduate course.
* Normally I am quite happy to study in whatever spare time I have, but I feel like I've lost my passion and I struggle to want to study.
* I am constantly confused, also, and I am doing poorly in the course. It's a graduate course and I currently have a B; to me, that indicates a deficiency in my effort level and / or my understanding. Maybe my linear algebra background is too weak.

This semester, I applied to graduate school and I've been working on research projects, hence my mind was elsewhere for much of the semester. But I feel so frustrated and I am scared that I've lost my passion for math.

I'm taking a graduate course in analysis next semester because I'm interested in statistics. I really really care about understanding the concepts from this course.

math,Math became my unexpected escape from life,"I‚Äôve always been fascinated by math, even as a kid in elementary school. Back then, I thought I liked it simply because I was good at it. I never really considered math as something I‚Äôd study seriously in university or as a particularly ‚Äúuseful‚Äù pursuit‚Äîit was just there.

Long story short, I ended up pursuing the path to medicine. But often problems would get stuck in my mind, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to shake them off.

Then came linear algebra. I took it as an elective, and it was my first real exposure to proof-based math. Honestly, I struggled with the proofs a lot, but something unexpected happened. After the course ended, I realized how much happier I was during that semester. Math had completely occupied my mind‚Äîthere wasn‚Äôt room for other worries to creep in. That struggle, that focus, made my brain feel calmer.

Now, I‚Äôve decided to make math my ‚Äúside quest‚Äù alongside medicine, and I feel incredibly satisfied about it. These days, I carry an abstract math book with me almost everywhere. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I‚Äôll open it, read a few pages, and immerse myself in it. It‚Äôs like a reset button for my mind.

Currently, I‚Äôm enjoying a book on Galois Theory, and it‚Äôs been amazing  so far. I just wanted to share this experience and see if anyone else can relate. Do you also find joy in math as a way to calm your mind and bring clarity to your life?

math,Learning to find good definitions,"Hello,

I have been studying analysis and wondered what a good generalized definition of boundedness in reals would be for metric spaces. I thought: ""a matric space X is bounded if there is a fixed point x such that d(x,p) &lt; M for all points p in X"".

math,How large is union of all prime ideals in a given ring?,"Hey mathmagicians, I‚Äôm not sure how to ask this question in a short title so apologies for that

Basically take an arbitrary ring R, then let A be the union of all possible prime ideals in the ring. I know that A isn‚Äôt necessarily an ideal itself but I don‚Äôt really care about that right now. I‚Äôm just curious, are we always guaranteed that A will contain a ‚Äòlarge‚Äô amount of R?

The example I‚Äôm thinking of is the reason for my intuition; take R=Z then all prime ideals are just ideals generated by prime integers. The union of all prime ideals contains every integer except 1 and -1.

If you‚Äôre curious why I want to know, I was trying to look into the following; Let A be a ring and let Spec(A) be the Zariski topology on A, will a non-empty open set (Zariski topology defines sets as closed) always contain 1?

math,Brent's Method algorithm,"Hello, I'm trying to find some source code as to how Brent's method is actually run in some packages in R or Python and I'm unable to get any results. It's very unclear to me the exact conditions for how the algorithm decides to switch from IQI to secant method, lots of sources just say ""if the IQI isn't good enough"", and I have seen some bounds that are conditions but I can't seem to find a definitive source for what's happening. On wikipedia it seems like you would only go to secant if a = c or b = c but then you'd only ever be doing secant for the first step right? Their example doesn't seem to line up with that. Some sources say to start with secant and others to start with bisection given 2 initial guesses, so I'd really just like to see some source code for how this method is done.
