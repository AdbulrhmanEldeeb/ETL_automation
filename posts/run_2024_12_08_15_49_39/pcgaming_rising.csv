pcgaming,"Ubisoft, Why Do Your Games Stop Working After a Year?","I’m done. I’m absolutely done with Ubisoft. Over the years, I’ve spent hundreds—probably thousands—of dollars on their games. I’ve built a library of some of their best franchises: *Assassin’s Creed*, *Far Cry*, *Watch Dogs*. These are games I *wanted* to love, games I poured hours of my life into. But what’s the point of owning them when they just stop working after a year?

Here’s what I’ve dealt with repeatedly:

* **Ubisoft Connect**: More like Ubisoft *Disconnect*. Every other update breaks something. Games that ran fine one day refuse to launch the next, and troubleshooting is like banging your head against a wall.
* **DRM Nonsense**: I’ve paid for these games—full price in most cases—and yet they can’t verify licenses? How does that even happen? Why do I feel like a pirate for trying to play games I legally own?
* **Servers, Servers, Servers**: Why does every Ubisoft game, even the single-player ones, seem to rely on servers? And when those servers inevitably go down or get shut off, good luck trying to access your progress or even start the game.
* **Updates That Break Everything**: Instead of fixing bugs, updates sometimes *add* new ones. Or they tank performance, making games unplayable. I shouldn’t have to *fear* clicking ""Update.""

And just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, in the past month alone, I’ve lost access to *Ghost Recon Breakpoint*, *For Honor*, and even *Battlefield 1* and *Battlefield 2042*. That’s FOUR games I can no longer launch no matter what I try. At this point, it feels like a ticking time bomb before the few games I still have that work also join the pile of dozens that don’t.

Speaking of Battlefield, let me throw EA into the mix, too. Their games are plagued by the *same* issues: DRM problems, launcher headaches, server reliance, and updates that break what didn’t need fixing. It feels like these companies are competing to see who can frustrate their customers more.

And what’s with the unnecessary third-party launchers? If I bought a game on Steam, I should be able to launch it *from Steam*. Why do I need Ubisoft Connect or EA Play or whatever other launcher shoved down my throat? It’s clunky, unreliable, and adds yet another layer of potential failure. Enough is enough!

It’s not just their old games, either. Ubisoft’s new games have been circling the drain in terms of quality. Remember when their titles felt groundbreaking and polished? Now it feels like every new release is rushed, bloated with microtransactions, or half-baked. They’re more focused on squeezing money out of players than creating games that work reliably or stand the test of time.

I’m tired of wasting my time, energy, and money trying to keep Ubisoft games functional. Gaming is supposed to be fun—not a second job where I’m troubleshooting errors or waiting on forums for a patch that may never come.

At this point, I’ve made up my mind: I’m not buying another Ubisoft or EA game. Not now, not ever. What’s the point of owning their games if I can’t trust them to work a year down the line? Why should I invest my money in companies that clearly don’t care about their customers once they’ve made the sale?

And I know I’m not alone in this.

* Have you had your games just stop working randomly?
* How do you deal with DRM, launcher issues, and server reliance?
* Do you feel like these companies are prioritizing cash grabs over long-term quality and support?

Honestly, Ubisoft (and EA), get your act together. You’re making incredible games—why are you ruining them with this garbage? You’re alienating loyal customers like me who actually *want* to support you.

I’m fed up, and I’d love to hear from others who’ve been through the same thing. Is it just me, or are these companies actively driving away their fanbase with these problems?
