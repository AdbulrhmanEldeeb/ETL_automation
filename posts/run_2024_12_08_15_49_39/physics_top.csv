Physics,Physicists vs Mathematician doing Maths,"I am a 1st year Theoretical Physics but I am slowly realising I am bad at Physics and okay at Maths. Then, I wondered whether Mathematical Physics is more ideal for me.

Anyway, my question is: how exactly does it differ between a physicists and a mathematician doing maths?

Obviously we have different research topics but other than that, let's assume a physicist and a mathematician is approaching the same problem. What would the difference be? The obvious one I have in mind is how rigorous we are (my maths module lecturer from the physics department literally doesn't care about the modulus for , say, integral 1/x dx)",Richie_Feynman,1h93m2o,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h93m2o/physicists_vs_mathematician_doing_maths/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h93m2o/physicists_vs_mathematician_doing_maths/,2024-12-07 22:10:17,33,0.76,33,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h93m2o
