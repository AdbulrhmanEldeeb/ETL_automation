books,Stoner by John Williams is absolutely devastating me,"I got sucked into it a few weeks ago...then I got to the part where Edith is gone and he bonds with his daughter, and then Edith comes home...it hurt so much, I had to stop.

I finally came back to it now after weeks only for the Charles Walker stuff to be some of the most intense and stressful stuff I've ever read. I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with that, but I'm in my first year of grad school and intend to continue in academia as a queer person; the thought of being absolutely screwed by department politics and the vindictiveness of those with more social power is horrifying. I think I'm going to have to take a step away from it again.

books,"Faust's Death (Faust Part II, Goethe)","I have been reading Goethe's second part of his most famous verse tragedy ""Faust"", and I have always been fascinated with the Faust's final scene in the fifth act (*Grosser Vorhof des Palasts; The courtyard of Faust's palace).* In this scene we see a blinded Faust (he was blinded in the previous scene by the personification of Depression; ""*Curae""* in latin) walking towards Mephistopheles and his ""Cronies"" (Lemuren; Lemures, ancient roman spirits of death); he quickly lounges into a long speech about progress, happiness and utopic desires (which most 20th century writers and philosophers have interpreted as a ""capitalistic"" desire which Faust tries to apply towards his subjects). During this speech he pronounces the ill-fated words of his deal (*""verweile doch, du bist so schön!; ""stay a while, you are so lovely!"")* and promptly falls on the ground, dead. I have always loved this scene because of its beautiful nature and because I love Goethe as an author in general. What do you guys think?

Anyway, I think I'll leave a copy of Faust's last speech right under here: ""*Ein Sumpf zieht am Gebirge hin, Verpestet alles schon Errungene; Den faulen Pfuhl auch abzuziehn, Das Letzte wär das Höchsterrungene. Eröffn’ ich Räume vielen Millionen, Nicht sicher zwar, doch tätig-frei zu wohnen. Grün das Gefilde, uchtbar; Mensch und Herde Sogleich behaglich auf der neusten Erde, Gleich angesiedelt an des Hügels Krat, Den aufgewälzt kühn-emsige Völkerschaft. Im Innern hier ein paradiesisch Land, Da rase draußen Flut bis auf zum Rand, Und wie sie nascht, gewaltsam einzuschießen, Gemeindrang eilt, die Lücke zu verschließen. Ja! diesem Sinne bin ich ganz ergeben, Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluß: Nur der verdient sich Freiheit wie das Leben, Der täglich sie erobern muß. Und so verbringt, umrungen von Gefahr, Hier Kindheit, Mann und Greis sein tüchtig Jahr. Solch ein Gewimmel möcht ich sehn, Auf freiem Grund mit freiem Volke stehn. Zum Augenblicke dürft ich sagen: „Verweile doch, du bist so schön! Es kann die Spur von meinen Erdetagen Nicht in Äonen untergehn.” — Im Vorgefühl von solchem hohen Glück Genieß ich jetzt den höchsten Augenblick.""*

*English version:* A swamp lies there below the hill,

Infecting everything I’ve done:

My last and greatest act of will

Succeeds when that foul pool is gone.

Let me make room for many a million,

Not wholly secure, but free to work on.

Green fertile fields, where men and herds

May gain swift comfort from the new-made earth.

Quickly settled in those hills’ embrace,

Piled high by a brave, industrious race.

And in the centre here, a Paradise,

Whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,

And though it gnaws to enter in by force,

The common urge unites to halt its course.

Yes, I’ve surrendered to this thought’s insistence,

The last word Wisdom ever has to say:

He only earns his Freedom and Existence,

Who’s forced to win them freshly every day.

Childhood, manhood, age’s vigorous years,

Surrounded by dangers, they’ll spend here.

I wish to gaze again on such a land,

Free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand.

Then, to the Moment I’d dare say:

‘Stay a while! You are so lovely!’

Through aeons, then, never to fade away

This path of mine through all that’s earthly. –

Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,

Now I savour it, that highest moment.

books,2024 Book Spending ,"I haven’t seen a post like this in a while - just curious how much bookworms spent this year as we approach the end of the year. 

Please chime in with how much you spent for the year or any comparisons you find interesting! 

Last year I spent about $400, but this year I’m approaching $1000 on books. I’m genuinely curious where this falls among the masses, is this a lot? Average? 

This amount includes my monthly audible and KU subscription (about $26 per month or $326 on subscriptions for the year, then about $700 for physical books and the random e-book or audiobook deal). I intermittently buy new books and always love to find something secondhand. I sometimes go a month or two without buying then get a shopping bug and stock up. 

I started a Booktube channel this year which I don’t feel like has influenced my shopping habits as I tend to be somewhat conservative, but clearly something changed this year. More self reflection needed to see what really drove my spending. 

I am somewhat happy to say I’ve read a fair amount of what I’ve purchased so far. Hoping to improve this next year by prioritizing my shelves, utilizing the library more and shopping second hand or deals when I need something.

books,"What are some books that you kept thinking about, weeks/months/years after finishing them, and why? ","My picks:

I’ve read 2 books by Bret Easton Ellis,— The Shards and Lunar Park— and they both made me wish I could’ve read them with a book club or something because they’re so fascinating. His “autofiction” approach is something that I don’t see done almost ever and it adds a whole new layer of intrigue onto everything he touches. Not a fan of him as a person but I love his books. 

Mason &amp; Dixon by Thomas Pynchon. This book is an epic, sprawling adventure with an entire fan wiki dedicated to the historical references contained within it. The only book I’ve ever annotated of my own free will. Unexpectedly, though, I think about it constantly not because its crazy plot but because it is deeply, deeply beautiful and moving. I never would’ve thought a silly little book about the two guys who drew the boundaries between states would have this profound of an emotional impact on me. I was MOVED!!!!!!!!

books,An apocalyptic pandemic as imagined in 'The Scarlet Plague' by Jack London (1912) - a short and gripping novel.,"It is quite difficult to choose some words to begin this review. Let's say that the novel gripped me with its fast pace. An almost cinema-like dynamism - the descent of civilization into chaos, through a combination of visceral panic and despair, spred like a fire, devouring everything around - and *a fire* it was, as the onset of *Scarlet Plague* brought forth the innate instincts of self-destruction - murder, looting, arson. For, if once the unexpected symptoms appear, it takes the microbes only hald an hour to turn a healthy man into rotting corpse, people seek either salvation - fruitless endeavors, as it turned - or accept their fate and set the world ablaze as a final act of will. 

A dystopian, magnate-ruled society of the 21st America (as it was imagined by a *Belle Epoque* writer) could not withstand the catastrophe. A rigid class system to be torn down, all of the intricacies of progress to be annulled by a single flash of Plague - in just a week! No wonder that the narrator, now an old, sickly man, the last alive witness of *the end*, recalls the events of the long ago with tears and trepidation. 

Jack London imagined an absolute catastrophe, that would leave a score of people alive - deserting all knowledge of civilisation and turning to a primitive way of life within a geberation. One might consider this interpretation a little naive - but the tale nevertheless retained its strong grip on me from the first moment to the last. And it is short - no more than eighty pages.

If you enjoy Octavia Butler, Philip K Dick, Margaret Atwood, Karen Lord, Anne Leckie, Hugh Howey, Becky Chambers, Jane Harpman. If you have ever worked in Academia. Then you should consider trying this book. For a literary SF book it is pretty accessible and readable. The prose is wonderful but economical and has a beautiful clarity to it. The subject matter is hard hitting and deeply political. 

I was immediately engaged, saw that it was quite inexpensive as an e-book, downloaded it and read the whole thing in one day.

books,No Spoiler Review: The Riyria Revelations by Michael J Sullivan,"First time poster, I generally read a series every week to two weeks depending on other tasks and felt like sharing so those wondering if they should grab that whole series at the bookstore or just the first book can make a more informed decision. 

The Riyria Revelations is a three book series following the thieving duo of Riyria; Royce and Hadrian. They are contracted for a job that turns their lives, and the world, upside down. Enjoy a twist on familiar fantasy themes, succinct but detailed combat sequences, and world building that rivals RR Martin and Anthony Ryan in scope if not detail. 

I don't like star reviews, because books deserve more than that. 

I rate this as a Good Read. The books are thick, detailed, and have just enough uniqueness to let them stand apart from the traditional fantasy fare. 

The plot was convoluted but tied up nicely with several twists that caught me off guard. Despite being self published, the quality of editing is superb, and I feel that it gives the writing more authenticity. If you love Tolkien's work with description, Sullivan accomplishes the same effect with dialog between the characters that pulls the reader deeper into the story and the arcs of the various characters. 

I loved this series for the storytelling through dialog and Sullivan's take on the traditional fantasy peoples of elves, goblins, dwarves, and humans. 

If you're a fantasy fanatic or even a casual consumer, this is a fantastic series that you should definitely grab as a set. If you're looking to jump into fantasy I would recommend picking up something a bit shorter, but it's not quite as beefy as The Raven's Shadow series or Night Angel Chronicles. Regardless, I would put this on the ""To Read"" shelf. 

If you've read this series, what other things would you say about it? And if you pick it up, come back and comment what you thought.

books,Life among the aliterate (a small rant),"In terms of aliterate, I mean people who know how to read, but don't care to. A familiar quote, ""I had to read in college (or high school) but I don't need to anymore.""

I grew up in a household of readers and have family who are still voracious readers.

20 years ago, I moved from a major Northern U.S. metropolis to a major Southern U.S. metropolis.

In my former home everyone I knew read all the time - different stuff, but they read. Poor people, rich people - for most it had been a lifetime avocation. And they did love reading.

When I moved, my partner (who was a former publishing person like me) and me continued our reading adventure. 

But NO ONE is our social circle reads here. Not books, not anything. Our friends don't even have books in their homes. They come to our house and see the books crammed in the 6 big bookcases and usually the first comment is ""Did you read all of these?"" - like it's some aberrant thing, like it's an impossible thing to do.

And they seem suspicious - like, what kind of person would read those books? Definite suspicions about the science books...

I get the impression that if the books were replaced with sports memorabilia, everything would appear normal to them.

I have learned not to talk about my love of reading. I know they will never understand. It's kind of lonely except for the reddit connections - and then, that's just shorthand for any real discussion about anything substantial.

At least my partner still reads - much more than me.

I agree with this very rude plea from noted director and author, John Waters:  
**“**&gt;!If you go home with somebody, and they don't have books, don't fuck 'em!!&lt;**”** “It wasn't until I started reading and found books they wouldn't let us read in school that I discovered you could be insane and happy and have a good life without being like everybody else.”",BigJobsBigJobs,1h86yrm,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h86yrm/life_among_the_aliterate_a_small_rant/,2024-12-06 17:40:26,420,0.79,420,0,390,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h86yrm
books,"""One does not read a book: one can only reread it"" - V. Nabokov","I finished my first time through *The Brothers Karamazov* (the Katz translation; excellent, btw) on December 2. 

Noted weirdo Vladimir Nabokov said once that one doesn't read a book, one only *re*reads it. It's his fancy way of saying that the first time through a book doesn't really count, since the reader is mostly just trying to make sense of the scale and dimensions of the story. It's the reread where the book starts to really reveal itself to the reader. 

So, I picked up the McReynolds translation (from Norton*) and started the introduction tonight (December 6 -- this will be relevant in two shakes).

[* The McReynolds is worth it if only for the ""Names in *The Brothers Karamazov*,"" which goes into the etymological roots of the names.]

In the introduction she mentions two scenes that I have *absolutely* no memory of (both quotes come from p viii in the Norton Critical Edition):

1) ""But we also share Ivan's indignation as he recounts the tale of Richard, whose life was taken away twice -- once, symbolically, by the biological parents who gave him away as chapel to some shepherds, and then by his social family, his fellow citizens of geneva, who chop off his head in brotherly fashion.""

2) ""We reel from the vision of the naked, terrified little boy ripped apart by hunting dogs before his mother's eyes.""

So, in conclusion: if you love a book once, it's probably worth reading twice, because what if you, too, don't remember two horrible deaths?

Do you reread ever? Is once enough? Is Nabokov full of beans?",Mike_Bevel,1h8e5y1,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8e5y1/one_does_not_read_a_book_one_can_only_reread_it_v/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8e5y1/one_does_not_read_a_book_one_can_only_reread_it_v/,2024-12-06 22:54:55,129,0.82,129,0,101,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8e5y1
books,"I went through a phase where I collected tons of books to keep on my shelves, and it had a negative impact on me. I want to talk about it in case anyone else has experienced the same thing. ","I love books. I always have. Not just reading them, but looking at them, holding them, feeling them, turning the pages, admiring the covers, seeing them displayed on my bookshelves so prettily, reorganizing my shelves. Books are art to me. Over the past few years one of my main hobbies was exploring used bookstores for fantasy, science fiction, lit fic, history, and poetry. I live in an area with many amazing ones and I would spend hours on my days off exploring them and learning about all the authors I wanted to read. The vast majority of my collection is used books and I often would only be spending a few dollars on one book even for very popular authors and that’s how I justified to myself that it was ok I was doing all this buying.

I told myself that I was ""collecting,"" which was a very different thing than hoarding in my mind. Books are my hobby, right? So it's okay that I collected so many.

I had this notion that I was building a little library for myself, a beautiful display that I could always go to and find my next read. However, this did not work out the way I thought it would. I enjoyed my time collecting these books very much but over the past week or so I've had to confront the negative impact this has had on me personally.

Problem 1: If a new release came out that I really wanted to read, one of two things would happen. One: I wouldn’t let myself read the new release because I knew I had so many books on my shelf. I needed to get to the ones I already owned. Two: I would read the new release and feel this creeping sense of guilt that I had just spent money or spent time on yet another book when I already owned hundreds at home.

Problem 2: My taste in genre had a rather drastic evolution this past year. I had been collecting mainly fantasy as that has been my lifelong literary interest. But this past year historical romance took over my reading and I began collecting that genre too. I adore my fantasy collection and I have good memories of exploring certain used bookstores that I love dearly, but the genre switch took my a bit by surprise.

Problem 3: I discovered my love of audiobooks this past year. I was a person who could never do audiobooks for some reason, my brain just would not focus on the story, and so I really thought I would be reading all these physical books. Well, not sure how it happened, but something changed in me and now I LOVE audiobooks. I find myself searching for a good audiobook more than a physical book now.

Problem 4: Looking at my shelves started to make me feel like a hoarder. I own enough books for the next five years and when I don't even know where I'll be living during that time and when libraries exist, there's no logical reason for me to own that many. The joy of going to a bookstore is gone for me now, and the only way to get that back is to simplify what I own so one day I will have an actual reason to go book shopping. The thing I once loved so much, I began to see as clutter, and that makes me sad. I don’t want to see books as clutter anymore, and the only way to prevent that is to literally de-clutter my bookshelf and therefore de-clutter my mind.

And so now as I write this there are four large bags of books by my shelves ready to be taken to a used bookstore or a thrift store over the weekend. Something snapped in me last week and I sat down in front of my shelves and just started pulling books down and putting them into the bags and it was as if my mind just knew which ones I didn’t need anymore.

I will no longer buy a book because “this looks really interesting and I’ll read it someday.” I will no longer buy a book because it has a gorgeous cover. I will no longer buy a book just because it's been on my TBR for a while and I found a cheap copy.

The reason I wanted to post this is that I know there are other people who struggle with this ""collector"" mindset the same way I do where you get that little thrill of buying books to add them to your shelves and you justify it to yourself because, in the moment, it really does make you happy and you really think you will read it soon or someday in the future.

books,The best thing that ever happened to me ...,"So…. this happened on a Sunday when I was extremely bored and I'm the kind of person who chooses books over anything to get rid of boredom. When I was scrolling through Goodreads, I laid eyes on a book with some kind of a crucifix on its cover. I immediately picked that book (this was approximately 2 weeks back). I knew it was a series and my initial plan was to read a single book. 

As I started the first book, within a few chapters I fell in love with the characters, Robert Hunter and Carlos Garcia. So after completing the first book in a day or two (which is way faster than my usual speed, considering I work on week days), I decided to proceed with the series. Now here I am, I finished the whole series in 2 weeks and I'm craving for more books by Carter. After this I can easily say that Chris Carter will forever be my favourite author and Robert Hunter, my favourite protagonist. 

Every book in the series was intriguing and brutal. In my opinion, if gore outweighs the actual content, it might become a negative in itself but here it works the opposite way. Apart from how the killer is found, the mystery behind why the crime is committed in a certain way and the motive for such brutality, are points of great interest in every book. 

Leaving these aside, there's a book in this series called An Evil mind. I was completely blown away by it. I never imagined that Carter could create an antagonist who is as powerful as Hunter.  But Lucien Folter overshadowed Hunter and he's the best antagonist according to me ( including every book and movie I have ever watched). 

I'm now anticipating the release of the next book in the series. I know it might take a year for the next book release so I'm planning to re-read the available books once more. I was not in a great mental state when I just started this series and Carter offered me the much needed distraction. Currently I'm at least one step better because of him and I'm grateful for that.",Alternative-Bit-999,1h8lpzr,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8lpzr/the_best_thing_that_ever_happened_to_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8lpzr/the_best_thing_that_ever_happened_to_me/,2024-12-07 05:37:58,7,0.59,7,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8lpzr

books,"Dark Evenings: ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" by Dean Koontz.","And now the fourth Dean Koontz book that I've been reading for the past few days is now complete tonight! ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" is that novel.

We meet Amy Redwing, a woman who has devoted her entire life to rescuing dogs. But there is a unique bond that she shares with a golden retriever named Nickie, a dog she had saved in a very dangerous encounter, one that is really deep.

But in one night, this loyalty will be put to the test, and they will prove to each other how far they can go--even when the stakes turn deadly.

This one's pretty similar to another Koontz novel ""Hideaway"", as it is a thriller mixed with the supernatural. It might not be as original as one would think, but I still found it pretty decent enough to find it enjoyable.

Koontz has written a lot, with some being either great or really decent, and ""The Darkest Evening of the Year"" fits into the decent category. Most would say that his writing has become repetitive, but for me they're still enjoyable. Not really deep, but incredibly satisfying. And now that I've had my quota of Koontz for now, it's time to move on to another book by a different author, or authors in this case, as this one is written by two authors.",i-the-muso-1968,1h8je8d,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8je8d/dark_evenings_the_darkest_evening_of_the_year_by/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h8je8d/dark_evenings_the_darkest_evening_of_the_year_by/,2024-12-07 03:20:23,7,0.68,7,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h8je8d
books,God emperor of dune is so interesting ,"I loved this book. I loved leto’s ramblings and I loved moneo. And I loved the way the golden path is explained. 

But this book had a few major issues for me. 

The biggest is the dialogue. Half the time I had no idea wtf anyone was talking about. The other half, the dialogue felt so robotic. And the emotion is so unreadable. Also, I’ve never seen anyone use as many exclamation points as frank herbert. Especially when they’re not needed or when they don’t fit the scene and emotion. A character doesn’t cry but exclaims. A character can be trying to say something quietly but there’s an exclamation mark. It sends so many mixed signals that it’s hard to tell what’s happening. I swear there’s at least one exclamation point in every paragraph. 

The second is that everyone except Leto is very flat.  Hwi noree and Duncan and moneo and siona could have been so interesting but they are barely explored. And these characters barely show emotion besides anger. The only exception is Hwi. But she is written to be crying in response to almost anything that Leto says. No matter what he says. Leto could say “man, it sucks to be a dictator” and she just starts bawling for no reason. 

One last thing: Hwi and Duncan had zero chemistry. Idk why their love was even included. Especially because it makes no sense in the context of the plot and had no impact on the plot. Presumably Duncan met Hwi once “off screen.” And the next time we see them, they just have sex. Like wtf. That came out of nowhere. And it’s not like their love has any impact on the plot because their relationship is ignored by Leto. Siona doesn’t give a shit. And moneo acts like it’s blasphemy but doesn’t do anything to stop them other than just saying stop. 

Also I would have liked to see leto’s ‘peace’ explored a bit more. How did his atrocities compare to his father. Paul’s ascension to the throne caused the death of 61 billion. How much did leto’s stagnation of progress do? The stagnation of medicine, of ecological developments, of new helpful technology, etc.

*There has been a wellspring of replies to this post and I am overwhelmed by the positive and life-affirming reactions. Thank you everyone, for the wonderful, thought-provoking and oftentimes personal replies. I've been reading every one!*  
  
Whether it's related to guilt over my participation in recent Black Friday sales, the need to make space for a proper kids' playroom, or a long-simmering reckoning against too many material possessions--I am considering significantly downsizing my book collection.

Literature (writing and reading) is largely my main hobby in life, but I am starting to look at my bookshelves and wonder, ""Do I really need that book?"" I recently began purchasing the odd ""fine press"" edition of favourite books (its own form of excess, I know, but hear me out) and it got me thinking about the worth I place on my \~1,000 books. Do I want to keep books that weren't life-changing, 5-star reads, just so I can hoard like some literary goblin who gets to point and say to guests, ""See, I read lots!""?

Has anyone else gone through a sort of reckoning like this? Did you sell them to recoup some of the costs over the years/decades, or just donate them? How did you go about downsizing--clear everything that wasn't an absolute favourite? Hold the ones that were 4 stars that others might enjoy? Hold onto classics just because they are classics? Hold onto rare or expensive or sentimental?

books,just finished “lonesome dove” and i am crying ,"i am so sorry for this rant but i have to get this off of my chest 😭😭

wow wow wow wow. i am completely in awe of this book. this is an understatement.

first off, i don’t really read western type of books. i mostly stick to classics, literary fiction, short stories, YA (every once in a while), etc. the only “western” author i read was cormac mccarthy. i LOVED “no country for old men” and “the road” (to be honest , those are the only books i read from mccarthy lol). and i also tend to read shorter books because of my attention span 😩

but every once in a while, i like to challenge myself. in the beginning of this year, i decided to try “war and peace” and was blown away by it.

i decided to finish this year off with a long book but i wasn’t sure which one. then i saw a bunch of people on my goodreads and reddit feed praising “lonesome dove.” i got curious. i figured that if i didn’t like it, i could always dnf.

let me just say—i never thought of dnfing this book. from the first sentence i was HOOKED!! the writing style was so vivid and raw without being tedious. mcmurtry’s writing style was honest and interesting. every single character had their own way of speaking and mannerisms it was incredible. all the characters were fleshed out; they came across like actual people from that time period. 

i loved all of the characters (except jake spoon). my favorite ones were gus, newt and lorena. i think that with these characters, mcmurtry’s writing style was the most powerful. i loved how he treated lorena with grace—he didn’t treat her like many of the men treated her (and other prostitutes). and on that note, he also treated minorities (like the native americans and black people) with respect—meaning, not rudely or even “special.” as a black woman reading this, i had to brace myself. i thought mcmurtry would paint the native americans, prostitutes and black people as either evil, mary sues who could do no wrong, or just victims. but he didn’t do that. he was realistic. just like the white men in the story, these minority groups had the potential for being good, neutral or bad. they were all humans. he was realistic. i hope this makes sense.

mcmurtry was so skillful that i felt like i was physically in the story with his characters, traveling with them, roping horses, etc. it was so good that i was thinking about learning how to ride a horse and channel my inner cowboy 🤠 

what i loved the most about this story was the narrative style. it wasn’t choppy. it was the perfect blend between dialogue and description. that was my biggest concern when i thought about reading this book. i was scared that this big book would have either just dialogue or tedious descriptions. but it was a perfect combination of both. i know this is minor to most people but this issue had led me to dnf so many books during my (short) lifetime.

i also liked how mcmurtry approached this time period. i’m not crazy about historical fiction (i tend to get bored), but he did a fantastic job. it made me curious to actually learn more about this time period.

mcmurtry captured leaving and staying in places so well. as someone who moved around, so much of his characters’ journey resonated with me. there was a sense of excitement for a new place and yet a loneliness in that that resonated with me. i might have cried during the last chapter.

and im so sad that now this journey is over. i was dragging my feet a little towards the last few chapters because i quite literally didn’t want to finish the book. but now it’s done. while i have left this beautiful story, i suspect that the story will not leave me.

and this quote below perfectly describes the book and my feelings about finishing it:

""It's funny, leaving a place, ain't it?"" he said. ""You never do know when you'll get back.""

The result is two bookcases of books and countless titles shipped to local hospital unopened because I felt overhelmed by the mess.

books,Dune: My Personal Journey,"Frank Herbert’s Dune series is one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written. It’s sprawling, philosophical, and deeply complex, full of political intrigue, ecological insights, and questions about power and destiny. What makes the series so remarkable, though, isn’t necessarily the strength of each individual book. None of them, for me, are among the best books I’ve ever read. But taken together, the *Dune* Frank Herbert’s *Dune* series is one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written. It’s sprawling, philosophical, and deeply complex, full of political intrigue, ecological insights, and questions about power and destiny. What makes the series so remarkable, though, isn’t necessarily the strength of each individual book. None of them, for me, are among the best books I’ve ever read. But taken together, the *Dune* series is absolutely one of the best series I’ve ever experienced. The sum is truly greater than its parts.

My journey with *Dune* has been a mix of awe, frustration, and moments of profound reflection. Add to that Denis Villeneuve’s stunning movie adaptations, and *Dune* has become more than just a series for me—it’s a world I’ve lived in, thought about, and will never forget.

# Dune: A Masterpiece of World-Building

The first book, *Dune*, is where it all begins, and it’s undeniably fantastic. Herbert’s ability to create a universe so layered, so alive, is unparalleled. Arrakis feels like a character in its own right, and the interplay between the Fremen, the spice, and the sandworms is unforgettable. Paul Atreides’ rise to power as the prophesied leader of the Fremen, Muad’Dib, is a fascinating and deeply human story set against a backdrop of galactic-scale politics and intrigue.

That said, while *Dune* is a towering achievement in science fiction, it doesn’t quite crack my personal “best books ever” list. It’s not perfect—it can be dense and slow in places—but it’s so unique, so rich, that it’s impossible not to be swept away by its vision.

Watching Denis Villeneuve’s *Dune: Part One* before reading the book brought that world vividly to life for me. I saw *Dune Part One* on a whim. I hadn’t heard of *Dune* before that as I was really just getting into reading at the time. The movie’s stunning cinematography, Hans Zimmer’s otherworldly score, and the pitch-perfect performances elevated the story. Seeing Arrakis, the spice fields, and the sandworms on the big screen made diving into the book much easier than it would have been otherwise.

# Dune Messiah: Smaller, But Powerful

The second book, *Dune Messiah*, takes the grandeur of *Dune* and turns it inward. It’s a quieter, more introspective story, following Paul Atreides as he grapples with the consequences of his rule and the prophecy that has shaped his life.

This book has a tragic quality that I really appreciated. Paul is no longer the bright young leader we met in *Dune*. He’s a man weighed down by the cost of his power, haunted by the violent acts committed in his name. It’s not as expansive or as immediately gripping as *Dune*, but it adds incredible depth to the series.

# Children of Dune: Uneven but Necessary

*Children of Dune* bridges the original trilogy and the dramatic shift that happens later in the series. It focuses on Paul’s children, Leto II and Ghanima, as they grapple with their father’s legacy and the path their lives must take.

This novel was a mixed bag for me. Some parts dragged, and the pacing felt off at times, but there were also flashes of brilliance—especially Leto II’s evolution into the figure who will dominate the series’ future. While I didn’t enjoy it as much as *Dune* or *Dune Messiah*, it contains important moments that make it a necessary part of the saga. One of the most powerful of these is Alia’s tragic conclusion. As the regent of the Imperium, she struggles to maintain control over her mind as the voices of her ancestors, particularly the malevolent influence of her grandfather, Baron Harkonnen, take over. Her internal battle becomes unbearable, and she descends into madness, growing paranoid and tyrannical. Ultimately, facing the loss of her power and the imminent threat of the Fremen turning against her, Alia chooses to end her life by jumping from the window of the Keep. This act is both a tragic surrender to her fate and a final attempt to free herself from the Baron’s control.

# God Emperor of Dune: A Bold Pivot

*God Emperor of Dune* is where the series takes a massive leap forward. Thousands of years have passed, and Leto II, now a human-sandworm hybrid, rules over humanity as a godlike figure.

This book is incredibly divisive, but I loved it. It’s philosophical, strange, and deeply introspective. Leto’s vision for humanity, his Golden Path, and his musings on power and sacrifice make for a fascinating, if slower, read. Herbert’s willingness to completely reimagine the series at this point is part of what makes *Dune* such an ambitious and singular work.

# Heretics of Dune: The Low Point

This is where the series stumbled for me. *Heretics of Dune* introduces new characters and factions, and the story feels disconnected from the earlier books. It was a slog to get through, and I found myself struggling to stay invested.

That said, it’s not skippable. It sets up the events of *Chapterhouse: Dune*, and without that connection, the final book wouldn’t have the same impact. Still, if it didn’t directly tie into the ending, I’d be tempted to tell readers to skip it.

# Chapterhouse: Dune: A Strong Finish

Thankfully, the series picks up again with *Chapterhouse: Dune*. This book focuses heavily on the Bene Gesserit, and their intricate scheming and power plays make for a compelling read. The story felt tighter and more engaging than *Heretics*, and it served as a satisfying conclusion to the series.

The final chapter, though, is what sticks with me the most. The mysterious old man and woman who appear at the end add an enigmatic layer to the story. It’s an open-ended, haunting conclusion that leaves you with more questions than answers—exactly the kind of ending that fits the sprawling, complex nature of *Dune*.

# The Movies: Dune: Part One and Part Two

Denis Villeneuve’s movies have been a revelation. *Dune: Part One* was a masterpiece, capturing the heart of the first half of the book with stunning visuals and a deep respect for Herbert’s world.

When I finally saw *Part Two*, it was everything I hoped it would be. The movie picks up seamlessly where the first left off, showing Paul’s transformation into Muad’Dib and the Fremen’s fight against the Harkonnens. The final confrontation with Feyd-Rautha was intense and satisfying, and the visuals were breathtaking.

Chani’s role was expanded beautifully, and her relationship with Paul felt authentic and poignant. The political tension, the weight of destiny, and the sheer spectacle of Arrakis came through so vividly. Zimmer’s score was once again extraordinary, and Villeneuve proved he could handle the more action-heavy second half of the story while keeping the depth intact. 

Although there were some major departures, I think Denis Villeneuve truly understands the spirit of Dune. His passion for the source material is clear to see when watching his films. These two adaptations were perfect in my opinion. I can't wait to see what he brings for Dune Messiah.

# Final Thoughts

The *Dune* series is an unforgettable journey. Each book has its strengths and weaknesses, but together, they form a singular, monumental work of science fiction. The individual novels may not rank among my all-time favourites, but as a series, *Dune* is one of the best I’ve ever read.

Villeneuve’s films have only enhanced that experience, bringing the world of Arrakis to life in ways I never imagined possible. Whether you’re reading the books, watching the movies, or doing both, *Dune* is an experience that stays with you long after it’s over—a testament to Herbert’s vision and the enduring power of science fiction. But this is a story for everyone, not just fans of science fiction. It’s a brilliant reflection of humanity and is a story worth investing your time in.",Sudden-Database6968,1h5c1lb,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5c1lb/dune_my_personal_journey/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h5c1lb/dune_my_personal_journey/,2024-12-03 01:42:34,74,0.76,74,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5c1lb
books,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time - Thoughts after reading,"Initially, I was enjoying the book a lot. I liked the way Christopher thought - it was, in some ways, like a fresh breath of air. There was a point when I thought the book would get 5 stars from me...

Then I learned that Christopher's mother cheated, and that's bad. (I know it's not so black-and-white, but even after finishing the book, I couldn't find the mother redeemable.) A few pages later we learn the mother is actually still alive and the father hid her letters. I might be able to see where he was coming from, but that's just plain wrong. And killing a dog because your neighbor loves the dog more than you? Unforgiveable.

Yet it was obvious that the dad loved Christopher, so it was very frustrating to see him just shut his father out. And when Christopher ran away from home...I lost my sympathy towards him. (It was especially frustrating when he needed to catch a tube but was too terrified and kept missing them.)

I guess we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards the narrator, but I couldn't. I did feel bad for the father though (which may be contrasting to how I called his actions 'unforgiveable', but it is what it is). It's just funny (and frustrating) that what I thought would be a 5-star read ended up being a 2-star read.

At the end of the day, I do not get the hype around the book. Maybe I'm looking for someone in the comments to tell me that I'm wrong and the book is great because of xyz.

books,The Message by Ta-Nahisi Coates,"Ta-Nehisi Coates is a crucial writer for this era we find ourselves in now, in this chaotic year of 2024.  
  
When so much seems to be going wrong in the world, it’s important to have writers and artists lay out how the world is (and how the world should be), to interpret and express the contradictions and horrors of America, and of the world America has made.  
  
For some activists who are very tuned into certain current events, Coates’ book The Message won’t quite say anything new. But that isn’t really the point. It’s not a history book—it’s not meant to be a scholarly review of everything racist within America and in those countries propped up by American support.  
  
Rather, The Message is a personal book by a writer who overlays these issues through the filter of his own experiences. And that is where its true value lies.  
  
This memoir is made up of three essays, each more powerful than the last. In the first, Coates goes to Senegal to reflect on his African heritage. It’s a fascinating insight, and he gets into his own inner conflict over his lifelong connection to his very name. It’s a perspective on the African American experience not often explored: How Black African nationalism inspired his parents to give him the name Ta-Nehisi, and how he has had questioned the validity of that.  
  
The theme of racial pride by way of imagining past empires, some real and some fictional, it’s something he goes back to again and again. It gives the reader much to think about.  
  
At least there is some optimism as he finds himself pleasantly surprised by the development in Senegal. Even as that surprise comes with his own reckonings for being so instinctively pessimistic beforehand. If nothing else, it’s an excellent travelogue about a country seldom written about.  
  
The second essay is extremely topical, and more directly focused on the land of his own birth, in which he goes to South Carolina to visit those who have used his previous works to fight against censorship. It’s a study on how America has rewritten its own history for the sake of white supremacy, and how America continues to do so right now in so many Southern states. Sadly, in the wake of the last election, moral panics about DEI and CRT are as relevant as ever. Sometimes these fights are won, and Coates indeed speaks of how inspirational the power of writing can be, but overall there is a sense that the forces of justice are currently losing.  
  
In fact, there’s a feeling of profound sorrow prevalent in this book. A sense of loss, and even guilt, as Coates travels the world and finds so much failure in these systems that we live by. And that brings us to the final essay: He goes to Palestine. It covers more than half the book, and the majority of the discourse Coates is currently going through as well.  
  
It gets deep. Coates has strong things to say about Israel and the occupation. A careful and meticulous writer, his is a is a very well-thought out book that does not try to be bombastic. It is admittedly not meant to be some overarching and objective history lesson. As Coates explains, there are already plenty of Israeli points of views in the West. He is instead seeking out a chance to tell the Palestinian side, as fairly as possible.  
  
There is plenty of research herein. Coates can be a serious journalist when he needs to be. But again, the most poignant of these writings is simply the stories of going to Palestine and Israel, to Hebron and the settlements and East Jerusalem, and then explaining what happened there with humanity and empathy.  
  
When criticism of Israel comes up, there are always those who immediately bring up the Holocaust. And not without cause, it is certainly part of the context of the history of Zionism. So let me say that Coates does write very much about the history of anti-Semitism, of the legacy of the Holocaust and Nazis and of how Jews were absolutely singled out throughout the racist era of Europe in the 1800s and beyond. He goes back to this repeatedly throughout the book, quoting the early Zionists and contrasting on the sad irony of how so many did support colonialism and how so many white supremacists have supported Zionism.  
  
“Your oppression won’t save you,” is a key line. It doesn’t just refer to the Jews of history and the Israelis of today. It’s something that refers to everyone. The ultimate tragedy of history is that those who were oppressed often become the oppressors to others. He even mentions Liberia as an example, as no group is spared this lesson.  
  
Coates also writes about his guilt concerning his explosive 2014 Atlantic article, ‘The Case for Reparations.’ He then used postwar German reparations given to Israel as an example in his case, and now realizes how wrong he was for expecting nation-states to be accurate representatives on the suffering of individuals. He was never an expert on international affairs, and had always thought it was too complex to delve into. (I happen to think he’s too hard on himself with all the guilt, it’s unfortunate but he’s hardly unique in that. It’s ultimately a positive thing to grow and change as one learns more.)  
  
There is much writing about writing. As said, these are major world issues but this is still a personal memoir. He regrets putting so much faith in journalism, in expecting the institution of the Atlantic to truly make a difference. He speaks of his other books as his children, with plenty of flaws therein, and wonders if he has been true to himself all along with his mainstream writing career.  
  
Sadly, The Message has proven to be perhaps his timeliest book. Written before October 7th of last year and the subsequent—and brutal—Gaza war, it now matters so much. Personally, I’ve found his current media tour in promoting this book and discussing its controversies to be invaluable in bringing these issues to the forefront.  
  
Much has been already been written by others comparing the Israeli occupation of Palestine to the system of apartheid. And Coates does do his homework and researches well, speaking of Bantustans and ties to South Africa during the latter country’s oppressive past. Plenty of dates and quotes showing the history of Zionism and the development of the modern state of Israel. But what the book is truly about, is simply the people he meets and listens to. Simply the telling of their stories—and an ending on a final note lamenting the lack of Palestinian voices in the world of journalism.  
  
As a Black man from America, Coates cannot help but liken the occupation to Jim Crow. The comparisons are valid, and inevitable.  
  
At last, Coates returns to the themes from earlier in the book. About the narratives people tell themselves to justify who they are and what they have done.  
  
“What I saw in the city of David was so familiar to me. The search for self in the mythic past, filled with kings, and sanctified by an approximation of science.”  
  
It’s not just about Israel. It’s about African Americans, it’s about pride and what could have been if history went another way. It’s about Ta-Nehisi Coates’ own life, and it’s about the stories that were told to oppress his people and other peoples over the centuries.

books,I read The Song of Achilles and felt nothing ,"I was promised great love and a heartbreaking ending, and that’s the only reason i was putting off reading this book. It sounded like just the book that would devastate me. Don’t get me wrong, the book is certainly sad, but in a somber, drab way, not in a heartbreaking, stay with you for a long time after you finished it kind of way.

Throughout the entire book bad things just pile on for our protagonist Patroclus. There really aren’t many moments of reprieve, the dread is ever present in the book. The main thing i felt for him is pity and then annoyance for being so passive. The only time he ever showed any agency is when he was following Achilles around, making sure he stayed by his side. 

When they were in the mountains, with a god who could supposedly teach them anything, any skill, fighting or life, Patroclus apparently didn’t learn much of anything. They were in that cave in the mountains for years. Just the two of them and the teacher who could teach him anything…

The romantic relationship is not fleshed out. For the most part Achilles is an aloof character, we don’t really know the boy, and later the man, we see him through Patroclus’ eyes only. And from his perspective, everything is perfect, from his beauty, to his excellence, to his “mischief” and sense of humour. Also, apparently Achilles is somewhat of a pacifist in his early days. Now, I don’t know much about Greek mythology, but i know this just isn’t so lol.

The war sucked though. I would also hate if i had to go, so understood them there. Fuck Agamemnon and Menelaus, and fuck Paris and Helen of Troy too.

Like i said, this book is sad throughout, and even after both of them died, things somehow still managed to get worse.

If we didn’t get that resolution and small glimmer of hope in the last few minutes of the book, my rating would go from 3, to literally 1,5. 
This book didn’t devastate me into a heartbreak, but it slowly drowned me into numbness.",amazingamy19,1h48hn5,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h48hn5/i_read_the_song_of_achilles_and_felt_nothing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h48hn5/i_read_the_song_of_achilles_and_felt_nothing/,2024-12-01 17:32:31,519,0.75,519,0,279,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h48hn5

books,The dismal childhood of Becky Sharp - Vanity Fair ,"I’ve just finished Vanity Fair and loved it, one of the most fascinating portrayals of 19th Century society I’ve ever read. I loved Thackerays satirical voice as the narrator.

Becky Sharp is as interesting character as they come, I was alternately repulsed and charmed by her cunning and devious methods of getting her own way. I know it’s not made explicit in the book, but I got the impression that she may have been subject to sexual abuse as a child, which informs why she acts the way she does as an adult.

1) We’re told she had to coax and cajole all of the men her father was in debt to, and she was surrounded by her fathers adult friends from an early age

2) It’s said near the beginning that she was “a woman” from very early in her life

3) There’s a passage where it says she’s pondering sadly about the “dark times” in her childhood. This could refer only to poverty, but there are other ways to read it.

This tracks with how she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into serving her - this is all she knows about how to get by in the world. 

And it also makes sense with why she might hate Rawdon junior, because she resents him for having the childhood she never got to have.

Further, it makes sense why she is borderline obsessed with the Marquess of Steyne - a much older man who she may be drawn to due to her past trauma. Also, this is one of the only characters in the book who strikes genuine fear into her. This may be explained by him simply being one of the most powerful and cunning people ever in her circle, but again, there are other ways to read it.

I’m using none of this to excuse Becky ruining other characters lives, abusing and neglecting her son, betraying her husband, killing Jos(?!) etc, but it gave me an understanding of her character that made sense and assisted in my ability to empathise with her.

I’d be really interested to hear if anyone else has arrived at this conclusion. Or maybe this take is common! Amazing book, 5/5.

books,Do You Ever Picture a Different Ending for a Book?,"You know that feeling when you finish a book, and while you liked it, you can’t help but think, “What if it ended differently?” Maybe the characters made a choice you didn’t agree with, or the plot left too many loose ends.

For me, it was 1984. I get why the ending is the way it is, but part of me wonders how the story would have felt if Winston had actually succeeded in resisting the Party. Would it still be as powerful?

books,The Divine Farce by Michael S. A. Graziano -Very Short Review,"5-Stars!

This book was a recommendation from Goodreads because I enjoyed A Very Short Stay in Hell by Steven L Peck. The cover kind of grabbed me and the description hooked me:

“Three strangers are condemned to live together in darkness, crushed together in a concrete stall so small that they can never sit down. Liquid food drips down from above. Waste drains through a grid on the floor. So begins one of the strangest, most surreal comments on the human experience, on love and hatred and the human ability to find good in any situation, no matter how difficult.”

I’m not the best at reviewing books, honestly the description above from the back cover sets up the story perfectly. The writing is very descriptive and the prose are amazing vivid and disturbing. The world the author paints is a nightmare and yet…there’s definitely beauty in the filth. 

How much did I love this book? It arrived on my doorstep this morning at around 09:00, I was reading it by 09:10. It’s now 13:40 and I’ve finished the book (it’s only 125 pages) and I’m now rushing to tell you all it’s a page turner for sure!

books,Why Outer Dark by Cormac McCarthy is a deeply unsettling work of fiction,"This book is wild. Just reading the back cover, I knew I was in for something crazy, but *Outer Dark* surpassed even my wildest expectations.

*Outer Dark* back cover:

*""A woman bears her brother's child, a boy; he leaves the baby in the woods and tells her he died of natural causes. Discovering her brother's lie, she sets forth alone to find her son. Both brother and sister wander separately through a countryside being scourged by three terrifying and elusive strangers, headlong toward an eerie, apocalyptic resolution.""*

This is an extremely dark read, but I loved every word McCarthy wrote. It was fantastic.

As I mentioned in my review of All the Pretty Horses, Cormac McCarthy is probably my favourite author. *Outer Dark* continues to reinforce that belief.

Interestingly, as I started reading *Outer Dark*, a Vanity Fair article surfaced claiming that Cormac McCarthy had a 16-year-old muse late in his life. While I haven’t been able to access the full article due to subscription barriers, the excerpts and discussions I’ve encountered paint the piece as overly stylized, almost as if the author is attempting to mimic McCarthy’s own prose. This stylistic choice, combined with the extraordinary claims made, makes the story feel exaggerated, if not dubious. I’m not dismissing the possibility that some of it might be true—if it is, it’s deeply troubling—but the lack of concrete evidence and the outlandish nature of certain allegations leave me skeptical. It’s also worth noting that McCarthy is no longer alive to respond or clarify these claims. While the article has sparked debates about separating art from the artist, I believe McCarthy’s literary contributions remain vital. His works deserve to be read and analyzed, even as we remain mindful of the complexities surrounding his personal life.

Now, back to *Outer Dark*.

This is an amazing piece of fiction. From the very beginning, the book is relentlessly dark. Set in Appalachia, McCarthy creates an eerie, almost fantastical world that feels alive in its desolation. The brother and sister live in an isolated shack deep in the woods, and when they venture out on their separate journeys, they encounter a cast of vivid and unforgettable characters. Some of these figures are helpful, while others are downright malevolent. These secondary characters breathe so much life—and death—into the story, amplifying its intensity.

The first time Culla Holme, the brother, meets the three elusive strangers face-to-face, right after his ride on the ferry, is one of the creepiest scenes I’ve ever read. The way McCarthy describes the shadows moving in the clearing and the strangers’ unsettling mannerisms—how they move, stare, laugh, and speak—is masterful. The tension is almost unbearable.

You know they’ll return, and when they do, McCarthy doesn’t disappoint.

*""Well, I see ye didn't have no trouble findin us.*  
*I wasn't huntin ye.*  
*You got here all right for somebody bound elsewhere.*  
*I wasn't bound nowheres. I just seen the fire.*  
*I like to keep a good fire. A man never knows what all might chance along. Does he?*  
*No.*  
*No. Anything's liable to warsh up. From nowheres nowhere bound.*  
*Where are you bound? Holme said.*  
*I ain't, the man said. By nothin. He looked up at Holme. We ain't hard to find. Oncet you've found us.""*

This scene is haunting, and when the strangers appear again—with the one-eyed baby and the tinker in the tree—the atmosphere is downright terrifying. I’m not sure if *Outer Dark* is officially considered a horror novel, but it’s probably the scariest book I’ve ever read.

I’m not a big horror reader. People rave about Stephen King, but I haven’t been impressed. I’ve read *The Dead Zone* and *The Shining*, and neither really did it for me. I actually prefer Kubrick’s adaptation of *The Shining* because it improved on the source material in tone and execution. That said, I love Dan Simmons, I mostly know him as a science fiction author, however, I read Drood and loved it, though it wasn’t the horror elements that hooked me. If you have horror recommendations, I’d love to explore more.

But *Outer Dark*? It qualifies as horror in my book.

Religious themes also run deep in this story, coming to the forefront in the latter half. One of the most memorable scenes is when Holme meets the hog drovers. After one of their brothers dies and Holme gets blamed, a preacher shows up, declaring his guilt without any knowledge of the situation. The absurdity of this preacher, casually pronouncing judgment, is both comical and thought-provoking—a sharp critique of blind religious authority.

Rinthy Holme, Culla’s sister, has her own strange and fascinating encounters, though none are as grotesque as her brother’s.

This was an incredible read. Any Cormac McCarthy fan needs to pick up *Outer Dark*. Being one of his earlier works, it’s not as widely discussed as some of his other novels, but it deserves to be. It’s right up there with the rest of his literature in my opinion. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend *Outer Dark* as a starting point for McCarthy newcomers, but for fans, it’s an absolute must-read.",Sudden-Database6968,1h3gwu8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,2024-11-30 16:59:00,132,0.7,132,0,77,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3gwu8

books,Do you think understanding is necessary for enjoyment of literature?,"I have tried reading Ulysses but just can't get through it. Here's a paragraph from the second chapter.

&gt;It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Sainte Geneviève where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.

Some chapters get easier but then we're back to more literary experimentations and Joyce basically showing off his amazing knowledge of things.

I was having trouble and someone who said he was reading through the classics in his free time said just read through it. And that he had read Ulysses in just a week, which I found astonishing. Did  he read it carefully, I wondered? He said he didn't get a lot of stuff but it doesn't matter, he still enjoyed it.

Anyhow, I said I I can't read what I don't understand. like I first need to learn more about philosophy, history, religion, Ireland, etc. Or at least need to have a few books and webpages open to look up each reference Joyce makes (and he makes plenty). And that is assuming I can understand his stream-of-consciousness style which I often can't. So it will definitely take me way longer than a week or two.

Some other people also report difficulties with Joyce but also passages or books from other writers, like Faulkner, Woolf, Pynchon, and so on. Yet there are many people who would tell you they enjoyed the work and had no issues. Yet, when you ask them more questions, you realize they did not necessarily understand what they read.

So where do you stand? Do you think one should take the same approach to literature as we often do to poetry, to accept there will always remain some mystery and we will never know certain things for sure? And that perhaps we don't even need to know them. Or do you think that unless one really understands a book they are reading, they are not putting in the effort the type of book demands and perhaps they can't claim to have really read the book?

books,The Tearsmith (SPOILERS),"Ok, so I’m not usually a romance reader. However, I’m sometimes known for picking up a romance or two when I want something different for a bit. Which is how I came to read the Tearsmith by Erin Doom. 

Now, I don’t know if any of you have read this, but I can’t express how bad I found this book. I was a little intrigued by the premise, but my god was this book boring. The main characters grow up in an abusive orphanage together, something that colors literally all of their actions/interactions with each other, but we barely get to see what actually happened there. Instead, we get nearly 600 pages of, well, nothing. The chapters are incredibly repetitive, and drag on and on for no reason. The narration, which is usually in first-person, is pretentious and, again, repetitive. I want to excuse some of this, because I assume the translation from Italian to English was not perfect, but that does not excuse the way the main character is only able to talk in metaphors, and constantly talks about the same thing over and over again.

And the characters. My god. The main character, Nica, is written as “frail, delicate, and innocent.” And these are words that are actually used to describe her in the book. Actually, she’s written more like a 6-year old child. She’s obsessed with Rigel, the orphan she grew up with, and is constantly staring at him and thinking about how gorgeous and “dark” he is, and compares him to a wolf about 70 times. She’s clearly meant to be “not like other girls,” but she just comes off as an idiot. And Rigel. Jesus. He’s supposed to be the dark and tortured love interest, but in reality he’s a huge bully and can’t handle Nica touching him or he’ll “lose control” and ravish her against a wall or whatever. And every time he commands her to stay away, he gets as close to her as humanly possible and she trembles and shakes and can’t breathe. He also tries to “protect” her for all the guys who fall in love with her due to her “unique” eyes, something that is repeated over and over again. And she’s too naive to know that all these guys are disgusting and want to take advantage of her. 

Also, the book should have ended at least 6 chapters before it actually did. The author just kept adding more and more for no reason. The first couple of times I was like “ok, I guess she could add something else,” and then I just ended up skimming the last couple of chapters because they were so useless. If Nica had stopped waxing poetic over how dark and tortured and wolf-life Rigel was, the book would have been half its size. 

Has anyone else read this? Am I just being overly judgmental?

books,Napoleon Bonaparte's 'On Suicide': A Teenager's Emo Moment with a Side of Anti-French Sentiment,"I recently read Napoleon's essay 'On Suicide,' written when he was 17. In this essay, Napoleon contemplates death and expresses deep despair, feeling isolated and unable to find meaning in life. He reflects on his alienation from his homeland and his growing frustration with the world around him. He even goes as far as to contemplate suicide as an escape from his misery. At this time, young Napoleon harbored strong anti-French sentiments, influenced by his identity as a Corsican and his resentment towards the French government, which he viewed as an oppressor. This anti-French outlook, combined with his personal anguish, shaped much of his early writings.

But, honestly, I don't think Bonaparte was seriously contemplating suicide. It’s more likely that he was dealing with sexual repression. Shortly after writing this essay, he met his first love, and—surprise—his mood seemed to lift. The depression and suicidal thoughts vanished. (probably because the sexual repression was resolved. Sorry just for a joke.)

At the time, Bonaparte often used exaggerated expressions of anger and frustration. For example, in 'The New Corsica,' he describes Corsicans slaughtering the French in a bloodbath, and in 'On Suicide,' he writes of his deep sorrow and desire to end it all. But we shouldn’t take these youthful outbursts literally. Just because he once wrote about killing the French doesn’t mean he spent his whole life plotting their demise. Later, his sense of identity shifted from being a Corsican to a 'French Corsican,' and instead of focusing on the French, he turned his attention to Austria and England.

I have carefully read the original French version and also created a Chinese translation. However, since English is more commonly used in Reddit communities, I will share the English version here:

# On Suicide - Napoleon Bonaparte

*Valence, May 3rd 1786*

Always alone in the midst of men, I return home to dream alone and abandon myself to all the intensity of my melancholy. Where did it lead today? Towards death.

At the dawn of my days I can still hope to live long. I have been absent from my fatherland for six or seven years. Which pleasures will I not feel in four months to see my compatriots and my parents! From the tender sensations which awaken the sweet memories of childhood, could I not conclude that my happiness will be complete?

What fury then leads me to want my destruction? No doubt, what to do in this world? If I must die, is it not better to kill myself? If I had already passed sixty years, I would respect the prejudice of my contemporaries and patiently wait for nature to achieve its course; but since I begin to feel misfortune, that nothing pleases me, why should I endure days in which nothing succeeds?

How far men are from nature! How cowardly, vile, and crawling they are! What spectacle will I see in my country? My compatriots heavy with chains, and who trembling kiss the hand which oppresses them! They are no longer these brave Corsicans which a hero animated of his virtues, enemy of tyrants, of the luxury of vile courtisans. Proud, full of the noble sentiment of his own importance, a Corsican lived happily if he had spent the day tending to public affairs. The night spent in the tender arms of a dear wife?

Reason and his enthusiasm erased all the troubles of the day. Tenderness, nature, rendered his nights comparable to that of the Gods. But, with freedom, those happy days vanished like dreams! Frenchmen, not content with having taken from us everything we cherished, you have also corrupted our mores.

The current condition of my fatherland and my powerlessness to change it, are thus yet another reason to flee a land where I am obligated by duty to praise men whom I ought by virtue to hate. When I will arrive in my fatherland, how must I act, which language should I hold?

When the fatherland is no more, a good patriot should die. If I had only one man to destroy to deliver my compatriots, I would leave this instant and plunge in the breast of the tyrants the vengeful sword of the fatherland and of violated laws.

Life is a burden to me because I taste no pleasure and everything is sorrow. It is a burden because the men with whom I live and will probably always live with have mores as far from mine as moonlight differs from that of the sun. I can therefore not follow the only manner of living which could make me endure life, from which follows disgust for everything.",Illustrious-Most6097,1h36f2r,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h36f2r/napoleon_bonapartes_on_suicide_a_teenagers_emo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h36f2r/napoleon_bonapartes_on_suicide_a_teenagers_emo/,2024-11-30 06:22:21,69,0.81,69,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h36f2r
books,Ender's Game Empathy?,"I teach Language and Literature to middle school students and we have an upcoming unit around the book *Ender's Game*. I last read it when I was about their age and really enjoyed it, but going through it again with a more analytical perspective there are some things I'm left really wondering about. The main thing is the idea of empathy being Ender's key to defeating his opponents. We're told this several times throughout the book, and we definitely see some scenes of him being highly empathetic, but I don't really see it come into play in terms of him being able to defeat his enemies.

&gt;!In the fights he has with Stilson and Bonzo he's able to goad them into fighting one on one, and a case could be made that he needs a degree of empathy in order to be able to successfully do that, but the entire rest of the time he's at the Battle School does he use empathy at all to win his battles? It seems to me that he just outthinks everyone else and comes up with better strategies while they all run the same basic patterns.!&lt;

&gt;!And of course, the biggest, most important battles are the ones against the Buggers. He's explicitly told by Mazer and Graff after defeating them that they needed someone who could empathize with them in order to understand and defeat them, but where does that actually happen? He knows next to nothing about them other than what Graff and Mazer tell him about their communication and the way they act as units of a whole rather than individuals. In fact, Ender doesn't even realize that he's actually fighting them at any point. He believes he's playing a computer simulation directed by Mazer, so if he's actually empathizing with an opponent in order to defeat them, wouldn't he be trying to do so with Mazer?!&lt;

&gt;!Am I missing something with this book? I think it's a good example of sci-fi for middle school students, which is what we're using it to teach, but I'm really not seeing empathy being central to Ender's success so much as just his intelligence.!&lt;",Heck_Tate,1h3381y,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3381y/enders_game_empathy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3381y/enders_game_empathy/,2024-11-30 03:13:30,69,0.81,69,0,82,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3381y
books,The Grapes of Wrath,"I just finished *The Grapes of Wrath* by John Steinbeck. It was my first time reading the novel, though I’ve read some of his other work like *Of Mice and Men* in high school and *Cannery Row* just last year. He’s probably my favorite American author (so far). 

I found myself a little disappointed by all the loose ends. Where did Noah go? Why did he think his family didn’t love him? What will Rose of Sharon do after being abandoned by her husband? Did they do divorce in absentia back then? Of course, those questions are small potatoes in the face of starvation and death, but my satiated type A brain hones in on that sort of stuff. And the more I think about it, the luckier I feel.

I’m also kind of sad that we started the story with Tom Joad but he was gone by the end.

Rose of Sharon’s pregnancy was interesting. In the beginning, it was her great hope, and it strengthened her union with Connie. I’m guessing as she got further along he realized there was almost no work, and no way to perform the kind of labor necessary to their survival while also fulfilling their dreams of an ideal life. Shit got real. Even before they left for California, it was stated that ROS was no longer the “hoyden” he married but more settled. I took that to mean their connection was a little dubious from then on. 

Long story short: ROS spends a lot of time being tired and worrying about the health of the baby, but the baby is stillborn despite their best efforts. Uncle John sending off the corpse was interesting, given the wife and unborn child he lost so long ago. Maybe it was symbolic for him, letting go of the unknown and unfulfilled potential of the past and looking toward a better future. ROS ends the story by breastfeeding the man in the barn and smiling. That reminded me of the story of Roman Charity, or Cimon and Pero, though the two characters in this case don’t know each other. No idea how to interpret it, but it does seem fitting somehow.",BrieflyBlue,1h32tt7,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h32tt7/the_grapes_of_wrath/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h32tt7/the_grapes_of_wrath/,2024-11-30 02:51:29,66,0.85,66,0,61,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h32tt7
books,Reading culture pre-1980s,"I am on the younger side, and I have noticed how most literature conversations are based on ""classic novels"" or books that became famous after the 1980s. 

My question for the older readers, what was reading culture like before the days of Tom Clancy, Stephen King, and Harry Potter? 

From the people I've asked about this irl. The big difference is the lack of YA genre. Sci-fi and fantasy where for a niche audience that was somewhat looked down upon. Larger focus on singular books rather than book series. 

Also alot more people read treasure Island back in the day compared to now. I'm wondering what books where ubiquitous in the 40s- 70s that have become largely forgotten today?

books,Dune book is just spoiling my reading interest!! ,"I am 400 pages into the book. The story is great, the world building, the houses, the planets all are great. I know what is going in the story but it's very very boring. I can't read it because of the complex words....I have to look again again in dictionary for the words , i just cant read the full page without searching in dictionary. I thought that when paul and his mother will go into the desert it will be very easy to read but it became more complex. I cant understand the places he is explaining... Like ""They came to a series of dropping shelves and beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule"". And now i cant understand the part where paul pack is lost in the fissure , how he find it using compass and spice and water. Usually when i like a book i always think about it whole day what is going to happen , also at nights i will think about it , will wake to read at night, my morning will start with reading.

books,Books need trigger warnings ,"I understand that triggers can be subjective and vary by people but we all know general triggers from explicit content like SA, death, suicide, abuse, substance use, etc. that are commonly recognized and books should be required to list these as a warning of the content, likes movies do. Additionally, if you’re going to contain explicit content, it is simple to include crisis numbers… if your book is about dying by suicide, how hard is it to include a little “if you have thoughts or feelings of hurting yourself of others, call 988”. Books should have some regulation when covering those types of topics. 

I don’t want to have to read entire reviews that spoil a book just to get an idea of whether certain triggers may be included. Just my opinion!

books,"Swimming in the Dark by Tomasz Jedrowski broke me apart, this is such a brilliant book.","Oh lord, it's been minutes since I have finished this book, and perhaps I should've waited some time before giving a review, but oh well, the thoughts and the torment I am facing at this exact moment will be forever lost to time. I loved this book, it's an understatement, ofcourse. This book tore through my heart and ripped my soul apart, is this also an understatement? Probably. Swimming in the Dark is a tale of daring homosexual first love in the complicated and conservative times of the 1980s, I am speechless, I don't know what to say or even how to say for a matter of fact.    
  
The first half of this book felt so real, so painful and so joyous, this book portrays the torment of gay love and relationships in such profound and intense depths; societal pressures and the corrupted bigoted world that we currently live in, suppressing our true self for the sake of survival, not being able to display our love and our true identity. The torment and the pain that run through ourselves, the agony and utter melancholy of being a homosexual in this world of prejudice. As a gay male, having faced similar experiences, this made my insides coil up and burst into flames. This is perhaps the most realest book I've read, to me atleast.

This book meticulously dwells into the joy of having a place to be yourself, to have a place where you no longer have to wear that mask and finally display your raw and true identity, a place where you could be yourself, moments where you are true to yourself, be true and real to your lover. I don't know man, even writing this review, my heart is beating like a cheetah, I dont know. We follow the life of Ludwik our narrator and his experience after he met Janusz, the love of his life in the military camp after graduation. Their begins the quest of them finding each other, falling in each others embraces and finding true love. The societal homophobic and bigoted views at that time is masterfully portrayed, how you have to always act, how you can never be yourself and always put the mask on that the society thinks is ""normal"", how homosexuality is perceived as abnormality in those times and how it was severely looked down upon. You can't even show feminine attitude, you have to be a rigid masculine figure like all others, always concealing the true self behind.

What I even could relate and adored was the portrayal of self hatred and resentment of oneself, the shame that eats you up for being gay, for not being ""normal"" according to others, the pain, the torment and the underlying fear of what will happen if others know? How should you act if others know? The never ending uncertainty and fear that always will linger within your mind, not leaving at all. Janusz and Ludwik, the book masterfully builds up their relationship and the intimacy that bloomed between them as it pushed on, showing that what true love is and how daring and fierceful it is. The prose is excellent, wow, simple words and simple sentences but arranged and crafted so beautifully and realistically that made me love the book even more, I was almost at the verge of tears because how beautiful and heart-shattering the language was, how moments displayed were so vivid and so full of life.

But they couldn't be together, not in this lifetime, their different views on politics and their own country separated the courses of their lives, dashed and divided into a million stars long gone in the midnight. Context I guess, please consider me as I am not really that knowledgeable regarding the post WW2 Cold War (The Soviet Period) and the impact faced by Poland in that time. To get free from the totalitarian authority and gain freedom was Ludwiks lurking goal, he never protested, but he always wanted a true and free Poland, he wanted to leave the country with Janusz to find a place where they could be together and be their own, but life isn't a checklist or black and white. Janusz was along the side of The Party from the beginning and, for him you must remain true to The Party to get a stable job and secure a stable life, but he knew, he wasn't blind, he knew about the prejudice and the torment that this authority laid over Polish people and its utter cruelty, but you have to be true to The Party to lead a stable life. His mentality circled around the concept of not leaving the country, because what can you do and will you have when you leave the country? This was the thread that started their separation, while we might not be able to understand it first, but this created the domino effect.

To conceal yourself and wearing a mask, being so true to the mask takes upon your identity and hides your true self underneath, you completely being oblivious to what it does to the one you love, Janusz completely being oblivious to what it did to Ludwik, I still believe Janusz loved no one other than Ludwik, but to play the act, he reached depths from which Ludwik would never pull him up. Having sex and being intimate with Hania, even if all this is foolery, how can you be true to your lover then? Janusz? He couldn't be true to him, he never could, a mask that eats away your life and the thing that matters the most to you. This is heartbreaking, my heart is still racing by the way, this book left me in a desolate state of despair and pain from the moment I turned over the last page, wow, just wow. This is what I consider a masterpiece, peeled layers and layers of my soul and made me feel all emotions ranging from joy and happiness to sorrow and dread, they could never be together, in this cursed life, couldn't even get the chance of saying proper goodbyes, regrets and shame, and to live an identity of not one's own. Their last moments together were heartbreaking, smoking cigarettes and staring into the dark, Oh God, I might cry. To even think of that part, the part where Ludwik reaches to Janusz to tell him he'll be leaving, leaving everything behind, leaving them and their love behind, leaving them, their moments and their life behind, fuck, I will cry. Gosh, this is so painful.

Friendship, and being together for your friends, a section which was also beautifully displayed in this book, supporting and being there for your own people, people who mean alot to you, reminded me of my own true friends and their significance in my life. Helplessness and depravity, living falsely to yourself are strong themes that lurked throughout the book and left it's impact with every passing page

I felt the narrators (Ludwik's) pain and suffereing in my own veins and felt his joys and moments of happiness in my own soul, this is such a brilliant book that displays alot about the world we live in and the melancholic fates of Homosexual back in those time periods. I loved it and this book will forever remain within myself.  I will quote alot of paragraphs and texts now, so please bear with me haha. This is a literary masterpiece, I don't know if I will ever heal from this. Strong feelings similar Lie With Me by Phillipe Besson (Another literary masterpiece, highly recommended). Giovanni's Room is referenced multiple times in significant depths throughout this book and I must read it now, while it was already high in my reading list of books, it just got much more significant. I shall reread this after finishing Giovanni's Room to connect more with the segments where it was mentioned, HOLY HELL. Gosh, I'm sorry for tweaking so much. No matter what I say, and how much I say, I can't put to words how much this book means to me and how much it truly affected me. Absolutely wounded me to the core, I doubt whether I can ever recover. I am genuinely blessed to have the chance of reading it, I rarely say this but I mean it.

  


***""This is how I lived back then—through books. I locked myself into their stories, dreamt of their characters at night, pretended to be them. They were my armor against the hard edges of reality. I carried them with me wherever I went, like a talisman in my pocket, thinking of them as almost more real than the people around me, who spoke and lived in denial, destined, I thought, to never do anything worth recounting.""***

***""My body moved in your direction, and you looked at me, suddenly calmed too. With your arms outstretched to the sides, you were like a ballet dancer hovering in flight. Under the surface of the water something warm rattled in my belly. I approached, until I could see the drops of water on your forehead and on the tip of your nose and in the corners of your mouth. We didn’t say a thing. We looked at each other, already beyond words. You were there, and I was there, close, breathing. And I moved into your circle. All the way to your waiting body and your calm, open face and the drops on your lips. Your arms closed around me. Hard. And then we were one single body floating in the lake, weightless, never touching the ground.""***

(This is so beautiful oh my god)

***""I felt your chest underneath your shirt, retraced the swing of your collarbones, the hardness of your shoulders. You tasted the same, warm and earthy. I pulled off your clothes in the dim light. Your tan was still visible, and around us the house was alive—feet shuffled below, water pipes gurgled, taps were turned on and off, accompanying our struggles. Later, when night had fallen and we had exhausted ourselves, we lay facing each other, the tip of your nose on the bridge of mine. Nothing else mattered in the dark.""***

***""I sat in the hallway and tried not to cry. I wanted to cease existing. I wanted to un-be. I sat in the hallway and tried not to think of you and me. I tried not to think of us, under the covers of your bed. I tried not to think of your arms or your hands or your eyes. I tried not to think of all the things I had imagined we’d do together—return to our lake next summer, move in together someday. I tried not to think of Hania, and your fingers on her sequined dress. I tried not to think of Maksio or his eyes when he saw us in the forest. I tried not to think of Granny or Professor Mielewicz.""***

(This quote nearly made me cry)

***""We searched for words, each one of us, trying to say something that meant anything. In the end, we just said goodbye. We said it casually, like we would see each other again soon or maybe like people who had never been much more than acquaintances. You two walked off, arm in arm, and I watched you, the burning cigarette still in my hand, the last thing you’d ever given me.""***

(There last moments together, fuck me Ill cry)

***""Not one example of a happy couple made up of boys. How were we supposed to know what to do? Did we even believe that we deserved to get away with happiness?""***

***""I’ve held on to the idea of us, scanning faces for a scrap of something known, searching for the familiar in the alien. When really, the familiar had already turned alien, and home had ceased being home. Both have gone on living and changing without me.""***

books,"Can someone explain ""The Silence"" by Don DeLillo to me?","I just DNF'd it at about 70% (which is saying something because the audiobook is only two hours long) because I could not make heads or tails of *anything* that was happening.  I've also never read a Don DeLillo novel, and I'm gathering that this was not the place to start.

Am I not smart enough for this book, or is it just pretentious nonsense??

books,What novel/series do you think uses the multiple POV most successfully and how?,"I recently finished the first novel in the expanse series after finishing the live action tv adaptation and am about to start the second book and it made me wonder about the use of multiple PoV characters. 

In the book with the exception of the epilogue the first novel has a dual PoV which I think was used very well. But when comparing to the show. Which is very much an ensemble series where you see so much of the world and better expands things that either happen off screen or we’re never mentioned. 

In later books I believe the authors increase the amount of PoV characters which I imagine will be for the benefit of the story. 

What do you think is the best use of this writing style?  Why did it work there. Do you think there is a risk of the story being convoluted.

books,"Just Finished ""Second Child"" by John Saul.","This was a difficult read, but not for the supernatural aspect. I'm glad I finished it, but I don't know if I want to read any more John Saul if this is a common theme in his books.

&gt;!First of all, it's ridiculous and heartbreaking the level of abuse that Melissa undergoes. Everything from her overly-critical and abusive, insane mother, to her jealous half-sister, to the other kids just plain not liking her for literally no reason. ""She's weird"" isn't a good reason, but it's an incredibly common reason that kids use to push other kids to the fringes of high school society. She's quiet because she's suffering, but she's also suffering because she's quiet. It's heart-breaking! !&lt;

&gt;!That being said, I feel like most of the characters are more caricatures, and are difficult to truly relate to. Overly Abused And Disliked Introvert Girl, Snobby Rich Teenage Clique, Evil And Conniving Half-Sister, on and on and on. But none take the cake more than Phillis, Melissa's natural mother and abuser. She is 100% insufferable! Within the first chapter or two, \*I\* wanted to throw her out the window! Good grief, how ridiculous can you get? So it's incredibly infuriating that though she was finally extracted from Melissa's life at the very end, nothing worse happened to her. I wanted her to be thrown from the attic window, impaled on a fence, feral animals eating her limbs, and then a 747 crashes on her nose-first! THAT'S what that lady deserved! !&lt;

&gt;!But let's forget Phillis for a moment, and talk about Teri, the evil half-sister. What bugs me is that no one - NO ONE - even kind of wondered how her house caught on fire in the beginning. I feel that was a bit unrealistic, even for the 1980s. I feel like firefighters worth their salt would have figured out, hey, someone *set* these fires! I was really surprised that it was never addressed, like at *all.* Very weird. That being said, I liked how she got her come-uppance, though I would have loved a suicide note confessing to all the crazy crap she did would have been a great cherry on top. But maybe the indication was that, because Melissa got ALL her memories back in the end, somehow it all came to light. I don't know. !&lt;

&gt;!Charles. The Dad. I can't say much, except he has the ""Clueless Father"" syndrome that a lot of dads in horror featuring children usually have. It's incredibly irritating. Added to this somewhat, how Melissa is able to be bruiseless and woundless in a friggin' bathing suit the day after her mother hurts her fairly prominently is a mystery. I thought for sure that it would lead to Dad seeing the bruises, etc., and might give him a clue about what was going on....but NOPE! Very strange. !&lt;

  
In the end, it wasn't the worst I've ever read, but it was far from the best. A fun read if you like slightly supernatural horror, but not fun if you don't like extensive stories of realistic, blood-boiling levels of child abuse.

Created by scientists, it is let loose in the town in a terrifying conspiracy, it can unlock the human mind's most deadly potential. And now a few innocent people are caught in a nightmare that is all too real, with death being the only cure.

This one's pretty tight and a little bit shorter, at about 308 pages. But it is very fast paced, a real pressure cooker of a story that builds up really quickly. And there are some pretty brutal moments in this book too, and I do mean brutal! Got a bit more horror, especially a little bit of psych-horror, along with the thriller with this one.

Koontz draws upon the world of psychology and even history for this one, and that adds a bit of realism to it. On the last two pages is a reference table on some of the works on psychology, and so forth, that he used for research for it. And still it is a really good and really intense horror thriller, that also leans on the psychological side of things.",i-the-muso-1968,1h27v93,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h27v93/chills_in_the_night_dean_koontzs_night_chills/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h27v93/chills_in_the_night_dean_koontzs_night_chills/,2024-11-28 22:53:48,23,0.77,23,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h27v93
books,The Prince by Machiavelli is not Satire ,"I have heard a lot of people online claim that the Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli is Satire, this couldn't be further from the truth. There are very few serious historians that make this claim. There are a few reasons that people arrive at this conclusion, the most serious of which is that the philosophy of the Prince clashes with his other writing like the Discourses. In the Prince Machiavelli writes a handbook for authoritarian nobles to gain and maintain power, while all his other writings indicate that he's a staunch republican. However, Machiavelli is a realist, democracy was a far-fetched dream in renaissance Italy, He prioritized stability and reunification above all else. 

“How we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall.”

I can't help but feel that a lot of these claim arise from an inner desire to deny the realities outlined for the book or from discomfort with the amoral view it represents ""it must be satire"". Machiavelli backs all his claims with good reasoning, and the book was never meant to be published for a public audience, if it wasn't for his premature death we might've never read it. 

Another claim that frustrates me is that the Prince is only relevant within its context, Machiavelli makes a lot of broad philosophical claims about the nature of Power that apply in different context, it's more than just a manual for Princes.

books,Griffin and Sabine,"Has anyone else read these books? They are so beautiful… They really impacted me a lot when I was growing up. 

Especially because for many years, I only had the first book! I actually had no idea it was a trilogy until a couple years ago…

If you’ve read the books, you can imagine how much darker the story would be if it just ended after the first one. I was maybe 7 or 8 when I first read it, and the &gt;!fight club-esque!&lt; nature of the ending was totally mind-blowing to me. It was absolutely the darkest thing I had ever read at that point, and it made me feel ways about stuff for a long time. It was sad, but also so profound and beautiful. 

When I found out there were two more books, I read them as soon as I could. I liked them too.. Honestly though, I kind of preferred the stark ending I had grown up with, where &gt;!It becomes clear that Griffin is a man descending into loneliness and depression, and that Sabine is a figment of his imagination. The last 2 letters, and the final post script note always gave me goosebumps.!&lt; 

It’s so good! If yall haven’t read these books, I would highly recommend checking them out. And if you do, try reading the first book as a stand-alone story

books,TIL Napoleon hated novels but secretly wrote his own edgy romance full of cuckoldry and emo vibes,"I recently spent an evening reading Clisson and Eugénie, a romantic novel written by Emperor Napoleon in his youth—a humorous and self-indulgent work penned during his early years. This piece offers an intriguing glimpse into the ""edgy teenage soul"" of a man who would later conquer Europe.



The Plot (Brace Yourself for Peak Napoleon)

The story revolves around Clisson, a genius born for the battlefield (ahem, self-insert alert), portrayed as cold yet kind-hearted. Through military achievements and undeniable charisma (sounds familiar?), he quickly ascends the ranks. But Clisson doesn’t just crave glory; he also yearns for idealized love. He meets the pure-hearted Eugénie, falls madly in love, and they vow eternal devotion before settling down for an idyllic countryside life.



Of course, fate intervenes. Duty to his homeland pulls Clisson away to war. While he wins victories on the battlefield, his domestic life crumbles spectacularly. Eugénie develops feelings for a ""nice-guy"" subordinate officer, turning Clisson into a tragic, heartbroken general in the middle of a war.



The pièce de résistance? Clisson’s emo spiral concludes with him meeting his end by letting ""thousands of merciless bullets pierce his body."" (Excuse me, how many? Thousands?) And thus, he dies as a ""noble and heroic"" figure. The tragic irony is that this melodramatic plot mirrored Napoleon’s real life—not once, but multiple times—as his relationships and two marriages fell apart due to infidelity. Turns out, ""cuckold literature"" might have been a subconscious prophecy.



Napoleon’s Teenage Energy, Encapsulated

Clisson and Eugénie is clearly Napoleon’s edgy self-insert novel. Clisson’s every trait—from his military brilliance to his unwavering passion—seems like the young Napoleon slapping on labels he wished for himself. The overly idealized romance reeks of a ""sexually frustrated teenage fantasy"" from a man who hadn’t yet figured out love.



But credit where it’s due—Napoleon later achieved things most fictional heroes could only dream of. He might have been bad at writing novels, but he was extraordinary at living like one.



""The Emperor of Edginess""

Let’s be real: Napoleon’s literary talent was... lacking. His writing is clunky, awkward, and reads like a disjointed diary entry. Some passages are so cringe-worthy they’d make middle-school fanfic look polished. Perhaps his disdain for novels—dismissing them as ""servants' reading material unworthy of a real man""—stemmed from his own struggles as a failed novelist. Sour grapes much?



Ironically, this same young Napoleon read Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther—a quintessential romantic tragedy—seven times and still found time to criticize Werther for committing suicide. Imagine the scene: Napoleon, now ruler of Europe, debating plot points with Goethe himself. When Napoleon boldly proclaimed, ""Werther should never have killed himself,"" Goethe could only respond, ""Perhaps novels don’t need endings.""



From Cringe to Charm: Why We Love Napoleon

This is where Napoleon’s charm lies: imagining yourself as an impossibly perfect hero is cringeworthy, but actually becoming that hero? That’s emperor material.



(At this point, I can’t help but marvel: Napoleon’s novel was painfully bad, but somehow, even the cuckoldry became real. Is this man’s life a cosmic inside joke?)



A Hypothetical Twist of Fate

If Napoleon had married Désirée and settled in a countryside château with a lovely garden (as hinted at in his letters), the Napoleon we know today might never have existed. And we have Désirée’s brother—who demanded too high a dowry—to thank for that twist of destiny. Life is a blend of blessings and curses; you never know what’s waiting just around the corner.



(Also, starting to suspect Napoleon had a thing for unfaithful wives—his obsession with the charming and flirtatious Josephine was definitely a choice.)



Bonus Embarrassment: Talleyrand’s Reading Session

As a final jab, picture Talleyrand, Napoleon’s wily advisor, reading Clisson and Eugénie aloud in front of the emperor himself. Napoleon’s toes probably curled so hard they could’ve carved the Tuileries Palace into the floor.



PS: Napoleon thought novels were ""maidservants' reading material,"" but he read them anyway. So maybe, deep down, Napoleon always believed he was the maidservant.",Illustrious-Most6097,1h10dri,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h10dri/til_napoleon_hated_novels_but_secretly_wrote_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h10dri/til_napoleon_hated_novels_but_secretly_wrote_his/,2024-11-27 09:18:29,1007,0.94,1007,0,108,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h10dri
books,Do you sometimes wish you knew less about an author?,"Though sometimes I like to know more about an author, on average I would say I like to know less. I want the book to speak for itself. I'm talking about fiction here by the way.

In my experience, so often details about a fiction author are distracting or reduce my enjoyment of the book because they take me out of the world of the story and into reality. This is particularly the case if I really like the book. It's sort of like not wanting to see the sausage being made. Again, there are exceptions, but that's a general pattern I've noticed.

I do try to avoid information about an author's personal life but that's not always easy. Sometimes people tell me things. Other times it's all over the news. I mean think of the sexual allegations against Neil Gaiman.

Someone I was chatting with online told me that her father had recently learned that a favorite author of his had been many years ago quite vocal about their personal political beliefs and these beliefs happened to be very much opposite to his. Feeling terribly upset, her father threw out the books of the author, stories that had brought him comfort and joy for so many years and had nothing to do with politics. She thought that was crazy. I said I think so too, yet I understand the father a little too.

In a way, it's dumb to say I don't know want to know things about an author, because that's like denying reality. But can anybody relate? Maybe you had similar feelings? Or if the opposite, have there been books that you came to like only after learning things about the author?",minor_celebrity,1h11hwm,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h11hwm/do_you_sometimes_wish_you_knew_less_about_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h11hwm/do_you_sometimes_wish_you_knew_less_about_an/,2024-11-27 10:41:17,568,0.89,568,0,680,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h11hwm
books,Lapvona by Otessa Moshfegh— what exactly IS Ina?,"**This post really isn’t about how grotesque the book is. It’s strange how enraged that aspect of the novel makes people, anyway. Just close the book. Stop reading it.***

Ina obviously has some sort of spiritual power. She’s lived longer than is humanly possible, especially in medieval times, and seemed to have only minor issues replacing her eyeballs with horse eyeballs. She is imbued with a power that I have not been able to determine the source of. She fits the bill of a “witch” character: a deep knowledge of flora &amp; fauna, a secluded home, public distrust.

My personal theory is that Ina is an agent of chaos in nature. I can’t tell if Satan himself is influencing her or what, but she was able to regain youth and lactation abilities by the end of the book. The stunt where she threatens Grigor’s life is hard to pin down, as it could be seen as an actual example of her powers or, more simply, just how persuasive she is with words.

What could she be, then, if not human? I doubt she is a human but am not convinced she’s the devil or a run-of-the-mill witch, either.

books,Fear and Trembling- Kierkegaard gave me ANXIETY ,"Fear and Trembling shook me to my core.  I picked it up to grapple with the story of Abraham, which had always troubled me. It wasn’t so much an ethical dilemma in my view, WELL at least not in the Quranic version, where Abraham asks Ishmael for consent, and Ishmael accepts. While still unsettling, this portrayal felt less harrowing to me than the biblical account. My deeper concern, however, lay in the tension between human judgment and blind faith. Little did I know how unprepared for what Kierkegaard had to say.

Faith, Kierkegaard argued, is fundamentally irrational **a leap into the absurd**. That idea terrified me. How can one immerse oneself in faith if there’s no clear path to what to believe? And how can one discern what to believe in without reason? His vision of faith, unmoored from rationality, left me deeply unsettled. Even more chilling was the realization that faith, when wielded by brilliant minds, can justify unspeakable evils (I couldn’t help but think of the antagonists in 1984 and Fahrenheit 451).

As I read on, frustration grew. My brain hurt as I wrestled with ideas I couldn’t fully grasp, but perhaps that was Kierkegaard’s point: faith isn’t meant to be understood. Yet, somewhere in the tangle of his words, a glimmer of understanding emerged. Kierkegaard wasn’t dismissing reason. Instead, he argued that faith begins where reason reaches its limits. I looked inward and saw this dynamic within myself: reason and belief in the absurd somehow coexisting, each feeding the other.

Then came the concept of the “teleological suspension of the ethical”  and I hated it at first. It clashed violently with everything I believed, especially my conviction that ethics are immutable. The idea that morality could be set aside for a divine purpose felt like a betrayal of the very foundations of what it means to be human. But as much as I resisted it, Kierkegaard’s argument began to work its way into my thoughts, unsettling and transforming me.

It forced me to confront uncomfortable questions: Could there be situations where our human sense of morality isn’t the ultimate guide? Is there a higher purpose that transcends our limited understanding of right and wrong? I didn’t want to accept these ideas, yet they lingered, challenging my certainties. This concept didn’t destroy my belief in ethics but added complexity to it. It changed me by making me see the tension between the absolute and the relative, the divine and the human, and how faith demands that we navigate these contradictions without resolution.

By the time I finished the book, my brain was **fried**. I can’t help but think Fear and Trembling is a dangerous book. Taken the wrong way, Kierkegaard’s arguments could easily justify horrors. Misinterpretation isn’t just possible, it’s inevitable in the hands of the wrong reader.

books,Cormac McCarthy love,"I was in a reading slump for several years and clawed my way out of it with some fun and engaging but not too challenging books like Hyperion by Dan Simmons and the Southern Reach books by Jeff Vandermeer. Great books, really fun, good pacing and easy to read. But nothing too heady or intellectually rigorous.  

Even still, after five years or more of only reading for work or reading news articles, my attention span was shot and I had to set mini goals to keep reading. Like I wouldn’t let myself stop until I read 5 pages, or until I got to the next page break, or the end of a chapter. As a voracious reader in my twenties and early 30s (I’m 43 now) I was shocked by how much difficulty I had finishing a chapter from a simple book. I DNF’d more books than I’d care to admit before getting back in the saddle, so to speak. 

Which brings me to this guy I had never heard of called Cormac McCarthy. Holy effing shit how did I live 43 years without hearing of this guy Cormac McCarthy. I picked up No Country for Old Men on a whim. I had watched the film over the summer when my wife and I went on a Coen brothers film spree. The movie was good, the book blew me away. The depiction of Anton, particularly toward the end of the novel, was one of the most chilling and engrossing things I’d ever read, and led to me significantly reorient my conception of the human experience. Wow! Blew me away. 

Since then I’ve read Outer Dark and All the Pretty Horses. Outer Dark was bleak as hell and not something I’d want to repeat, but All the Pretty Horses immediately became one of my favorite books of all time. The way this man could paint a picture in my brain is beyond impressive. I don’t understand at all his talent for words. I don’t know how a person can put a few sentences together in such a way that I can read them again and again and get more out of it every time. He accomplishes so much with no wasted words or thoughts. The meticulous care it must take to craft such a thing is not something I can understand, but I sure appreciate it as a reader. And the final scene… holy shit I probably read the last two pages a dozen times. 

I’m a few chapters into The Crossing right now and so far it’s also beautiful and highly evocative. I’m planning to finish this trilogy and then move onto The Road and Blood Meridian. I will probably read a few lighter books in amongst those, for the sake of my sanity.

books,Ten year passing of P.D. James,"P.D. James (1920.08.20 - 2014.11.27) was considered by many to be the eminent British detective fiction author during her career. 

Since today marks the tenth year of her passing I felt the need to make this post. I hope you enjoy it. 

I recall watching an interview with her at the end of one of the many Masterpiece Theatre productions of her Adam Dalgliesh detective novels. She stated that when on vacation she would come across a town/city/ village that seemed an ideal location for a novel. Later she would return to the location for a longer visit writing down descriptions of interesting features of the location and  inhabitants to use in her next novel. I thought that it was a superb way to ground a work of fiction in reality. 

In 2008 she published the mystery novel ""The Private Patient"". I recall reading an interview in which she stated that it would be her last novel. She was afraid that it she continued writing at her advanced age the level of her work might drop off and disappoint her fans. I thought how sad to realize that after such a long career to realize it was time to quit. 

Imagine my surprise a few years later (2011) when I came across an advert for her new novel, ""Death Comes to Pemberly"". I immediately searched for an interview with her to explain this backtracking of her earlier declaration. She explained that she did previously believe she was done with writing. However she had long been a devotee of Jane Austen and had at one time considered writing a ""Pride and Prejudice"" sequel. She remarked that she discovered that her mind would not let her rest until the idea came to fruition. She realized that many Austenites would be upset with her for bringing death to Pemberly, but she stated ""it is what I do"". 

While reading ""Death Comes to Pemberly"" I realized that here was a novelist in her 90s that was still an excellent writer. Not only had she produced a remarkable ""Pride and Prejudice"" sequel, but that she had intentionally written it in the style of Austen. I can only hope that my own mind is still active enough in my 90s to be able to read such outstanding literature.",Knight1errant,1h16zfd,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h16zfd/ten_year_passing_of_pd_james/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h16zfd/ten_year_passing_of_pd_james/,2024-11-27 15:32:20,45,0.92,45,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h16zfd
