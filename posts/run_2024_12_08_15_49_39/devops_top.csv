devops,How hard actually is the CKA exam itself?,"Asking here because cert discussion is banned in the main Kubernetes sub, and the K8S cert sub is a ghost town.

How difficult is the CKA exam itself? I have sat through the Kodekloud CKA course mock exams, and although they were tough at first, after a redo on each I got a high enough score to be satisfied.

The killer.sh stuff was insane though. Incredibly tough stuff; thankfully they give the disclaimer that it's tougher than the real exam. But how much tougher?

How tough is the real exam compared to these resources? Would appreciate the input of anyone who has sat it. Although I know the course content back to front, I still struggle when approaching mock exams for the first time, due to a combination of silly mistakes and being absolutely awful at problem solving for the troubleshooting section.

Would greatly appreciate if anyone has any input on this.",topbananaman,1h97y3a,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h97y3a/how_hard_actually_is_the_cka_exam_itself/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1h97y3a/how_hard_actually_is_the_cka_exam_itself/,2024-12-08 01:45:50,64,0.97,64,0,26,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h97y3a
devops,Company blocks all downloads; how the fuck am I supposed to do my job?,"I recently started working at a big law firm as part of a four-person DevOps team, and I'm honestly losing my mind. Everything is locked down. I mean, I literally can't download anything. Want zsh? Nope. WSL for a Linux-y environment? Not happening. Need Python scripts or any files from any github repos? Also nope. Need kubens, or any other kubectl plugins? No chance. Want to be an administrator on your own computer? Not gonna happen. ChatGPT to speed up basic scripting tasks? Hah, forget it. Even Chrome extensions are off-limits.

This is all because of the strict security guidelines implemented by the security and networking team. And every single time I want to do something like use some github repo to automate my work I need to open a request to the security team who are physically in a different building and it takes *days* for them to respond. And the answer is usually no!

The pay is great, but I'm stuck doing a bunch of manual work that I know I could finish in a fraction of the time if I had the right tools. Is this normal at big companies—or am I just in some kind of corporate IT nightmare?

I’m genuinely curious about what the DevOps experience in this regard has been like for other folks here.

devops,What's makes a hard problem to solve ? ,"Setting up a high-availability cluster with load balancing might seem like a tough challenge for some, but for a DevOps engineer who works with Kubernetes daily, it might not be that difficult.

Recently, I came across a post where someone claimed to monitor developer productivity by counting commits and merges.

Most responses were along the lines of, ""Some developers solve hard problems, while others just color-code buttons.""

It got me thinking: what actually makes a problem ""hard""? How do we determine whether a problem is genuinely difficult? Can problem difficulty be categorized or measured numerically?

devops,"Seeking feedback on multi-repo, environment-based infra and schema management approach for my SaaS","Hi everyone,

I’m working on a building a SaaS product and undergoing a bit of a AWS design shift with how I manage infrastructure, database, and application code. Initially, I planned on having each service (like a Telegram-based bot or a web application) manage its own database layer and environment separately. But I’m realizing this leads to complexity and duplication.

Instead, I’m exploring a different approach:

**Current Idea:**

1. **Two postgres database environments (dev/prod), one shared schema:** I’ll provision a single dev database and a single prod database via one dedicated infrastructure repo. Both my Telegram bot service *and future web application* will connect to the same prod database in production, and the same dev database in development. No separate DB per service, just per environment.
2. **Separate repos for services vs. infra:**
   * One repo for infrastructure (provisioning the RDS instances, VPC, any shared lambda's for the APIs etc.). This repo sets up dev and prod databases as a “platform” layer right?
   * Individual application repos for the bot and webapp code. Each service repo just points to the correct environment variables or secrets (e.g., DB endpoint, credentials) that the infra repo provides.
3. **Schema migrations as a separate pipeline:** Database schema migrations (e.g., Flyway scripts) live in the infra repo or a dedicated “schema” repo. New features that require schema changes are done by first updating the schema at the “platform” level. Services are updated afterward to use those new columns/tables. For destructive changes, I’d do phased rollouts: add new columns first, update the code to not rely on old ones, then remove the old columns in a later release.

**Why do I think this is good?**

* It keeps a single source of truth for the database schema and environments, I can have one UserTable that is used both for Telegram users and Webapp users (part of the feature of the SaaS, is that you get both the Telegram interface and a webapp interface)
* Reduces the complexity of maintaining multiple databases for each (front-end) service.
* Allows each service to evolve independently while sharing a unified data layer.

**Concerns:**

* It’s a BIG mindset shift. Instead of tightly coupling a service’s code and database together, I’m decoupling them into separate repos and pipelines and don't want any drift between them. If I update one I'm not sure how it will work together.
* Changes feel more complex: a DB schema update might require a migration in the infra repo, then code changes in each service’s repo. Or a new feature in the webapp might need to change the way the database, and so impact on the telegram bot SQL
* Ensuring backward compatibility and coordination between multiple services that depend on the same DB.

I’d love any feedback on this design approach. Is this a reasonable path for a small but growing SaaS, or am I overcomplicating it? Have others adopted a similar “infra as a platform” pattern with centralized schema management and how did it work out?

devops,Handling deployments to offline environments,"Hi!
A really interesting problem came up when discussing a new project with my company.
It's the case where deployments are not continuous but happen only 1-2 times a year. However, there's a big specific: all end environments are Windows based and are offline until there's a time for an upgrade.

They're currently doing manual deployments via VPN and RDP where connection is granted only for the time of an upgrade. There's also another issue: not all environments use the same VPN client.

Any ideas on how to tackle a case like this one?
We're currently doing deployments to internal environments with on-prem GitLab CI/CD but my fear is that GitLab itself won't be enough to do something like that.

I'm of course open to totally new ideas and means of achieving the optimal result.

Each branch contained a 130MB zip file.

3. When pushing, I encountered an error stating the file exceeded the limit, referencing the old path with a space.



To address this:

1. I checked out each branch, removed spaces in the file path, and updated tracking.


2. Cleared the cache and ran git prune on each branch.


3. Added the zip file to .gitignore in all branches.
