programming,JavaScript Interactive Quiz,"For my JS interview, I was bored of scrolling through the GitHub repo of some famous JS trivia questions repo so ended up creating an interactive JS Quiz game. 

Though I wanted to learn, I hardly learnt anything, spent entire time building this.

(In my defence, I spend time playing JS quiz instead of scrolling Reddit while in toilet)
 
I know this is nothing fancy, but might help you to revise concepts before the interview.

Feedback, Suggestions, PR welcome.
