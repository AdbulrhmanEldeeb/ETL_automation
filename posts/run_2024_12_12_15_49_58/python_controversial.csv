Python, Just started a course and am starting to learn. Need a small clarification.,"So i just got introduced to adding variables, and the fact that you cannot add variables of different types like string and intger. the tutorial said use explict conversion by str(varible), eg. print( ""your total is "" + str(total)). But I acheived the same result by using print( ""your total is "", (total)). 

is this wrong or is there an advantage to using the conversion/",krithyk_2105,1hcj3d3,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcj3d3/just_started_a_course_and_am_starting_to_learn/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcj3d3/just_started_a_course_and_am_starting_to_learn/,2024-12-12 11:29:26,3,0.6,3,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcj3d3
Python,Can ya suggest small-yet-serious webscraping portfolio project ideas?,"I wanna do a real project with Python and webscraping. Doesn't have to be big or fancy, nor bring me money, I just wanna take it seriously, reason being I wanna learn both python and webscraping.

What is one of the easiest, simplest projects on the matter that'll give me valid experience on these subjects? Maybe not an exact idea, but types of ideas to do. Something that once complete someone can ask me ""hey can you work with this"" and I can say ""yes""?

Python,My First Python Project: URL to NDEF Converter! 🎉,"Hi everyone,

I’m thrilled to share my first Python project, **url2ndef**, a tool that converts URLs into NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) messages. You can use these messages to program NFC tags.

GitHub: [url2ndef](https://github.com/brunoooost/url2ndef)

# What My Project Does

This script takes a URL as input and encodes it into the NDEF format, which is compatible with NFC-enabled devices. It’s a simple and lightweight way to prepare data for NFC tags, whether you’re working on IoT applications, marketing use cases, or just having fun with NFC tech.

# Target Audience

This is primarily a **learning project** but could also be useful for:

* Beginners interested in Python or NFC tech.
* Developers exploring NFC-related applications.
* Hobbyists looking for a simple tool to work with NFC tags.

It’s not production-ready, but I hope it can serve as a foundation or inspiration for others!

# Comparison

There are more advanced tools like NXP TagWriter or NFC Tools, but those are typically GUI-based and cater to broader use cases. **url2ndef** is purely a Python CLI script designed for simplicity and learning.

This was a great learning experience for me, and I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions for improvement. If you’re interested in NFC, let’s chat! Thanks for checking out my project. 😊",BST04,1hcjdg9,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcjdg9/my_first_python_project_url_to_ndef_converter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcjdg9/my_first_python_project_url_to_ndef_converter/,2024-12-12 11:48:05,4,0.83,4,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showcase,self,t3_1hcjdg9

`df.to_datetime(df['column'])`

`df = df.with_columns(`  
`pl.col(""column"").str.strptime(pl.Date, ""%d/%m/%Y"").alias(""column"")`

Python,python-json-logger has changed hands,"Hi r/python,

I wanted to introduce myself as the new maintainer of [python-json-logger](https://pypi.org/project/python-json-logger/) and hopefully establish a bit of trust.

Understandably there [has been some anxiety](https://github.com/madzak/python-json-logger/issues/187#issuecomment-2063184958) over the [PEP 541 Request ](https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/3607)that I submitted given the importance / popularity of the package -  especially in the context of the XZ Utils backdoor earlier in the year.

I think it's important to highlight that although this was prompted by the PEP 541 request, it was not done through PEP 541 mechanisms. In other words this was a decision by the original maintainer and **not** the PyPI Administrators.

For those wanting to know more about me (to prove that I'm not some statebased actor subverting the package), [I'm a security professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-hairs/) and [maintain a few other packages](https://github.com/nhairs). You might also have seen some of [my blog posts](https://www.nicholashairs.com/) on reddit.

Finally apologies if the newly released versions broke your things - despite my best efforts at testing and maintaining backwards compatibility it appears [some bugs managed to slip through](https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/issues/29).",nicholashairs,1hcm2rr,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcm2rr/pythonjsonlogger_has_changed_hands/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcm2rr/pythonjsonlogger_has_changed_hands/,2024-12-12 14:18:50,19,1.0,19,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1hcm2rr
