[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-jc-chandor-1236083842/) (20/100):

&gt;Punishingly dull.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):

&gt;I‚Äôve seen much worse comic-book movies than ‚ÄúKraven the Hunter,‚Äù but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn‚Äôt stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That‚Äôs a dereliction of duty, but it‚Äôs one I didn‚Äôt commit on purpose. I simply hadn‚Äôt bothered to think about it.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):

&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don‚Äôt even feel like they take place in the same *film*, ‚ÄúKraven the Hunter‚Äù might be very, very bad (and by ‚Äúmight be‚Äù I mean ‚Äúalmost objectively is‚Äù), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today‚Äôs audiences might consider as ‚Äúgood.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):

&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

&gt;Crowe‚Äôs safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there‚Äôs not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it‚Äôs best that this misbegotten series quits while it‚Äôs just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.
