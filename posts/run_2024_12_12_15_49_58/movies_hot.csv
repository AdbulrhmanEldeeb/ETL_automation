[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-jc-chandor-1236083842/) (20/100):

&gt;Punishingly dull.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):

&gt;I‚Äôve seen much worse comic-book movies than ‚ÄúKraven the Hunter,‚Äù but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn‚Äôt stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That‚Äôs a dereliction of duty, but it‚Äôs one I didn‚Äôt commit on purpose. I simply hadn‚Äôt bothered to think about it.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):

&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don‚Äôt even feel like they take place in the same *film*, ‚ÄúKraven the Hunter‚Äù might be very, very bad (and by ‚Äúmight be‚Äù I mean ‚Äúalmost objectively is‚Äù), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today‚Äôs audiences might consider as ‚Äúgood.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):

&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

&gt;Crowe‚Äôs safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there‚Äôs not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it‚Äôs best that this misbegotten series quits while it‚Äôs just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

movies,The Most 80's 80's Movie,"Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. 

  
I figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. 

  
So, for example....

  
Back To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. 

  
Top Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks ""80s""

  
But Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there. 

  
Can anyone beat Rocky 4 for ""Most 80's 80's Movie?""",Super-Cry5047,1hcnzzy,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcnzzy/the_most_80s_80s_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcnzzy/the_most_80s_80s_movie/,2024-12-12 15:49:15,3,0.71,3,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hcnzzy

movies,The Wackness (2008) nails the 90s New York atmosphere. ,"If you don't know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it's worth the hour and 40 minutes.
 

First of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography.  The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. 

Most of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my view you could see Dr Squires trying to help Luke so he doesn't become him. I think the movie shows that if Luke is in the same direction he is in he will end up like Squires. Honesty Luke and Squires have the best chemistry and scenes together. And the way they written Squires wife relationship and Luke and Stephanie relationship is great.
 
It also has a great soundtrack. If you love 90s hiphop the film and actually fits in with the movie well. 

And the movie has great commentery. The movie portrays 90s New York problems well with Rudy Giuliani drug war aganist weed as a supporting part of the story. 


The only problem i have is Josh Pecks acting. I think this is one of those rare times where a character is written well but the actor isn't great. Josh Peck does more better in comedic roles and his acting isn't good in this film. I don't know how you describe it but Josh Peck has trouble portraying a pot head in this story. 


Anyway I love this film, The cinematography is great, the music is great, the writing is good, and despite Josh Pecks performance, I think everyone else did a good job.

I'm surprised he hasn't had a itch to remake or continue Legend (1985) Since it was his forth movie he did.

movies,Watching Dead Man (1995) and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) back-to-back is a unique experience,"*Dead Man* is an acid western in which a wounded accountant named William Blake teams up with a strange Native American man named Nobody, who happens to be a fan of the artist William Blake and believes the accountant is a vengeful reincarnation of the more famous Blake. The movie plays with western tropes, but it is mostly a somber meditation on death.

*Ghost Dog* is more modern and less bizarre, but it explores many of the same themes and features a similarly heightened reality in which a masterful modern assassin takes strong influence from the Hagakure as he works for (and then against) a bunch of old wiseguys.

They're both unconventional independent action-thrillers by Jim Jarmusch. Both feature a protagonist who acts as a personification of death, often effortlessly killing various stereotypes (cowboys, gangsters). Both films are very philosophical and artistic, but in different ways.

In addition to death and philosophy, the two films are also quite amusing. Jarmusch's dry sense of humor contrasts well with the dark plots full of murder. I like that there's nothing flashy about either movie's world. Dead Man makes the old west feel like a dirty and miserable playground for deranged weirdos, and in Ghost Dog the modern city run by gangsters looks totally mundane and unglamorous, an environment plagued by elderly has-been punks with guns.

The subdued reality of the world and its villains allows the heightened reality of the heroes to shine. There's nothing really superhuman about Blake or Ghost Dog, but the way they intensely associate themselves with death and the fatalism that breeds puts them on another level than the basic bad guys they do battle with.

This was very easy for me in the last round: I can't announce a winner yet, because the 24 hours aren't up yet (I'm a bit early today, as I have plans for later - yes, there is an RL outside of Reddit), so stay tuned, but all in all, Ukraine is still and hopefully will continue to be an independent country. But when it comes to today's country, it is sometimes a little difficult to understand, at least for me as an outsider.

I know, I know, Wikipedia can never be the last source, but let's take a look on it here. When it comes to the UK, it clearly says:

&gt;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.

At the same time, you can read on another article:

&gt;Since 1922, the United Kingdom has been made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales (which collectively make up Great Britain) and Northern Ireland (avoriously described as a country, province, jurisdiction or region.

Further internet research has shown that not only for me as a non-native speaker, but also for the British themselves, it is sometimes not so clear where their country begins and their state ends. Even here in the discussion group I have even read that the UK is not a country at all, then again that it is a country made up of several countries (sometimes by one and the same person). It's all quite confusing, but I think I've found a solution that I can live with.

Today we're going to start with films set in **England**. Over the next few days, we'll do the same with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On the fifth day, the respective individual winners will then compete against each other again, so that we have a winner for the UK, but also winners for the individual ‚Äòsub-countries‚Äô. I think that's a lot of effort, but hey, even if I think the UK members should sort out once and for all whether they want to be federal states or separate countries, I can't ignore the actual situation. In return, I ask you not to ignore the following two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"Opinion / discussion: examples of iconic actors (and well written roles I guess) are those who only played a very small movie part, but feel like were much bigger! ","I posted this is r/television, but then thought maybe there are examples in movies too! Original post below:

For example: I was amazed to learn that Shelly Long, who played DeDe Pritchett (ex wife of Jay) in Modern Family, only appeared in 8 episodes (out of the total 250)! I really couldn‚Äôt believe it when I read that. I would have never guess that and felt like she really made such an impact that I felt she was in way more episodes.

Another example is for me is Kathy Bates who played Jo Bennett in the office for 8 episodes as the CEO of Sabre (out of 188 episode total). Or can you imagine Game of Thrones without Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo? He was only in 11 episodes out of 73. 

Obviously as the title says it‚Äôs not only the actor but also how well written te part is, but still execution is key.

How do you guys feel about this opinion? Or do you feel it‚Äôs mostly how well written it is? Do you have any other examples?

movies,Highlander - What if Kurgan had won?  Could he really do anything?,"This is a very old movie with well know ending, so need to spoiler tag.   Don't read any further if you somehow haven't seen Highlander after 40 years.

There were lines in the movie where Ramirez (Sean Connery) warned Connor that they couldn't let The Kurgan win the prize, or mankind would enter a terrible darkness and never recover.

But what if Kurgan had beaten Connor, and won the prize?   What could he really have done to the world?  As we saw in Connor's closing comments during the ending, he became mortal.   He did say he ""knew everything"" and could basically understand everyone in the worlds feelings and intentions.

So if their worst fear came true and the Kurgan won - so what?  He is now mortal and can be killed.   How would he topple the worlds governments who were defended by massive Armies, war machines, and technology?  

The Kurgan would be the best swordsman in the world which would be meaningless in the 1980s.   He would have a great understanding of people and be able to manipulate SOME people do his bidding, but it doesn't seem like he could really surpass the level of ""local kingpin""

Any thoughts on what ""prize Kurgan"" could actually do to the world?

movies,David Lean‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrief Encounter‚Äù and my paradoxical experience watching ‚Äúclassic‚Äù films,"I have a hard time placing my genuine thoughts towards judging older films from before the 60s, mainly stuff around the Hays Code era, as a lot of them maintain a place in the film canon by having been ahead of their time, or at least timeless enough to still be watchable in 2024. Having seen Brief Encounter last night, I didn‚Äôt fall in love with it but there are some sparkingly modern filmmaking techniques and creativity that must‚Äôve been distinct at the time. I‚Äôm thinking of shots like the dream sequence Celia‚Äôs character has when reflected in the train window, it has this ethereal quality to it with the ornate lights that would feel very fitting to a new release today, and the ‚Äúmadness tilt‚Äù zoom on her when she contemplates suicide after the man leaves. Plus the whole recontextualisng of the beginning is very slickly done and easy to love. However, and this may be the jaded part of refusing myself emotional attachment to it, but like lots of classic revered titles I can‚Äôt tell if I like it for the film or the filmmaking. It‚Äôs difficult to decipher where my investment in the story ends with a recognition of how ahead-of-its-time a certain film was. 

This could be a wider humbug I have when it comes to my personal assessment of films in the ‚Äúcanon‚Äù and at the risk of overcomplicating matters, but when they have such a long reputation and are held up in every conversation about being essential viewing and/or revolutionary, it feels like an inevitable shadow on the film as I‚Äôm watching. I‚Äôm not just watching Brief Encounter, I‚Äôm watching David Lean‚Äôs universally acclaimed 1945 classic Brief Encounter. 

If this post ends up sounding more like an overly verbose rephrasing of ‚Äúletting expectations hamper my viewing experience‚Äù then apologies for that, but it‚Äôs an issue I encounter regularly whenever I dip my toes into this circle of the movie world.

movies,Recent movie styles/trends that you don't like? ,"I've noticed that most movies tend to become more of the same, especially this:

\- Action movie that tries to be nitty gritty? Lower the colors, make everything green/gray and film shaky hand style during the adrenaline/fight scene. During the 2000's, the movies would try to at least choreograph an admirable fight scene and the camera 's point of view would be at least steady

\- There are almost no epilogues for romantic movies. They basically roll the credits as soon the couple kiss. We don't get a moment to catch our breath or appreciate whatever is happening and boom the credits starts. The epilogues doesn't even need to be a 5 minute if you want to cheapen the budget. Just a minute or something to show what the future holds. Even the side characters doesn't really get their side plot resolved or hear about it what happened.

\- Movie intro. In the 90's en 00's, we would hear music, the introduction names start, we see the main character start their morning/life/moment and there is a minute of no talk. We just get a sense of what their life is before the main plot starts. Now it's bam, immediately start and it takes us a lot more minutes before finding out the gist and we have to remember everything because of possible plot relevance. And the title comes just before the credits roll.

\- Car riding scenes: 80's and early 90's could get away with this because the technology wasn't quite there yet: Green screen driving. Back then, they could hide this by filming in the dark and have the character sway the wheel furiously from left to right and back to indicate he/she is driving all while telling us the problem in thoughts. Nowadays they film with a green screen, especially when we see it from sideways. The scenery is also a bit blurry, giving us a stark contrast when the characters and the car itself is in crisp 4K quality. I see this style getting back more and more.

What is your thing that you don't like, that has been happening lately? I'm not asking about the main character grabbing a toast from a full breakfast spread and heading off examples.

movies,"After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?","After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?

Recently I watched the Indian movie ""Devara"" starring N. T. Rama Rao Jr. of RRR, and just like RRR the movie was astonishing. There's something about modern Indian movies of the last 15 years. The Aesthetic (?) is something else. I don't know any other word, because the movies are so unique. They way male characters stand on their word, the emphasis on concern for family and the community, the hero and villains' willingness to resort to cartoonish levels of violence, the preserving of women's virtues unless it's a colourful pop video in the middle and repeated fanfare when the hero appears or begins killing people. 

I always start laughing uncontrollably at these moments but I am throughly entertained! Are there any books or online articles that explain this style of filmmaking and why Indian producers believe or know this is what their audience responds to? The closest thing I can think of is like Michael Bay, but on a budget! Because I think the directors draw on a lot of elements of music videos &amp; commercials throughout the films through colour schemes, cinematography, family scenes, fight sequences and of course the pop songs. 

Are there any Hollywood movies made like these? I know Hollywood only just recognized RRR, but there must be something good about what the Indian filmmakers are doing as they show a hell of a lot more imagination and are determined to give their audiences spectacle on what is Hollywood mid-budgets.

movies,Deja Vu (2006),"So I just watched this, and I'm confused about the third act.

The movie very strongly suggests that there is only one, immutable timeline in the manner of 12 Monkeys.

We learn that the main character's partner is inexplicably killed in the ferry attack. Later we see the scientists send a warning back, which is intercepted by the partner and explains why he was killed. This is one timeline then: that note was *always* there for the partner to find

When the main character himself goes back in time, everything he does is stuff that already happened. His finger prints were found all over the house because he'd *always* traveled back in time to touch stuff. The bloody tissue was on the garbage because he'd *always* gone back in time to leave it there, etc. In this scene he realizes that this has always happened this way and then... suddenly changes things?

Did I miss something, or is this a glaring plot hole? He's been trying to use his knowledge of the future to change things for half the films runtime, only to be consistently thwarted with the realization that he'd *always* done those things. His foreknowledge consistently fails him because by trying to apply it, he's just ensuring that things happen the way they already happened. So how is he able to just suddenly change things at the end? What's different about that instance?",AnAquaticOwl,1hc4jdf,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc4jdf/deja_vu_2006/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc4jdf/deja_vu_2006/,2024-12-11 21:25:40,2,0.6,2,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1hc4jdf

movies,Just got done rewatching The Green Mile.,"The Green Mile is my favorite movie of all time, along with Fight Club and another Darabont/King film, The Shawshank Redemption. But what Mile has over Shawshank is the supernatural and stronger religious themes. 

I love all the characters here, with my favorite being Paul Edgecomb. His character arc and relationship with John Coffey is so sad, but also so sweet. The way he starts to believe in miracles and actually offers John a way out is such compelling character writing. As is his relationship with Brutus and Dean. 

Wild Bill is a threatening antagonist, and you truly learn to hate him. Very satisfying seeing him get what he deserves.

John Coffey is a true miracle of God. A man who heals and helps people, and who sees the good and bad in everyone on Earth. His death had me bawling like a baby, and his dialogue is some of the best in the film. His execution is my personal favorite scene in film history for how well-executed and emotional it is.

&gt;At the center of this all is a remarkable performance by Timothee Chalamet who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lyp-synching or blending of voices between actor and subject. It is all Chalamet in the same way¬†*Walk The Line*¬†was all Phoenix and Witherspoon, and¬†*Coal Miner‚Äôs Daughter*¬†was all Spacek.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-james-mangold-1236081991/) (70):

&gt;Whatever script flaws there are in terms of structure, plot momentum and an opaque central character,¬†*A Complete Unknown*¬†offers rewards in its lived-in performances and in the exhilarating music sequences that propel it forward. For many audiences with an affection for Dylan‚Äôs music and the era in general, that will be enough.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (39/100):

&gt;A superficial illustration of the artist‚Äôs allure, interspersed with endless, increasingly comical shots of people watching him perform and smiling beatifically.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation) (100):

&gt;Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It‚Äôs all rise, but troubled and unclear. You might not buy Chalamet‚Äôs Dylan at first; I didn‚Äôt, until that Guthrie bedside scene. There is amazing bravado in this performance.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/10/bob-dylan-movie-review-a-complete-unknown/76857860007/) (3.5/4):

&gt;‚ÄúA Complete Unknown‚Äù is that rare biopic that leaves you wanting to watch it again¬†*and*¬†go on a Spotify deep dive, and you're apt to find new respect both for Dylan as a bluesy contrarian and Chalamet as a top-shelf thespian of his generation.

[Collider](https://collider.com/a-complete-unknown-review/) (80):

&gt;James Mangold's A Complete Unknown explores the music of Bob Dylan with fantastic care and a great performance by Timoth√©e Chalamet.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan) (70):

&gt;Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold takes his hands off the steering wheel for A Complete Unknown, resulting in a Bob Dylan biopic that takes unpredictable turns. Rather than connecting the dots between how the world influenced him (and how he influenced it in turn), the film frames his enormous musical sea changes as personal drama for his peers. It‚Äôs formally straightforward, but its focus on the characters in Dylan‚Äôs life ‚Äì rather than the musician himself, played by Timoth√©e Chalamet ‚Äì turn him into an enigma, for better or worse.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-complete-unknown-bob-dylan-movie-review-b2661910.html) (60):

&gt;Despite the drip-fed reminders of contemporary history (the Cuban Missile Crisis! the Kennedy assassination! Weren‚Äôt the Sixties wild, man!), A Complete Unknown struggles to fully engage with Dylan‚Äôs relationship to that intersection between politics and music.

Written and Directed by James Mangold:

movies,Actors/Actresses who screwed up a comeback arc?,"Everyone loves a good comeback story. From sports to music and especially movies. Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, and soon probably Demi Moore and Pamela Anderson. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?

First one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.

Another example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo.

movies,Collateral ,"

At the beginning of the movie Vincent is walking through a airport and bumps into a character played by Jason Statham.  They both drop identical briefcases and then exchange them.  We then follow Vincent on his journey but we have never revisited what Jason‚Äôs character may have been off to.  It‚Äôs provides perfect foreshadowing for a second movie loosely based on the plot of the first one (drama with drug cartels, law enforcement, litigation etc).  I always thought that Michael Mann would revisit this moment.  He could start a movie with this exact scene again and then follow Jason‚Äôs character as Vincent walks off.  Thoughts?

movies,Challengers is possibly the worst movie I've seen this year. Why do people love it?,"I'm surprised to see that the critical reception for this movie was so high. Just had the displeasure of watching it in a flight and it was insanely boring.

First of all: it's artificially long. It's only over 2 hours because of excessive slow mo and cuts. That part near the end where Patrick gets warned for stalling and then it takes like 2 minutes for him to serve was infuriating to watch.
The soundtrack is all over the place, some random electronic beatsuthat are suddenly cut off.

The characters are all extremely unlikeable. Art is a major pushover with basically no will of its own, Patrick is a nihilistic womanizer, but Tashi takes the cake. She's probably the most selfish, shallow, self-absorbed and unnecessarily rude/hostile character I've seen in any film for the past years. Her entire purpose is to sow discord, she doesn't care about anyone but herself, she insists she's not a homewrecker but she spends the film symbolically and literally doing that

The plot goes absolutely nowhere, the whole fllm was just a vehicle to see which character you'd end up hating the most.

movies,"Pedro Almod√≥var's style and writing doesn't translate well in English in ""The Room Next Door""","I wanted to like Pedro Almod√≥var because Almod√≥var was my childhood idol when I became obsessed with Cinema and I identified with his vision. His worldwide success after Todo Sobre Mi Madre was exciting because the world could see his genius. 

For years, I've been wanting to see Almod√≥var cross over into English and after I got to watch ""The Room Next Door"", it might be a case of his style, his trademark, doesn't translate well into English. 

Because the way he writes and directs didn't change, it's always been slightly theatrical, big yet subtle at the same time when it comes with his writing, and in Spanish and the way Spanish actors accostumed with Almod√≥var are, it works, yet in English, it's distracting. It's more wooden and stagy and some of the dialogue comes off as contrived. 

Yet I wouldn't call ""The Room Next Door"" a bad film, because of the use of colors, the direction, the way Almod√≥var shoots scenes with symbolism and the importance of sets, and, of course, Tilda Swinton is excellent (as usual) as a dying woman who chooses euthanasia. She is fascinating and you can't take your eyes away from her. Julianne Moore is good, it's just, she's more of an observer, she exists to support Swinton, and as a result, her character ends up being underwritten. John Turturro shows up a few times to spout stuff about the world ending, I didn't like how forced his dialogue was. At one point, I thought the film was going to create a triangle when Swinton expresses interest in attending a event hosted by Turturro and it ends up being quickly interrupted.",Davis_Crawfish,1hc0ufi,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc0ufi/pedro_almod√≥vars_style_and_writing_doesnt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hc0ufi/pedro_almod√≥vars_style_and_writing_doesnt/,2024-12-11 18:51:10,0,0.36,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hc0ufi

&gt;Although not hitting us emotionally on the scale of the live action films, Kamiyama has produced a visual landscape that at times , through use of motion capture, models, and hand drawn animation do register a striking visual motif, not what we have previously associated with the cinematic efforts at Tolkein, but a world of its own merged with more allegiance to Jackson than Tolkein.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236243179/) (60):

&gt;For those who can‚Äôt get enough of Middle Earth, here‚Äôs two-plus hours of deep-cut backstory to feed your appetite, centered around a siege at the stronghold that would come to be known as Helm‚Äôs Deep (where we saw Saruman‚Äôs Orcs obliterated by Ents in ‚ÄúThe Two Towers‚Äù).

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (80):

&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore‚Äôs original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).

[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):

&gt;‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim‚Äù is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien‚Äôs appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm‚Äôs Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we‚Äôve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):

&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie‚Äôs greatest strength ‚Äî The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson‚Äôs LotR in the best way. It‚Äôs packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):

&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from ""The War of the Rohirrim."" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):

&gt;‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim‚Äù plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that‚Äôs unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It‚Äôs hard to get mad at this movie, but it‚Äôs oh so easy to be disappointed.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):

&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson‚Äôs trilogy ‚Äî few do ‚Äî but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.

[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):

&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth‚Äôs famous legends.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Ukraine,"Hello there,

I've been asking you for your favourite film every day for almost a month and a half now, and the journey is gradually coming to an end. Following an alphabetical order, in which the United Kingdom will soon be duly dissected, I arrived at the letter T yesterday. Today I can now announce the winner for Turkey: To be honest, I'm not familiar with ***Bir Zamanlar Anadolu‚Äôda*** (engl.: *Once Upon A Time in Anatolia*) yet, but it really s to touch the heart of this project and to provide an as entertaining as accurate look into the country.

When it comes to the next country, some would say that it is particularly important nowadays that films can offer us a real insight into the country's current condition: I'm talking about **Ukraine**. But please take note: Since *20 –¥–Ω—ñ–≤ —É –ú–∞—Ä—ñ—É–ø–æ–ª—ñ* (engl.: *20 Days in Mariupol*) would actually be an obvious suggestion as a prominent documentary film, I would like to explicitly point out  what was always implicitly clear to everyone in the previous rounds, namely that documentaries are excluded from [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). Apart from that, the following two rules apply as always:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Meet the Fockers 4,"With the recent announcement of Meet the Fockers 4 being in production, I would like to share the two ideas/predictions I had for what the plot will be. My girlfriend and I love the movies so we‚Äôre really excited for this fourth installment (I literally had not watched it until last year, safe to say I loved it). Also, regardless of what the movie is about, my girlfriend had a great idea for the name: ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs Focked‚Äù. I‚Äôll start with the best prediction my girlfriend and I came up with and then I‚Äôll throw in the second backup guess. The most likely thing that we see happening is a repeat of the first movie, but instead with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro WORKING TOGETHER to do the same thing that was done to Ben years ago. We pictured Stiller (or Greg) having a daughter, and him going through the same situation that Deniro (or Jack) was going through in the first movie. We think that either 

A.) Robert deniro will help stiller to investigate his daughters new bf with all of the gadgets and such he possesses
or 

B.) Greg realizes that he‚Äôs acting exactly like Jack, and even when he tries to stop himself, he can‚Äôt help but see the similarities (when it comes to their daughters)

The last throw away idea we had was a huge family reunion, where we see all of the aunts, uncles, and cousins from the Focker family, and they have to interact and get along with the cousins and such from the Byrnes family. Anyways, that was our ideas. Lmk what you think and whether you agree! Honestly, I think the first idea is very likely, and if it‚Äôs not done, then i think it would be a miss that they definitely should‚Äôve taken.

movies,Was the Duke of France gay in Elizabeth (1998). ,"Hey guys I hope you all are doing well. 
I was watching Elizabeth (1998) and am confused about a particular scene.
A Duke from France who happens to be the nephew of Mary of Guise comes to England to ask the hand of Queen Elizabeth for marriage. 

She of course is reluctant because of her ongoing affair with Lord Robert. 

Then during a party, she goes to the room of the Duke and catches him in a dress. He is drunk and dressed like woman. Does this imply that he was gay ? Or is this just a lord doing lord things. 

Also, she proceeds to extend her hand to be kissed by the Duke but he is obviously embarrassed by this. He reluctantly agrees and does not even kiss it properly. 
Why ? Can men in dress not kiss the hands of a Queen ? Why was he embarrassed and so reluctant for this. 

I hope to get answers to these two questions as I'm not European and not well aware of the customs of that region.

movies,The Real Reason Landa Kills Hammersmark - Inglorious Basterds,"Landa mentions after capturing Aldo that he was a detective before the war. I think this is supposed to be a clue for us that he can figure out what happened at the bar. He sees shoes on the ground, blood from a low impact shot, knows that whoever the shoes belong to was shot low, then laid on the ground for a while. 

He sees the corpse of Wilhelm ( guy with newborn son Max) lying not far away, with no weapon, and with some of his detective work, notices that Wilhelm has been shot from a low angle with a low-caliber pistol, from the spot where the blood and shoes are. He sees the napkin which confirms that Hammersmark knew that she was killing an un-armed man with a newborn son. 

Landa has already been shown not to kill without reason, and he seems to genuinely care about some people (like Shoshanna and the soldier at the end of the movie who is killed by Aldo). I think he proves to himself that Hammersmark killed a drunk, unarmed, and fearful new father, and regardless of what comes next, decides that she deserves to die for those actions. 

When Landa is asked what happens to Hammersmark, he says she got what she deserved. I think many would assume it's because she is a traitor, but that would make him a hypocrite a few moments later when he chooses to betray the Nazi regime. I think what he really means is that she got what she deserved for killing Wilhelm.

movies,La La Land‚Äôs (2016) ending sequence is one of the best uses of a no-dialogue scene in major modern film since the beginning of Up (2009),"I just finished a rewatch of La La Land and was reminded just how amazing the ending is, when Mia stumbles across Seb‚Äôs club and sees him for the first time since they parted ways all those years ago.

Despite having seen the movie before, the sequence that shows how one of them would‚Äôve ended up unhappy if they stayed together still manages to make a strong emotional impact. In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would‚Äôve played out in other circumstances, I can‚Äôt watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could‚Äôve been, and ill-fated love. 

The way that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were able to convey so much emotion through just their movements and facial expressions was a testimony to their talent. Of course, the slowed down piano version of City of Stars also plays in a big role in setting the mood for this scene and is a gorgeous score. It‚Äôs hard to think of another movie that captures such a perfect balance of being bittersweet. 

I know it‚Äôs strange to compare La La Land to an animated children‚Äôs movie, but I couldn‚Äôt help but thinking about Up (2009) while rewatching the ending. The beginning of Up that shows how Carl met and lost his wife with no dialogue had people of all age groups in tears when the movie was released. These two scenes are both uniquely special in the way they‚Äôre able to convey strong emotions and make an impact on the audience while using no dialogue. 

Barring actual silent films, can anyone else think of a scene in a movie that manages to pack an emotional punch with no dialogue on the level of La La Land and Up?

movies,I have a question about ‚ÄúThe substance‚Äù I seriously don‚Äôt this one thing. ,"If you haven‚Äôt noticed - spoiler ahead .

So when Elisabeth (Demi) is told about substance she is advise ‚Äúyou are one‚Äù with your other self, so I was watching the movie as if her consciousness has been transferred into Sue, however later in the movie I realised Elisabeth has no recollection of what Sue does when she was watching the interview on tv she was shocked and livid and clearly hearing it for the first time. Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth‚Äôs experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. 

But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it‚Äôs clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn‚Äôt? But the bigger question is if you are Elisabeth, you don‚Äôt actually get to experience being young again, you go to sleep for a week wasting away, why would anyone want to just clone themselves and keep going when they don‚Äôt get anything out of it?! It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Is there a reasonable explanation within this movie‚Äôs universe that I‚Äôm just not getting ?

movies,Ariana DeBose needs a better agent,"TL;DR: Ariana DeBose's movies after WSS aren't very good. Hopefully that changes soon. If not then she needs to give her agent the boot.

This isn't something only exclusive to her (looking at you Tom Holland, though things are looking up for you), but I'm shocked by how drastic of a downturn Ariana DeBose's career took after West Side Story. That movie put her in the spotlight and even won her an Oscar! Yet every movie she's been in after that has been panned by both audiences and critics.

I.S.S was the first movie she stared in after WSS, which released on January 2023. For the uninformed January is seen as a dumping month for movies which studios think won't do well. That movie bombed at the box office despite a low $13 million budget and received average reviews.

Then she voiced the main character in Wish. I think we all know what happened with that movie. It flopped, making $255 million on a $175‚Äì200 million budget. Don't forget movies need to make 2.5x their budget to make a profit. I remember a lot of people on social media and irl making fun of the movie's animation, story and songs. It was seen as an embarrassment to Disney, especially since it was meant to celebrate their 100th anniversary.

In 2024 she starred in Agrylle. The movie was meant to launch a new franchise but it bombed and was ridiculed by critics and audiences. I know many people see it as a low point in Vaughn's career. Tbf her role in that movie was very minor but still.

This likely went under your radar as it's a streaming movie released on Amazon Prime but she stared in a horror movie called House of Spoils where she plays an evil chef I think. Cool premise but unfortunately it's produced by Blumhouse and you know how all their recent output has been like lately. It didn't make much splash but from what I can tell it was received quite negatively by both critics and audiences.

Later this month the 8 people still invested in Sony's Spider-Manless Cinematic Universe will be seeing her again in Kraven the Hunter. Tbh I actually think this movie's reception won't too bad, or at least not as bad as Morbius and Madame Web. I can totally see people calling it a fun turn-off-your-brain popcorn flick. But I really doubt it'll get higher than a 65% on the tomatometer.

Finding out that she was going to be in Kraven the Hunter was what prompted me to write this ridiculously long post (that and the fact that I have a lot of free time.). To be completely hyperbolic, this was what broke me and caused me to write all this out. I admit that I've never seen a single movie she's been in but I have seen clips of WSS and she was phenomenal in it. She's a scene stealer man, not just because she looks absolutely stunning but because of her amazing acting and singing. She deserves a better career man. I'd hate to see such talent be reduced to such poor and ill-fitting roles.

Not all hope is lost for her tho, next years she'll be in Love Hurts, also staring Ke Huy Quan. I have really high hopes for that movie as I love Ke Huy Quan and the premise sounds really fun! She's also staring in two other upcoming movies which don't have release dates yet. Those may be good. Who knows. I hope they are. If all three of her upcoming movies end up terrible then she ought to fire her agent cause man is she squandering her skills and potential. Of course I'm not saying gonna end up in poverty if she keeps getting bad movie roles but I do think it's odd she hasn't been in a single hit since WSS.

movies,Hellboy: The Crooked Man is better than I expected,"I'm a fan of Brian Taylor and I love the Hellboy character, but I expected this to be a complete disaster after it got buried during its release. Honestly, it isn't a great movie, but it's completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it's pretty clear that most of what we're seeing is fake, which drags it down. 

Despite me finding it passable enough, I'm really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights. The character isn't much of a box office draw either, which is a shame as the comics are excellent.

[https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols](https://www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/films/2024/hunting-matthew-nichols)

I did not know ANYTHING about this movie before I went in to see it and that's the best way to experience it. It won me over because the story about this woman searching for her missing brother is interesting. The atmosphere is dripping. Literally because they filmed in December on Vancouver Island, showcasing really dark, rainy and super foreboding/dread tone. The deeper they get into the woods the eerier it gets. It's strangely grounded and absorbing. It's decently-shot, but what I appreciate is it's a nice slow burn. It builds and builds to one of the tensest, scariest movies I've seen in years. Closest I can compare is UNCUT GEMS,  in style, realism and oh-my-GOD tension.

It's a locally produced Vancouver indie so a lot of the audience had heard about it through family, friends or colleagues, myself included. I showed up 20 minutes early and most movies at the Whistler film fest don't have crazy lines. This one day. I barely got in via the rush line, they had 10 spots open and I was the eighth. So it was a full up theatre.

Preferably though absolutely not just limiting to, movies where a group or a select few individuals have to escape or defend themselves against larger, stronger, or outnumbered foes like in *Green Room*, *You're Next*, and *Dog Soldiers.* 

If the movies have some kind of cross into the action field but still have horror themes and elements like *I Saw The Devil*, they are also welcome.

By definition, a well rounded film should have these attributes

1. Quality - Be a quality film, obviously. Within the script, acting, scenes and soundtrack 

2. Good Length - Have an average run time not too long or short 

3. Highly Accessible - Able to watch with almost types of audiences, including film critics and casual viewers. Not too niche of a topic or style.

4. Rewatchability - Is able to be rewatched multiple times without fatigue

The 'Interstellar' IMAX re-release earned $4.6 million from just 165 theaters. Meanwhile, A24's 'Y2K' flopped in ninth place with just $2.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/qi1cxbn2ew5e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8

Thanks to the excellent performance last week, this was a fantastic post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. ***Moana 2*** broke the record for highest post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office, while ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II*** continued their run. As is typical with the weekend, studios avoid releasing big stuff. The biggest push was A24's ***Y2K***, which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. In contrast, the IMAX re-release of ***Interstellar*** fared much better in just 165 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 115% from last year, when ***The Boy and the Heron*** opened in North America. It's the best post-Thanksgiving weekend in history.

Without any competition, ***Moana 2*** easily held the top spot with $51.2 million this weekend. That represents a 63% drop, which is a little steeper than usual for the post-Thanksgiving weekend. It's worse than ***Wish*** (61%), ***Frozen II*** (59%), ***Strange World*** (58%), ***Ralph Breaks the Internet*** (54%), ***Frozen*** (53%), ***Encanto*** (52%), and the original ***Moana*** (50%).

Through 12 days, the film has earned $299.3 million domestically, already eclipsing the original ***Moana***. For a comparison, it had a huge start over ***Inside Out 2***, but it's now running almost $60 million behind that through the same point. It should hit $500 million for the holidays, but the $600 million dream appears to be dead.

***Wicked*** stayed at #2, dropping 55% and adding $36.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $322.1 million, and it should finish with over $450 million.

***Gladiator II*** dropped a rough 59%, adding $12.5 million this weekend. The film has earned $132.8 million so far, and it's gonna close with a little over $150 million unless the holidays surprise us.

Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** dropped 45%, adding $7 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $85.7 million. We'd like to say it will hit $100 million, but that's pretty much Joever; Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday. That's gonna kill legs.

The Indian film ***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** opened with $4.88 million in 1,245 theaters, which grows to $9.3 million in its first five days.

Paramount re-released Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** in 165 IMAX theaters. It earned a huge $4.6 million in these locations, which translates to a $27K per-theater average. IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out. These numbers took its lifetime gross to $192.6 million.

Sony/Crunchyroll's ***Solo Leveling: ReAwakening*** earned $2.4 million from just $846 theaters. Not bad for a recap of the first season.

Fathom Events released the concert film ***For King + Country‚Äôs A Drummer Boy Christmas Live*** in 1,540 theaters, for a limited 4-day run. It finished in eighth place with $2.2 million ($2.8 million four-day).

Debuting in ninth place, we find A24's ***Y2K***, which flopped with just $2.1 million in 2,108 theaters. That's a poor $1,003 per-theater average, suggesting a lot of empty screenings. It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2,000 theaters. 

This shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. The film lacked big names, with the big emphasis on its writer and director, Kyle Mooney. Mooney is definitely well known for ***Saturday Night Live***, but like a lot of stars in the show, that doesn't mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen. Horror is a profitable genre, but the film is actually a horror comedy, making it a tougher sell. A24 takes a lot of risks, but it was clear that this would struggle. Since its SXSW premiere, reviews have been mixed, and they've been worsening (currently at 43% on RT), making it one of the worst titles of the studio. It's simply a film that couldn't find an audience.

According to A24, 58% of the audience was male, and 77% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it an awful ""C‚Äì"" on CinemaScore, suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters. A run under $5 million is a possibility, and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives. Not the best years for Rachel Zegler, apparently.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever***. It fell 53%, adding $1.5 million this weekend and taking its total to $34.4 million.

Outside the Top 10, we find ***Werewolves***, a horror action title with Frank Grillo. It hit 1,351 theaters, but it flopped with just $1 million this weekend. Don't expect it to last long.

Vertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel's ***The Order*** in 603 theaters, but it only made $878,000 this weekend. Ouch.

A24 expanded Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** to 47 theaters. It added $405,910 this weekend, taking its run to $866K after 10 days. It will continue expanding.

Searchlight didn't even bother with ***Nightbitch***. Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters, but they didn't release box office numbers. Le sigh.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** continued leading the box office after its record-breaking weekend. It added $103.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $599 million. Its biggest debut was Japan, where it opened with $6.5 million. The best markets so far are France ($32.5M), UK ($27.2M), Germany ($19.7M), Mexico ($19.1M) and Brazil ($16M). A billion is imminent, but it looks like it will take a little while.

While ***Wicked*** registering strong numbers domestically, it continues performing softly overseas. This weekend, it added $26.9 million, taking its worldwide total to $457.5 million. It had very soft debuts in France ($2M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Poland ($900K). The best markets are the UK ($47.4M), Australia ($17.2M), South Korea ($10.6M), Mexico ($8.1M) and Spain ($4.5M). It will open in more markets, but it's not like it will suddenly explode. If it was performing on par with its domestic run, we'd say a billion is a possibility, but that's not the case here. 70% of its money is coming from the domestic market, which is crazy.

***Gladiator II*** added $17 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $368.5 million. The film is slowing down, and while it will hit $400 million, it won't get much further than that. Far below the original's $460 million worldwide total.

***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** opened in 31 markets, mostly Latin America, a week ahead of its worldwide rollout. To say that it performed badly would be an understatement. The film debuted with an awful $2 million. It had terrible starts in Spain ($347K), Mexico ($239K), Thailand ($146K), Brazil ($106K), and Czech Republic ($103K). Yep, not a single market over $1 million. This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Here* | Nov/1 | Sony | $4,875,195 | $12,227,851 | $13,295,076 | $50M

- Wake up babe, new Zemeckis flop just dropped. After barely one month in theaters, Sony/Miramax's ***Here*** has closed with just $12 million domestically and $13 million worldwide. Despite touting the film as a ***Forrest Gump*** reunion (Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright), the audience was uninterested. In fact, the domestic total is barely half of what ***Forrest Gump*** earned on its opening weekend back in 1994, and that's not even adjusted. Oh, Robert Zemeckis, what happened to you? To say that his glory days have passed...

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Five films, two of which are hitting wide release. But none stand a chance in topping the box office.

The first is Sony's latest addition in the Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe, ***Kraven the Hunter***. This universe has been mostly profitable, but it carries an asterisk. The three ***Venom*** films are hits, while the other two (***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***) flopped and became Internet's laughingstock. ***Kraven*** is leaning towards the latter. And for reasons beyond understand, Sony decided that this film warranted $130 million, making it their most expensive SSU film. After this, who knows what'll happen.

The other wide release is Warner Bros.'s ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, an anime prequel to Peter Jackson's trilogy. This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history... yet ***The War of the Rohirrim*** is not gonna come close anywhere close to that. Anime has a ceilling at the box office, and the pre-sales are insanely low. With a low screen count, limited marketing, and middling reviews so far, we'll see how low it can go.

Paramount is releasing ***September 5*** in limited release, before its wide release on January 17. The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events. The film has received some solid reviews so far.

Amazon MGM is releasing ***Nickel Boys*** in limited release. The story follows two African American boys, Elwood and Turner, who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida. The film has received critical acclaim, and there's Oscar buzz on the horizon. Watch out for this one.

The other one is Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl***, starring Pamela Anderson. Reviews are very positive, with Anderson lauded for a career-best performance.

movies,What do you think will happen when the Hobbit enters the public domain?,"J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth franchise began way back in 1937, with the release of the Hobbit. The Hobbit has been adapted twice, once back in 1977 as an animated movie, and again as a live action trilogy, between 2012 and 2014. 

However, something that often goes unnoticed, is that we're creeping up on the date in which the Hobbit novel, will be available to the public domain. In 2034, the original Hobbit novel will enter the public domain, at least according to an article I read recently. 

Given how people had issues with both the original animated adaptation and the Peter Jackson trilogy, I'm curious to know what you think of the idea that anyone will be able to try adapting the Hobbit for themselves. Do you think it's a bad idea, or could we see a more faithful adaptation come about as a result? Or do you think the market will get over-cluttered with poor retellings of the story?

I myself see a lot of potential here. A fledgling studio could use the Hobbit to turn their fortunes around for instance, or a rival major studio to WBD, could try beating them at their own game. Universal Studios, who owns the rights to the LEGO movie franchise, could easily do their own LEGO adaptation of the original book if they so wanted to. Even if the worst comes to pass and the Hobbit gets adapted into a horror movie, like Steamboat Willie and Winnie the Pooh already have, I'd still be down for a horror movie about Middle-earth. I still think that could work wonders if handled correctly.

The visual effects are awesome, water hasn't been done better. The characters are well thought out and very entertaining, Karl Urban plays the role of Jacob very well. The soundtrack is excellent, and overall tone is suitably foreboding when it needs to be. The ""pirate speak"" could be better, but it is obviously aimed at kids.

It's got a lot of the charm of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and follows the time-tested Moby Dick format while staying fairly original. It's got a very classic feel that reminds me of the old swashbuckling pirate films of the 80s. Its a proper adventure film.

movies,What if Sergio Leone made Leningrad: The 900 Days?,"Question, What if Sergio Leone never died and managed to make Leningrad: The 900 Days?

On what I am saying, While finishing work on Once Upon a Time in America in 1982, Leone was impressed with Harrison Salisbury's non-fiction book The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad, and he planned on adapting the book as a war epic. Although no formal script had been completed or leaked, Leone came up with the opening scene and basic plot. According to the documentary Once Upon a Time, Sergio Leone, the film opened in medias res as the camera goes from focusing on a Russian hiding from the Nazis' artillery fire to panning hundreds of feet away to show the German Panzer divisions approaching the walls of the city. The plot was to focus on an American photographer on assignment (whom Leone wanted to be played by Robert De Niro) becoming trapped in Russia as the German Luftwaffe begin to bombard the city. Throughout the course of the film, he becomes romantically involved with a Russian woman, whom he later impregnates, as they attempt to survive the prolonged siege and the secret police, because relationships with foreigners are forbidden. According to Leone, ""In the end, the cameraman dies on the day of the liberation of the city, when he is currently filming the surrender of the Germans. And the girl is aware of his death by chance seeing a movie news: the camera sees it explode under a shell .... ""

By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire $100 million in financing from independent backers, and the film was to be a joint production with a Soviet film company. He had convinced Ennio Morricone to compose the film score, and Tonino Delli Colli was tapped to be the cinematographer. Shooting was scheduled to begin sometime in 1990. The project was canceled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film.

Now, Since Sergio Leone never had a script, it's hard to know whether the film would go, but I think, given Leone's track record, I really think this film would've a been another masterpiece. I am just sadden that Sergio died just only 2 days before he was to sign on to this film, and one thing that amazes me is that Leone managed to acquired 100 Million just for this project, probably making it one of the most expensive film projects is it actually got made?

All in All, What do you think? What if Sergio Leone never died and managed to make Leningrad: The 900 Days?

movies,District 9 is great original film.,"A recommendation post of this film suddenly popped on my Instagram feed and I thought I should give it a try. I'm glad that I did.

I knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it has aliens in it (thought that it was an alien invasion movie).

Never in my life did I imagine that a film can make me sympathize with aliens and hate humans. Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.
 
Another thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.

The ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).

The only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.

In short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.

Highly recommend if you haven't already watched it.",CYBOZAX_,1ha0t0x,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,2024-12-09 03:40:06,2268,0.92,2268,0,230,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha0t0x

movies,"Another ""The Prestige"" post asking for some clarification","Hi everyone! I know... 9 years late to the party hahaha. I love this movie so much I had to watch it twice in once sitting.

I won't lie... I was looking for a suggestion to ""Now You See Me"" as I enjoy the over the top heist movies that don't take themselves too seriously (think Rick and Morty heist hyperbole and not Fast and Furious). I saw the movie ""The Prestige"" pop up multiple times, but since it was often coupled by overt animosity towards the person asking for movie recommendations similar to ""Now You See Me"", I had assumed it was a sarcastic recommendation, and thus also accidentally mistook the suggestion for ""The Purge"", thinking these people where being malicious with their recommendations; but I digress.

The actual question I have involves the jail scene, in which Jess visits Alfred accompanied by Lord Caldlow; whom we immediately learn is actually Angier. They have a heated transaction, and Alfred frantically grabs Jess's attention and says, ""I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise. I promise. Look"" and after he pulls the red ball out from behind her ear, he repeats, ""I promise"" and ends the transaction with, ""I love you. I love you. I love you Jess."" We're not privy to the details, but we learn that in fact, Alfred is a portmanteau of the first names of the twin Borden brothers Albert and Frederick, so that means either Albert or Frederick is in jail. Well... to be accurate, we learn that Alfred is actually the single identity born from the shared lives of the twin Borden brothers, without really learning any names. These names I've learned from extensive Google warrioring. Anyway, I'm led to believe that Frederick is the one in jail, especially since he opens by saying to Jess, ""I've missed you so much. Fallon's missed you too. We both have."" Meaning that the one in jail is not Jess's father, and that leads me to believe it is then Frederick, who is the who who has been cold to Sarah Borden, Albert's wife.

I guess I'm just confused because If Frederick is the one who is in jail, and is the one who is ultimately hanged, I just find it odd that he showed such an overwhelming amount of love and concern for Jess. Especially since he was incapable of showing that affection towards his sister in law, which led her to her eventual suicide. That didn't seem like an act to me. It didn't feel like he was just trying to use her to garner sympathy enough to get out of jail. It didn't feel like he was acting for the sake of the daughter. The scene to me felt very real, and very self-less might I add. It feel like he was truly worried about her well being and how she would cope after him. I think the magic trick with the ball‚Äîa signature ""Borden"" gesture, was meant to reassure her in a familiar, comforting manner, maintaining the illusion of stability knowing that he was at an end the moment he learned of Caldlow's true identity. And that, is where I'm confused, if that's true, why would he have that kind of feeling towards his niece. Why did he comfort her so desperately when he could even do the same for Sarah?

Oh, I guess as I further think on this as I try to organize my thoughts into a coherent Reddit post, I again want to point at his coldness towards Sarah; and I want to supplement that with the fact that he \*immediately\* chased Olivia after Sarah's passing, leading to her leaving him as well. She was unsettled by how little her death affected him, and how quickly he moved on to his mistress. To me, this leads me to believe that Frederick is not much of an actor. I don't believe he's able to fake love, and that reinforces my thought that what he shows towards Jess is genuine and true; and again, I just want to know why? Unless of course, it was not Frederick in the jail cell.",Aerothix,1hbkl85,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbkl85/another_the_prestige_post_asking_for_some/,2024-12-11 03:40:15,0,0.42,0,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbkl85

movies,"""The Lovely Bones:"" A New Add to My Least Favorite Movies List","I just saw the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. 

I came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on ""paired with"" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl ""everyone dies"" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. 

I also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to ""everyone"" like the spirit guide describes death. The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. 

Furthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the ""cool grandma"" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a ""grown man"" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just ""live with it"" less than a year after the murder.

It's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.

Finally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the ""weird looking, creepy stranger"" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.

This movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.

EDIT: I guess I wasn't as articulate as I could have been, no I don't think they needed to show a 14 year old literally getting raped, please stop saying that's what I said or asking why I supposedly wanted to see that. My point there was, I think the film is way too flipant with how it handles rape's emotional impact by not acknowleding what happened in any way, or at the very least by rushing the girl to get over it ASAP. Girls need to show that this isn't okay and their upset feelings are valid when it happens to them. No death survivors can get anything from this movie, as they are dead. However SA survivors can. And if the point wasn't supposed to be about the girl, we didn't need to see her in the afterlife.",Due_Assist_7614,1ha2xe2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,2024-12-09 05:43:43,545,0.73,545,0,216,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha2xe2
movies,Why do A list actors do small movies,"I‚Äôm looking at Robert De Niros IMDB and seeing his stuff from the last couple years. Since Irishman he‚Äôs done 10 projects, but I only know about Killers of the Flower Moon and Amsterdam. 

I know a lot of actors get tied up in contracts and are forced to do bad movies, but in this stage of his career, is De Niro really still tied up with contractual obligations? Idk maybe he is i don‚Äôt really know how these things work but it seems counterintuitive for him at this point to sign those kinds of contracts when he could probably easily get a high quality role at any point. 

The other factor could be money, which for De Niro obviously seems off, but I guess we don‚Äôt truly know bros financial situation.

movies,I'm still confused by 'The Platform' and 'The Platform 2',"I have seen both movies, but I'm still confused on a couple of things (I'm going to reference both):

* The platform shoots to the top really fast, but what happens when the platform approaches Level 0? Does it slow down or does it immediately stop?  If it immediately stops then I don't think either the child or the panna cotta at the end of the first movie would be intact if either was sent up. The child would likely go splat on the ceiling like a squashed berry. The panna cotta wouldn't be intact either. Otherwise, the platform would need to slow down as it approaches the top, whereby some prisoners could possibly attempt to jump on? I guess this is a plot point that is just never explained?
* Does a child being placed at the bottom level at the end of the second movie confirm that the child at the bottom in the first movie was NOT in fact imaginary? THAT was the possible ending that really happened, and not the other one with the panna cotta being sent up?
* There are cannibals beneath the pit which survive on dead bodies and their parts that fall down the hole? And who are these cannibals? Are these all prisoners that descended to the bottom of the pit with a child over time? 
* Lastly, so either the platform suddenly stopping or the cannibals at the bottom are the things that make the prison completely escape proof? So if a prisoner rides the platform down to the very bottom they are simply killed by the cannibals? Or if they have a child they are just pulled off by the cannibals, the prisoner joins the cannibals, and the child is sent up and is supposedly not killed at the top by the sudden deceleration? 

Am I understanding it all correctly? Or is this just terrible writing?

I just finished watching it, and the incredibly constant time-skips back and forth were incredibly jarring. The constant cutting to people back on earth giving these post-journey and pre-journey explanations was so random .

It's especially confusing because you're just with the same five cast the entire time (plus the two main people on earth) so it's impossible to keep track of what has and hasn't happened yet. They even spoil the death of one of the main cast members five minutes into the movie, who doesn't die until about 70 minutes in.

movies,Can we talk about Apple TV movies?,"This week I saw three Apple TV movies:

Napoleon

Killers of the Flower Moon

The Instigators.

Whilst The Instigators was a tragic waste of talent, the first two imo were both resounding successes. Both fine, magnificent movies cinematically speaking. I‚Äôd read bad things about both (too long, inaccurate etc) but on a purely cinematic level, both these movies delivered and I applaud Apple TV for these. 

I‚Äôm genuinely excited what Apple TV can offer. The only downside is that I can only watch it in my iPhone as when viewed on my television the picture breaks up. That‚Äôs quite a major problem especially as Ridley Scott has publicly voiced his disapproval of watching movies on phones. 

Anyway, I think I might watch Blitz next. I have reservations about this one too but, seriously, after The instigators, surely it won‚Äôt be on that level of badness. It looks as if it will offer something of substance at the very least.

movies,Biggest Filmmaker ,"Who according to you are among the Top 5 Biggest ( most influential ) filmmakers in the world currently , of this era ( 2007-present ) ?



According to me -

1. Christopher Nolan - Probably the most famous and commercially/critically successful filmmaker of this Era .
With movies like The Dark Knight , Inception , Interstellar , Dunkirk , Oppenheimer under his belt , I certainly presume that no one even comes close to his invincibility .




2. Bong Joon Ho - With masterpieces like Mother , Snowpiercer , Okja , and Parasite , he nearly misses the first spot solely on the basis of lack of global recognition compared to Nolan. But definitely on the same level on the basis of the quality of content when compared to Nolan.




3. Martin Scorsese  - This era has been sort of a second phase of Scorsese's cinematic journey imo. It feels as if in the current phase of Scorsese , he is not making movies for them to be great classics but just for enjoying the privilege of creating real "" old school "" cinema in a world which is largely dominated by movies which feels more like factory produced products for consumer's satisfaction.
His Shutter Island , Wows , Silence , The Irishman , and Killers of the flower moon are 
' breeze of fresh air ' .





4. Wes Anderson   - One of the most unique filmmakers of recent times , his distinctive style and artistic approach has cemented his position among the great comedy filmmakers of all time.




5. Denis Villeneuve  - Probably the best ' spectacle movie ' director in the world with his movies like Arrival , Blade Runner 2049 , Dune  achieving the perfect balance between being extremely well made and thoroughly entertaining .",Beefyvalkyrie,1hbae2h,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbae2h/biggest_filmmaker/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hbae2h/biggest_filmmaker/,2024-12-10 19:45:54,0,0.31,0,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hbae2h

movies,The Substance is way too long for what it is and suffers greatly for it.,"Don't get me wrong Demi and Dennis' performances were great and the movie was thematically strong and has some of the best use of practical effects I've seen in recent film. However, the damn movie is just too long. It's not hard to surmise what will happen once the exposition is through. Demi will recapture her youth but only a week at a time, or else? Surely she won't disobey those orders! Surely ""Remember, you are one"" is not a foreboding warning that underlines the entire theme of the movie? And there's nothing wrong with telegraphing your thematic intentions and then leaning into them, but when you do that you need to make it snappy. The middle section of the movie drags so hard because you know what's coming the whole time and instead of getting that, you get stiff dialog and a few gross out scenes. It felt like sitting at the dinner table watching the food get cold. It's being heralded for its message, which is a good one, but it's also not a complicated one and it DEFINITELY did not need almost 150 minutes to be delivered.


I'll also mention that I get what the idea was with all of the intense sexualization of Sue, but the movie falls into the trap of being popular for the things it's trying to denigrate. Sex sells and that sucks for women, but also, let's make an over the top sexualized movie and hey, look, people love it. It ends up feeling like virtue signaling mixed with hipocracy via naivete.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Turkey,"Hello there,

since more than 40 days I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain european country. Yesterday, it was Switzerland's turn and it was certainly not the first try to bring the *Three colours*\-trilogy into the game, but now, finally, quasi at the last opportunity, it made the cut: ***Trois couleurs: Rouge*** (engl.: Three colours: Red) will be the next entry on our official letterboxd list. 

What comes next? Well, we'll see - here in this thread. I am following the alphabetical order of the Council of Europe's official list of European countries here, which means, on the one hand, that we're yet to get to England and the like (stay tuned), but on the other hand it also means that today we are  talking about a country that is only partially part of geographical Europe: I'm looking for movies set in **Turkey**. But even in this case, there are only two rules to follow when approaching this country from a cinematic perspective:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

I was very excited to watch Dear Santa because it felt like a wholesome, old school Christmas movie, all I really knew about it was the concept and that one trailer I saw, but that was enough for me.

The movie was just wholesome from beginning to end and at the end, it did it, a story that FINALLY had the courage to and we're heading into end game major spoiler territory here

&gt;!A story that had the courage to DEFY death! THANK YOU to the writers, whoever approved it, thank you!!&lt;

&gt;!I'm so tired of stories teaching us that the dead are gone and we should accept it, that we can't bring our loved ones back and all that reality check stuff. No, this is a fantasy movie, this is a world that someone imagined and in their world this kinda stuff IS possible because the worlds we create in our imagination are ours to write the rules in and the writers did just that. I'm glad that somewhere out there exists a world like this, I wish ours was one but it isn't, but I'm happy just to see this stuff.!&lt;

So not only did I enjoy this heartwarming movie from the very beginning, but it ended the way I was hoping it would ever since I learned of the main plot twist I would say.

this is my #1 new Christmas Movie alongside Klaus.

Obvious love for the visuals aside. One thing that I did not appreciate when I saw this film 10 years ago was the stakes and what was happening to the characters. Being that this was Nolan‚Äôs first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could ‚Äúsolve‚Äù his movie like many tried to after Inception released.

I can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.

I read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. ‚ÄúStay/Coop leaving Murph‚Äù in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. 

there is something so powerful in that composition that just had me losing it. It might be the idea that I‚Äôm becoming more open to becoming a father, but when the entire orchestral noise starts escalating as Coop is letting Tom have the truck, I am wailing for him to stay.

movies,Godzilla Minus One,"I just got around to seeing this movie. For dubbed movies I know I need to make sure I can pay full attention and with kids I just never got to this one. 

But my god it was incredible. I had heard good things but it still exceeded my expectations. Visuals, fantastic. Story, even better. The pacing was damn near perfect as far as I'm concerned. And considering it was a Godzilla movie I found myself incredibly moved by the characters, none of whom were one-dimensional characatures.

I hate when movies are too optimistic and I thought this walked the line perfectly between tragedy and fortune.

movies,Onegin (1999) - Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler are excellent in this beautiful romantic drama based on the novel in verse by Russian writer Alexander Pushkin.,"https://preview.redd.it/lfizh83n9q5e1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c406dbf791527cd189be56708ea4efc41484aa1d

Alexander Pushkin's verse novel ""Eugene Onegin"" is well-known in English-speaking countries, partly due to the influence of Tchaikovsky's opera, so I need not set out the plot in any detail. It centres upon the relationship between Yevgeny Onegin, a 19th century Russian landowner, and a teenaged girl named Tatyana Larin–∞, the daughter of a neighbour. Tatyana falls passionately in love with Onegin and writes him a letter setting out her feelings, but he replies that he cannot return them. Six years later Onegin meets Tatyana again and discovers that she is now married to a prince. A subplot deals with a duel fought between Onegin and Vladimir Lensky, the fianc√© of Tatyana's sister Olga.

Ralph Fiennes executes a stunning performance as the aloof, sarcastic disillusioned aristocrat managing a performance which combines a great deal of emotion and extreme surface passivity; Liv Tyler is at her most beautiful in one of her best performances to date as the poignant Tatiana who, as the film unfolds, evolves from passionate idealism into resignation and honour.

As for the story, the movie is very faithful to the Pushkinian attitude. The story is very character-centred, typical to Russian lit. The change in Evgenyi Onegin¬† is marked indeed. However, the character of Tatyana captivated me. Her faithfulness to herself and to her integrity is amazing.

Any other movies with comedic bits as a side story that get more ridiculous as the movies goes on?","Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.

It just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying ""jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore"" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. 

Of course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Switzerland,"Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Sweden. Almost 100 comments later, I think, we've found a very interesting new entry for [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): I mean, I've never seen it, but I will, because (apart from the fact that I will watch every movie on this list), c'mon, if I have been informed correctly, **Det Sjunde Inseglet** (engl.: *The Seventh Seal*) shows us Max von Sydow playing chess with the Death! To be honest, I doubt that the next winner will be able to top that...

...but we can try. I'm following an alphabetical order here (yeah, yeah, I know, that England and Co are still missing, wait for it), and so, we now take a look at movies set in **Switzerland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

The third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.

Some ups and downs:
+Denzel glooming
+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again
+Nice location
-Boring villain
-Slow pacing
-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie

I came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him.

I personally was really excited for it, based on both the reviews, the director and a solid cast with JK Simmons, Nicholas Hoult and that chick from the sixth sense. If nothing else, a good courtroom drama is always hard to beat.

Watched it last night and was so utterly confused by the praise this movie has gotten. The plot was ludicrous even for a hollywood film, every secondary character's dialogue was incredibly obnoxious and no I every standard clique/trope was left untouched.

All I can figure is that people believe this is Clint Eastwood's last movie and are being nice; nobody wants to send him to the afterlife with a movie that is 25% fresh with an IMDb of 5.4. Or am I offbase here?

She was so excited and hopeful. It was a knife in the chest and the back. I still have never forgiven the actor that was her boss. I'll honestly stop watching something if he pops up.

The performances of everyone in this movie was amazing, but its few films where you feel just as bad emotionally as the character does. You feel bad for them. You feel as if ""what if that happened to me?!"" and you're living it in real time.

Its not so much the actions, because a lot of people go through this. But watching the entire before and after is what the film captured well. It was seeing a characters candle extinguished.

The only other time I really felt the film was when the villagers in Apocalypto were enslaved/sacrificed. It really captured how dire the situation was, and how much of a total and complete alien mindfuck that would have been.

movies,"Now You See Me 3 (2025) - Cast, Release Date - Parade","Now You See Me 3 wasn't delayed because of COVID like the writer claims. The head of Lionsgate notoriously was more interested in hitting specific release dates than making good movies. Writer/director Gary Ross didn't return to direct the sequel to The Hunger Games because Lionsgate wouldn't give him any time to work on the script or do pre-production prep. The sequel ended up going into production without any script at all --the director was shooting pages from the book until a shooting script was cobbled together. Catching Fire was a big hit anyway because of the goodwill generated by the first film but Lionsgate's slapdash approach to production led to diminishing audience interest and box office for the final installment (which was split into two films since that worked for Harry Potter and Twilight).

Before Now You See Me 2 opened Lionsgate announced that part 3 would be going into immediate production and be released the following year --but audiences weren't happy with the sequel which underperformed in North America. Lionsgate claimed the China box office made up for the disappointing returns in North America which clearly wasn't true because the original sequel which was to be helmed by Jon Chu again was cancelled.

In addition to completely screwing up the sequel to Now You See Me Lionsgate did the same with the sequel to the Bruce Willis action comedy R.E.D. Now You See Me and R.E.D. were both developed by Summit Pictures before that company was acquired by Lionsgate.

After a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven‚Äôt been very successful recently.

movies,Looking for historical courtroom dramas,"Because of the nature of the work I do now,  I‚Äôve become fascinated with how courtrooms are shown in tv and movies. It‚Äôs a convenient way to showcase moral dilemmas and human conflict, and it gets great performances out of actors.  

What I‚Äôm looking for, though, is movies that take place in historical versions of the standard courtroom drama. For arguments sake, by historical let‚Äôs say we mean before 1930. These courtroom settings could be either in a western or non-western country.

Two films made me think of this topic, and they coincidentally have the same lead actor and similar themes. The first one I saw was Le Colonel Chabert (1994), with Gerard Depardieu as a French cavalry officer presumed dead during the Napoleonic Wars. When he returns, he hires a lawyer to regain his inheritance from his remarried widow.

movies,I don't agree with the sentiment that the Driver from Drive was a psychopath (SPOILERS),"Just watched the movie for the first time. Fantastic, instantly went to see what others were discussing. Seems the common consensus seems to be the Driver was sociopath/psychopath, even my friends think so.

To me, the movie was a character study on a troubled man looking for a normal, happy life, but got involved with the wrong people (and continues to.) Not a sociopath or psychopath. Probably on the spectrum. The whole movie was also showing us that he was a real human being. 

First, biggest signs of a socio/psychopath are lack of empathy and love, but he clearly has a lot of empathy and love for Irene and the child. He puts himself into danger just so he can keep them from harm. He isn't just physically or intimately in love with her, he never advances on her in a sexual way, it's a sweet and caring love. The elevator scene didn't scream lust to me (or my wife) personally, just a final kiss before he'll never see her again. The dates were always innocent with them chilling with her child. He is also very clearly distraught when Shannon dies, who again, proves to be part of the wrong friends he accidentally associates himself with. 

At the beginning of the movie, he denies a job for a lot of money from a previous client. Tells him to STFU, but ends up inadvertently taking the job because now Irene and her little boy are in danger if he doesn't.

People also mention the brutality of his kills, but all his kills in the movie come from self defense, or defense of a loved one. He was furiously stomping on the guy in the elevator because he was an active and present threat to Irene. It was a violent outburst towards his frustration at being unable to keep a person he loves out of danger. She becomes sad because she realizes she fell in love with yet another man with violent baggage that mean harm to the family.

He 100% does have a violent past. That is why he is disconnected, awkward, calculated and aware. 

He has good intentions, but fate and nature keep him away from them. He's the frog, the scorpion, and the shark in one package. He's not feigning his care for humanity. He sacrificed his only remaining bond to keep her safe. He left the money behind. Gave her a sweet goodbye voicemail. Clearly sad as he drives onto nowhere, where he'll probably get a job on the spot from a random guy again, forever and ever in this cycle.",Forhaver,1ha4h5u,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,2024-12-09 07:28:38,0,0.49,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha4h5u

In it, an old detective seeks to solve a crime that he failed to solve for decades due to a series of stupid bureaucratic mistakes and absence of any concrete leads.The author sought to make a point about how detective novels are the opposite of real-life crime solving in that it pretends that coincidences don't exist and logic is the only thing that matters.

I noticed strong similarities between its plot and more recent movies like Bong Joon-Ho's Memories of Murder and Wei Shujun's Only The River Flows.

movies,"Gulliver's Travels with Jack Black it doesn't even manage to be a fun parody of Jonathan Swift's book,","Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear.

What is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose.¬†

the film gives us  two woozy love interests and a multitude of over-the-top jesters (also guised in the form of kings and generals).

movies,What did we think of Nightbitch?,"I was on the fence, leaning negative, for the first two-thirds. This is coming from someone who unreservedly adores¬†*Can You Ever Forgive Me*¬†and¬†*A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*. Once it hit the third act, I got it. And thank god it clicked, because it would have made me really sad to give a negative review to a movie that needle-drops ""Dare to Be Stupid"" by Weird¬†Al.

While I still prefer Marielle Heller's previous films, this big and often baffling swing reveals itself as a deeply personal reflection on balancing artistic legacy with continuing heritage. Kudos to Heller for making a film on her terms, even if it almost turned me off completely before eventually winning me¬†over.

I was reminded of Ari Aster's¬†*Beau Is Afraid*. In¬†*Beau*, Joaquin Phoenix as Aster's self-insert protagonist only finds peace when performing a play in the woods‚Äîmirroring how Aster himself might only feel at ease when creating films and seeing the world through his unique lens. Even as some audiences follow Richard Kind's character out the door wondering what the hell they just saw, they at least had the opportunity to understand how it feels to live with Aster's restless, haunting¬†brain.

An unhinged Amy Adams gives us a similar peek into Heller's mind in¬†*Nightbitch*. And like Scoot McNairy's character admits, I ""didn't get it"" at first. Honestly, as a single man with no kids, I still don't get all of it. But now I feel a little closer to empathizing, rather than just sympathizing, with moms in the¬†arts.

(Side note: I saw Brian De Palma's¬†*Phantom of the Paradise*¬†a week ago and didn't recognize a young Jessica Harper until the end credits. Then tonight I didn't realize an older Jessica Harper plays Norma until I saw her name on the Letterboxd page. I don't know what's causing my Jessica-Harper-prosopagnosia, but as a big fan of hers, I'm hoping one of the witches at Tanz Akademie can cast a spell to fix¬†it.)

movies,Was the Hag in Snow White an Illusion?,"We all know that after the huntsman fails to provide Snow White's heart, the queen then magically transforms herself into the old hag which she then uses to trick Snow White into eating the apple.

The thing that I've always been curious on is whether or not that transformation is simply an illusion or not. What I mean is does the black magic only make her appear to be an old woman but she still functions as her normal self or is it truly a transformation and she IS that old woman? Sure she acknowledges the voice change, but she also seems to run pretty damn fast for an old woman and almost succeeded in moving a boulder onto the dwarfs; also an impressive feat given her ""age"". It wouldn't surprise me if someone that powerful was able to keep her strength and endurance while changing the voice to make it believable. 

What do you all think? 

Bonus question, do you think that after her death the magic wore off? Or did she remain even in death as the hag?

Regardless, personally she remains tied for my top Disney villain (with Maleficent), and by far the scariest, particularly as a child.

I find it fascinating, almost magical, how the right colors, textures, and lighting can transform a scene. But here‚Äôs the question that keeps circling in my mind: Do audiences, especially those not involved in filmmaking, really see these subtle details? Do they feel them, even if they don‚Äôt consciously notice?

For context, I make movies purely for fun, out of passion. They‚Äôre not for money or validation, just a way to express myself. Sometimes I wish I could ask my 10-year-old self‚Äîsomeone who simply loved movies without knowing the technical side‚Äîif these nuanced elements would have mattered to him. Back then, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about grain structure, dynamic range, or color grading. I was just immersed in the magic of storytelling.

It reminds me of this video by Cleo Abram about football shots. She discussed how people thought the footage looked incredible‚Äîlike it was shot in 8K‚Äîwhen, in reality, it was all about the aperture. The shots people loved were done on DSLRs with a shallow depth of field, unlike traditional broadcast cameras with their massive lenses, which prioritize a different aesthetic. When I saw the footage, I instantly recognized it was the aperture creating that ""cinematic"" look, not resolution or 8K. But it was fascinating to see how much people loved the DSLR footage without knowing why.

From this example, it‚Äôs clear that people do notice these things‚Äîbut does it really matter? My assumption is that there‚Äôs a bare minimum that evolves over time as generations grow up exposed to better and better clarity. They notice the overall improvement, but they can‚Äôt pinpoint what it is‚Äîand honestly, they don‚Äôt even care. It‚Äôs not their job to know these details.

That‚Äôs the thing, right? This is also why smartphones have diminished DSLR sales compared to a few decades ago, when standalone cameras were the only option. Obviously, we in the industry know the technical reasons why DSLRs are still better than even flagship phone cameras. But that‚Äôs not the point. The point is the bare minimum.

And honestly, as an aspiring filmmaker, I feel great about this. It means I can start with a smartphone as my camera. All I have to do is figure out what the bare minimum is for how my movies need to look. Everything above that is good to have, but not necessarily a deal-maker.

Because at the end of the day, if the vibe of the movie doesn‚Äôt resonate with someone, they won‚Äôt want to watch it‚Äîno matter how good it looks, even in IMAX.

So, to the community here: Do you think the average viewer, or even a younger version of yourself, notices or appreciates subtleties like film emulation, color, or light? Or are these details more of a filmmaker's obsession? And what do you think that ""bare minimum"" standard is today?

Edit-
The reason why I ask this question is because I make movies simply because the process makes me happy. But sometimes, I find myself diving too deep into the rabbit holes of filmmaking details, losing track of the joy and starting to see perfection in those details as the only path to fulfillment‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs really not. That‚Äôs not who I am. Even though I make movies for myself, I wanted to understand what the audience actually feels about these things because, honestly, I‚Äôve been exhausted thinking about it all on my own. What I really want is the clarity to know when I‚Äôve done enough, to recognize when I‚Äôm focusing too much on the details and losing sight of myself in the process.",No-Indication9775,1ha8nph,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,2024-12-09 12:31:23,0,0.27,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha8nph

movies,Was the main character of Kingdom of Heaven (2005) the real son of Godfrey in the movie? I think he might not have been.,"Rewatching the movie and I start to think that Bailan (Orlando Bloom) may not have been Godfrey's (Liam Neeson) real son.

I see it as Godfrey and his circle were driven by meritocracy and finding a right guy to fit into Jerusaleem to keep peace, justice and all.

After seing the smith and hearing about his talents, the hosptalier (David Thewils) asks Godfrey ""remember what we talked about on the road?"".

I think that they either
a) agreed to come back to France and pick the most deserving/fitting man to become Godfrey's heir, either while on the road or even before sailing out from the Holy Land

b) Met his real son and realized they couldn't let such a jerk inherit the.piece of the kingdom of god they were building

c) Both a) and b) + hearing about his engineering talents played the crucial part of choosing him.

It is just a presumption, but it lays into the narrative which both Godfrey and King of Jerusaleem pronounce, ""everyone can be the master of his fate here, no matter who he was in his homeland"".

Baldwin even straightly says ""a father may claim a son"" while pronouncing this whole narrative during his first conversation with Bailan.",RuslanNCAA,1ha1p10,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,2024-12-09 04:30:26,0,0.35,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha1p10

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Sweden,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Spain. It's interesting, because more than 100 comments later, in a way, we have a ""fpreign-but-not-so-foreign"" winner here: Internationally, ***El labertino del fauno*** (engl.: *Pan's Labyrinth)* is likely to be the best-known film on our list so far.

But [our official letterboxd list ](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)immediately calls for the next movie. We now move on to the next euorpean country with S, namely **Sweden**. Just like yesterday, there are only two rules to follow today:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

In iRobot, Will Smith had a retro stereo system that was behind the current tech in the movie. In WALL-E, the robot is always watching vintage black and white movies. In the 2018 movie Upgrade where the main character gets an AI implant to give him the ability to walk again, he also has a 70s model car.

movies,"I'm gonna defend the ""Liar revealed"" trope in Bug's life","I know people hate the ""Liar Revealed"" trope and im not gonna argue that this scene is actually a ""Masterfully done example"" of it or anything, but people always say the same thing regarding it.  ""Why do they care that Flik lied?  They have the giant bird! thats the plan now! why wouldnt that work?!?!""

But people are forgetting the overall context of Flik in the group.  Flik was a *continuous* screw-up before he went out to get the warrior bugs.  They literally sent him out of the colony to look for warriors just so they would have time to fix HIS major screw-up.  They were even arguing about what his punishment should be but couldnt figure one out cause he's apparently had, and subsequently messed up, every single job he's been given.  So they aren't discounting the bird plan because ""oh Flik lied so theres no way that plan will work.""  They're discounting it because he's literally **NEVER** had a plan that DIDNT make things worse.  

On top of that, they think him saying ""The Bird will Work"" is just him trying to cover his own Ego rather than to save everyone.  He lied about the Warrior bugs the ENTIRE time they were there and if the grasshoppers came, they would've been no help whatsoever without the bird plan.  NOT telling the truth actively put the entire colony at risk as they weren't rushing to gather extra food for the grasshoppers.  They think he kept the lie going to just protect HIMSELF, so him insisting on the bird plan sounds like he's still protecting HIMSELF over the colony.

Again, I understand people don't like the Liar revealed trope, and I won't say this is a 'groundbreaking' take on it or anything, but the ants don't think his plan will work cause he's screwed up every single idea he's ever had.  Its not just because ""oh he lied, therefore it wont work.""",Bladebrent,1h9vury,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9vury/im_gonna_defend_the_liar_revealed_trope_in_bugs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9vury/im_gonna_defend_the_liar_revealed_trope_in_bugs/,2024-12-08 23:24:47,0,0.38,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h9vury

movies,"Revisiting ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" critiquing it on its own merit, I found it to be a pretty bad film.","This is a sort of Mandella Effect with me, but after rewatching the film only remembering bits and pieces of it when I was younger, I was surprised how small the guardian angel imagination sequence actually is. I thought this was the bulk of the 2nd act originally, but it happens after the film almost reaches its 2-hour runtime. The impact this film has in popular culture is completely dependent on those final 20 minutes.   


If you look up the plot of the film on an website, it will say a variation of ""An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.""

This, however, actually happens at the end of film.  This happens about 1 hour and 50 minutes into it. So, this cannot be the plot of the movie. This could only be the plot of the movie if the first act gave us a brief character development of George in the first act, before Clarence takes him on his excursion, where the film will spend the majority of its runtime. But that is not what happens. The plot of the film is actually more closely aligned with, ""A businessman is at financial and personal dilemma when a wealthy tycoon has sights to take over his business and have completely control over the city.""

The only reason this is listed as a plot is the impact its had in culture rather than the film on its own merit.

Other things:

The film opens with an exchange of George, Violet and Mary and children. Violet and Mary both fawn over George.

The way the film opens, you'd think this would foreshadow Violet and Mary feuding over Goerge as adults, or George having to choose one. Opening with the 3 of them suggests these 3 are going to be the main characters later. But no. Adult Violet isn't really integral to the plot at all. Kid Violet has more lines than adult Violet. The opening scene sets something up that didn't end up happening.  

A 7-year-old Violet's innocent crushes on ""a lot of boys"" is somehow offensively supposed to foreshadow that adult Violet is promiscuous. Women who are promiscuous and exotic dancers don't generally start showing signs of this at 7, and it's completely unrelated to any crushes she'd have at that age. 

They spent too much on the opening scene when the only two plot points it needed was to show that George saved the druggist from a fatal error, and George liked exploring. The druggist ended up being an insignificant character later on, so there's no need to spend so much time here. 

George is mildly surprised that Mary is ""18"" as if they just met, yet doesn't seem to remember Mary from childhood. Young Mary didn't just come into the pharmacy that one time; she knew George quite well. Young Mary whispered in his ear ""I'll love you 'til the day I die,"" so they were well acquainted with each other as children.  In fact, there is never a callback to the child years, as if the opening scene was tacked-on later.

We didn't need the narrator exposition by the angels. We didn't need to the conversation by the angels at the introduction about who George is. Clarence's first appearance could've been when he was drowning, and that would've been fine.  There's enough exposition that Clarence is an angel after Clarence saved him (or George saved Clarence) that we didn't need the opening exposition.   
  
If we already see Clarence in human form, then what was the point of the star sequence anyway, which was also horrible special effects even by 1946 standards? The movie could've opened with Clarence in human form simply could've been conversing with the two other angels off-screen.  There was no point in showing them as stars. This seems like a tacked-on reshoot when they didn't have the actors available. 

Officer Ernie spots George by the bridge and says he's been looking for him all night. George is ecstatic he's back to his normal life and leaves. However, if Ernie had been looking for George all night, then he would've stopped at Martini's Bar prior the bridge, where the patrons would've told Ernie that George left drunk. Additionally, Ernie would've found out about the accident. Regardless of his friendship with Ernie, George still should've or would've been detained for drunk driving and leaving the scene of accident. 

When Freddie opens the gym floor to engage the pool- he's told George and Mary are right over the crack.  Freddie opens this floor, and George and Mary are dancing away from the crack at this point. There're a lot of other dancers closer to the opening than they are, and manage to see and avoid it. But coincidentally, George and Mary are the only two that don't see it and fall in accidentally. The two people that Freddie targeted are the two people that happen to fall in despite them not being any more likely than any one else at the dance. What should have happened was, as soon as the floor opened, everyone started falling in. 

Finally, there's an unresolved arc for the main villain. Potter stealing the money isn't addressed, nor is he shown to be defeated overall. 

In sum, it's a badly made film, and the initial reviews are negative, but it does have an cultural impact but that's mostly because it's shown during every Christmas season through decades of rewatch.

	‚Ä¢	Fiennes spends a lot of the film basically naked, and it‚Äôs clear he trained hard for the role‚Äîimpressive dedication!
	‚Ä¢	The movie focuses only on the final third of The Odyssey and takes a few liberties with the story. But the key plot points are there and handled well.
	‚Ä¢	Visually, it‚Äôs stunning. The set design and cinematography are top-notch.
	‚Ä¢	The pacing was my one gripe‚Äîit drags at times and could‚Äôve used a tighter edit.
	‚Ä¢	One major omission: the gods are completely absent. A big part of Homer‚Äôs original was the divine meddling, and the movie doesn‚Äôt even mention them. Homer would not approve!

movies,Galaxy Quest censorship theory.,"For those that haven't seen the movie, absolutely worth the watch, it is the best Star Trek movie made. There is a theory out there that talks about the movie censored a line to achieve a PG13 rating. A scene towards the end takes place where Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen have to navigate through a booby trap inside the ship. When Sigourney Weaver sees the trap, she exclaims ""Well, screw that!"" while mouthing the words ""Well, fuck that!"".

I have a second theory. The premise of the movie is the main characters are former actors of a show, much like Star Trek, and have washed up and struggling to get by. One day, Tim Allen is confronted by strange people at a convention. They claim that they are in danger, and Tim Allen is the only one who can help. He mistakes them as just kooky fans and agrees to meet with them thinking it is a gig. He is instead abducted and taken aboard a ship that is based off the ship on the show he was the star of.

It turns out, these aren't fans, they are a species of alien that have based their entire culture around Galaxy Quest, the TV show. Thinking the show was a factual documentary, they received the signals from earth and practically worshiped the show, replicating everything around them to be as accurate as it would have been in the show. To include how they speak.

TL;DR the aliens would have had something on the ship that would censor any curse words. The TV show was on national television in the 80's and would not have any curse words, therefore the aliens would not allow curse words.

Edit: Yes, I know the movie is known to have been more raunchy and likely has an R rated cut, this is more of a fan theory that gives it an in universe explanation.",JDubStep,1h9wx56,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,2024-12-09 00:16:35,0,0.24,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9wx56

My question to you all is a more general question - what movie have you seen that is about something you either have a ton of knowledge on or is about your work that is so unrealistic it pulled you out of the movie? AND what‚Äôs the opposite (a movie that is unrealistic but you didn‚Äôt even care because it‚Äôs so good)?

If the mods wanna take it down because its been solved they can do it


Hi reddit, as you can see from the title I'm looking for a animated christmas movie that aired on tv back in 2014-2016 (i think) in german on Super RTL. Its a kids movie with an art style similar to 'lady bug catnoir' and 'scooby doo mystery incorporated'.

The main character a boy about 10-12 somehow ends up with Santa claus fighting an evil black bearded santa with a trio of elf girl special forces. These girls have some aort of levitation-y power that the can use by tapping a snowflake on the left side of their neck around where the big vein is.
The girls end up getting trapped and about to be hit by either some deathly laser machine or sunk into lava or an shredder. The MC reacues them by them sharing their levitation with him and at the end fight the evil santa gets the good santas power to clone himself hundreds of time.
The end fight happens in this big room with moving rings around it thats similar to a ""Grand Orrery Model of the Solarsystem"" where you can also get teleported to the houses (i think).
I also remeber the leader of the trio force to first hate the mc and then be more friendly to the end because he rescued them all.

movies,Snow White and The Huntsman -- weird but I don't hate it,"For some reason we have this on BR and we ended up putting it on the other night, not having seen it in probably a decade. And yes, it's a really fucking weird movie, but in some ways it totally works. Obviously there's an emphasis on visuals, which change throughout the movie to reflect the the land's hope vs despair (a la Pride Rock). But this movie has some other things going for it as well. Charlize is crazy but legitimately scary. Kristen Stewart is great, even though she doesn't actually talk all that much for most of the runtime. Plus it's got a banger of an end credits song, courtesy of Florence and the Machine.

The movie has some interesting themes as well. Most prominent is the fear of death and aging, which I think is always going to be subtext of this story. Snow White represents youth, beauty, and purity, which can never last; the pursuit of these things rots the Evil Queen's soul. Aside from making this subtext text, and the obvious feminist interpretations/implications, Snow White and the Huntsman also carries a pretty obvious environmental message. The Evil Queen steals beauty and vitality from not just her people, but the actual land as well, transforming the enchanted forest from a vibrant fairyland into a desolate wasteland.

All that said, the pacing can be really weird. The first twenty minutes is basically backstory, as Snow White's mother dies, the Queen takes control of the kingdom, Snow is imprisoned, and finally she escapes to the enchanted forest, when the huntsman, ostensibly one of the main characters, finally enters the picture. The middle of the movie is a little confusing, because the title characters don't seem to really have goals other than surviving. The poisoned apple and Snow White's coma transition pretty abruptly into the climactic battle, as well.

So yeah, it's weird, and you can point out a few flaws, but it's also a beautifully dark movie with a lot of heart and a pretty clear message. What do you think?

All these PG-13 movies I listed after School of Rock have more extreme inappropriate content then the higher R rated Kings Speech and Steve jobs movie.

You would rather want children to watch the R rated Steve Jobs and Kings Speech rather then PG-13 stuff like Split and The Dark Knight. There's many movies with a lower age rating that's more inappropriate then ones with a higher age rating and comparing movies that share the same rating are inaccurate too.

movies,The Departed 2006 - Second undercover cop.,"So there is a lot of back and forth on Delahunt being a cop or not. Most say it's ambiguous. Most say that Costello is right, when he says that police wanted them to believe he was a cop, to throw them off from the real one. 

But right now rewatching it, I noticed a little scene about 1:40 into the movie. So Sullivan is checking the names of the guys he was given in the envelope. He looks at the picture of Delahunt and yet when he types in his social security number, he gets an error noise, and a message that person is not found. We instantly cut back to Delahunt giving another guy pointers on how to find a cop. Sullivan types in another social security code, and we get a little beep sound like the computer accepted that one. Back on the street, Billy walks out and Delahunt jokingly calls him a cop. And back to Sullivan, he types in Billy's name, and gets another 'person not found' message, and error sound. So in a scene where Delahunt jokes about spotting cops, the two people Sullivan can't get info on at all, are Delahunt and Billy? And this happens just before everything with Delahunt, from him not ratting out Billy, to him being declared a cop on tv. So uhh, I don't think it was for no reason, that Sullivan got two errors on his computer. I think it was just a little hint that not everything about Delahunt was as it seems.

Also, when Billy said that he doesn't have a bank account, Delahunt was the only one to say that he is a cash business himself too.

Edit: for people saying that it was not ambiguous, well I read up on quite a few posts before making mine, and there is no clear answer. Some believe he was, others say that 10 years is too long to be undercover, and most just take Costello's word on it being disinformation (none of the cops confirm or deny it for the rest of the movie, so we don't get a clear answer from any other party than the news).",LegatoRedWinters,1h9ju5o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9ju5o/the_departed_2006_second_undercover_cop/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9ju5o/the_departed_2006_second_undercover_cop/,2024-12-08 14:21:12,0,0.43,0,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1h9ju5o

movies,"In The Count of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviezel, I believe that after so many lies from Fernand and Mercedes, I believed that at the end of the film, Edmond became a misanthrope.","The adaptation with Jim Caviziel appears to be an unintentional parody of the book.

The scene of French high society going to an unknown foreign nobleman's party and him descending from a balloon seemed like a parody of the book. French high society was closed off and the Count acting like a nouveau riche would bring the contempt of the French elite to him. The Count needed someone to open the doors of high society for him. This scene had a comedic tone like the Monty Python movies.

Albert is kidnapped by Luigi's gang and a stranger with a sword appears out of nowhere and saves him, giving a lame excuse when it was supposed to arouse suspicion that the kidnapping was set up.

And the mediocre revenges of the terrible 2002 film. The Count uses the treasure to attract Fernand and Danglars , but it is such an obvious trap that anyone would suspect it and not fall for the trick.

And the way the Count makes Villefort confess to his crime, what an amateur thing. An experienced man like Villefort would never confess his crime with such an amateur trick as the one in the 2002 film.

It would be much better if the Count hired Luigi Vampa 's gang to execute Danglars and Villefort like Michael Corleone executed Moe Greene, Tattaglia and Barzini in the Godfather . And he strangles Fernand like Clemenza strangled Carlo Rizzi . Contrary¬† the logic of the book to inflict prolonged suffering on his adversaries, but it would be a smarter way for the count to get rid of his enemies.

And Edmond reconciling with Mercedes was hilariously poorly written. She was married for years to the man who sent Edmond to a dungeon and you would think there would be a happy ending for them. She shows him a ring and Edmond starts crying saying something worthy of a comedy: ‚ÄúDon't steal my hate, it's all I have.‚Äù¬† Only in the movies do these absurdities happen. In a realistic situation, he would never forget that Mercedes was married to Fernand for years and had sex with him, while he rotted at the Ch√¢teau D' If . And he thinks that even if she claimed she was pregnant with his child, that would not erase or justify to Edmond Mercedes' marriage to Fernand. And worse, she lied and deceived. Wouldn't this help Edmond become a misanthrope like Gullinver ? Even the woman he loved proved to be an untrustworthy person.The couple reconciles and there is no resentment on Edmond's part for his former fianc√©e marrying Fernand or for having lied or deceived. And Albert discovers that he is the count's son and everything is fine, no trauma or questioning on Mercedes' part.

I thought that in the end, Edmond, tired of all the lies and deceit he had lived, would become a misanthrope like Gullinver . After all, the people close to him had proven to be untrustworthy. He would start to avoid human presence. Gullinver at the end of the book avoids the presence of his family In Livor, Mercedes was an honorable woman and that is why Edmond respected her.",cleopatraandcaesar63,1h9kgw4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,2024-12-08 14:53:16,0,0.23,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h9kgw4

movies,Losing your local movie theater,"When it opened in 1999 as a Carmike, my local movie theater was the premier high-tech theater of the future in the area. I saw Star Wars Episode 1 there 3 times. I saw the whole Lord of the Rings series &amp; probably something like 150 other movies there over the years. My roommate worked there for quite a while.

Except for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off. My girlfriend and I saw Endgame there at 8pm on opening night &amp; there were only about 8 other people.

The last movie I saw there was The Way Back, a drama with Ben Affleck as an alcoholic basketball coach. This was March 15, 2020. Two days later, it closed for COVID &amp; never reopened. At the point it closed, it still had the original carpet, which was badly stained &amp; full of holes &amp; the original seats, many of which were broken &amp; could not safely support a person.

movies,"The Count of Monte Cristo (2024) - A terrible adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic. The screenwriters didn't understand that the Count would be a mix of Job, Joseph, Raskonilkov and Ulysses and made the Count a kind of masked vigilante.","

The Count of Monte Cristo from Alexandre Dumas' classic would be a story of Joseph (son of Jacob), Job , Raskonilkov (Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky ) and Ulysses ( the Oydsey by Homer )

¬†A man with a tragic past, many scores to settle, an insatiable thirst for justice and *a lot of* money to spend on it, who returns to his home country years after being struck by a tragedy, with new fighting skills, disguises and unlikely allies in his mission to bring vigilante justice to criminals, all while dressed almost eternally in a black uniform. If the reader thought ‚ÄúBatman!‚Äù, know that the author did too; but, according to the French, this is none other than Edmond Dant√®s , Alexandre Dumas‚Äô Count of Monte Cristo. Apparently.

¬†

One would expect the French to have greater respect for their own literary heritage, but apparently not. The new French film adaptation of the work, starring Pierre Niney and acclaimed in France, though why is beyond this author‚Äôs comprehension, makes this abundantly clear. Dumas‚Äôs masterpiece is altered so significantly that it is once again virtually unrecognizable; once again it is transformed into a story that completely contradicts everything Dumas intended in his book. ‚ÄúThe greatest revenge story of all time‚Äù is reduced to the most vulgar, superficial level of its existence‚Äîskin and bones, a melodramatic, caricatured serial novel.

Edmond Dant√®s de Niney is almost a superhero. He is an expert in hand-to-hand combat , undergoing a *training montage*¬†which makes no sense at all ‚Äì apparently, the Prisoner of Ch√¢teau d' If was hell, and yet he had enough strength, energy, space and freedom to train in combat with an Abb√© Faria -, leaves his insignia as a mark after beating up several ""tough guys"" on a street corner (tough guys hired by him, let's make that clear), is always wearing a black coat almost reminiscent of a cape, has in his house (heavily produced by CGI) a closet that becomes a shooting target when he presses a button, and uses masks and latex prosthetics with an almost comical proficiency.

¬†

In many ways, the film is reminiscent of the French Netflix series ‚Äú Lupin ,‚Äù which adapts Arsene ‚Äôs classics. Lupin , the Burglar, for modernity. But ‚Äú Lupin ‚Äù is a modern adaptation, not a direct one ‚Äì the series revolves around a fan of the books who commits crimes inspired by them in the 21st century, and does not directly adapt any story from the books featuring the character Arsene. Lupin ‚Äì and, above all, one that doesn't take itself too seriously.

It is excellent for what it sets out to do, with all its absurdities and moments of comedy. If the new Monte Cristo had followed the same approach, the situation would be entirely different ‚Äì this could be a more youthful, fun and intelligent adaptation of Dumas' wonderful book ‚Äì but that is not what happens. The film wants to be taken seriously, and it wants to be a direct adaptation of Dumas' book, and that is why it fails.

The film is a modern, youthful, almost Marvel Cinematic approach. Universe ‚Äì without considering itself as such, the main source of ridicule in this whole farce ‚Äì of a classic that deserves much better than this. It adds totally unnecessary action scenes ‚Äì including scenes of Monte Cristo fighting hand-to- hand with several men in the middle of the street *and* the infamous duel (in the case of this specific adaptation, one was not enough; there are *two* duels, one with pistols and one with swords, invented for the film for no reason other than to follow in the footsteps of its equally mediocre predecessors) that half the Monte Cristo adaptations insist on including, despite Dumas's deliberate choice to subvert the expectations of his genre and purposefully avoid clich√©, and to compensate he cuts buckets and buckets of nuance and narrative delicacy.

¬†

It is clear that it is impossible to expect a perfect adaptation of a classic of over 1,500 pages into a film, even if that film is almost three hours long. Even the greatest classics of cinema, with all their brilliance, have not managed to do so ‚Äì Gone with the Wind‚Ä¶, Ben-Hur , etc. Yet, these same classics ‚Äì and other more modern ones, such as Les Mis√©rables from 2012, for example (speaking of which, Victor Hugo has not slept in the Pantheon for decades because his grave neighbor, Dumas, has been struggling in his own coffin since at least 2002, when the adaptation of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviziel hit theaters. Please, someone help him.) ‚Äì have already proven that it is possible to make a good adaptation of masterful, complex and, of course, immense books in a relatively short space of time. The secret is to preserve what really matters ‚Äì and that is where Monte Cristo with Niney fails.

First of all, let's talk about the man of the moment: Edmond Dant√®s , *the* Count of Monte Cristo. What was done to Dumas' protagonist was outrageous. The problem is not exactly Niney - although he doesn't help either - but his characterization.

¬†

The clothes, the laughable aging, the disheveled hair, all of this contrasts so ridiculously with Dumas's elegant, refined, sophisticated, and utterly charming yet arrogant Monte Cristo, who took over Parisian society in the space of a few months, that it is hard to believe that the character is the same person. His methods are equally crass, and infinitely less sophisticated than those of his literary counterpart, and for this, the character suffers.

An excellent example of this tragic character deconstruction is what happens to Monte Cristo to save Albert. For some inexplicable reason ‚Äì not even the shorter and, in theory, less concerned with details film of 2002 makes this mistake ‚Äì the Italian narrative is completely omitted. So, so that Monte Cristo has an excuse to get close to Albert, he fakes a robbery himself, hiring men to do it, just to have the opportunity to beat them all up in the middle of the street and ‚Äúsave the boy‚Äôs life‚Äù.

A significant difference from the well-structured plan described in the book, during which Monte Cristo, over the course of several days, befriends and displays his immense wealth to Albert and his friend Franz D' Epinay during the Roman Carnival, arranging for the young man to eventually be kidnapped, and then negotiating his release with Luigi Vampa , the feared Italian bandit responsible for the crime ‚Äì and Monte Cristo's debtor, who used his influence with the Pope to save the life of one of his men ‚Äì for no money at all, thus ensuring that the two young men returned to Paris not only grateful and willing to do anything for their new friend, but also impressed and ready to spread throughout French high society fabulous stories about the legendary wealth, courage, phlegm and power of a man who has as much influence in the Vatican as in the European criminal underworld.

Dumas‚Äôs Count of Monte Cristo would never hire men just to beat them up. This is humiliating for a man who prided himself with an almost irritating sense of self-importance on his near-superhuman ability to do, well, anything. When the Count does fight someone, he fights them, period‚Äîand wins on his own merit. But most of all, Dumas‚Äôs Monte Cristo would *never* go toe-to-toe with ‚Äútough guys‚Äù on a street corner, even if the fight were paid for. He solves his problems with telegrams, money, and pistols, not *bartitsu* . He doesn‚Äôt lay a finger on *anyone* , and he‚Äôs all the more effective and lethal for it.

¬†

Adding violence in the name of action is a common problem with adaptations of Monte Cristo. The book is often classified as a ‚Äúswashbuckler novel‚Äù ‚Äì and while it is, to some extent, it is a simplistic classification, as Dumas is deliberate in avoiding certain clich√©s and common tropes of the genre.

He creates the entire scenario of the duel (an almost mandatory item to be included in this type of novel in the 19th century), for example, but purposely does not let it happen, subverting the expectations of his readers and making his story more sophisticated because of it ‚Äì since the resolution to the duel occurs in a surprisingly beautiful and emotionally profound way, which makes a huge difference not only in the development of the characters' arcs but in the narrative as a whole ‚Äì and it is a shame that adapters ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù this perceived ‚Äúfailure‚Äù to align with the literary expectations of their supposed category. In this film, it is no different: two duels, in addition to the laughable fight in the middle of the street, are added to the story, always at the expense of complex and well-constructed narratives, which in the book involve the emotional and psychological state of the characters, and in the film are nothing more than action sequences without further details.

But if that were all, perhaps it would be possible to save the film. But, of course, it isn‚Äôt. As is customary in mediocre adaptations ‚Äì yes, 2002, I‚Äôm talking to you directly ‚Äì the villains of Monte Cristo are completely mischaracterized to such a crass level of exaggeration that it becomes childish. Due to lack of time, no doubt, but equally due to lack of imagination and understanding of the text, Villefort , Danglars and Mondego are transformed into people so devoid of any human characteristics that it is almost possible to hear the echo of an evil laugh every time one of them enters the room. This author more or less expected one of them to stroke his mustache maliciously while giving a speech about his infallible plan to dominate the world, *a la the* mad scientist from a children‚Äôs film ‚Äì Dr. Heinz. Doofenshmirtz , the comedic villain from the Disney Channel cartoon ‚Äú Phineas and Ferb ,‚Äù is frankly a more intelligently written and less stereotypical character.

Dumas‚Äô characters are men who can be found in any high society salon today, just as they might have been in his time: family men, with varying degrees of love for their children and wives and involvement in domestic life; businessmen, with varying degrees of competence and probity; well-liked men , very pleasant and sometimes even too nice. Men, in short, ordinary, but with more than one terrible secret. Men who have their qualities, but succumb to their weaknesses ‚Äì ambition, greed, passion, flattery, instincts of survival and self-preservation ‚Äì all too often. These are the nuances that make them so real, so credible and so despicable, without, at one time or another, we fail to feel some degree of sympathy for one or two of them. These are the nuances so undignifiedly thrown out the window, like the corpses in The Prisoner. of Ch√¢teau d' If , for this production.

Let‚Äôs start with Fernand. Following the pattern established on other occasions ‚Äì most famously by the 2002 film starring Caviziel ‚Äì Mercedes‚Äô envious cousin can‚Äôt just be that; he *has to be* Dant√®s ‚Äô best friend . How, after all, are we supposed to know he‚Äôs a despicable person if he doesn‚Äôt betray *his best friend* out of jealousy and ambition? How, oh my God, can we not like a villain if he‚Äôs not completely and irremediably that ‚Äì despicable? And he‚Äôs rich, of course. Don‚Äôt let Dumas‚Äôs poor, ambitious Mondego, willing to do anything to climb the career ladder, appear on a movie screen. He has to be a rich nobleman and, let‚Äôs not forget, *despicable* from the start, or he won‚Äôt do. He‚Äôs so caricatured that ‚Äì and here the author assures us she‚Äôs not joking, despite what it might seem ‚Äì he wears an eyepatch. Is there anything more appropriate for a cartoon villain than an eyepatch ?

He and Dant√®s have a showdown at the end of the film ‚Äì a sword duel that never happens in the literary counterpart of the story, and which has none of the dignity of Dumas. The author's Monte Cristo never crosses swords with Morcef , he is too calculating for that. His revenge is much more sophisticated, and ends with Morcef himself committing suicide ‚Äì too cowardly, and perhaps too disturbed, to even consider going through with a duel with the newly revealed Edmond Dant√®s . Far superior, without a doubt, is Monte Cristo's foolish display of mercy when he defeats his enemy and lets him live, something simultaneously out of character and meaningless for the construction of the narrative as it was.

Danglars is made equally over-the-top in his villainy, which is a shame, as he was already brilliantly *despicable* and, frankly, disgusting in the original, and didn't need these additions - but he gets them, of course. In Dumas's book, the character was an accountant who had ambitions to become captain of the Pharaon , and who becomes jealous when the young First Mate, Dant√®s , is promoted to the position. After Dant√®s 's arrest , he receives the promotion, and eventually leaves the sea life to become a corrupt and greedy banker who puts money above all else - including his family. In the film, he is already captain, and is demoted from the position, which is given to Dant√®s , after refusing to save a drowning woman, which Dant√®s does in his place.

¬†

He rises in the world by becoming a slave trader. He is directly responsible for the destruction of the Morrel family , sabotaging their ships ‚Äì the Morrels ‚Äô situation in the book is simply a natural case of bad luck, with their ships sinking over the years ‚Äì and leading Morrel to die in poverty ‚Äì something that, once again, does not happen, because in the book Dant√®s is able to save his friend from suicide *in extremis* , an occasion that, in fact, serves to show the good side of the protagonist, who makes a point of rewarding those who were good to him over the years before punishing those who did him wrong, without ever denouncing himself as the author of their good deeds. Danglars finally comes to effectively admit with pride that he is a brute in his first lines ‚Äì in case the rest of the story is not enough for the audience to realize it, of course.

Danglars is one of the most unbearable and realistic villains in his work, precisely because he is an extremely ordinary man - corrupt, cowardly, envious, greedy, selfish, affected, unctuous, sycophantic, ridiculous in his petty pettiness. He has no legitimate reason to feel wronged by Dant√®s - the position of captain was never his, and in fact it made more sense as a natural promotion for the First Mate than for the accountant, anyway. He makes his wealth like countless men before him - by stealing from the poor and from the public coffers. He sells himself to men richer than himself ‚Äì opening the doors of his house to the billionaire Count of Monte Cristo without thinking twice, when moments before he had tried to belittle him, unaware of his absurd amount of money, and accepting Prince Andrea Cavalcanti as his son-in-law without even bothering to check anything about his life, all in the name of the title of prince ‚Äì, he practically auctions off his daughter to the buyer ‚Äì read, future husband ‚Äì willing to pay the most, and accepts his wife's humiliating affair with the journalist Lucien Debray , who goes out in public with Danglars 's wife and daughter and visits his mistress at her husband's house, with him present, in exchange for inside information on the stock exchange. There was no need to change such a brilliant villain precisely because he was so good at generating disgust. He was already terrible enough in his own pettiness.

And what about Villefort , the most complex of all the three villains in Monte Cristo? Dumas's Villefort is not, at first, a bad man; just ambitious and insecure. He knows that Dant√®s is innocent and is about to release him; however, when he discovers that the letter that was used to incriminate the boy was written by his father, and that his career could be completely ruined by it, he decides to keep him imprisoned. This simple but perfectly plausible and reasonable story is replaced by one of the biggest changes in the 2024 film ‚Äì Villefort 's father , Noitier , is replaced by his sister, Angele (nonexistent in Dumas's narrative), whom Dant√®s saves from drowning, and who is carrying a letter for Napoleon. Not only does Villefort arrest the man who saved his sister's life, he is violent towards her, hanging her until she is nearly dead, and then handing her over to Danglars to turn into a prostitute-slave. Years later, Monte Cristo finds her destroyed by years of sexual servitude, and she dies soon after.

The Villefort of the 2024 film is so cartoonish that he is not even given the family he has in the book ‚Äì a bad man cannot , it seems, care for his children, care for his father, or have a wife. This not only eliminates one of the most unusual plot lines in the book ‚Äì that Villefort ‚Äôs second wife , Heloise, is a serial killer who is murdering all the family members to ensure that Villefort ‚Äôs inheritance goes entirely to her son, Edouard ‚Äì but it considerably diminishes the complexity of Monte Cristo‚Äôs revenge, both in terms of his actions themselves and in terms of the moral and emotional depth of it for both Villefort and Monte Cristo himself.

The fact that he dies is tragic ‚Äì after all, the book's revenge is delicious precisely because Villefort stays alive and is forced to live with all his worst nightmares coming true at once. All of this, however, is sacrificed for a simple death and a villain without a shred of humanity ‚Äì and, if that weren't enough, the director makes a point of placing hanged bodies rotting in front of Villefort 's office , in case, once again, his villainy wasn't obvious.

This destruction of the characters is sad to watch, because all three are some of the best, most real and human individuals ever created by the author. Dumas' villains are real men, and *for that reason* they are despicable; because they are men like those we can find in various sectors of society, in real life, today, as we could find before. Because they are not monsters, just corrupt, petty and cowardly people . Real-life villains.

How many slave traders, pimps for their own sisters, and forgers of the imprisonment and disgrace of their best friends were walking around in 19th-century France? A certain number, no doubt, but nowhere near as many as the politicians, bankers, military men, and civil servants who embezzle public funds, issue convictions bought for their own interests, commit crimes that remain hidden abroad, get rid of the children they have with their mistresses, forge entire careers on flattery and political changes at the right time, and trample on probity, justice, honesty, and, above all, on poor, nameless innocents as if they were the dust under their shoes. How many *of these* were there in Dumas‚Äôs France? How many of these are there today?

Are they not deserving enough of an audience's hatred?

The adaptation's allergy to nuance and realism in the balance between good and evil, however, also works in reverse: at least two bad characters from Dumas's book are redeemed in a completely inexplicable way in the film, becoming heroic and admirable figures that would surprise Dumas himself. They are Caderrouse and Benedetto.

There is not much to say about Caderrouse ; it is enough to point out that, while in the book he is a man so greedy that he kills his wife ‚Äì and meets his own death ‚Äì for money (but who, despite this, feels remorse for his role as a passive observer in the imprisonment of the innocent Dant√®s ), in the film he becomes a man who is presented with a diamond and refuses it in the name of his moral principles.

Benedetto, also known as Prince Andrea Cavalcanti, is a special case: the character in the book is, in fact, a psychopath or something like that, being not only a terrible criminal, but also willing to torture his (adoptive) mother and kill his supposed father (he believes he is the illegitimate son of Monte Cristo, whom he tries to murder. Eventually, he discovers he is the son of Villefort ). Millions of leagues away from the Benedetto of the 2024 film ‚Äì a progressive hero willing to marry a lesbian woman to help her hide her interest in women, kind, polite, and who lives as an adopted son of Monte Cristo, who has great affection for him (significantly different from Dumas's Monte Cristo's opinion of Benedetto, which, in his own words, disgusts him).

Benedetto's death ‚Äì nonexistent in the book ‚Äì while taking revenge on his father, Villefort , is one of the saddest and, in theory, most emotionally charged moments in the film, and it is what makes Monte Cristo doubt the justice of his actions. It took the place of the death of Edouard de Villefort , Villefort 's young son . And, of course, it makes no sense. After all, Monte Cristo begins to have doubts after seeing his revenge result in the death of an innocent man ‚Äì a seven-year-old child who had no connection with his father's crimes and no part in his plan. How is it possible to transfer this same degree of guilt for the death of a boy who was as interested in revenge as he was ‚Äì after all, Benedetto in the film also wanted to end Villefort , and dies doing so ‚Äì and who participated willingly and enthusiastically in his plan? The answer is ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù. The choice renders much of Dant√®s 's doubts meaningless or, at the very least, out of proportion, and eliminates some of the most dramatic scenes and most significant moments of the narrative in its wake.

Early in his revenge plot in the 2024 film, Dant√®s goes to a church and angrily tells Jesus that from now on he will do what God was clearly unwilling to do ‚Äì serve justice. Although dramatic ‚Äì reminiscent of Bram ‚Äôs Dracula Stoker with Gary Oldman , even -, the scene once again contradicts everything Dumas writes in his book. The literary Count of Monte Cristo would not commit this kind of blasphemy, not necessarily out of immense faith and fear of God, but because he sees things in a completely different way.

One of the main themes of Dumas's ‚ÄúThe Count of Monte Cristo‚Äù is the *Dies Irae* , divine wrath. This is because the Count himself positions himself as an agent of divine providence, and justifies all his actions as being part of God's will. He understands that he was rescued from D' If and gifted with his fabulous fortune to serve as a divine agent who dispenses justice like the God of the Old Testament, and that it is God's will that his vengeance be carried out. He would never ""argue"" with Jesus about his lack of action, because he understands that everything that happened to make him a Count was his action. He is not acting because God did not do it; he is acting because God compels him. And this aspect is fundamental not only for the symbolic and thematic integrity of the narrative constructed by Dumas, but also for the psychological aspect of the protagonist, who feels perfectly justified in his notion of justice and bases many of his actions on this reasoning.

¬†

This erasure of themes linked to the Old Testament ‚Äì which is explored in the book, by the way, through a much more philosophical than religious approach ‚Äì is also connected to several disappearances of characters extremely relevant to the story, but which the film cuts out completely: Maximilien Morrel , Luigi Vampa , Bertuccio , Edouard de Villefort , Heloise de Villefort , Monsieur Noitier , Hermine Danglars , Valentine de Villefort , Franz D' Epinay , and, of course, the modification of the roles of characters such as Hayd√©e, Benedetto and Caderrousse . These disappearances have gigantic consequences for the plot, which has to be developed in a completely different way to accommodate the absence of certain characters, since Dumas structured his narrative in such a way that even the most insignificant events and minuscule characters are fundamental to the functioning of the story.

It is important to realize that almost all of the characters mentioned are members of certain characters' families. There are a number of implications for each of these cuts individually, but as a collective example, nothing better than the Villefort axis of the narrative: after all, without Heloise de Villefort , Hermine Danglars , Noitier , Edouard , Valentine and Morrel , how does Gerard de Villefort 's Monte Cristo get revenge ? The 2024 film resolves this with a death at the hands of Benedetto, something reasonably better than his senseless death in the 2002 film, but a simplistic solution when compared to the sophistication and true family drama that Dumas' Edmond engenders, involving poisons, serial murders, a faked death, an illegitimate son, an Italian criminal, a baby buried alive and a high-caliber public trial, resulting in the judge going mad, who begins to dig up his backyard in search of the son he had buried two decades earlier, having his reputation - the very thing he condemned Dant√®s to protect - ruined and his family torn apart.

Similarly, what prompts the Count of Monte Cristo to reflect on the justice of his revenge if there is no little Edouard there ? Hayd√©e, the adaptation says, for the princess reminds the Count of the price of his revenge after the death of the reformed Benedetto, for whom Monte Cristo and she herself have great affection. It has already been discussed why Benedetto as a catalyst for this particular drama does not work, and now it remains to speak briefly of the implications of this for the character of Hayd√©e.

This act of killing an innocent person that leads to questioning his actions , precedes Raskonilkov in Crime and Punishment. He kills the innocent, Lizaveta . Ivanovna¬† who was the pawnbroker 's sister Alyona Ivanovna made Raskonilkov question his theory about the Great Man, that extraordinary men in the name of the common good could transgress social rules.

Hayd√©e is a character who is often misunderstood , and this time was no different. The fact that she appears in the film is already a great victory ‚Äì most adaptations don‚Äôt even bother to do this ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean that her character wasn‚Äôt, as expected, destroyed. It‚Äôs easy to think of Hayd√©e as a mere accessory, one more detail in the calculated identity created by Edmond Dant√®s to enchant Paris as a millionaire, eccentric and orientalist aristocrat ‚Äì and therein lies one of the great misinterpretations of the work. Not only does Hayd√©e play a major role in the revenge plot that the Count has been hatching for a decade, but the revenge in question is also hers: one of the men who wrongly accused Dant√®s , taking him to prison in D' If , to marry his then fianc√©e, Mercedes, is the same one who betrayed her father's trust, killed him, and sold Hayd√©e and her mother into slavery ‚Äì Fernand Mondego, the Count of Morcef .

Hayd√©e is as vengeful as Monte Cristo. She is angry. She is deceitful, and she is a match for the Count in every way, part of a Machiavellian duo who have spent years plotting revenge. Hayd√©e is not simply a pawn on Monte Cristo‚Äôs chessboard, much less the voice of conscience on his shoulder: for all we know, she is his partner in the game, and does more to encourage him than to stop him. Like him, she has suffered immensely at the hands of her enemies, and like him she has a deep desire for revenge. There is, however, one fundamental difference between the two: unlike Edmond, Hayd√©e seems immune to any kind of remorse.

This is the fundamental aspect of their relationship‚Äîa sadly underdeveloped aspect of the Count-Princess dynamic in many adaptations, and one that is effectively ignored in 2024. Hayd√©e may be a source of peace for Monte Cristo, but she is certainly not a numbing agent. She does not help him forget the demons that haunt him, because her presence in his life is entirely conditioned by the existence of those demons. He would never have met her if he had not been searching for ways to disgrace the man who put him in prison. Hayd√©e is not oblivion: she is a reminder of the horrors committed by those whom Edmond destroyed, and that he was justified in his anger. And unlike him, Hayd√©e seems to be completely at peace and content with everything that has happened.

She has no doubts ‚Äì and perhaps that helps Edmond feel at peace. And, in the end, she is also probably the only person in Dumas‚Äôs entire narrative who gets everything she wants. To take that away from her ‚Äì to make her a young woman in love with *Albert* , completely ignoring her narrative function as Dant√®s ‚Äôs romantic partner , and to make her a spokesperson for remorse and morality on the Count‚Äôs shoulder ‚Äì is to diminish and decomplexify one of Dumas‚Äôs brilliant and forgotten female characters, who are once again relegated to clich√©s of goodness and honor.

¬†Haydee bears a certain resemblance to Sonia Marmeladova from Crime and Punishment. Sonia offers Raskonilkov hope for happiness and a new beginning after he confesses his crime, just as Haydee offers the Count of Monte Cristo the chance for a new beginning after he forgives Danglars . Just as Job had lost everything and gained back twice as much as he had lost, so too did Monte Cristo.

The addition of melodrama doesn‚Äôt leave even the inanimate objects untouched: Monte Cristo‚Äôs treasure gets a new origin story, so dramatic that it might deserve its own book. It passes through the hands of the Borgias , the famously cruel French king Philip IV the Fair, and the *Knights Templar* ‚Äì of which Abb√© Faria is the last, by the way (At this point, Dumas begins to convulse in his coffin. √âmile Zola, his other grave neighbor who is also being prevented from sleeping, accuses the screenwriter who decided that this was a good idea) ‚Äì before reaching the hands of the sailor from Marseille. Speaking of Faria, he dies from fatal injuries after being crushed in an escape attempt ‚Äì much more dramatic and less plausible than the death of the Faria in the books, due to a health condition that runs in his family and seems to be something like epilepsy.

¬†The aforementioned romance between Albert and Hayd√©e ‚Äì which makes no narrative or thematic sense whatsoever ‚Äì is another one of those additions that turn the book into a soap opera-like melodrama for no reason at all. How does it happen? We don't know; the film doesn't bother to develop this aspect of the narrative well, certainly not well enough to justify such absurdity ( *please* , think of Hugo and Zola). All we know is that Albert and Hayd√©e decide to run away together, madly in love, even though Albert's father killed Hayd√©e's father, and Hayd√©e was instrumental in the downfall of Albert's father ‚Äì and family. Monte Cristo forces her to tell him this , of course, because what would become of this romance *a la*¬†Romeo and Juliet if the drama were not made explicit to the entire audience?

That it was a poorly told story is bad enough, but the real problem here is what it means for the arcs of both characters. Hayd√©e‚Äôs literary function is, as we‚Äôve already established, to be Monte Cristo‚Äôs perfect match; Albert‚Äôs is to be a young dandy who develops and becomes a better man through the influence, destructive as it was, of the Count, as he abandons his family‚Äôs money and name and renounces all pleasure to enlist in the French army and go fight in Africa as a common man, building his new name, reputation, and wealth from scratch to atone for his father‚Äôs crimes‚Äîthough he didn‚Äôt have to.



The ending of the 2024 film is unsatisfying for all possible audiences. On the one hand, those who have not read or care little about Dumas's work generally expect Monte Cristo to end his days married to Mercedes , the ending popularized by many adaptations, including, most famously, the 2002 one. An ending that is exactly the opposite of everything Dumas wanted to say with his book, by the way.

Those who have read the book and are genuinely interested in the author's message, however, expect to see the ending as he wrote it: with Monte Cristo avenged, satisfied but feeling some weight of guilt, sailing east to end his days living as a mistress in the company of Hayd√©e. Not because this is a sugary happy ending ‚Äì on the contrary, the way it is written, it is quite tempered by a good dose of bitterness ‚Äì but because it is the right ending.

At the end of 2024‚Äôs ‚Äú The Count of Monte Cristo,‚Äù Monte Cristo is alone. He has achieved his revenge, but he has lost people he cared about, he has suffered immensely, and above all, he has his doubts, however well hidden behind a stoic facade they may be, about the validity of his actions, instilled in him by Hayd√©e de Janina , by Benedetto‚Äôs death, and perhaps even by his choice to spare Fernand‚Äôs life. He leaves Paris and goes away, leaving a letter behind addressed to Mercedes. A harsh ending, which almost seems to indicate that revenge is not worth it‚Äîa point that has been made a thousand times before, and which would have been reasonable if the entire film had not made such a point of making its villains so caricatured and its protagonist so ‚Äúsuper-heroic‚Äù in his quest for retribution that it borders on incoherent, and above all, if Dumas himself had not written a book that says exactly the opposite.

Dant√®s even flirts with repentance. That‚Äôs all it takes: he is reaffirmed in his revenge time and time again, and even receives a ‚Äúposthumous message‚Äù from his mentor, Faria , which says, ‚ÄúYou will tear out the teeth of dragons, and you will trample lions under your feet, says the Lord.‚Äù If Dumas had drawn it, he wouldn‚Äôt have been so explicit. Dumas‚Äôs Edmond is justified in his revenge, he feels that way, and the narrative sees him as such. Casting doubt on this could be an interesting philosophical discussion, but it doesn‚Äôt serve an adaptation of the work.

The problem here, as in so many other cases, is a simple misunderstanding of the author‚Äôs intent. ‚ÄúThe Count of Monte Cristo‚Äù has become so widely known as ‚Äúthe greatest revenge story of all time‚Äù that for many it has been reduced to that very thing. Let‚Äôs not misunderstand: Monte Cristo is indeed a revenge story, and arguably the most essential of them all, in that it has definitively influenced the genre as a whole, including its imitations, such as Ben-Hur , and its subversions, such as Les Mis√©rables. But the point of the story , for Dumas, was never revenge. That‚Äôs the fun part, of course. Who doesn‚Äôt feel a sense of personal satisfaction when the men who sent an innocent man to prison in order to secure his love, his money, and his reputation end up dead, bankrupt, and disgraced, respectively? These are the narratives that have kept the story, published in installments over the course of a year in a newspaper, interesting to the public for so long. But when you get to the very end‚Äîin those final chapters after everything is over‚Äîyou realize the author had something more important to say. This is not just a story of revenge. It is the story of the fall and rise of a man who was young, and is no longer. Who was innocent, and is no longer. Who was good, and is no longer sure if he still is.
