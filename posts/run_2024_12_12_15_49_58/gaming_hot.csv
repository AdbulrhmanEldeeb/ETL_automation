gaming,A Fjord I made in Minecraft,"This Inlet is part of major fjord I have been developing in my Minecraft world called Sky Pixel. The fjord itself is called the ""Lullaby Fjord"" it is surrounded by large tidewater glaciers I have been making for quite some time now. 

This world is also already released on my Patreon (Sky Pixel) for users to experience and download.

Much of my builds can also be seen on my YT channel @elijahjones as well. 

This build is a small section of my world that I have been developing since 2014. Which includes many cities and landscapes. 

This glacier itself is called the ""Porter Glacier"" it's part of a series of glaciers that run near it such as the ""Harlette, Kusuah, Ellie, Jacie, Rezjvik, Lunaska, and Sathomko glaciers"" amongst others. 

This area I have been developing in my world is inspired by the Pacific Northwest landscapes. I've been doing a ton of developing similar to these landscapes because I was born and raised in the PNW. This area in particular is mostly focused on areas of British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska. I have already developed much of areas within the Cascades and Coast Mountains already. Just making my way up the line. And almost done with this region in my world.

Naming chips the same as desktops, not disclosing TDP to the chip in a clear and straight forward manner, changing naming schemes every few gens, these are all anti-consumer actions that increase their sales of higher end options and screw the customer into paying more for what they don't need just to ensure they get what they do need. 

Clearly, none of the big tech companies is going to change their behavior. They have the market cornered, can limit production to increase pricing, and clearly have no further concern than their bottom line. So I think someone independent but in the arena should handle this for them. Someone like steam. 

I see all the reviewers talking about the demands of certain games, and how some chips can handle a game at low TDP because it is ""light weight"". Or how some games are ""more CPU bound"". Or any other gaming euphemism that gets tossed around in game review and laptop reviews. How exactly is the average consumer (who is a casual gamer remember) supposed to know what any of this means. More importantly, how do they know this info about a game prior to purchase?

I don't think it would take that much for Steam to make a chart showing the performance of each chip at each TDP that is available for purchase in mainstream laptops for the last 5 gens of GPU. Then this table could be sectioned off into 10% sections (or even 5% sections) to show which chips will perform at expected level in each section. In this way, every chip with its individual TDP could at least be approximated to give the user an idea of its performance. Each game would then get a rating of 1-10 (or 1-20 if you use 5% sections) to give the customer at a glance the info they need to make an informed decision. This could be displayed right on the game page in the store. So you would know, my laptop is in tier 8 so I could only comfortable play games with an 8 rating or lower. The standards for the rating could be something like able to play at at least 60 fps, 1080p, high settings or whatever arbitrary settings you want. 

Currently I am still using a 2020 Zephyrus G14 with a 2060 max q. I would assume this would probably rate like 6-7 on this scale (pure guess). I was looking at the PX13 with the 4050 @ 95w. I have absolutely no idea if this would be an upgrade, lateral move, or downgrade from what I currently have. It is 2 gens newer so I assume it is better. But it is also a 4050 where my current is a 2060, so that seems like a step backwards. But again, the Max Q is underpowered by a lot. Even though the 4050 can take more juice, it gets 95W (though it is diminishing returns after 100w from what I have seen with 40 series chips. They both have equal VRAM. In the end I assume it is a slight upgrade, but I don't really know. And honestly, is it worth the cash for only like a 10% boost 4 years later?

The whole gaming landscape is already extremely anti-consumer. Companies like Steam have shown in the past that they will buck that trend and work with customers or do things clearly to their benefit unlike so many other gaming companies. I think this would go pretty far in allowing users to make informed decision when it comes to purchasing games or new hardware. 

tldr: Laptop GPUs should be tested and ranked, data compiled into a chart, and given ratings 1-10 to show general GPU capability. This could then be used to inform purchases of games, or purchases of laptops with specific games playability in mind.

gaming,Idea: Ranking games by their devs,"This is an idea I've had for a month or two now, and I can't imagine I'm the first person to suggest something like this:

People want to be able to experience works of art made by artists they like.  But with video games, the art in question is being developed by potentially hundreds or thousands of people, and it's harder to ascribe authorship to any one person.  Yes, AAA gaming still has the rare Hideo Kojima or Sam Lake, but it's more common for people to follow game companies- which is fine in the short term, but once enough developers leave or get laid off, it turns into the Studio of Theseus.  And all the while, the big publishers want us to focus on the franchise itself rather than the people behind it.

So what if you could keep track of all the individual game devs from project to project?  My idea here is a website that would keep track of games and their devs, and be able to compare them based on how many devs are shared.  So for instance you'd be able to select Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, and find out that they shared (wild guess) 85% of the same devs.  The most obvious challenge is how much weight you give to certain devs, since a game's director is probably more responsible for its vision then, say, a guy who modelled some of the enemy bicycles.  I know basically nothing about how responsibility is divided up within a studio, but just for example you could have the director given 25% of the credit, the department heads another 25%, and the remainder split among everyone else.

I feel like a lot of people would have the same kinds of problems with this that they do with systems like RottenTomatoes, but respect for artistic vision in AAA gaming is in such dire straits, I'd think any version of this would be an improvement.",MiloHawkins,1hcn5np,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,2024-12-12 15:10:54,0,0.37,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcn5np

gaming,My thoughts on TGA Nominees having now played them,"I finally played all of the TGA GOTY nominees thanks to Black Friday deals and I wanted to share my thoughts as award season approaches 

Balatro (9/10)

This game is a masterclass in deceptively simple design and It’s astonishing how easy to lose hours to its “one more run” hook. 

If you’ve avoided it because you think it’s “just poker” or “just a card game,” you’re seriously missing out and doing yourself a disservice. It’s a deeply engaging experience that I think you should try if you haven’t 

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (9/10)

While there’s some debate about its eligibility, for me personally there’s no denying that SOTE delivered one of the absolute best gaming experiences of the year. 

This expansion earns a spot on my Mount Rushmore of DLCs, right alongside Blood and Wine, Shivering Isles, and Phantom Liberty.

Astro Bot (9.5/10)

This. Game. Fucks.

As a fan of classic Nintendo 3D platformers, this felt like a love letter to the genre with a modern twist. 

My only complaint with the game is that I just wanted more of it at the end of the short run time to a platinum trophy. 

The final challenge run and the themed X, Square, Circle, and Triangle levels were brilliant and I’d kill for more levels of that difficulty and quality

If this game was just an appetizer, I can’t wait to see what Team Asobi has in store for the main course. If not for my ultimate favorite this year, this would have been my pick for GOTY.

Black Myth: Wukong (7.5-8/10)

While I enjoyed my three playthroughs of BM: W, I don’t think it quite reaches the same level as the other nominees. 

That said, for the developers’ first big swing, this is a fucking crazy impressive showing. I’m excited to see where they go next as this was an incredibly solid starting point and a downright great game in its own right 

Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (8.5/10)

As a huge fan of the original FF VII, the remake series has been a delight for me. 

The visuals are stunning, and it’s fucking sweet seeing the locations I remember in full 3D recreations. 

However for me it ultimately suffers from some modern open-world fatigue (developers seriously need to retire map towers and their equivalents lmao) 

Despite that, it’s a standout gaming experience, and I can’t wait for Part 3.

Metaphor: ReFantazio (9.5/10)

Jesus Christ, this game.

The characters, world-building, and narrative are utterly fantastic. 

At 40 hours in, it’s easily my GOTY—though, of course, a poorly executed ending could change that. 

My only (minor) gripe is that the soundtrack, while great, doesn’t quite hit Persona levels of perfection.

Final Rankings:
1.	Metaphor: ReFantazio
2.	Astro Bot
3.	Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
4.	Balatro
5.	Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
6.	Black Myth: Wukong

gaming,Are we ever going to get a sense of normalcy back for the AAA gaming space?,"Just saw a post that explains how Activision has a patent in place for a system that maximizes exposure of players with bought skins towards non-paid skinned players. Just reminds me of how desperately greedy every AAA company as seem to turn into. It's as if 
 
-The push for live service for every single company in the industry. 

-Ubisoft's yearly pumping out of same formulaic copies for every IP they have, becoming worse and worse every time till they get to the point where the entire company is looking to sell

-Xbox's constant fumbling of so many first party studios that they've bought out and subsequently shutdown, that's if they were able to finish their projects and release their flops of games. 

-Sony's obsession for high 
profile/cinematic/high fidelity games to get block buster sales numbers. Apparent push for live service games when single player games were what made them get the lead in the I dustry in the first place. Why does it seem

-Rockstar's refusal to develop any games outside GTA and RDR to utilize their extremely monitored online modes for years/decade to come

-EA's total flop of battlefield/battlefront do to short sighted decisions of the company, and there entire scorched earth approach towards shutting down so many studios

-So many god damn broken releases with studios having to deal with outside forces that always end up prioritizing money so far from the actual quality of the product. Even outside of that, we have constant stories of infighting in long standing studios that one way or another have an inherent lack of direction and leadership to get a working product out. This makes the lack of quality in a lot of games an issue involving terrible leadership in developer studios as much as outside interference from share holders.

Can make the list twice as long but you get the picture. It's crazy just how fucked the industry is, especially with how many studios have shut down during and after COVID, and I honestly don't believe the aftermath of COVID has had the most affect in this regard. These companies have been going down this route throughout the late 2010's and took it to overdrive this generation. I mean just look how far Sony has fallen from before, it's good damn mind blowing how much they are fumbling this generation, it's as if anyone in the company with any sense of the industry were lobotomized. 

With the pending recession thats bound to happen soon, along with the aftermath of so many studios shutting down in the past 5 years, I feel like decades of progression and development of the industry itself from now to at least the 90's is going to be totally lost. There are a handful of high profile leaders in the thick of it that are rumored to be developing new studios as we speak, but the economy is turning to shit and these kinds of studios need proper funding to get through and I just don't think many publishers are going to have reasonable demands anytime soon.

I can't help but to feel we aren't going to back to a sense of normalcy in the AAA space. We got some AA studios that have show up, plenty of indie's, but I for one miss the kind of quality, tightly and fully developed games we used to have back in the ps2-ps3/xbox-xbox360 and some of the PS4 eras (where the momentum for monitizaion really picked up). I personally don't believe the amount of indie's, majority of them on early access most of its life on the market, makes up for the lack of experiences we used to have before hand in the gaming space. And I don't believe that's speaking with rose-tinted glasses, as much as reddit likes to preach otherwise.",NamedFruit,1hc87kj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,2024-12-12 00:11:19,0,0.23,0,0,47,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hc87kj

gaming,Revisiting classics can be heartbreaking sometimes,"For example, I’ve recently reinstalled Battlefield 1. I had some major memories with this game as I used to take my PlayStation over to my friends house every Friday night and we used to sit there with two monitors so it was as close to split screen as it gets. For those that are familiar with the game type “Operations” you’ll know what I’m talking about when I say THAT was the game mode you would play. It was both hectic and chaotic all at once.

Coming back to it now there’s just no player base numbers to fill up the lobby so you have to resort to smaller games in different modes like “frontlines”. Makes me think about all the classics shutting down or just not having a player base anymore like rainbow six vegas 2 and Halo 3. I feel these games live forever in our memories but sometimes trying to go back to them just feels so different. Almost like revisiting a house you used to live in.

Unranked queues should just be a wild, fun, chaotic mess where you're rewarded for being extremely good at the game. I don't like feeling pressured to win up against equally skilled players, nor do I enjoy the extremely long matchmaking times, in UNRANKED queues.

gaming,"Thoughts on a game mechanic i had. ""Editing""","I love storytelling. Whether its movies or games.

Id even say that the interactive medium perfected the way stories could be told.

That being said we as gamers have our classics of story games.

Sadly a lot of them are dated by game mechanics and gameplay loops/pacing. 

Also the modern ""remake/remaster"" approach of today actually causes a lot more problems than making the initial game perfect.

For me its like. I love AC and the batman arkham games.

But hate the remaster for not fully doing what they were supposed to do.

I love the quality of live improvements like the gameplay in that being better. The world looking gorgeous.

But then the developers of those games remasters botched the cut scenes and made them ugly.

On one end their good. And on the other it would be great if they turned back to the original.

And i started thinking.

Im a big fan of ""fanedits of movies"". For the people who don't know what that is.

Fanedits are well..edits...by fans of movies where said fan cut or added scenes from a movie to make said movie better.

Whether is pacing or else.

What if games had this feature after your first play through. Making certain passages shorter. Choosing art direction form either version

Idk how that would work as far was the developers budget or time. 

OR...if that would even work.

But to it would be like a chapter menu. Where you can delete long gameplay section that just wasnt for you. Ect....

To make future play throughs easier.

Just a random thought. Curious to what you think.

I also don’t want it to feel like Dark Souls, where either I god stomp a boss after learning patterns, or get annihilated over every small mistake until I god stomp the boss.

Do you know of any games like this? I look forward to your responses.

gaming,Need a little help here with certain genres,"For the past few years, I've been trying to chew through the many games that have piled up. Having been stuck on League and Minecraft, my skills have somewhat gotten worse and I am not any good at some of these newer titles.

To put into perspective: my the hardest thing I've finished / done were probably Brutal Difficulty of SC2 missions, Guardians of Graxia (buggy mess with impossibly efficient AI), and the first ""set"" of levels of Super Hexagon (didn't get the true ending, got to the last basic difficulty and called it good)

Lately, I've played a lot of stuff like Nekopara, Stardew Valley, Minecraft, fairly easy and laid back games. I'm trying to not use guides because I am dumb and want to learn to learn.

TL; DR: Any tips, suggestions, or advice on getting gud at stuff like rougelikes, survival games, and bullet hells?

gaming,Why are most new games that aren’t AAA titles coming out as early access?,Don’t get me wrong there are a few gems that are still in early access that are well worth the buy. My biggest issue is a lot of these games shouldn’t even be released because they’re early alpha builds at best. Damn near unplayable due to numerous bugs and glitches. I know deadlines and impatient shareholders are some reasons for early access releases. I just wish devs would go back to the way things used to be and release the finished game on launch. Early access to me feels like a cop out where the dev can keep a small team working on the game for its future updates. Then use the rest of the dev team to start working on their next game.

gaming,Why doesn't Steam get involved in Android Gaming/Emulation?,"Mobile gaming is appareantly the biggest market in gaming: [Global increase State of Mobile Gaming Industry | GO-Globe](https://www.go-globe.com/state-of-mobile-gaming-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20the%20Mobile,2.8%20billion%20mobile%20gamers%20worldwide.). The reasons are clear. Everyone has a smartphone, but not everyone has a PC fit for gaming or a console. So the obstacles for getting into gaming are pretty low.

Sadly the Playstore mainly constists of garbage games, with a free-2-play and in-app-store monetization model. This model does not aim for good gameplay, but for pulling your money out of your pocket. There are some pearls standing out, like Dead Cells, Slay the Spire and so on, which are direct ports of their pc/console counterparts, but as they have upfront cost, appareantly the big mass does not want them or does not find them in the pile of thrash, that the Playstore is. Since they don't generate enought revenue, the willingness of other publishers to port their already existing games to Android is also neglectable.

Now comes the neat part: If you checkout r/EmulationOnAndroid , basically the whole gaming history, with the exception of the latest consoles, is available on Android through emulation. Using **Winlator** or similar, it is even possible to emulate PC games, without much hassle. I have seen videos of Skyrim, Witcher 3 and even Cyberpunk getting played on High End Android devices. Since this is possible, this eleminates the need for porting games, you can just play the PC version, if you want to. As i understood it, the Steam Deck does the same. It creates a compatibility layer for PC games for the Steam Deck hardware/OS, they were not initially made for.

Now comes the big question: Since such feats can be accomplished by just a few developers worldwide, why is lets say Valve/Steam so not interesed in this topic? They already have a mobile app, with Steam Link a powerful editor for mobile controls and the compatibility layer through their Steam OS. If they tie these parts together they could have a third platform, they could distribute their games for. Imagine you buy a game on Steam and you could play it on PC, on the Steam Deck AND on Android!

It is definitely technically feasible, as it was already shown by others. So why does no one use that potential?",dibade89,1hbntng,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,2024-12-11 06:57:57,0,0.14,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbntng

gaming,"I don't know if a game like this exists, but I'm looking for suggestions. ","Hey everyone, I'll try to keep this as concise as I possibly can. I am looking for a game to play to scratch an itch that I have and I don't know if a game like it exists, but here we go.

MUST HAVES:

- A talent/skill system that allows for high build variety. Something between Elden Ring and PoE.
- Multiplayer. Not so much in MMO, maybe MMOlite, or something that doesn't rely on multiplayer, but supports it and is an integral part of the game.
- Character Customization. Doesn't have to be super in depth.
- Somewhat active community. I don't want to play a game that's practically dead. 


OPTIONAL FEATURES:

- PvP. I can take it or leave it but it will be cool if it had something like it. 
- Base Building. Again, same as above, would be cool if it had it but okay if it doesn't. 

There it is.

This game is one of the most brilliant games I ever played. And a short one, which I appreciate having now a toddler. 
What a wonderful time to be alive to play such an awesome piece of art. Lucas Pope if you ever read this, I'll pay you a drink, whenever.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

For me this game was as marking as Outer Wilds, or Subnautica. Two games with surprising aspects you shouldn't know about prior to playing them.

I wasn't really concerned with PC gaming up until I got the Steam Deck and was floored with the how cool and versatile it is. I also have a Steam Deck Dock so I can hook it up to my TV. It does well for what I use it for. But I think I would like to get a gaming PC to play some older games but with much higher resolution and frames. I also was super impressed by Steam sales, people are not lying when they say you can rack up a library for the price of one game on PlayStation or Xbox. I also have both ps plus premium, and xbox game pass ultimate. So I'm not missing any online action when it comes to those systems.

gaming,I’ve Had Enough of The Diablo 4 and PoE 1 &amp; 2 Discourse,"About a month ago I got back into Diablo 4 and while it’s not perfect by any means it’s a fun, turn your brain off, action RPG. While playing for a month I remembered I pre-order POE2 early access a while back and also was incredibly excited to try it out.

Since then I’ve been switching back and forth between them and have been having a blast because ultimately I understand, that while they occupy the same genre, they are two completely different types of ARPG.

Diablo 4 is a fast paced power fantasy with a lot of high quality polish. POE2 is the spiritual successor of the Diablo 2 formula. It’s a slower more methodical ARPG that requires more thought, with a lot of customization for how you want your builds.

Both are serviceable to their audiences, and both have incredibly loyal fanbases. An while comparisons are inevitable and fair in some cases. Certain sects of each fanbase, like children, look for constant opportunities to shit on the other acting as if there is this “one true” ARPG.

The ARPG community is similar to the JRPG community in that, you have these incredibly vocal voices, who do not make up the majority of players, set these arbitrary “rules” on what constitutes a true game of the genre. So anything that goes against these “rules” is deemed as not a “true” this or that. 

Which then creates this very negative, and unhealthy mindset, that limits your ability to accept anything new or genre pushing. To someone like me, this type of behavior is shallow and embarrassing. Not to mention it’s hypocritical given that most ppl like games within genre for different reasons. 

If it were up to these types we’d still be stuck in the 90’s.

gaming,Easy open world games like Mario Odyssey?,"My five year old son loves video games and while I’ve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I’ve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There’s basically no way to play that game wrong. It’s a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There’s a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.

We’ve tried some other games to varying success, but I’m looking for more options. We are also somewhat system agnostic as I have the means to provide him with different systems.

1. Kirby and the forgotten lands: probably his second favorite. Very youngster friendly. However, it’s not a sandbox and the linear nature frustrated him sometimes (no going backwards, game forces you in a certain direction).

2. Super Mario world 3d and bowser’s fury: the difficulty was a bit too high for 3d world after the first world and suffers the same linear design issue. Bowsers fury was great but ultimately short for him.

3. Animal crossing new horizons: youngster friendly art and design but honestly not in game play. It seems simple, but is heavy on reading and understanding the motivations of progression (paying off your house, earning money, etc.) it also has the issue of not being able to start from scratch and my island is already pretty decked out. He can start his own tent but the island is still the same as my decked out one.

4. Yoshi’s crafted world: great difficulty for kids but again… not open world

5. Captain Toad Tracker: fun bit too difficult as the puzzles get harder

6. Sonic frontiers: way to clunky. He lost interest pretty much right away because of terrible controls.

7. Zelda: breath of the wild: too difficult for him for progression

8. Pokémon: his reading needs to be polished a bit more for him to really get it.

9. Spider-Man: Miles Morales: hilariously is super fun for him to just swing around the city. He even started getting good at fighting, but the puzzles grind him to a halt and then I have to play all those parts.

Anybody have any suggestions that I’ve missed?

gaming,Can someone explain the Indiana Jones hype right now?,"I downloaded it yesterday on my Xbox, and I have to say it’s a pretty mediocre experience for me so far. But the consensus seems to be that it’s going to be GOTY, with people just giving high praise to it.  I feel like I’m missing out on something that’s keeping me from enjoying it. 

My major complaints with this game are that it feels more like an interactive story where I sometimes get to open doors by pressing X and then moving my thumbstick to the left.  When I finally get to see some actual gameplay, it’s mostly stealth. Indiana Jones should be an adventure game, not a stealth game.   Combat when it happens is okay but there’s way better combat in games out there. 

The one thing I do like about combat is there’s lots of options for weapons just lying around that can be easily picked up.  Another thing that’s really the only thing keeping me playing is that the story feels like a real Indiana Jones story, so I keep playing just to find out what happens next. 

Anyway I’m not here to hate on the game, I’m just trying to find out why people love it so much. If I understood that maybe I’d enjoy it more too.

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle combat too easy? Enemies go down in three hits,"I’d post this on the game’s subreddit but I can’t find one. I’m playing on hard difficulty, but enemies go down in three punches. There’s no fight, it’s really just me quickly knocking them out. It ruins the fun a little as there is no consequences for leaving stealth, it’s just an easy 1 2 pop and on to the next enemy. Do the enemies get more life/harder as the game progresses?",theonetowalkinthesun,1hav87a,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hav87a/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle_combat_too/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hav87a/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle_combat_too/,2024-12-10 06:02:41,0,0.37,0,0,16,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hav87a
