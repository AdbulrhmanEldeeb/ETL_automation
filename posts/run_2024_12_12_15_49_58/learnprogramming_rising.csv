learnprogramming,"Your goal isn't to understand everything, it is to develop the skills to be able to understand anything","Here's a mistake I see newbies make all the time - thinking that either a) they have to understand everything, or b) the only stuff they need to be able to understand is the stuff they're currently doing. Both are wrong.

There's too much out there for anyone to understand everything. I've been doing this for over 30 years, and I know what I know is just a drop in the bucket compared to all there is to know.

*But* I am confident that I *could* understand almost any code/library/system within a certain threshold of difficulty - there's some really really hard stuff that maybe is beyond most developers, but for everything else I know that even if I don't know it now, I could learn it if I had to. How long it'd take me to get up to speed will vary by how close it is to my existing knowledge - learning Yet Another Frontend Library I can probably do pretty fast, but getting up to speed on an ancient Cobol codebase might take me much longer since I've never touched Cobol before. But I'm dead certain I could do it even if took me awhile.

That's your end goal. You can't learn everything. This is why just memorizing code doesn't work, and why tutorial hell doesn't help you grow. The skills you need to develop are problem solving skills, learning how to learn, and how to generate abstractions in your mind.

I think a big signal that you've passed from ""learner"" to ""programmer"" is how a lot of people look at libraries. A lot of learners look at libraries and go ""this is a magic box that does things I'd never be capable of doing"", whereas after awhile...well, you'll have written a lot of libraries yourself, so you *know* you could do most of the stuff the library does you're just like ""thank god someone else already wrote this so I don't have to spend the next week/month/year/decade doing it myself"".

**You'll never be done learning** \- this is a bad field to get into if you don't enjoy constantly learning. But, if you keep hacking away at it, you will get to a point where you lose that ""Am I capable of understanding this?"" doubt and instead start asking ""Do I *have time* to understand this?"" instead and realize you just have to pick and choose where you spend your time as you learn new things.",PoMoAnachro,1hc0w8o,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc0w8o/your_goal_isnt_to_understand_everything_it_is_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc0w8o/your_goal_isnt_to_understand_everything_it_is_to/,2024-12-11 18:53:17,423,0.99,423,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hc0w8o

learnprogramming,How to actually get good at programming,"## What Programming is About

In my view, programming has two main components: problem
solving (including debugging) and system design (a.k.a.
architecture). Problem solving is figuring out how to get the
computer to do what you want it to do. Practicing Leetcode is
practicing problem solving. But Leetcode tends to be a certain
kind of problem solving, that is more focused on math and
algorithms than regular day-to-day problem solving is. You
don't necessarily need to be super good at Leetcode to be a
decent programmer. (Small rant: An algorithm, by the way, is not
just any program, or piece of a program. An algorithm is a
description of how to solve a well-defined problem (like
sorting), that is guaranteed to work every time, in finite time.
""The Youtube algorithm"", for example, is a poor use of the word,
since it does not solve a well-defined problem. If you study
algorithms, you will see that things called algorithms, for
example ""Dijkstra's algorithm"", have these properties.)

System design is about putting a lot of parts together into a
big system without making an unmaintainable mess. It's all about
eliminating complexity. What is complexity? It's when the parts
or aspects of something are intertwined (or complected) such
that they are not independent. Let me give you an example.
Imagine you want to buy 5 eggs. But at the store they only sell
eggs in packs of 12. Now you have a problem, because you need to
buy 7 more than you wanted. This is because the product eggs has
been complected with the amount 12. I hope you see that the
problem here stems from things not being independent. And
unless you can intuit it, let me tell you that complexity always
leads to problems---it is always bad. Let me repeat something I
said earlier, but you might not have thought much about: System
design *is about eliminating complexity, nothing more*. The
SOLID principles, for example, are all special cases of
eliminating complexity. [Here is a brilliant, important talk on simplicity that
you should watch religiously.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4)

While problem solving is essential, system design is almost more
important. Why? Because most hard problems you will run into
have already been solved, like problems with text searching,
graphs, databases, network protocols, etc. If you just know the
terminology you can google your way to solutions to all hard and
reasonably common problems. But you need to be decent at problem
solving, so you can solve most of your own day-to-day problems
yourself. But a lot of people get to a decent level at problem
solving. What sets programmers apart is mostly system design,
and you can't solve system design problems as easily by
googling.

Notice that I have not said anything about memorizing a certain
language or framework. Sure, you need to know at least one
language, but that's not what programming is about. Learning a
framework is easy once you know how to program.

## How to Get Good at Programming

Getting good at programming is mostly about practice (I'll get
to the ""mostly"" part later). This should be obvious, but
apparently it is not, given the amount of posts I see here about
watching tutorials, memorizing languages and frameworks, and
people wanting to be told how to do things. But you can't learn
programming by being told how to do it, in the same way that you
can't learn to play chess well by being told how to do it.
That's why chess engines are AI programs that practice against
themselves or other AI programs; a programmer and a chess grand
master can not sit down and explain how to do it (i.e. program
it).

So as a beginner, what do you do? You learn a language from a
book or proper course (not Youtube). While learning a language
you should solve small problems and experiment yourself. The
book or course hopefully has exercises. When you have done that
you move on to projects. With projects you will practice both
problem solving and system design. If you feel stuck, there are
only two solutions you should consider (if you actually learned
the language); *think harder, or choose an easier project*.
Don't look for someone to tell you how to do it. And don't give
up too easily. You should think about your problems for at least
a few hours before giving up; maybe even days if the problem is
that you can't figure out how to begin with your first project.
Sure, if the problem you can't figure out is just a small part
of a project, you may ask for help, but you should think about
it for at least a few hours yourself first. [Here is a great
take on this from Nathan
Marz.](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/recipe-for-a-great-programmer.html)

Having said all this, it can of course be invaluable to learn
from other people. You should read books, watch conference
talks, try new paradigms, etc. (not Youtube garbage like tutorials or
""Best languages to learn in 2024""). But only a small part of your
time, say maximum 10%, should be spent on this.

I should probably say something more about tutorials. Tutorials
are fine if you are trying to learn a new library, game engine,
or something; when there is a new part of a project you are
doing that you have not done before, and you need to get
started. Written tutorials are often better than Youtube
videos, and often the best ones are just the ""Getting Started""
sections on the official websites. But don't watch tutorials for
the purpose of learning how to do everything in your project.

Finally: Think for yourself. This is general life advice, and
should be applied to programming as well. Don't do something,
for example OOP, or whatever, just because someone else told you
to. If you don't understand the reasons behind something, ignore
it or try to figure out the reasons and evaluate them.

## What Language Should I learn?

It doesn't really matter, because once you know how to program
learning new languages will be much easier. But there are a
couple of traps to look out for. Firstly, learn one thing at a
time. This is mostly a problem in the web development world,
where people feel the need to learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a
couple of frameworks all at once. Don't do this. Stick to one
thing, like JavaScript with just the very basics of HTML.
Learning a bunch of things at the same time will likely just
lead to an illusion of compentence. Secondly,
I think C++ should be avoided, because it is by far the most
complicated, complex and time-consuming language out there. You
may think that you want to learn C++ because a lot of games are
made with it, but I think it's a waste of time. [Here is a game
programmer who actually uses C++ ranting about it (Bjarne
Stroustroup, whom he talks about, is the main designer of
C++).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i4-e1okZtw) And Jonathan
Blow, a successful game programmer who made *Braid* and *The
Witness*, is making a new language because he thought C++ was
bad. Imagine that, C++ drove him to make a new language. [Here
is a short clip of him discussing
it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmBa_2_TjU). At 02:11 in
the video he says ""Let's actually do what we know is better than
this C++ thing. And there is an unending list of things that you
could do better."" Note his facial expression.

One final thing I'll say about languages is: *Don't believe a
language is good just because it is popular*. Almost the opposite
is true. And almost all popular languages are very similar to
each other. That can easily make you think that the kind of
programming that is typical in those languages (C, Java, Python,
etc.) is the only way to program, but that is not true. Try
Lisp, Smalltalk, Erlang, Prolog, etc. at least eventually. [And watch
this very important video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)",jackstawfromwitchita,1hc936v,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc936v/how_to_actually_get_good_at_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc936v/how_to_actually_get_good_at_programming/,2024-12-12 00:54:35,68,0.86,68,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hc936v

learnprogramming,"What exactly does ""experience and knowledge equivalent to a bachelors degree"" look like?","I'm a 19 year old programmer, who started programming in high school, I did about 3 years of computer science classes there, and it felt like decent progress, but the more I learned I naturally found there was more I still needed to learn. My main interest is game development, and I've dabbled around mostly in Godot.  
  
Afterwards, I went to college, tried to suffer through the prereqs, especially math and... The combination of struggling so hard in math even with assistance from tutors, and all of these other random classes I needed to take for general education was so draining. It felt like it sucked the little motivation I already had, and didn't leave any left for me to learn about the things I wanted to learn, like programming. I couldn't take it anymore, so I dropped out after a couple months into my second year.

Most of my time programming since high school has been working on passion projects and game jams, sometimes with a few other people in a team. Admittedly, it feels like I've been less and less productive since high school when it comes to coding and learning. So stating I have 5 years of experience feels like a bit of an overselling.

Right now, I'm at the stage of continuing my main passion project, and looking for jobs, hoping to start a programming related career. It is extremely discouraging, I hear so many people telling me I need to go back to college if I want a chance. I'm told there is no point because AI will take over my career path and at best raise the bar for skill I need for a job. I won't make good money unless I earn a degree. (my interest is not about making a lot of money) College is not an option, I was so unhappy there, I don't want to go back. I know its possible to learn on my own, but I feel directionless.

Looking around at job postings, almost every position, whether its an internship or a job seems to require you to be pursuing a degree or graduating by a certain date. It's beginning to feel hopeless. Usually the best I can find is ""bachelors degree or equivalent experience and understanding"".

How do I know if I have reached this level of understanding? What exactly am I expected to know and be good at? What do I need to do to get to this point? Where can I learn these things effectively? It doesn't help that I already doubt how capable I am, it feels like I start to learn and use a new language, and feel like I forgot everything when I go back to the language I used before. I get stuck on an issue or a bug, and I tell myself ""There's no way I'm ready for a job if I can't even figure this out"".

tldr: what concepts/understanding/capabilities am I expected to know/have when I claim I have an equivalent experience and understanding to someone with bachelors degree? This goes for software and game development, I know they are likely different.

learnprogramming,How do I make algorithms with specific time complexities like O(m^2 logn)?,I'm fine with mindlessly optimizing my algorithms and getting to the best optimized solution I can but when I'm asked to give algorithms with specific algorithms that aren't necessarily the most optimized (ex O(n^2 2^n) I get very stumped and don't know where to start. I feel the constraints are limiting me.

learnprogramming,How Can I Convert Alberta LSD Coordinates to GPS (Latitude/Longitude)?,"Hi everyone,  
Iâ€™m working on a project where I need to convert Alberta LSD (Legal Subdivision) coordinates into GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).

The format for LSD coordinates looks like this:  
`4-5-6-7-W4`  
Where:

* **7** is the LSD number
* **6** is the section number
* **5** is the township
* **4** is the range
* **W4** is the Meridian

Iâ€™m not entirely sure about the best way to do this conversion, especially in Python. Does anyone know of an algorithm or open-source library that can handle this? Or could someone help point me in the right direction?

Iâ€™d really appreciate any help, advice, or resources on how to approach this problem.

learnprogramming,Advice for a novice ,"Hey, guys, 

I've been learning Java for a month and a half now.  I've went through Types and Variables, Conditional Statements,Loops and just heard what Arrays are. To be honest, math was never a strong side of mine, I have not practised math in years. So I am solving problems to get in a bootcamp if I decide, but once I look at some problem if I can not solve it under 2-3 minutes, I just go to the solution, as I do not have an idea how to solve it.  May you advise if the problems are friendly for a novice with just over a month and let's say 1-2 hour 4-5 days a week of writting code or watching videos. As well, any tips on studying such as models for studying etc. 

2 example loop problems:

Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N and prints a matrix like in the examples below. Use two nested loops.

# Input

* The input will always consist of a single line, which contains the number N

Bob and Elly.have very weird taste - their last idea of fun is calculating the ""distance"" that a word is from a given number. The distance is calculated by summing the position in the alphabet of each letter in the word and than finding the absolute difference between that word and another predefined number. You are a programmer so you must ruin their fun by automating the process.

Examples:

* word 'bob', number = 22, distance = 3 ('b' + 'o' + 'b' = 2 + 15 + 2 = 19)
* word 'bob', number = 10, distance = 9

Write a program that calculates the distance for each string and also outputs the average distance.

# Input

* The input consists of several lines.
* **T**Â \- the target number
* **N**Â \- the number of words to follow
* on the nextÂ **N**Â lines - each word on a new line

# Output

* Output consists ofÂ **N + 1**Â lines
* First N lines - word + its distance in formatÂ `word distance`
* Last line - the average distance, rounded to two digits after the decimal point

# Constraints

* Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase english alphabet letters
* 1 &lt;=Â **N**Â &lt;= 20
* 0 &lt;=Â **T**Â &lt;= 1000

This are just examples which I find near impossible to solve as the theory in the course I do not find sufficient. What are your opinions about my situation?

learnprogramming,I want to code a birthday gift for a friend of mine. Looking for fun or meaningful ideas,"My friend is a developer who motivated me to study coding.

I want to either code one big thing or multiple smaller things, and I have 3 months and a week to do so.

My current level? I was learning HTML, CSS, and JS. Took a React course and am currently learning Next.js. I began building a Notion web app clone (which is still in its early stages).

So,I decided to code a birthday gift for him, and I am looking for ideas. In the meantime, an Idea I have is to build an interactive Venn Diagram (we have an inside joke about it because we both like it, and also, his nickname is Ben, so we often make silly jokes like Ben's diagram). 

I want to use this opportunity to learn with the extra motivation of building something for someone I am close to.

I am open to ideas.",Aromatic_File_5256,1hcksoo,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcksoo/i_want_to_code_a_birthday_gift_for_a_friend_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hcksoo/i_want_to_code_a_birthday_gift_for_a_friend_of/,2024-12-12 13:12:19,1,1.0,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hcksoo
learnprogramming,Help to solve this exercise,"**Efficient Container Stacking Algorithm - Practice Problem**

I'm working on a problem related to algorithm design and would appreciate any help or suggestions. Hereâ€™s the scenario:

In a commercial port, goods are transported in containers. When unloading a ship at the terminal, it's crucial to use the smallest possible surface area. To achieve this, the containers need to be stacked optimally.

We have **N containers** (numbered from 1 to N), all with the same dimensions. For each container, we are given:

1. Its **weight**.
2. Its **maximum load capacity** (i.e., the total weight it can support on top of it).

The goal is to stack as many containers as possible in a single pile while respecting these constraints:

1. A container can only be placed directly on top of another.
2. A container cannot be placed on top of another with a **larger serial number**.
3. The total weight of all containers placed on top of a container cannot exceed that containerâ€™s **maximum load capacity**.

# Input Format

* The number of containers, **N** (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 800).
* For each container, two integers: its **weight** (wáµ¢ â‰¤ 5000) and its **maximum load capacity** (cáµ¢ â‰¤ 5000).

# Output Format

* The **maximum number of containers** that can be stacked.
* The **serial numbers** of the containers in ascending order that form the pile.

# Example

**Input:**

    21  
    168 157  
    156 419  
    182 79  
    67 307  
    8 389  
    55 271  
    95 251  
    72 235  
    190 366  
    127 286  
    28 242  
    3 197  
    27 321  
    31 160  
    199 87  
    102 335  
    12 209  
    122 118  
    58 308  
    5 43  
    3 84  
    

**Output:**

    Number of containers: 13  
    Container 2  
    Container 4  
    Container 5  
    Container 6  
    Container 8  
    Container 11  
    Container 12  
    Container 13

    Container 17  
    Container 19  
    Container 20
