gaming,A Fjord I made in Minecraft,"This Inlet is part of major fjord I have been developing in my Minecraft world called Sky Pixel. The fjord itself is called the ""Lullaby Fjord"" it is surrounded by large tidewater glaciers I have been making for quite some time now. 

This world is also already released on my Patreon (Sky Pixel) for users to experience and download.

Much of my builds can also be seen on my YT channel @elijahjones as well. 

This build is a small section of my world that I have been developing since 2014. Which includes many cities and landscapes. 

This glacier itself is called the ""Porter Glacier"" it's part of a series of glaciers that run near it such as the ""Harlette, Kusuah, Ellie, Jacie, Rezjvik, Lunaska, and Sathomko glaciers"" amongst others. 

This area I have been developing in my world is inspired by the Pacific Northwest landscapes. I've been doing a ton of developing similar to these landscapes because I was born and raised in the PNW. This area in particular is mostly focused on areas of British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska. I have already developed much of areas within the Cascades and Coast Mountains already. Just making my way up the line. And almost done with this region in my world.

I’ve been leading Metro’s video games coverage for over a decade now and can discuss every element of the games industry as long as it doesn’t involve sports or driving a car in a straight line.  
  
GameCentral has been contributing to The Game Awards for several years now and, unlike almost everything else about the games industry, it doesn’t tend to have that many leaks about its reveals. There are some [official confirmations already though, and a lot of unsubstantiated rumours, so it’s going to be fun to speculate on](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/11/game-awards-2024-predictions-gta-6-split-fiction-rumours-22170224/) what could be the most important night of the year for gaming...  
  
I can’t tell you who we voted for at The Game Awards, and it would be undiplomatic for me to talk about who might win, but if you want to Ask Me Anything else about the event - [in particular what I hope and expect in terms of new trailers and announcements](https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/12/half-life-3-rumoured-one-game-awards-2024-megaton-announcements-22173667/) \- you can tune into our AMA on Thursday 12th December at 5 pm GMT.

gaming,Are we ever going to get a sense of normalcy back for the AAA gaming space?,"Just saw a post that explains how Activision has a patent in place for a system that maximizes exposure of players with bought skins towards non-paid skinned players. Just reminds me of how desperately greedy every AAA company as seem to turn into. It's as if 
 
-The push for live service for every single company in the industry. 

-Ubisoft's yearly pumping out of same formulaic copies for every IP they have, becoming worse and worse every time till they get to the point where the entire company is looking to sell

-Xbox's constant fumbling of so many first party studios that they've bought out and subsequently shutdown, that's if they were able to finish their projects and release their flops of games. 

-Sony's obsession for high 
profile/cinematic/high fidelity games to get block buster sales numbers. Apparent push for live service games when single player games were what made them get the lead in the I dustry in the first place. Why does it seem

-Rockstar's refusal to develop any games outside GTA and RDR to utilize their extremely monitored online modes for years/decade to come

-EA's total flop of battlefield/battlefront do to short sighted decisions of the company, and there entire scorched earth approach towards shutting down so many studios

-So many god damn broken releases with studios having to deal with outside forces that always end up prioritizing money so far from the actual quality of the product. Even outside of that, we have constant stories of infighting in long standing studios that one way or another have an inherent lack of direction and leadership to get a working product out. This makes the lack of quality in a lot of games an issue involving terrible leadership in developer studios as much as outside interference from share holders.

Can make the list twice as long but you get the picture. It's crazy just how fucked the industry is, especially with how many studios have shut down during and after COVID, and I honestly don't believe the aftermath of COVID has had the most affect in this regard. These companies have been going down this route throughout the late 2010's and took it to overdrive this generation. I mean just look how far Sony has fallen from before, it's good damn mind blowing how much they are fumbling this generation, it's as if anyone in the company with any sense of the industry were lobotomized. 

With the pending recession thats bound to happen soon, along with the aftermath of so many studios shutting down in the past 5 years, I feel like decades of progression and development of the industry itself from now to at least the 90's is going to be totally lost. There are a handful of high profile leaders in the thick of it that are rumored to be developing new studios as we speak, but the economy is turning to shit and these kinds of studios need proper funding to get through and I just don't think many publishers are going to have reasonable demands anytime soon.

I can't help but to feel we aren't going to back to a sense of normalcy in the AAA space. We got some AA studios that have show up, plenty of indie's, but I for one miss the kind of quality, tightly and fully developed games we used to have back in the ps2-ps3/xbox-xbox360 and some of the PS4 eras (where the momentum for monitizaion really picked up). I personally don't believe the amount of indie's, majority of them on early access most of its life on the market, makes up for the lack of experiences we used to have before hand in the gaming space. And I don't believe that's speaking with rose-tinted glasses, as much as reddit likes to preach otherwise.",NamedFruit,1hc87kj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,2024-12-12 00:11:19,0,0.26,0,0,47,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hc87kj
