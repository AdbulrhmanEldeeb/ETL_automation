webdev,Form over function to make it feel less “technical” for average user,"Those are frames from continuous loop where each square rotates its hue from 0° to 360° each have different (negative) delay. 

I was trying to make the TOTP QR code reading screen in the registration flow feel less “technical” to average users. Then this came to my mind. 

Sadly this doesn’t work with every reader at its current iteration, and I wanted to get some responses before going into technicals with grayscale conversion. 

Is there some other technic you use to solve the problem? I don’t think current trends are friendly to users.

webdev,How I got out of tutorial hell,"Don't get me wrong, tutorials are important when you are first starting your web development journey. They should not be where/how you build the majority of your projects from.

This took me a long time to realize, I thought hiring managers and recruiters would find these projects interesting enough to give me a shot... I was very wrong.

This realization is what got me out of tutorial hell, I realized that re-building an already made product that showcased no effective problem-solving skills of my own was going to get me no where.

As someone who was in tutorial hell myself for a long time, I know how hard it is to think of what to build; it seems like everything that has a chance of being successful is already built.

What I found best to building a successful project was fulfilling these requirements:

1. I needed to be passionate enough to finish the project
2. It needed to serve a particular unpopular niche to have the best chance with establishing presence for SEO to eventually have organic growth.

What I landed on was a platform, similar to dribbble, where developers could easily find images from developers portfolios for inspiration.

This was:

✅ Something I was passionate about

✅ Serving a purpose within a particular untouched niche

Unfortunately, at the end I was left with a project with no users (of course) like a lot of projects we make. So I decided to take a leap and do what is known as ""building in public"".

I made an X account, started to find users apart of the niche and directly messaged them about my project. This did not work at first as everyone's always a little skeptical being the first user on a new website.

As I continued to publicly market my product on X, I decided to find ways to market my product directly to users email inboxes.

Where I struck gold was finding this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios)

This single repository got me my first 20+ users that helped establish the foundation of my site.

The repository is filled with developers who uploaded their portfolio link, along with their name, to be publicly showcased. This was my niche served to me with no fluff.

The approach I took was sincere when emailing users from this repository, clearly stating how I came across their email address, and portfolio site and why I thought they would be interested in my site.

Within the email, I also included positive feedback I had from their site as I did have to browse it to find their email address.

From this, I was then able to continue ""building in public"" with a decent enough level of success by eventually getting 80+ users and about 20k monthly visitors for my first month after launching my project.",yeahimjtt,1hc2fv1,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc2fv1/how_i_got_out_of_tutorial_hell/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc2fv1/how_i_got_out_of_tutorial_hell/,2024-12-11 19:57:35,47,0.77,47,0,31,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hc2fv1
webdev,Need some help with website generators frameworks. ,"I have a pretty big project that is used to create websites based on existing templates  
It consumes config, uses html/js/css templates and creates a static multi-page site

But now I've run into a problem: I need more flexibility. The logic has gotten complex and threatens to get even more complex, and what I have is very tightly extended

Are there any modern solutions for website generators that use the same scheme as I do (config + templates = a set of html, css and js)? I've heard something about React Templates, but I'm not sure about this thing

webdev,"Built an actual working AI meeting copilot - and I am building it in open source, and making it self hostable","I got tired of relying on clunky SaaS tools for meeting transcriptions that didn’t respect my privacy or workflow. Every one I tried had issues:

* Bots awkwardly joining meetings and announcing themselves.
* Poor transcription quality.
* No flexibility to tweak things to fit *my* setup.

So I built **Amurex**, a self-hosted solution that actually works:

* Records meetings quietly, with no bots interrupting. 
* Delivers clean, accurate diarised transcripts right after the meeting.
* Automatically drafts follow-up that I can email.
* Keeps a memory of past meetings for easy context retrieval.

But most importantly, it has it is the only chrome extension in the world that can give

* Real-time suggestions to stay engaged in boring meetings.

It’s completely open source and designed for self-hosting, so you control your data and your workflow. No subscriptions, no vendor lock-in.I would love to know what you all think of it.  
  
 It only works on Google Meet for now but I will be scaling it to all the famous meeting providers.
