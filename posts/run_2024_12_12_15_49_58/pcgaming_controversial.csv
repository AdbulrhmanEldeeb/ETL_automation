pcgaming,Anti-aliasing: Why did it become so bad recently?,"In older games (up until 2013-2015), Using 2/4x MSAA was enough to make edges buttery smooth while keeping picture sharp and readable.

Now, even though games look visually more impressive, detailed, and just more beautiful, you have to choose between two evils - use CMAA/FXAA/TAA and make your game blurry and hazy, or use MSAA/no AA and the entire picutre is just jugged edges, no matter how high you crank the MSAA (in forza 4, for example, even 8xMSAA didn't help - you had to use FXAA to have anything acceptable on the screen).

What is the deal now, and what is the point of having beautiful games ""on paper"", while in reality you either see all blur or all edges?",smilinmaniag,1hcgaef,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hcgaef/antialiasing_why_did_it_become_so_bad_recently/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hcgaef/antialiasing_why_did_it_become_so_bad_recently/,2024-12-12 08:00:05,0,0.42,0,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcgaef

pcgaming,Beware ordering items from Max Gaming (international reseller),"Hi all,

Like many, I was intrigued by the appearance of new lightweight high performance mice that have cropped up recently.

I was building a new PC, so ordered a Santali S1-O from [Maxgaming.com](https://us.maxgaming.com/)

Despite having a US prefix on their website URL, they are in fact based in Sweden, and will ship any orders internationally.

So far, everything seems fine, right? The internet is international, and borders are such a 20th century conceit.

However, the problem arose when things did not work according to plan.

According to the carrier (DHL Express), the package was delivered to my mailbox on Monday.

However, my mailbox was empty when I checked it, and neither my condo office nor the package locker had any packages in my name.

When I contacted Maxgaming, their response was that since the package was shipped internationally, and the carrier reported it as 'Delivered', there was nothing for them to do.

No refund, no resend, not even an attempt to contact the carrier to confirm receipt of delivery.

I was just supposed to eat up the item and delivery charge and have nothing to show for it, like a chump (my words, not theirs).

It's not egregious to describe this situation as 'Extremely Unprofessional'. A legitimate business should have the means to ensure safe delivery of purchased items to the consumer, and to resolve disputes with the carrier if things go south on delivery. ""Tough luck, you're SOL"" is not an acceptable means of doing business, especially in the long term. 

Consumer Protection Laws in the US protect me from being charged for items I have paid for but did not receive.

I have filed a dispute claim with Paypal and with my bank, and hopefully they will b able to resolve matters on my behalf.

But in the meantime, a cautionary tale to people who may be tempted by the low prices and deals at maxgaming. You get what you pay for, and sometimes, you don't.
