devops,How do you knew you wanted to be a DevOps? And is still true?,"What did make you feel confident of pursuing this path and how is this actually true for you right now?

edit1 = Thank so much for so many answers! I think is fair to explain why I asked this, because I can't answer this question by myself. I have been going through different positions in the dev side of things, learning android development, later learning just pure algorithms, later shifting to python and such, working with databases and poking some AI. At the end, I found myself not enjoying most of it. So I started reading what devops role is and found out that it could be what I actually want, or at least, a starting point, because I do like to know the whole lifecicle of something, I do like managing resources and strategic thinking, and I enjoy giving solutions to problems with scripts and automatizations... and I do like programming, understanding how things works and learning... So thanks so much for your comments because I can learn more about this.

devops,RHEL SSL Certificate renewal automation with Windows NDES Server,"Hi all,

First of all, I'd like to precise I'm a junior devops engineer so please do correct me if anything looks wrong

I'm working on a solution to automate certificate renewal with Certmonger and a NDES Server

The NDES Server is installed and running but I'm struggling to find a design to automate the client part.

Looking at the RHEL doc I found Certmonger which seems perfect to monitor and auto-renew a certificate with SCEP protocol (also used by NDES server)

My issue here is that there seems only 2 ways to authorize a certificate renewal:

1. NDES server provide a OTP (One time password) that you put in the CSR file
2. (I'm not really sure about it) you provide the SHA-1 thumbprint of the certificate to be renewed also in the CSR file

EDIT: ~~Certmonger doesn't seem to support neither of these solutions (correct me if I'm wrong, I'll be glad to hear it)~~ Certmonger does support the OTP process but how to fully automate this ? On the other side I didn't find a solution to automate the SHA-1 thumbprint process

I've been looking here and there for a few days for a solution but I knew from the start that Linux machines talking to Windows machines wouldn't be an easy challenge

Another solution would be to make Ansible do all the tasks, from monitoring to renewing the certificates (proposed by my manager)

devops,The infrastructure guy quit,"We are a small DevOps team in a very fast-paced mid-size startup. We run and maintain several on-site bare metal Kubernetes clusters, but we fully depend on our infrastructure ""team"" to set up the physical servers, build the racks and set up and manage the entire network.

But the team is just one guy who takes care of everything. Literally no one else at the company truly knows how it's all set up. Attempts to start some knowledge transfer have never gotten too far. This situation has persisted for a long time and his direct manager has not hired a second person for the team. Well, now the totally unexpected and unforseeable thing has happened (edit: /s) and the guy put in his notice (2 months - we're in Europe).

Since then they have managed to find a new person for the position, but I still expect that management will try to push some of his agenda onto us. However, none of us have the required advanced networking and sysadmin knowledge that's required. We are a very small team and are already overloaded to the point that simple features take months to deliver due to high operational pressure, us being constantly interrupted by requests from other teams and other high priority work. I know that there are IaC tools for hardware and network administration, but we just don't have the capacity to take on and be fully responsible for setting up all this hardware and be responsible for its reliable operation. The transition period for the new guy will be very short and I'm afraid that the entire infrastructure will be at risk of falling apart.

We are now wondering, if there is any way to connect both GitLab and ArgoCD even more....

devops,Self service ngrok based on Kubernetes,"Hey DevOps folks,

I wanted to share a small utility I built on top of [ktunnel](https://github.com/omrikiei/ktunnel). It leverages the Gateway API‚Äôs separation-of-concerns architecture to allow developers to provision ""dynamic"" endpoints. These endpoints can be tunneled to specific ports on their local machines, making it easy to create public endpoints for development environments.

I originally created this while working on a GitHub webhook, and it evolved into a self-service tool inspired by the challenges I often encounter at work.

The project isn‚Äôt overly complex and can also serve as a tutorial on setting up a Kubernetes gateway. Additionally, it‚Äôs a good starting point for learning how to use the [go-client](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) to programmatically interact with Kubernetes.

devops,Seeking Advice on Securing ServiceNow APIs with Apigee Without Significant Rework,"I'm looking for advice on how to secure ServiceNow APIs without requiring significant rework on our third-party applications.

Context:

I work in an organization with over 50 external third-party tools connected to ServiceNow.

Many of these tools are legacy systems using the Table API.

Our security team has raised concerns about the risks associated with this and has asked us to move to more secure integration methods, avoiding any new integrations with the Table API in ServiceNow.

Current Situation:

The security team has selected Apigee from Google to help with this transition.

They are configuring Apigee to connect to secure endpoints on ServiceNow. However, the API calls are not in the Table API format, meaning each third-party application requires significant rework, ongoing maintenance, and extensive testing. This approach seems impractical and costly.

Questions:

If the goal of using an API gateway like Apigee is to enhance the API security of ServiceNow, is there a way to achieve this transparently, without requiring extensive rework on the third-party applications?

What is the best and easiest approach to enhance security without expecting each third-party application owner to do significant rework?

Are we potentially over-complicating the solution by applying two different security concepts that might affect the platform's usability?

Additional Information:

I've noted that companies like Akamai, Imperva, Salt Security, and Obsidian Security specialize in this area. Maybe Apigee is not the right tool for this, or perhaps it's being implemented incorrectly. Currently, endpoints are being changed from /api/dosomething to /api/dosomething_companyname, and I'm unsure why transparent API security controls can't be implemented.

So far I really love it. Made it so anything merged on the dev branch would be built, sent off to App Store Connect and the build would be distributed to all external testers with the release notes being the contents of a [CHANGELOG.md](http://CHANGELOG.md) file.

  
I came to realise the hard way that my GitHub actions free minutes have diminished due to the upload\_to\_testflight action in Fastlane waits for Apple to process the build (which is required to distribute to external testers). The processing time can vary from 2 mins to probs hours depending on if the build needs to be reviewed again.

Which brings me to my question, has anyone made a workaround to this? I know you can tell the upload\_to\_testflight action to not wait for processing which will cut my action's time down by a lot but then I won't be able to automate the distribution of the app to external testers which sends this entire pipeline back to the same level as what I was at when using Xcode cloud.

I'm looking to create  industry-level DevOps project which can help me to land a job in Devops or Cloud industry .

I have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, AWS, Git, Prometheus, and Grafana, and I want to combine these tools into a practical, resume-worthy project.

I‚Äôm aiming for a project that:

Highlights best practices in CI/CD pipelines.

Includes monitoring and logging with Prometheus and Grafana.

Leverages Kubernetes.

Uses AWS for infrastructure (e.g., ECS, EKS, or S3).


If you‚Äôve worked on or know of any projects like this, I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions! Bonus points if it reflects real-world use cases or solves a specific problem.


Thanks in advance!

devops,"VPS, self hosted runner, docker compose with traefik for a small microservices application ","I am running a small scale web app very few users and few other related microservices services on a vps (cheap server). I am running a github self hosted runner on the server, which runs docker compose on the server using github actions. Using traefik to expose the API for a s3 hosted web app. 

I am a dev, so I would like to understand what risks are involved in the above setup in terms of security and other aspects. Got DDOSed recently which made everything unusable until I restarted the vps and restored a db backup.
