books,Gabriel's Moon by William Boyd: The ideal thriller novel to give as a Christmas gift.,"I recently got this book through NetGalley, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on it. It's a great thriller with a strong focus on espionage, keeping the genre's mysterious and suspenseful elements alive.

The story follows Gabriel, a 30-year-old writer with a troubled past. He was orphaned at the age of six after his mother, who was an alcoholic, died in a fire. Fast forward a few years, and Gabriel's life takes an unexpected turn as he becomes involved in the world of espionage.

I thought it was great to see so many strong female characters in Gabriel's life. They're not just background characters; they influence his decisions, challenge him, and guide his journey in meaningful ways. There's also a subplot about his family history that's woven really well into the narrative, which gives readers a deeper understanding of his struggles and motivations.

What really stood out to me was the author’s ability to create characters that feel so real and relatable. It’s easy to connect with them and become invested in their stories. Combine that with a plot full of twists and turns, and you have a novel that’s impossible to put down. The way the story builds tension and unravels its secrets kept me hooked until the very end.

This is easily one of the best thrillers I’ve read this year, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone who loves mystery or espionage. It’s also a great Christmas gift idea for thriller fans who enjoy gripping stories with complex characters!",inabookhole,1hcnfid,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hcnfid/gabriels_moon_by_william_boyd_the_ideal_thriller/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hcnfid/gabriels_moon_by_william_boyd_the_ideal_thriller/,2024-12-12 15:23:14,3,1.0,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcnfid

books,The fear of running out of something to read is called Abibliophobia.,"Have you ever felt a sudden sense of panic at the thought of finishing your last unread book and having nothing left to dive into? If so, you might be experiencing something called *Abibliophobia*—the fear of running out of things to read.  
  
Is that even possible? I only know people who have a huge pile of books to read and who long for more time to read! I think it may also be due to the overwhelming amount of books being published, so it's not a fear of not having anything to read, but of not being able to choose, or of not having anything that feeds the mood.

books,[Swiss Family Robinson] Rereading this book as a modern reader was WILD ,"*Disclaimer: I've not read too many ""classics"" for most of my life, the only other exception aside from this book is Dracula, most of the time I read nonfiction. Please pardon if I'm not too familiar with the ""genre conventions"".* 



Back when I was about 10 or 12 years old, I had a copy of Swiss Family Robinson that eventually got ruined by me spilling a glass of milk on it. I have always been fascinated by survival stories of various kinds and had a fascination with zoology, so young me (as much as I could recollect) absolutely loved the book. Anyways, three weeks ago I decided to purchase a copy to see if it has held up after all these years. 

**Oh boy.** 

For the most part, despite being influenced by Robinson Crusoe with its castaway and survival setting, it really stood out to me the sheer lack of \*strife\* the family experienced. Aside from the initial event of the shipwreck and having to survive on an exotic tropical landscape, the family for the most part lives very comfortable lives as the island itself seems to spawn whatever kind of flora and fauna that would help them live comfortable lives. In the edition that I read, there are kangaroos, buffaloes, hippopotamus and a whole bunch more on a single island. 

What was even more darkly hilarious is that the characters never once lampshade on how weird this was, rather opting to shoot and consume any animals they come across (understandable given the context but lmao). A constant barrage of ""see new animal, shoot animal because we own this island now and we can do it"". 

The family themselves were ""interesting"". I'm gonna be honest, the dad was what I could only described as the ""platonic ideal"" of what a M A N should be. Not only he was so religiously devoted that he could quote the Bible rivaling that of a senior clergyman, but knows about every plants and animals, their uses and can build practically anything. The children were well, just there, mostly to make things happen by running around doing shenanigans. The mother meanwhile was barely a character, mostly there to smooth out whichever things that stumps the father. Overall though, there was a distinct lack of character arcs for any of them, no new revelations about each other, no one gets changed by anything that happened. They got stuck on that island for years, and left it none the worse for wear.

Ultimately, I'd say that the online reviews I read before reading the book really was correct, it TRULY FELT like a product of its time. The specifics are too much for a post, but the overall constant occurrence of overt religious theming of the family's mass exploitation of nature because god gave them dominion of it and the whole ""ideal parental figures"" as I've mentioned above. For me, it encapsulates quite a fair bit of the common worldview at the time it is written, but there were points where it felt like quasi-absurdist humor at times. In conclusion for those that wants to read/reread it, it was a fun read but be prepared for some occasional ""weirdness"". 

Tl;dr: People weren't kidding about it being ""a product of its time"" ",BattleMedic1918,1hbwgh0,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbwgh0/swiss_family_robinson_rereading_this_book_as_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbwgh0/swiss_family_robinson_rereading_this_book_as_a/,2024-12-11 15:49:15,292,0.89,292,0,100,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbwgh0
books,1980s Dad Lit,"If you were a dad in the 1980s, you could expect two things for Christmas: a bottle of Old Spice and whatever the latest Michener was. Or Ken Follett. Or Robert Ludlum. In the '90s, it was likely Crichton or Grisham (John, not his brother Kevin, who wrote *The Rural Juror* and *Urban Fervor*).

Are there ""Dad"" books any more? My sense is that:

(a) in general, the population isn't reading as much; 

(b) men (outside of this sub) are reading even less than the general public; and

(c) television has taken the place of reading.

If you have a dad whom you could ask: what is he reading? What are *any* dads reading? Do they have an author from whom they buy the latest book when it's published?
