learnprogramming,girls who code : highschool,"Basically im a highschool junior,, and i want to start a GWC club at our school.

However, clubs arent really a thing at our school, we dont have any, really. So its going to be kind of tough.

Is it worth it? Like is it something I can add to my university applications, ''i started and participated in a GWC club at my school'', etc?. Is it impressive, slightly?

Thanks!

learnprogramming,"So my cs final is today, a rant","Basically, I passed the first midterm with a C and miserably failed the 2nd. This means i need to pass this final to pass the class. I have been severely lacking motivation for the past two semesters, and with the way my college is, everything is practically self taught.

CS1 was taught in python. We learnt the basics of it, learned recursion (which is still a confusing topic for me), and thatâ€™s about the extent of it. This was around 3.5 months. Now CS2, which is the class I am now retaking after last semester practically humbled me. CS2 is taught in java, not python. They do this to teach object oriented programming, though in this case they should just teach in java from the beginning but ohhh dear. CS2 is also heavily focused on data structures. I consider it a data structure course.

This final is on generics, which hmm ok I guess, binary search trees, not worried about that. Tries. Very worried about that. Heaps/priority queues. I watched Abdulâ€™s lecture on youtube, I understand them so well I could reteach it, canâ€™t apply it in code. Hash tables. Quite worried about that, but maybe I can figure it out. Self balancing binary trees, specifically red/black. Lord help me I donâ€™t understand them

I have studied 2 days straight, using leetcode after learning something to try and apply it considering time is limited. Itâ€™s worked to an extent, leetcode isnâ€™t necessarily beginner. Today, the final is at 4. That gives me another few hours to try to wrap my head around everything I still lack understanding in so that I can at the very least write my responses in pseudocode. If youâ€™re wondering how I figure out homeworkâ€¦ I donâ€™t. There was a time I would. I really do enjoy coding, donâ€™t get me wrong. If I understand it, itâ€™s very fun. I have not been understanding. 

Where do you guys find the motivation to self teach? I have to take a philosophy and history and literature class alongside this and I just struggle so badly. Anyway, wish me luck. To youtube I go.

learnprogramming,Building an analog CPU,"Was watching Black Panther and saw their weird computer system. Thought it would be kind of cool to build an analog CPU.

I'm thinking an abacus with 20 rods, and 20 beads on each rod, each rod has 40 notches which the beads slide into. Each notch is horizontally color coded to allow changing number base (or we could just color the beads).

This allows the user to work with numbers up to base 21. Allows plenty of space for variables within memory. And can store encoded messages. Up to base 21, with multiple lines.

You can also do all the basic stuff of an abacus: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

What other uses could this offer, and is there a way to incorporate quantum computing?

learnprogramming,Which route makes more sense for OO?,"# Preface

Overseer object that oversees production of *blank*. Builder object that builds a component. From my novice experience with OO and google, I think that what `Overseer` should do is tell each builder to build their component `Builder.build()` and `Overseer` doesn't care how it gets done. `Overseer` will then likely put the components together, or something else... But my issue is that *some* `Builder` objects need specifications whilst others don't.

Thinking of SOLID, and Interface Segregation amongst other things, doesn't that mean that only objects that require information have the implementation to do so? Maybe I could do this with interfaces alone, but my problem is thus: should `Builder` objects make calls to `Overseer` after being told to `.build()`?

# Example 1

* Overseer: Build this component.  `Builder.build()`
* Builder: Okay. What colour is it?
* `Overseer.order.get_colour()`
* Overseer: Blue.
* Builder: Okay. What material is it? `Overseer.order.get_material()`
* Overseer: Stone.
* Builder: Done.  `return component`

This is probably worded horribly, but I hope my point comes across.

# Example 2

* Overseer: Build this component. It needs to be blue and to be made of stone. `Builder.build(order.get_colour(), order.get_material())`
* Builder: Okay, but I don't care what colour it is.
* Builder: Done.

Which example makes more sense? I don't get OO (started in C, then Python and I'm aware that Python is not a OO language) and don't know if I'm thinking in the right way.

To me, example 1 makes sense because then `Overseer` does not care how stuff gets done, but in example 2 it would *have* to care because it would have to keep track of which `Builder` object uses what information... right?",Warmspirit,1hbvwz0,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hbvwz0/which_route_makes_more_sense_for_oo/,2024-12-11 15:25:22,0,0.5,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbvwz0

learnprogramming,"Syntax Help - I need a ""where column &gt; 1"" somewhere and I'm not sure where","Ok, so it looked like it was ok to as this based on the FAQ and the rules.

I have a school assignment I'm working on. This is a database concept class so we are just starting in SQL. Our test database is a tutor center, I have 3 tables: tutor, which lists the tutors details, course, which lists the course details, and tutorcourse, a joining table containing the primary key of both the tutor and course tables. The tutorcourse table is the list of all courses assigned to each tutor.

What I need to do create a query that displays the total number of courses assigned to each tutor, then I need to only display the tutors with more than 1 course assigned. So far, I've gotten to the point where I can list the number of courses for each tutor, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to fit in a WHERE clause to narrow that output list down to only tutors with more than 1 class.

Here is the current query I'm working off of:

`select tutor.tutorkey, tutor.tutorfname, tutor.tutorlname, count(tutorcourse.coursekey)`  
`from tutorcourse`  
`inner join tutor on tutorcourse.tutorkey = tutor.tutorkey`  
`group by tutorcourse.tutorkey;`

I have tried putting a where clause in multiple places and it either gives me the wrong output by counting ALL the classes total, or I get an error that my syntax is wrong, or I get an error that my group by statement is invalid.

Any guidance? I'm using MySQL for this. Mostly, I want to know if I need to totally reformat the query or use a subquery instead of a join or even just knowing if I'm anywhere even close to the right idea would be great. I don't particularly want a direct answer since part of my fun with programming is this problem solving bit... my brain is just at a roadblock right now.

Thanks! Please feel free to take this down if I misunderstood the rules.

Edit: winner winner chicken dinner. I forgot and also misunderstood the purpose of the Having clause. This version of the query got me the correct output: 

  
`select tutor.tutorkey, tutor.tutorfname, tutor.tutorlname, count(tutorcourse.coursekey)`  
`from tutorcourse`  
`inner join tutor on tutorcourse.tutorkey = tutor.tutorkey`  
`group by tutorcourse.tutorkey`  
`having count(tutorcourse.coursekey) &gt; 1;`

learnprogramming,Help to solve this exercise,"**Efficient Container Stacking Algorithm - Practice Problem**

I'm working on a problem related to algorithm design and would appreciate any help or suggestions. Hereâ€™s the scenario:

In a commercial port, goods are transported in containers. When unloading a ship at the terminal, it's crucial to use the smallest possible surface area. To achieve this, the containers need to be stacked optimally.

We have **N containers** (numbered from 1 to N), all with the same dimensions. For each container, we are given:

1. Its **weight**.
2. Its **maximum load capacity** (i.e., the total weight it can support on top of it).

The goal is to stack as many containers as possible in a single pile while respecting these constraints:

1. A container can only be placed directly on top of another.
2. A container cannot be placed on top of another with a **larger serial number**.
3. The total weight of all containers placed on top of a container cannot exceed that containerâ€™s **maximum load capacity**.

# Input Format

* The number of containers, **N** (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 800).
* For each container, two integers: its **weight** (wáµ¢ â‰¤ 5000) and its **maximum load capacity** (cáµ¢ â‰¤ 5000).

# Output Format

* The **maximum number of containers** that can be stacked.
* The **serial numbers** of the containers in ascending order that form the pile.

# Example

**Input:**

learnprogramming,"What exactly does ""experience and knowledge equivalent to a bachelors degree"" look like?","I'm a 19 year old programmer, who started programming in high school, I did about 3 years of computer science classes there, and it felt like decent progress, but the more I learned I naturally found there was more I still needed to learn. My main interest is game development, and I've dabbled around mostly in Godot.  
  
Afterwards, I went to college, tried to suffer through the prereqs, especially math and... The combination of struggling so hard in math even with assistance from tutors, and all of these other random classes I needed to take for general education was so draining. It felt like it sucked the little motivation I already had, and didn't leave any left for me to learn about the things I wanted to learn, like programming. I couldn't take it anymore, so I dropped out after a couple months into my second year.

Most of my time programming since high school has been working on passion projects and game jams, sometimes with a few other people in a team. Admittedly, it feels like I've been less and less productive since high school when it comes to coding and learning. So stating I have 5 years of experience feels like a bit of an overselling.

Right now, I'm at the stage of continuing my main passion project, and looking for jobs, hoping to start a programming related career. It is extremely discouraging, I hear so many people telling me I need to go back to college if I want a chance. I'm told there is no point because AI will take over my career path and at best raise the bar for skill I need for a job. I won't make good money unless I earn a degree. (my interest is not about making a lot of money) College is not an option, I was so unhappy there, I don't want to go back. I know its possible to learn on my own, but I feel directionless.

Looking around at job postings, almost every position, whether its an internship or a job seems to require you to be pursuing a degree or graduating by a certain date. It's beginning to feel hopeless. Usually the best I can find is ""bachelors degree or equivalent experience and understanding"".

How do I know if I have reached this level of understanding? What exactly am I expected to know and be good at? What do I need to do to get to this point? Where can I learn these things effectively? It doesn't help that I already doubt how capable I am, it feels like I start to learn and use a new language, and feel like I forgot everything when I go back to the language I used before. I get stuck on an issue or a bug, and I tell myself ""There's no way I'm ready for a job if I can't even figure this out"".

tldr: what concepts/understanding/capabilities am I expected to know/have when I claim I have an equivalent experience and understanding to someone with bachelors degree? This goes for software and game development, I know they are likely different.

learnprogramming,"Learning VBA - How do i deal with regional settings? Everything i try breaks as soon as someone has a different date format or uses ; instead of , as delimiters...","I am at my wits end - for some reason i can't find out how to set a format for the 'backend' of my VBA code to disconnect it from the end-user's settings.  
  
I am a beginner but have managed to spend my spare time over the last two years making a 'daily data entry form' in excel via VBA which has integrated validation.   
  
I keep running into the problem where myself and a few others are using a QWERTY layout and dd/mm/yyyy settings but the others are using French AZERTY and mm/dd/yyyy (or some other random and entirely unhelpful regional setting because they thought it'd be cool to try)  versions of excel which use different delimiters/date formats.

I have specified everywhere which deals with dates the date formats e.g:  
Format(CDate(csvValue), ""dd/mm/yyyy"")

I have replaced form entry values which might include commas or semicolons (french systems/excel uses ';' instead of ',' in the formulas and it doesn't always translate nicely between language types) to a dash because comment fields with commas break the (backup) CSV exports, I have to use CSVs or an easily useable format unfortunately but happy to hear any other suggestions.  




Additionally... I realised far too late that if i need to have multiple people editing the same file using VBA form entries then i'd run into major sync issues... I have also only just started learning python which would be able to cope with this a lot more i think?

learnprogramming,How to actually get good at programming,"## What Programming is About

In my view, programming has two main components: problem
solving (including debugging) and system design (a.k.a.
architecture). Problem solving is figuring out how to get the
computer to do what you want it to do. Practicing Leetcode is
practicing problem solving. But Leetcode tends to be a certain
kind of problem solving, that is more focused on math and
algorithms than regular day-to-day problem solving is. You
don't necessarily need to be super good at Leetcode to be a
decent programmer. (Small rant: An algorithm, by the way, is not
just any program, or piece of a program. An algorithm is a
description of how to solve a well-defined problem (like
sorting), that is guaranteed to work every time, in finite time.
""The Youtube algorithm"", for example, is a poor use of the word,
since it does not solve a well-defined problem. If you study
algorithms, you will see that things called algorithms, for
example ""Dijkstra's algorithm"", have these properties.)

System design is about putting a lot of parts together into a
big system without making an unmaintainable mess. It's all about
eliminating complexity. What is complexity? It's when the parts
or aspects of something are intertwined (or complected) such
that they are not independent. Let me give you an example.
Imagine you want to buy 5 eggs. But at the store they only sell
eggs in packs of 12. Now you have a problem, because you need to
buy 7 more than you wanted. This is because the product eggs has
been complected with the amount 12. I hope you see that the
problem here stems from things not being independent. And
unless you can intuit it, let me tell you that complexity always
leads to problems---it is always bad. Let me repeat something I
said earlier, but you might not have thought much about: System
design *is about eliminating complexity, nothing more*. The
SOLID principles, for example, are all special cases of
eliminating complexity. [Here is a brilliant, important talk on simplicity that
you should watch religiously.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4)

While problem solving is essential, system design is almost more
important. Why? Because most hard problems you will run into
have already been solved, like problems with text searching,
graphs, databases, network protocols, etc. If you just know the
terminology you can google your way to solutions to all hard and
reasonably common problems. But you need to be decent at problem
solving, so you can solve most of your own day-to-day problems
yourself. But a lot of people get to a decent level at problem
solving. What sets programmers apart is mostly system design,
and you can't solve system design problems as easily by
googling.

Notice that I have not said anything about memorizing a certain
language or framework. Sure, you need to know at least one
language, but that's not what programming is about. Learning a
framework is easy once you know how to program.

## How to Get Good at Programming

Getting good at programming is mostly about practice (I'll get
to the ""mostly"" part later). This should be obvious, but
apparently it is not, given the amount of posts I see here about
watching tutorials, memorizing languages and frameworks, and
people wanting to be told how to do things. But you can't learn
programming by being told how to do it, in the same way that you
can't learn to play chess well by being told how to do it.
That's why chess engines are AI programs that practice against
themselves or other AI programs; a programmer and a chess grand
master can not sit down and explain how to do it (i.e. program
it).

So as a beginner, what do you do? You learn a language from a
book or proper course (not Youtube). While learning a language
you should solve small problems and experiment yourself. The
book or course hopefully has exercises. When you have done that
you move on to projects. With projects you will practice both
problem solving and system design. If you feel stuck, there are
only two solutions you should consider (if you actually learned
the language); *think harder, or choose an easier project*.
Don't look for someone to tell you how to do it. And don't give
up too easily. You should think about your problems for at least
a few hours before giving up; maybe even days if the problem is
that you can't figure out how to begin with your first project.
Sure, if the problem you can't figure out is just a small part
of a project, you may ask for help, but you should think about
it for at least a few hours yourself first. [Here is a great
take on this from Nathan
Marz.](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/recipe-for-a-great-programmer.html)

Having said all this, it can of course be invaluable to learn
from other people. You should read books, watch conference
talks, try new paradigms, etc. (not Youtube garbage like tutorials or
""Best languages to learn in 2024""). But only a small part of your
time, say maximum 10%, should be spent on this.

I should probably say something more about tutorials. Tutorials
are fine if you are trying to learn a new library, game engine,
or something; when there is a new part of a project you are
doing that you have not done before, and you need to get
started. Written tutorials are often better than Youtube
videos, and often the best ones are just the ""Getting Started""
sections on the official websites. But don't watch tutorials for
the purpose of learning how to do everything in your project.

Finally: Think for yourself. This is general life advice, and
should be applied to programming as well. Don't do something,
for example OOP, or whatever, just because someone else told you
to. If you don't understand the reasons behind something, ignore
it or try to figure out the reasons and evaluate them.

## What Language Should I learn?

It doesn't really matter, because once you know how to program
learning new languages will be much easier. But there are a
couple of traps to look out for. Firstly, learn one thing at a
time. This is mostly a problem in the web development world,
where people feel the need to learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a
couple of frameworks all at once. Don't do this. Stick to one
thing, like JavaScript with just the very basics of HTML.
Learning a bunch of things at the same time will likely just
lead to an illusion of compentence. Secondly,
I think C++ should be avoided, because it is by far the most
complicated, complex and time-consuming language out there. You
may think that you want to learn C++ because a lot of games are
made with it, but I think it's a waste of time. [Here is a game
programmer who actually uses C++ ranting about it (Bjarne
Stroustroup, whom he talks about, is the main designer of
C++).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i4-e1okZtw) And Jonathan
Blow, a successful game programmer who made *Braid* and *The
Witness*, is making a new language because he thought C++ was
bad. Imagine that, C++ drove him to make a new language. [Here
is a short clip of him discussing
it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmBa_2_TjU). At 02:11 in
the video he says ""Let's actually do what we know is better than
this C++ thing. And there is an unending list of things that you
could do better."" Note his facial expression.

One final thing I'll say about languages is: *Don't believe a
language is good just because it is popular*. Almost the opposite
is true. And almost all popular languages are very similar to
each other. That can easily make you think that the kind of
programming that is typical in those languages (C, Java, Python,
etc.) is the only way to program, but that is not true. Try
Lisp, Smalltalk, Erlang, Prolog, etc. at least eventually. [And watch
this very important video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)",jackstawfromwitchita,1hc936v,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc936v/how_to_actually_get_good_at_programming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc936v/how_to_actually_get_good_at_programming/,2024-12-12 00:54:35,66,0.86,66,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hc936v

learnprogramming,Seeking a mentor to help me transition to top-tier software engineering roles,"Hi!  
  
For the past decade, Iâ€™ve been working on various IT projects, primarily as an SDET. Two years ago, I decided to transition into a Backend Engineer role. However, Iâ€™ve come to realize that my coding practices, knowledge, and the projects Iâ€™ve contributed to are far from optimal. Despite having 10+ years of experience, Iâ€™d currently rate myself as a mid-level developer.

Recently, I made a bold decision to quit my job and dedicate myself entirely to learning, with an ambitious ultimate goal: to become skilled enough to confidently apply for top-tier software engineering positions (e.g., OpenAI, Tesla, FAANG, etc.).

To achieve this, Iâ€™m seeking a mentor who can guide me through projects and help me elevate my knowledge and skills to that level.

**What am I looking for in a mentor?**

* **Experience:** The mentor should currently be where I aspire to be in the future.
* **Commitment:** The mentor must be willing to participate in regular meetings (1â€“2 times a week, depending on availability) to track my progress. Additionally, occasional ad-hoc meetings may be needed to address specific challenges or questions as they arise.
* **Guidance:** The mentor should help create a personalized roadmap of skills and projects to focus on.

My main areas of interest are **AI** (where I have limited experience) and **blockchain** (where Iâ€™ve already worked in the industry for a few years).

Of course, Iâ€™m offering compensation for this mentorship.

If youâ€™re someone who fits this descriptionâ€”or know someone who doesâ€”Iâ€™d greatly appreciate your advice or recommendations.

My story My first job working on flutter based app and it's ok but I don't have that much experience in dart or flutter. But I understands the fundamentals so I was able to pick up language, although framework is quite large to master with new things coming every day. 

Now I'm in situation where I get both kind of task one which involve creating some UI things quickly and other integrating other technologies. As this is my first job(already completed 2 yrs here) so it doesn't pay well and task are getting more challenging although not that much but still.

I was talking to my manager and he told me to learn the core principles (which I'm already doing like design patterns and other good coding practices) but still I'm not able to create something completely on my own. Like even for personal projects thing get crazy real quick and I see use of library, so technically I'm learning new thing but it's not getting used as I don't see that coming in interview or my future task at current company.

So I shifted my focus on Leetcode and cracking the interview, Still waiting for my first call though.

but after all that and little bit (too much) of gaming in between. I'm working more hard and earning less, including not taking vacations that much as it takes me longer to complete task due to some broken dependency.

So back to manager and I asked how you switched and what was his career path like he didn't share much direct details but just how focusing on core principles helps move between the roles.

So far what I have found, the general answer is 

1. build some projects to gain knowledge but keep in mind not to focus too much unless it's something unique or solving problem.

2. have separate time to learn about interviews process and how to crack them.

3. change job to get high salary

Need some specific answers here.

1. building projects takes time and I don't think they actually give you the reward when compared to time you put in. Specially if you are not interested in creating clones. Then what I have found is just copy/fork the projects you like so you don't have to create from scratch (although it's good to have at least 2-3 projects from scratch) and then add the functionality you want. 

Benefit: less time consuming and you get to read others code and implement on top of it (it's a skill much worth then knowing 5 different languages)

2. I mean we do this. But what actually work is number of application you filled and your luck

3. Do this man whenever you get chance, there is no disadvantage to this, better work 1 year at unstable company and get laid off if they offer 3x or 4x salary even 2x sometimes then working at pay rate of mcd employee with so called stable job.

learnprogramming,"Your goal isn't to understand everything, it is to develop the skills to be able to understand anything","Here's a mistake I see newbies make all the time - thinking that either a) they have to understand everything, or b) the only stuff they need to be able to understand is the stuff they're currently doing. Both are wrong.

There's too much out there for anyone to understand everything. I've been doing this for over 30 years, and I know what I know is just a drop in the bucket compared to all there is to know.

*But* I am confident that I *could* understand almost any code/library/system within a certain threshold of difficulty - there's some really really hard stuff that maybe is beyond most developers, but for everything else I know that even if I don't know it now, I could learn it if I had to. How long it'd take me to get up to speed will vary by how close it is to my existing knowledge - learning Yet Another Frontend Library I can probably do pretty fast, but getting up to speed on an ancient Cobol codebase might take me much longer since I've never touched Cobol before. But I'm dead certain I could do it even if took me awhile.

That's your end goal. You can't learn everything. This is why just memorizing code doesn't work, and why tutorial hell doesn't help you grow. The skills you need to develop are problem solving skills, learning how to learn, and how to generate abstractions in your mind.

I think a big signal that you've passed from ""learner"" to ""programmer"" is how a lot of people look at libraries. A lot of learners look at libraries and go ""this is a magic box that does things I'd never be capable of doing"", whereas after awhile...well, you'll have written a lot of libraries yourself, so you *know* you could do most of the stuff the library does you're just like ""thank god someone else already wrote this so I don't have to spend the next week/month/year/decade doing it myself"".

**You'll never be done learning** \- this is a bad field to get into if you don't enjoy constantly learning. But, if you keep hacking away at it, you will get to a point where you lose that ""Am I capable of understanding this?"" doubt and instead start asking ""Do I *have time* to understand this?"" instead and realize you just have to pick and choose where you spend your time as you learn new things.",PoMoAnachro,1hc0w8o,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc0w8o/your_goal_isnt_to_understand_everything_it_is_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hc0w8o/your_goal_isnt_to_understand_everything_it_is_to/,2024-12-11 18:53:17,422,0.99,422,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hc0w8o

learnprogramming,Advice for a novice ,"Hey, guys, 

I've been learning Java for a month and a half now.  I've went through Types and Variables, Conditional Statements,Loops and just heard what Arrays are. To be honest, math was never a strong side of mine, I have not practised math in years. So I am solving problems to get in a bootcamp if I decide, but once I look at some problem if I can not solve it under 2-3 minutes, I just go to the solution, as I do not have an idea how to solve it.  May you advise if the problems are friendly for a novice with just over a month and let's say 1-2 hour 4-5 days a week of writting code or watching videos. As well, any tips on studying such as models for studying etc. 

2 example loop problems:

Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N and prints a matrix like in the examples below. Use two nested loops.

# Input

* The input will always consist of a single line, which contains the number N

Bob and Elly.have very weird taste - their last idea of fun is calculating the ""distance"" that a word is from a given number. The distance is calculated by summing the position in the alphabet of each letter in the word and than finding the absolute difference between that word and another predefined number. You are a programmer so you must ruin their fun by automating the process.

Examples:

* word 'bob', number = 22, distance = 3 ('b' + 'o' + 'b' = 2 + 15 + 2 = 19)
* word 'bob', number = 10, distance = 9

Write a program that calculates the distance for each string and also outputs the average distance.

# Input

* The input consists of several lines.
* **T**Â \- the target number
* **N**Â \- the number of words to follow
* on the nextÂ **N**Â lines - each word on a new line

# Output

* Output consists ofÂ **N + 1**Â lines
* First N lines - word + its distance in formatÂ `word distance`
* Last line - the average distance, rounded to two digits after the decimal point

# Constraints

* Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase english alphabet letters
* 1 &lt;=Â **N**Â &lt;= 20
* 0 &lt;=Â **T**Â &lt;= 1000

This are just examples which I find near impossible to solve as the theory in the course I do not find sufficient. What are your opinions about my situation?

Iâ€™ve been grappling with the Floyd-Warshall algorithm lately, and honestly, itâ€™s been a real pain. Specifically, the way the next and path matrices handle the output order of nodes in the shortest path is driving me crazy.



Hereâ€™s the deal:



When I use the next matrix to reconstruct the path, the nodes are output from front to back.

But when I use the path (predecessor) matrix, the nodes come out from back to front.

I understand the theoretical difference between them, but whatâ€™s really tripping me up is why initializing next\[i\]\[j\] = j and updating it with next\[i\]\[j\] = next\[i\]\[k\] results in front-to-back output, whereas initializing path\[i\]\[j\] = i and updating it with path\[i\]\[j\] = path\[k\]\[j\] leads to back-to-front output. I just canâ€™t wrap my head around the mechanics of it.



When I try to simulate the process manually, it feels like trying to untangle a knot. Every time I think Iâ€™ve got it figured out, something breaks, and Iâ€™m left more confused than before. The initialization and update rules make sense on paper, but translating that into a mental model or even a hand-drawn simulation is excruciatingly difficult. Itâ€™s frustrating because I know these concepts are crucial, but no matter how many times I go over them, they just donâ€™t click.



Has anyone else been through this struggle? How did you overcome the confusion between next and path matrices in Floyd-Warshall? Any tips, explanations, or even just commiseration would be greatly appreciated. Sometimes it feels like Iâ€™m the only one stuck on this, and thatâ€™s really disheartening.



Thanks for reading and for any support you can offer!

learnprogramming,How to make each child the same width of the longest child in Tailwind CSS?,"I have tried a few methods usingÂ `flex`Â andÂ `grid`, but none of them seem to work:

    &lt;/Tabs&gt;

The structure looks something like the code snippet above. When I setÂ `className`Â as:

* `flex items-end justify-start *:flex-1`
* `grid items-end justify-start grid-cols-3`
* `grid items-end justify-start auto-cols-[minmax(auto,1fr)] grid-flow-col`

Both of them up the full space ofÂ `Tabs`Â as below:

Is there any way I could get it to take up the space of the longest Tab (i.e., Tab 3) without manually specifying width inÂ `className`Â likeÂ `flex items-end justify-start *:w-[216px]`? I would like to achieve something like the following:

UsingÂ `auto-cols-[minmax(auto,min-content)]`Â or simply not setting width doesn't work either, as the columns just use up the minimum width of each child.

learnprogramming,Am i crazy? Or is the documentation not for beginners trying to learn whatsoever?,"Its way too complicated. I tried using cppreference to refresh myself on arrays. for those curious this page: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array)

After being lost for 5 minutes I found myself just asking chatGPT who promptly told me ""std::array&lt;Type, Size&gt; name;"" And then followed it up with a basic example using a for loop. 

now over on cppreference where im supposed to ""just look at the documentation dude"" and it says right off the bat: ""This container is an aggregate type with the same semantics as a struct holding aÂ [C-style array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/array)Â T\[N\]Â as its only non-static data member. Unlike a C-style array, it doesn't decay toÂ T\*Â automatically. As an aggregate type, it can be initialized withÂ [aggregate-initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization)Â given at mostÂ `N`Â initializers that are convertible toÂ `T`: std::array&lt;int,Â 3&gt;Â aÂ =Â {1,Â 2,Â 3}; ""  HUH? 

Ok maybe that was just a mistake... scrolls down:

  
""The struct combines the performance and accessibility of a C-style array with the benefits of a standard container, such as knowing its own size, supporting assignment, random access iterators, etc.

`std::array`Â satisfies the requirements ofÂ [*Container*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container)Â andÂ [*ReversibleContainer*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ReversibleContainer)Â except that default-constructed array is not empty and that the complexity of swapping is linear,Â satisfies the requirements ofÂ [*ContiguousContainer*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousContainer),(since C++17)Â and partially satisfies the requirements ofÂ [*SequenceContainer*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SequenceContainer).

There is a special case for a zero-length array (`N == 0`). In that case,Â array.begin()Â ==Â array.end(), which is some unique value. The effect of callingÂ front()Â orÂ back()Â on a zero-sized array is undefined.

An array can also be used as a tuple ofÂ `N`Â elements of the same type.""

I can't at all figure out how to solve this in a semi-good way. It almost worked a few times, but I always end up having to throw it all out and start over. I think I am not seeing something obvious...

  
**Project**

The project let's players create games. I want to pretty much give an evaluation of the games, so whenever a new game comes in, I want to evaluate all the data of all the players. I added a Participant as a Player that participated in a game to save values relative to the player. So e.g. Player1 plays with Player2, then Player2 will be a Participant in the Set of Participants belonging to Player1. And that Participant will be in the teammates Map and have the values ""numGames=1, ..."".

Here are the data types

  
GameCreatedEvent = result1, result2, team1, team2

Team = ID, players: List&lt;Player&gt;  
Player = ID

Participant = ID, numberOfGames, numberOfWins, numberOfLosses, numberOfDraws

**What I want to achieve initially** \- Pseudocode, so I hope someone understands

    var teammates = Map of Player to Set&lt;Participant&gt;
    var opponents = Map of Player to Set&lt;Participant&gt;
    
    function updateMaps(event: GameCreatedEvent):
      var result1 = event.result1
      var result2 = event.result2
      var team1 = event.team1
      var team2 = event.team2
    
      for each player in (team1.players + team2.players):
        var teammates = this.teammates[player]
        var opponents = this.opponents[player]
    
        for each participant in (team1.players):
          var isTeammateOfPlayer = (...)
          var hasWonGame = (...)
    
          update values of participant relative to if isTeamMate and hasWonGame
    
        this.teammates = teammates
        this.opponents = opponents

  
**TLDR**

I have Players in a Game. After a Game is created, for every Player that was in that Game, I want to update the List of all the Players that Player has played with or against and if he won with or against them.
