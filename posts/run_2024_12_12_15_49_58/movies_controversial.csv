movies,Just got done rewatching The Green Mile.,"The Green Mile is my favorite movie of all time, along with Fight Club and another Darabont/King film, The Shawshank Redemption. But what Mile has over Shawshank is the supernatural and stronger religious themes. 

I love all the characters here, with my favorite being Paul Edgecomb. His character arc and relationship with John Coffey is so sad, but also so sweet. The way he starts to believe in miracles and actually offers John a way out is such compelling character writing. As is his relationship with Brutus and Dean. 

Wild Bill is a threatening antagonist, and you truly learn to hate him. Very satisfying seeing him get what he deserves.

John Coffey is a true miracle of God. A man who heals and helps people, and who sees the good and bad in everyone on Earth. His death had me bawling like a baby, and his dialogue is some of the best in the film. His execution is my personal favorite scene in film history for how well-executed and emotional it is.

Absolute masterpiece of a film, and a damn near perfect one.

movies,Recent movie styles/trends that you don't like? ,"I've noticed that most movies tend to become more of the same, especially this:

\- Action movie that tries to be nitty gritty? Lower the colors, make everything green/gray and film shaky hand style during the adrenaline/fight scene. During the 2000's, the movies would try to at least choreograph an admirable fight scene and the camera 's point of view would be at least steady

\- There are almost no epilogues for romantic movies. They basically roll the credits as soon the couple kiss. We don't get a moment to catch our breath or appreciate whatever is happening and boom the credits starts. The epilogues doesn't even need to be a 5 minute if you want to cheapen the budget. Just a minute or something to show what the future holds. Even the side characters doesn't really get their side plot resolved or hear about it what happened.

\- Movie intro. In the 90's en 00's, we would hear music, the introduction names start, we see the main character start their morning/life/moment and there is a minute of no talk. We just get a sense of what their life is before the main plot starts. Now it's bam, immediately start and it takes us a lot more minutes before finding out the gist and we have to remember everything because of possible plot relevance. And the title comes just before the credits roll.

\- Car riding scenes: 80's and early 90's could get away with this because the technology wasn't quite there yet: Green screen driving. Back then, they could hide this by filming in the dark and have the character sway the wheel furiously from left to right and back to indicate he/she is driving all while telling us the problem in thoughts. Nowadays they film with a green screen, especially when we see it from sideways. The scenery is also a bit blurry, giving us a stark contrast when the characters and the car itself is in crisp 4K quality. I see this style getting back more and more.

What is your thing that you don't like, that has been happening lately? I'm not asking about the main character grabbing a toast from a full breakfast spread and heading off examples.

movies,David Lean‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrief Encounter‚Äù and my paradoxical experience watching ‚Äúclassic‚Äù films,"I have a hard time placing my genuine thoughts towards judging older films from before the 60s, mainly stuff around the Hays Code era, as a lot of them maintain a place in the film canon by having been ahead of their time, or at least timeless enough to still be watchable in 2024. Having seen Brief Encounter last night, I didn‚Äôt fall in love with it but there are some sparkingly modern filmmaking techniques and creativity that must‚Äôve been distinct at the time. I‚Äôm thinking of shots like the dream sequence Celia‚Äôs character has when reflected in the train window, it has this ethereal quality to it with the ornate lights that would feel very fitting to a new release today, and the ‚Äúmadness tilt‚Äù zoom on her when she contemplates suicide after the man leaves. Plus the whole recontextualisng of the beginning is very slickly done and easy to love. However, and this may be the jaded part of refusing myself emotional attachment to it, but like lots of classic revered titles I can‚Äôt tell if I like it for the film or the filmmaking. It‚Äôs difficult to decipher where my investment in the story ends with a recognition of how ahead-of-its-time a certain film was. 

This could be a wider humbug I have when it comes to my personal assessment of films in the ‚Äúcanon‚Äù and at the risk of overcomplicating matters, but when they have such a long reputation and are held up in every conversation about being essential viewing and/or revolutionary, it feels like an inevitable shadow on the film as I‚Äôm watching. I‚Äôm not just watching Brief Encounter, I‚Äôm watching David Lean‚Äôs universally acclaimed 1945 classic Brief Encounter. 

If this post ends up sounding more like an overly verbose rephrasing of ‚Äúletting expectations hamper my viewing experience‚Äù then apologies for that, but it‚Äôs an issue I encounter regularly whenever I dip my toes into this circle of the movie world.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 1 - England,"Hello there,

since over one and a half month I'm asking you for your favorite movie in a certain european country once a day. This was very easy for me in the last round: I can't announce a winner yet, because the 24 hours aren't up yet (I'm a bit early today, as I have plans for later - yes, there is an RL outside of Reddit), so stay tuned, but all in all, Ukraine is still and hopefully will continue to be an independent country. But when it comes to today's country, it is sometimes a little difficult to understand, at least for me as an outsider.

I know, I know, Wikipedia can never be the last source, but let's take a look on it here. When it comes to the UK, it clearly says:

&gt;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.

At the same time, you can read on another article:

&gt;Since 1922, the United Kingdom has been made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales (which collectively make up Great Britain) and Northern Ireland (avoriously described as a country, province, jurisdiction or region.

Further internet research has shown that not only for me as a non-native speaker, but also for the British themselves, it is sometimes not so clear where their country begins and their state ends. Even here in the discussion group I have even read that the UK is not a country at all, then again that it is a country made up of several countries (sometimes by one and the same person). It's all quite confusing, but I think I've found a solution that I can live with.

Today we're going to start with films set in **England**. Over the next few days, we'll do the same with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On the fifth day, the respective individual winners will then compete against each other again, so that we have a winner for the UK, but also winners for the individual ‚Äòsub-countries‚Äô. I think that's a lot of effort, but hey, even if I think the UK members should sort out once and for all whether they want to be federal states or separate countries, I can't ignore the actual situation. In return, I ask you not to ignore the following two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Deja Vu (2006),"So I just watched this, and I'm confused about the third act.

The movie very strongly suggests that there is only one, immutable timeline in the manner of 12 Monkeys.

We learn that the main character's partner is inexplicably killed in the ferry attack. Later we see the scientists send a warning back, which is intercepted by the partner and explains why he was killed. This is one timeline then: that note was *always* there for the partner to find

When the main character himself goes back in time, everything he does is stuff that already happened. His finger prints were found all over the house because he'd *always* traveled back in time to touch stuff. The bloody tissue was on the garbage because he'd *always* gone back in time to leave it there, etc. In this scene he realizes that this has always happened this way and then... suddenly changes things?

Did I miss something, or is this a glaring plot hole? He's been trying to use his knowledge of the future to change things for half the films runtime, only to be consistently thwarted with the realization that he'd *always* done those things. His foreknowledge consistently fails him because by trying to apply it, he's just ensuring that things happen the way they already happened. So how is he able to just suddenly change things at the end?

movies,Collateral ,"

At the beginning of the movie Vincent is walking through a airport and bumps into a character played by Jason Statham.  They both drop identical briefcases and then exchange them.  We then follow Vincent on his journey but we have never revisited what Jason‚Äôs character may have been off to.  It‚Äôs provides perfect foreshadowing for a second movie loosely based on the plot of the first one (drama with drug cartels, law enforcement, litigation etc).  I always thought that Michael Mann would revisit this moment.  He could start a movie with this exact scene again and then follow Jason‚Äôs character as Vincent walks off.  Thoughts?

Watching this movie opened my eyes to the horrors of our health care system and has stayed with me all these years.

movies,"Pedro Almod√≥var's style and writing doesn't translate well in English in ""The Room Next Door""","I wanted to like Pedro Almod√≥var because Almod√≥var was my childhood idol when I became obsessed with Cinema and I identified with his vision. His worldwide success after Todo Sobre Mi Madre was exciting because the world could see his genius. 

For years, I've been wanting to see Almod√≥var cross over into English and after I got to watch ""The Room Next Door"", it might be a case of his style, his trademark, doesn't translate well into English. 

Because the way he writes and directs didn't change, it's always been slightly theatrical, big yet subtle at the same time when it comes with his writing, and in Spanish and the way Spanish actors accostumed with Almod√≥var are, it works, yet in English, it's distracting. It's more wooden and stagy and some of the dialogue comes off as contrived. 

Yet I wouldn't call ""The Room Next Door"" a bad film, because of the use of colors, the direction, the way Almod√≥var shoots scenes with symbolism and the importance of sets, and, of course, Tilda Swinton is excellent (as usual) as a dying woman who chooses euthanasia. She is fascinating and you can't take your eyes away from her. Julianne Moore is good, it's just, she's more of an observer, she exists to support Swinton, and as a result, her character ends up being underwritten. John Turturro shows up a few times to spout stuff about the world ending, I didn't like how forced his dialogue was.

movies,Highlander - What if Kurgan had won?  Could he really do anything?,"This is a very old movie with well know ending, so need to spoiler tag.   Don't read any further if you somehow haven't seen Highlander after 40 years.

There were lines in the movie where Ramirez (Sean Connery) warned Connor that they couldn't let The Kurgan win the prize, or mankind would enter a terrible darkness and never recover.

But what if Kurgan had beaten Connor, and won the prize?   What could he really have done to the world?  As we saw in Connor's closing comments during the ending, he became mortal.   He did say he ""knew everything"" and could basically understand everyone in the worlds feelings and intentions.

So if their worst fear came true and the Kurgan won - so what?  He is now mortal and can be killed.   How would he topple the worlds governments who were defended by massive Armies, war machines, and technology?  

The Kurgan would be the best swordsman in the world which would be meaningless in the 1980s.   He would have a great understanding of people and be able to manipulate SOME people do his bidding, but it doesn't seem like he could really surpass the level of ""local kingpin""

Another example is for me is Kathy Bates who played Jo Bennett in the office for 8 episodes as the CEO of Sabre (out of 188 episode total). Or can you imagine Game of Thrones without Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo? He was only in 11 episodes out of 73.

movies,Meet the Fockers 4,"With the recent announcement of Meet the Fockers 4 being in production, I would like to share the two ideas/predictions I had for what the plot will be. My girlfriend and I love the movies so we‚Äôre really excited for this fourth installment (I literally had not watched it until last year, safe to say I loved it). Also, regardless of what the movie is about, my girlfriend had a great idea for the name: ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs Focked‚Äù. I‚Äôll start with the best prediction my girlfriend and I came up with and then I‚Äôll throw in the second backup guess. The most likely thing that we see happening is a repeat of the first movie, but instead with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro WORKING TOGETHER to do the same thing that was done to Ben years ago. We pictured Stiller (or Greg) having a daughter, and him going through the same situation that Deniro (or Jack) was going through in the first movie. We think that either 

A.) Robert deniro will help stiller to investigate his daughters new bf with all of the gadgets and such he possesses
or 

B.) Greg realizes that he‚Äôs acting exactly like Jack, and even when he tries to stop himself, he can‚Äôt help but see the similarities (when it comes to their daughters)

The last throw away idea we had was a huge family reunion, where we see all of the aunts, uncles, and cousins from the Focker family, and they have to interact and get along with the cousins and such from the Byrnes family.

movies,The Real Reason Landa Kills Hammersmark - Inglorious Basterds,"Landa mentions after capturing Aldo that he was a detective before the war. I think this is supposed to be a clue for us that he can figure out what happened at the bar. He sees shoes on the ground, blood from a low impact shot, knows that whoever the shoes belong to was shot low, then laid on the ground for a while. 

He sees the corpse of Wilhelm ( guy with newborn son Max) lying not far away, with no weapon, and with some of his detective work, notices that Wilhelm has been shot from a low angle with a low-caliber pistol, from the spot where the blood and shoes are. He sees the napkin which confirms that Hammersmark knew that she was killing an un-armed man with a newborn son. 

Landa has already been shown not to kill without reason, and he seems to genuinely care about some people (like Shoshanna and the soldier at the end of the movie who is killed by Aldo). I think he proves to himself that Hammersmark killed a drunk, unarmed, and fearful new father, and regardless of what comes next, decides that she deserves to die for those actions. 

When Landa is asked what happens to Hammersmark, he says she got what she deserved. I think many would assume it's because she is a traitor, but that would make him a hypocrite a few moments later when he chooses to betray the Nazi regime. I think what he really means is that she got what she deserved for killing Wilhelm.

movies,Watching Dead Man (1995) and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) back-to-back is a unique experience,"*Dead Man* is an acid western in which a wounded accountant named William Blake teams up with a strange Native American man named Nobody, who happens to be a fan of the artist William Blake and believes the accountant is a vengeful reincarnation of the more famous Blake. The movie plays with western tropes, but it is mostly a somber meditation on death.

*Ghost Dog* is more modern and less bizarre, but it explores many of the same themes and features a similarly heightened reality in which a masterful modern assassin takes strong influence from the Hagakure as he works for (and then against) a bunch of old wiseguys.

They're both unconventional independent action-thrillers by Jim Jarmusch. Both feature a protagonist who acts as a personification of death, often effortlessly killing various stereotypes (cowboys, gangsters). Both films are very philosophical and artistic, but in different ways.

In addition to death and philosophy, the two films are also quite amusing. Jarmusch's dry sense of humor contrasts well with the dark plots full of murder. I like that there's nothing flashy about either movie's world. Dead Man makes the old west feel like a dirty and miserable playground for deranged weirdos, and in Ghost Dog the modern city run by gangsters looks totally mundane and unglamorous, an environment plagued by elderly has-been punks with guns.

The subdued reality of the world and its villains allows the heightened reality of the heroes to shine. There's nothing really superhuman about Blake or Ghost Dog, but the way they intensely associate themselves with death and the fatalism that breeds puts them on another level than the basic bad guys they do battle with.

movies,The Wackness (2008) nails the 90s New York atmosphere. ,"If you don't know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it's worth the hour and 40 minutes.
 

First of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography.  The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. 

Most of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my view you could see Dr Squires trying to help Luke so he doesn't become him. I think the movie shows that if Luke is in the same direction he is in he will end up like Squires. Honesty Luke and Squires have the best chemistry and scenes together. And the way they written Squires wife relationship and Luke and Stephanie relationship is great.
 
It also has a great soundtrack. If you love 90s hiphop the film and actually fits in with the movie well. 

And the movie has great commentery. The movie portrays 90s New York problems well with Rudy Giuliani drug war aganist weed as a supporting part of the story. 


The only problem i have is Josh Pecks acting. I think this is one of those rare times where a character is written well but the actor isn't great. Josh Peck does more better in comedic roles and his acting isn't good in this film. I don't know how you describe it but Josh Peck has trouble portraying a pot head in this story. 


Anyway I love this film, The cinematography is great, the music is great, the writing is good, and despite Josh Pecks performance, I think everyone else did a good job.

By definition, a well rounded film should have these attributes

1. Quality - Be a quality film, obviously. Within the script, acting, scenes and soundtrack 

2. Good Length - Have an average run time not too long or short 

3. Highly Accessible - Able to watch with almost types of audiences, including film critics and casual viewers. Not too niche of a topic or style.

4. Rewatchability - Is able to be rewatched multiple times without fatigue

I was watching Elizabeth (1998) and am confused about a particular scene.
A Duke from France who happens to be the nephew of Mary of Guise comes to England to ask the hand of Queen Elizabeth for marriage. 

She of course is reluctant because of her ongoing affair with Lord Robert. 

Then during a party, she goes to the room of the Duke and catches him in a dress. He is drunk and dressed like woman. Does this imply that he was gay ? Or is this just a lord doing lord things. 

Also, she proceeds to extend her hand to be kissed by the Duke but he is obviously embarrassed by this. He reluctantly agrees and does not even kiss it properly. 
Why ? Can men in dress not kiss the hands of a Queen ? Why was he embarrassed and so reluctant for this.

&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don‚Äôt even feel like they take place in the same *film*, ‚ÄúKraven the Hunter‚Äù might be very, very bad (and by ‚Äúmight be‚Äù I mean ‚Äúalmost objectively is‚Äù), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today‚Äôs audiences might consider as ‚Äúgood.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

&gt;Crowe‚Äôs safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there‚Äôs not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it‚Äôs best that this misbegotten series quits while it‚Äôs just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

For example, I think we all can relate, but being away from your mother takes a toll on you, especially as a kid. I felt her pain and it was so REAL! I couldn't handle setouskes death, im not usually a sensitive kind, but I cried for a while. And the pain of being rejected by your own family is almost outer worldly.

movies,Looper first time watch. ,"The entire movie I had no idea that was Joseph Gordon Levitt. I thought it looked like him at times but something was off. My question is this, was he made to look different in the film or did he have work done? If I recall Batman came out around this time and he looked totally different. 

My other question is about TK. Was the only purpose of establishing the TK mutation so that the rainmaker had some sort of super mutation? Otherwise it seemed pointless and I was waiting for how it might play into the storyline.

movies,"After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?","After watching Salaar, Tiger 3 and Devara, how do you describe the ""Aesthetic"" of modern Indian movies?

Recently I watched the Indian movie ""Devara"" starring N. T. Rama Rao Jr. of RRR, and just like RRR the movie was astonishing. There's something about modern Indian movies of the last 15 years. The Aesthetic (?) is something else. I don't know any other word, because the movies are so unique. They way male characters stand on their word, the emphasis on concern for family and the community, the hero and villains' willingness to resort to cartoonish levels of violence, the preserving of women's virtues unless it's a colourful pop video in the middle and repeated fanfare when the hero appears or begins killing people. 

I always start laughing uncontrollably at these moments but I am throughly entertained! Are there any books or online articles that explain this style of filmmaking and why Indian producers believe or know this is what their audience responds to? The closest thing I can think of is like Michael Bay, but on a budget! Because I think the directors draw on a lot of elements of music videos &amp; commercials throughout the films through colour schemes, cinematography, family scenes, fight sequences and of course the pop songs. 

Are there any Hollywood movies made like these? I know Hollywood only just recognized RRR, but there must be something good about what the Indian filmmakers are doing as they show a hell of a lot more imagination and are determined to give their audiences spectacle on what is Hollywood mid-budgets.
