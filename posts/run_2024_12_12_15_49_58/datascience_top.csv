datascience,Error rates /dirty data can cause sickness? ,"I do remember reading a long time ago that in production lines with high error-rates the motivation of labourers went down and the stress affected the workforce. 

I wonder if dirty-data can have the same effect and has been researched as such. I know there are studies into error-rates in software, but that mixes software with data. 

I wonder if specifically the stress caused by the unpredictability of the amount of work and the constant pressure dirty data causes has been studied as a health concern/risk. 

Thanks.
