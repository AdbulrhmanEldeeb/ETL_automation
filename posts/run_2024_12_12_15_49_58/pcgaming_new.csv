pcgaming,Anti-aliasing: Why did it become so bad recently?,"In older games (up until 2013-2015), Using 2/4x MSAA was enough to make edges buttery smooth while keeping picture sharp and readable.

pcgaming,Beware ordering items from Max Gaming (international reseller),"Hi all,

Like many, I was intrigued by the appearance of new lightweight high performance mice that have cropped up recently.

I was building a new PC, so ordered a Santali S1-O from [Maxgaming.com](https://us.maxgaming.com/)

Despite having a US prefix on their website URL, they are in fact based in Sweden, and will ship any orders internationally.

So far, everything seems fine, right? The internet is international, and borders are such a 20th century conceit.

However, the problem arose when things did not work according to plan.

According to the carrier (DHL Express), the package was delivered to my mailbox on Monday.

However, my mailbox was empty when I checked it, and neither my condo office nor the package locker had any packages in my name.

When I contacted Maxgaming, their response was that since the package was shipped internationally, and the carrier reported it as 'Delivered', there was nothing for them to do.

No refund, no resend, not even an attempt to contact the carrier to confirm receipt of delivery.

I was just supposed to eat up the item and delivery charge and have nothing to show for it, like a chump (my words, not theirs).

It's not egregious to describe this situation as 'Extremely Unprofessional'. A legitimate business should have the means to ensure safe delivery of purchased items to the consumer, and to resolve disputes with the carrier if things go south on delivery. ""Tough luck, you're SOL"" is not an acceptable means of doing business, especially in the long term. 

Consumer Protection Laws in the US protect me from being charged for items I have paid for but did not receive.

I have filed a dispute claim with Paypal and with my bank, and hopefully they will b able to resolve matters on my behalf.

But in the meantime, a cautionary tale to people who may be tempted by the low prices and deals at maxgaming. You get what you pay for, and sometimes, you don't.

We’re thrilled to share *Majulah*, our debut game from **That One Time I Made A Game Studio**! 🎮 As a Singapore-based indie studio, we’ve created a unique City Builder Roguelike that puts you in charge of building and governing your own version of Singapore.

In *Majulah*, you’ll:

* Strategically place Singapore-inspired buildings with different scoring rules 🏙️
* Recruit powerful Cabinet Members who grant unique abilities to help you govern 💼
* Navigate Parliament sessions and elections to secure your re-election 🗳️
* Enjoy fresh, dynamic city-building challenges with each playthrough

We’ve infused the game with elements of Singapore’s culture, architecture, and folklore, and we’re excited to share our home’s uniqueness with the world. Our goal is to create a game that celebrates Singapore, similar to how other cultures (like Japan) have influenced games globally.

We’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback as we continue development. Wishlist *Majulah* now on Steam and join us on this exciting journey!

pcgaming,Did PC gaming use to not be very popular in some parts of the world?,"Hello everyone. I am Polish. I have been playing on PC since I was a kid. It seems to me that Poland is predominantly a country that games on PC. I have always believed that PC gaming IS the default way to game.

However, it appears to me that this probably hasn't been the case in other countries?

As an example, Americans pretty much only refer to games made between 2000 and 2011 as, ""a PS2 game"" or ""an Xbox 360 game"" even if said game had a PC release. Most of the discourse regarding gaming around that time revolves around the PS2, the 360, the GameCube, etc.

Also, most Americans seem to know console games like Ocarina of Time (which I will admit I have no clue what that game even is) but they probably have no idea what games like Baldur's Gate or Baldur's Gate 2 are, because they released on PC.

pcgaming,Our World War II airbase builder got a new demo with new major features,"Hello r/pcgaming, my team and I are making a base builder set on World War II military airfields, called [Ground of Aces](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/). In this game, you build your own air base, manage your ground crew and aircraft, and send your pilots out on missions.

And we just released a **major update for our**[ **demo on Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/) with new features and content.

The key updates are:

* Four new aircraft: Avro Lancaster, Bristol Blenheim, Bristol Beaufighter, Gloster Gladiator
* Expanded mission systems with new missions and mission types
* Plane maintenance system, incl. fuel as a new resource, multi seat plane logic and pilot class and task system
* New metal building blocks for hangars, fences, fuel tanks
* Gardening system that lets you grow plants and harvest your own food
* and many more improvements

Play the demo here:[ https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground\_of\_Aces/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/)

Here is an overview video of the new Alpha 3 features:[ https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R](https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R)

As a big fan of base building games like Rimworld and as a World War II aviation nerd, this is a passion project for me. Almost 10 years ago, I had the idea of a base builder game set on World War II airbases, and it feels unreal to see this idea coming to life now and have people play this alpha version of the game.

We are in the alpha phase of development, so everything is still a work in progress. It would be **great to hear your opinion and feedback about the demo**. Is it satisfying to collect resources and build your first structures? How long did you play and how big did your air base get? Anything in particular you like/dislike about the experience? Getting early feedback helps the ongoing development and will make the game better for everyone.

pcgaming,how are unoptimized/buggy games able to ship out that way?,"Everyone knows PC game optimization hasnt ever been the best but i gotta ask, if anyone were to know, is it really that hard to test a game for shit like that? I do understand game development isnt a walk in the park like its made out to be sometimes by people who are mad, but do these developers have like super computers or something? Maybe their dev kits for consoles(if those are still a thing) just make the game work better or sum. Even then though, couldnt they just test the game on just consumer products? It just seems like itd be such a huge shock to devs to release a game that they (hopefully) have rigorously tested for it to be reviewed as unoptimized and buggy.

All this is just genuine curiosity btw.

pcgaming,Did I just get older or have things changed?,"I'm sure my experience mirrors others. When I was a kid, I trusted the Ubisoft logo. Prince of Persia, Hawx 2, Blazing Angels, and Just Dance, to name a couple of the ones i played on the family Wii. Granted, i was a child and not the best judge of games, but I had fun with all of those and that's what games are for. Nowadays that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Skull and Bones, which i thankfully avoided buying altogether when reviews were less than stellar. Shame the tailers made it seem like exactly my type of game, i LOVED Sea of Thieves. 

Most of the recent Assassin's Creed games selling permanent double money and experience points (imo should not have even been offered, if the feedback you get from testers is that progression is too slow, it's scummy to sell a solution). Did the fact that they sell those boosters spoil my enjoyment of Oddysey/Valhalla? Mostly no, but I was far more conscious of the fact I COULD be progressing faster like my friend who bought them. We would play the game on a voice call, share loot locations and strats, it became frustrating hearing the things I couldn't access because of my low level. 

Games like Call of duty seem to be slowing the progression of the battle passes to get you to play their game and ONLY their game if you want to reach the top tier within the time limit. Could be just placebo, unsure how true this is.

As I said above, I'm not alone in feeling this way. A few of my friends share my sentiment. It's not only Ubisoft that does this, they're just a prime example. Create a problem and sell a solution is a great business move, but shitty for consumers.",dadodavedude,1h9z4hz,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,2024-12-09 02:09:27,0,0.26,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9z4hz

pcgaming,is it common to lose interest in a game after completing the main storyline?,"I'm honestly new to playing modern AAA games, I used to watch gameplay videos a lot but now that I have somewhat of a proper rig to game on, I noticed that I lose interest in games after the main story. when the main story is still ongoing I do the side missions and stuff a lot, I like it then but once the story concludes I don't want to do the side missions anymore, maybe I feel like there are too many other good games to dive into to waste my time on side missions after the main game ends? Also, I feel a bit sad when the main story ends, which is of course a common thing for everyone when something they like comes to an end.

I recently played Arkham Knight and I haven't seen the knight fall protocol in action yet as I lost interest after the identity reveal.

pcgaming,Bad optimization vs poor optimization the real reason.,"This is not asking for tech support or providing it, please don't auto delete this mods :-)



There's this age old argument of whether games are optimized well or not by developers and I think I have the simple answer that I don't see being talked about. It maybe so obvious that it doesn't need mentioning, but then again it may be so obvious that no one sees it.

Since the PS3/360 generation of gaming fidelity became more important to developers than fluidity and response time. If optimized well 30 frames per second (33.3ms) 6ft from your TV with a wireless controller could be satisfying and to those new to gaming that generation is was just normal. In the PS3/360 era, PC gaming was just a drop in the bucket of the market share too. Every generation there's a leap in fidelity potential and despite the demand for 60fps on consoles it was always an after thought until this generation. Now it's kind of a frustrating joke.

Because games are still being made with a render bandwidth of 33.3ms at the base level, that's where the majority of games start. For those who don't understand, developers know at 30fps they have 33.3ms to render a frame which is double the amount of time (bandwidth) to render 60fps (16.6ms.) So they design and optimize the game around the flexibility that 33.3ms provides. If a game like that sticks to a solid 30fps it is actually optimized well and functioning as intended.

But enter performance mode though... All modern performance modes are doing is trying to scale back the fidelity on a surface level usually just by cutting back on the resolution and level of detail. But with games full of lighting, Ray Tracing and effects based around using all 33.3ms of render time your CPU has available 60fps is just not possible for most CPUs.

Some games however are designed to run within a 16.6ms render time on console, usually less graphically intensive games. But sometimes we get standout games like the new Indiana Jones, CoD (I don't like CoD but it performs very well,) Hogwarts Legacy (had some PC issues at launch, but super optimized for a UE4 game,) Dragon Age 4, Helldivers 2, Evil West, Stellar Blade (proof will be in the PC launch,) and Resident Evil 4 Remake to name a few.

The list of games that run a 30fps well and not 60fps is much longer, but there's a few games that have issues that don't even stay at 30fps.

We also have the new standard emerging that is 40FPS/25ms which feels so much better than 30fps but not at good at 60fps. Maybe that's a new baseline we should hope for going forward? But it only works if you have a 120Hz display. But if they target 25ms render time it provides a potential Frame Interpolation (Frame Generation) target of 80fps/12.5ms which can feel like 60fps. I could live with that instead of being stuck at using FG to go from 30fps to 60fps on PC. But I'd prefer if developers would push the limits and figure out how to best utilize 60fps/16.6ms.

I believe poor optimization is when games crash and or can't hit their intended target framerate (which is rarely 60fps) and bad optimization is the unwillingness to give gamers what we've wanted for 3 console generations now which is 60fps. I honestly don't care about 4K, render to a super clean 1080p or 1440p and bilinearly upscale with the GPU - go play TLOU Remastered on a PS5 and tell me if you can really see a difference between performance or fidelity modes. Poor PC port though, that was just a botched/rushed job. But this 4K and faux 4K (FSR - looking at you) is stealing precious render time that could be spent making the game more stable.

Most games are well optimized they just have poor optimization limits.

pcgaming,"Ubisoft, Why Do Your Games Stop Working After a Year?","I’m done. I’m absolutely done with Ubisoft. Over the years, I’ve spent hundreds—probably thousands—of dollars on their games. I’ve built a library of some of their best franchises: *Assassin’s Creed*, *Far Cry*, *Watch Dogs*. These are games I *wanted* to love, games I poured hours of my life into. But what’s the point of owning them when they just stop working after a year?

Here’s what I’ve dealt with repeatedly:

* **Ubisoft Connect**: More like Ubisoft *Disconnect*. Every other update breaks something. Games that ran fine one day refuse to launch the next, and troubleshooting is like banging your head against a wall.
* **DRM Nonsense**: I’ve paid for these games—full price in most cases—and yet they can’t verify licenses? How does that even happen? Why do I feel like a pirate for trying to play games I legally own?
* **Servers, Servers, Servers**: Why does every Ubisoft game, even the single-player ones, seem to rely on servers? And when those servers inevitably go down or get shut off, good luck trying to access your progress or even start the game.
* **Updates That Break Everything**: Instead of fixing bugs, updates sometimes *add* new ones. Or they tank performance, making games unplayable. I shouldn’t have to *fear* clicking ""Update.""

And just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, in the past month alone, I’ve lost access to *Ghost Recon Breakpoint*, *For Honor*, and even *Battlefield 1* and *Battlefield 2042*. That’s FOUR games I can no longer launch no matter what I try. At this point, it feels like a ticking time bomb before the few games I still have that work also join the pile of dozens that don’t.

Speaking of Battlefield, let me throw EA into the mix, too. Their games are plagued by the *same* issues: DRM problems, launcher headaches, server reliance, and updates that break what didn’t need fixing. It feels like these companies are competing to see who can frustrate their customers more.

And what’s with the unnecessary third-party launchers? If I bought a game on Steam, I should be able to launch it *from Steam*. Why do I need Ubisoft Connect or EA Play or whatever other launcher shoved down my throat? It’s clunky, unreliable, and adds yet another layer of potential failure. Enough is enough!

It’s not just their old games, either. Ubisoft’s new games have been circling the drain in terms of quality. Remember when their titles felt groundbreaking and polished? Now it feels like every new release is rushed, bloated with microtransactions, or half-baked. They’re more focused on squeezing money out of players than creating games that work reliably or stand the test of time.

I’m tired of wasting my time, energy, and money trying to keep Ubisoft games functional. Gaming is supposed to be fun—not a second job where I’m troubleshooting errors or waiting on forums for a patch that may never come.

At this point, I’ve made up my mind: I’m not buying another Ubisoft or EA game. Not now, not ever. What’s the point of owning their games if I can’t trust them to work a year down the line? Why should I invest my money in companies that clearly don’t care about their customers once they’ve made the sale?

And I know I’m not alone in this.

* Have you had your games just stop working randomly?
* How do you deal with DRM, launcher issues, and server reliance?
* Do you feel like these companies are prioritizing cash grabs over long-term quality and support?

Honestly, Ubisoft (and EA), get your act together. You’re making incredible games—why are you ruining them with this garbage? You’re alienating loyal customers like me who actually *want* to support you.

I’m fed up, and I’d love to hear from others who’ve been through the same thing. Is it just me, or are these companies actively driving away their fanbase with these problems?

Thanks for reading. I needed to vent.

  
**Edit:** 

Hey everyone, thanks for contributing to this discussion I want to make a few things clear. After reading through the comments it's became apparent that a lot of people haven't experienced the same kind of issues I have in relation to games completely not working. I'd like to say that it was not my belief that this issue was common to many people however in my mind that still does not throw out the other points that I do believe are common issues that have always plagued the gaming landscape, however I felt that specifically Ubisoft and EA tend to have the most issues. 

I understand that I may have upset many people by posting this which was not my intention. It's hard to see this as anything other than rage bait or farming karma since I provided no real solutions to any of the problems I listed. I've also aggravated some people who noticed that this wasn't my own original words and that I used ChatGPT to generate a lot of this content. These are all true and I can not deny them, however despite my shortcomings I still believe in everything I posted here and I hope one day things will change. 

I could have done a better job at putting more effort and time into this post, but at the time I was simply fed up with having the same experience over and over again. I've kept my mouth shut about this and figured it had been beaten to death already, but for some reason I finally felt enough of a push to post about it. 

Even if this hasn't changed any bodies perspectives, I'm glad to see I'm not the only person who's had terrible experiences with these game companies.

pcgaming,Ink. - All that glitters is not gold - Just got its first big update releasing Chapter 3 on Steam!,"Hi! I'm one of the (two) developers of Ink. a colorful roguelike singleplayer/coop adventure, and I just wanted to announce that today our game just got its first big update after the early access launch on Steam. I am still actively developing the game, but everything is in a really solid state currently.

**To make it short, what is Ink. ?**  
Ink. is the story of a little boy named Liam. Liam lives in a small country house with his grandfather. His parents separated some time ago, due to his father's violent behavior. Liam often misses his mother, since she works as a stewardess for an airline. Liam spends his days drawing in a book, the Ink. book that his mother gave him for Christmas some time ago, together with a stuffed cat named Spok, the protagonist of his drawn adventures.

In Ink. you will face various chapters, in which there are many different enemies and bosses to defeat. During your adventure you will collect cards and powers that can synergize with each other creating combinations of unique effects.  
The peculiarity of this game is precisely the ink: the drops that you can collect will be your lifeblood, and the same can be used to strengthen yourself, but putting you at risk, or as a bargaining chip with other characters that you will meet during your adventure.

We've been working on this for almost 3 years now, and there's truly so much to discover in this game, all the details that makes every game unique. I hope you find some time to check it out and let us know your impressions.  
In the future you can expect regular updates of new chapters (there are 9 planned in total, some of them are almost already completed) and many enemies, cards, effects but also original soundtracks and if the interest is high even a cartoon for the intro (it costs a lot to do this, unfortunately).

Thank you for your attention, I'll leave you with some links:

pcgaming,Why does Uplay still suck so bad? ,"I have to vent.... I've just tried to replay Far Cry 5 because I'm in a nostalgic mood, but Uplay is just utter garbage - no better still: It aspires to be garbage because now it's rat feces and pestilense. It's probably the worst piece of software I've ever had on my PC including viruses.

1. Start Uplay. Nothing happens so you try again. This time a popup comes with a request for Uplay to make changes to your disk. I say yes - even though I know the futility of this since I've said yes about a billion times now, and whaddayaknow...
2. Another popup with the same request. This repeats about 5 times before the launcher starts and then says it needs to update. I catch myself thinking that maybe the update will fix the trash program before I remember that it's Uplay and there will be peace in the Middle East before this trash is fixed.
3. Uplay has been updated and restarts with a popup requesting to make changes to disk. Repeats 3 times.
4. Now finally it starts up and greets me with.... a login screen. I've only saved my username and password about a trillion times, but no, I need to manually enter it again.
5. I'm now enraged. It's been maybe 5-7 minutes in Uplay-hell and I just want to.... meet whoever made this hellish and evil malfunctioning piece of raw sewage!'

If you've played Pirates!, I would love to hear what your favorite features were in it.","I was thinking about new game ideas and somehow I always kept going back to nostalgic memories of playing Sid Meier's Pirates! I feel like there hasn't been a similar game since, so why not make my own and try to scratch that same itch?

I'm trying to strike a good balance between making my game unique (for example my game will have a focus on deep ship customization by letting the player have full control over what kind of weapons &amp; equipment the ship has and where they are placed) and still scratching that nostalgic Pirates! itch. To help with this, I would love to hear what you enjoy the most in Pirates! Hopefully I can add those features/aspects to my game also.

If you are interested in the project, I just opened a Steam page for it:

*I hope we managed to surprise some of you with a new combination of mechanics.*

**A bit of narrative that is implied:**

Imagine that you defeated a very dangerous enemy - elite techno-zombies, tore out his heart and absorbed it. As a result, you got a mutation. Which one? - You don't know in advance, but now it's part of your deckbuilding.

By the way, you can get several mutations in one run.

pcgaming,How Indiana Jones Proves That Game Engines Don't Matter,"I have been vocal about this topic a few times before, that a game engine inherently does not decide how a game performs, looks or feels to play.

People praise IdTech for being ""Optimized"", Source &amp; Source 2 for how it feels smooth and fluid, but criticise Unreal Engine for how every game that seems to be made with it runs poorly.

Let me try to explain the point one last time, a game engine is just a tool, it's up to you how to use it, and wether it will be used properly is also dependant on your skills, or the time you have, or what type of game you are making, what type of environment a game has, what kind of artistic, narrative or design decisions were made.

Case in point, Doom Eternal, which gets endless praise for running so well, is a fully linear game, with almost no dynamic environment elements, only enemies, projectiles and some objects are movable, this allows the developers to precalculate or ""bake"" all lighting information before hand, reducing computational load.

Although we are yet to see the true nature of Indiana Jones game design, we can already assume that due to certain reasons, the devs realized that baked lighting would not work, thus necessitating some sort of dynamic lighting system, like UE5's Lumen, also using higher res textures and models, making the requirements to run it steep.

To address the point about why Unreal Engine games always turn out poorly optimized, it's simply because it's the most widely used tool, and simply due to that, there will be a higher probability that some devs for whatever reason did not put in the time to make proper decisions and did not properly optimize the game. Batman Arkham Knight is a prime example, as bad as the game ran at launch, it was fixed, and now runs and looks fantastic despite being from the same time as Doom 2016. I can guarantee that if IdTech was used by more developers, we would quickly realize that it's not the silver bullet we thought of.",Danyaal_Majid,1h70dmv,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h70dmv/how_indiana_jones_proves_that_game_engines_dont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h70dmv/how_indiana_jones_proves_that_game_engines_dont/,2024-12-05 04:04:09,0,0.22,0,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h70dmv

One key per person (except for Remnant which includes DLC). NO DUPLICATE POSTS, I will be checking. I will distribute the keys via **Reddit messages** after 24 hours of this post being live. Please know how to access your messages in Reddit, as people love to say I haven't given them the key because they don't know the difference between Reddit messages and Reddit chat. 

Best of luck! This will be my last giveaway for 2024, but I have some additional keys ready for next year.

pcgaming,Pathfinder: Wraith of the Righteous Could Be My Next Dragon Age: Origins ,"## Background

Apart from the Mass Effect Trilogy and Fallout games, Dragon Age: Origins is my all-time favorite CRPG-ish title. I could never get that experience again, even with Dragon Age II, or Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Being in my late 30s, and having difficulty finding time to play videogames, I've been pushing myself to play those shorter experiences like Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch, even though I somehow managed to finish the Metro Trilogy recently, and that says something about that series.

But, there's always that itch for an immersive RPG experience.

## My Requirements for The Ideal RPG (across sub-genres)

1. Good story
2. Party-based gameplay (Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Origins have spoilt me)
3. Choices should matter
4. Voice-acted dialogues
5. Shouldn't take an eternity to complete the main quest (adult/parent gamer)
6. Should be able to motivate me to keep playing till the end

Basically, the game should hook me in during my play session so that I return to play it before real life pulls me away until I forget the plot, characters, controls, etc. I've lost interest in several very good games just due to this.

## What Didn't Work (along with reasons)

### Divinity Original Sin

- I could not connect to the story, probably due to being my first Divinity game
- Restricted camera movement felt awkward

### Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2 (Enhanced Editions)

I picked these up after tens (if not hundreds) of positive reviews.

- As much as I liked the original and could appreciate it, I found it hard to push myself past the aged graphics and gameplay style.

### Pillars of Eternity

Amazing story, execution, etc. making it feel like a modern Baldur's Gate

- Too much reading
- No camera movement
- Something was missing!

### Wasteland 3

Was a natural choice given how much I liked Wasteland 2

- Dark plot (darker than I can take)
- Too much gore for my taste
- Visuals were not as good
- Buggy experience
- I messed up a major choice after hours into the game, and didn't feel like continuing or starting over

### Divinity Original Sin 2

- Overwhelming interactions and conversations right during the start of the game
- Felt lost till the time I met all the companions after the intro mission on the ship

### Pathfinder: Kingmaker

An interesting start to the game, and felt well-made

- Too much reading
- Lost interest

### Baldur's Gate 3

Feels like a perfect game, but this one's expensive!

## Evaluating with Steam Deck Recently

I've had a preference for the Steam Controller against keyboard+mouse due to my Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and have recently been trying to move some of my gaming to the Steam Deck. I did not evaluate the above-mentioned games with the Steam Deck except Wasteland 3 which felt unnatural.

### Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire

Seemed very close to what I was looking for

Pros:
- Great gameplay
- Decent scaling on the Steam Deck
- Deep mechanics

Cons:
- No camera movement
- Unclear controls on Steam Deck, had to guess a lot
- Overall, felt more suitable with mouse+keyboard

### Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Seemed exactly what I was looking for!

Pros:
- Love the audio and soundtrack
- Native support for Steam Deck controls
- All controls are ""right there"" and feel natural
- A lot of voice-acting
- Camera rotation!

Cons:
- HowLongToBeat reports the gameplay hours to be way more than what I can afford

## Conclusion

Given my requirements, expectations, and time limitations, mostly around being able to spend enough time and focus on these huge games, it makes this pretty much impossible to find something that works for me.

If at all I could play something from what I mentioned, it may only be one unlike what I see on other posts where people beat these lengthy games multiple times, getting all the achievements, and then moving to other titles.

With that being said, and with all my research and experience, I'm settling with Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous on the Steam Deck until I can afford (or justify spending on) Baldur's Gate 3.

I haven't started a real playthrough yet, but I'm happy to hear your thoughts!",myTerminal_,1h6lv3u,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6lv3u/pathfinder_wraith_of_the_righteous_could_be_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6lv3u/pathfinder_wraith_of_the_righteous_could_be_my/,2024-12-04 17:33:37,0,0.31,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6lv3u

I'd even go so far and say that I vastly prefer this game over most 2D FF games?! Combat is great, NES graphics and sounds are VERY charming and authentic, the writing is witty and the game comes with all of the more modern features that just save time (f.e. no random battles, enemies are visible on the map).

pcgaming,"Announcing ""Do No Harm"" - A Lovecraftian ""Papers, Please""-like Medical Simulator","Earlier this year we decided to make a game that would be about a Spooky Doctor in a Spooky Town. I just got verified, so I wanted to share with gamers in here. If you like *Papers, Please* or *Strange Horticulture*, I think you'll like my game too!  
  
*Do No Harm* is a Lovecraftian medical simulator where you play as a 19th-century doctor using Galenic medicine (think Four Humours theory) to heal patients on an eerie island village.

* Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do\_No\_Harm/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming)
* YouTube: [https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE](https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE)

The gameplay revolves around patients coming to you with symptoms—some they’ll describe, while others you’ll notice visually or diagnose using tools. You’ll consult your Book of Medicine, which offers hints and narrows down potential treatments, but ultimately, you’ll need to experiment with different medicines to see what works. Sometimes, your patients get better; other times… they don’t make it.

All the while, a Lovecraftian story unfolds in the background, mixed with eerie events and subtle resource management elements.

**What makes** ***Do No Harm*** **unique?**

* **Doctor Simulator with Galenic Medicine**: Immerse yourself in medieval medical practices as you analyze symptoms and treat patients.
* **A Lovecraftian Twist**: Unravel a chilling narrative where reality blurs and cosmic horrors creep into your everyday life.
* **Moral Choices**: In this cultist ridden island village, you'll have to decide whom to trust, heal or maybe even kill. Each choice leads to a different ending.

If you’re intrigued, you can [Wishlist the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming) to support us and stay updated on its release.

* Bite-sized – explore the map, expand your cities, mine for crystals, and defend against the demons, in 5-minute levels that fit into your lunch break.
* Accessible – *Flocking Hell* features simple design, making it easy to learn but challenging to master.
* Low-stress – focus on discovery and growth. The demons will not interrupt until the level is done, at which point you can grab the popcorn and watch the outcome of your work.
* Customize your strategy – draft your deck from over 100 cards and recruit a team of guides from over 40 options, making each run different.
* Endless replayability – each run is unique, with a variety of demons to oppose you and a different mini-challenge in every level.
* Whimsical yet sinister – the world of *Flocking Hell* is full of cuddly sheep and magical cottages. Even the demons are adorable, at least until they start munching on lamb chops …

pcgaming,"BOWLOUT: A wacky first-person bowling shooter by 2 indie devs | Releases on Steam January 7th, 2025","Hi PCGaming! Next year a friend and I will release our first ever game on Steam, and we would like to share it with as many people as possible!

* Release date trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9\_\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9__U)

As you'll see in the attached trailer video, in BOWLOUT you'll throw lots of bowling balls or use pins as weapons to proceed through a pin-infested bowling centre and eliminate the source of the attack. It's a relatively short game with a simple gameplay loop - perfect to blow off some steam without getting attached to a long story. There's also achievements, unlockable ball colors and controller support!

Hopefully you'll enjoy this trailer and share/wishlist the game - it helps us with the algorithm, increasing the chances of the fabled 'front page' slot! If you have any questions about the game or would like to create content/articles on it, I would gladly help! Comment here or message me directly.

pcgaming,"Star Wars Outlaws - Some really good bones, but I have to put it down for a while.","Weird crashing and broken saves, along with some strange tech hiccups.

Bought the game for $25 so I’m not upset, they just need to do a lot more patching.

Overall, I really like the game. 

As a Star Wars guy, the open world is pretty amazing, and REALY stunning to look at.

The faction system is great. The blaster combat is fine and the stealth kind of sucks.

I’m even starting to like the story; I think they’ve nailed the “Outlaw” aspect of the characters and numerous interactions and choices the game presents.

Looking forward to returning to it once everything gets patched up a bit more.

pcgaming,"Star Wars Jedi Survivor &amp; Fallen Order are still broken on PC, do not let the dark side tempt you with sales","In light of the all the sales now til the end of the year, here's a little reminder or notice if you're unfamiliar:

Jedi Survivor and Fallen Order infamously suffer from shader and traversal stutters. These occur on *every* PC, regardless of hardware or whether you're able to notice them. There are other bugs too, like white flashing when turning corners/the camera, flickering lights, and even basic things like menu settings not engaging. Is DLSS on or is your PC just that bad? Who knows! 

To get you caught up, here's Digital Foundry's analysis of the most recent [Jedi Survivor Patch 9 - Improved but still very poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw) by Alex Battaglia, preeminent expert on PC game performance and leader in the #StutterStruggle. 

So, while Patch 9 improved shader comp and shader stutter, **both Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor *still* to this day suffer from shader compilation and travel stutter.** **Everyone** on PC will encounter several types of stuttering, *regardless of how good the hardware.* There's also **[animation stutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw&amp;t=573)**, which affects camera movement and character animations. A triple threat stutterer!

I can also vouch that the issues occur on the current fastest CPU for gaming, the 9800x3D, which I use OC'd to 5.7Ghz and run with 48gb DDR5-8000 CL40 EXPO, Crosshair X870 Hero, and RTX 4090; all stability tested &gt;24hrs, latest drivers, no issues like this with any other games that aren't also known and common.

Oh, and [even the PS5 Pro version of Survivor is having issues right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8?si=wYfe9swwp0dpR98K). EA is aware and investigating, patch is assumed/confirmed to come soon, but it's just another example of their poor standards.

I don't think it's appropriate to continue rewarding EA's and Respawn's repeated lack of respect for paying customers by spending more money or playtime on these lackluster products. Just means they will continue to reward you with the same or lower standards next time. If as many of us as possible opt not to purchase them, even at a steep discount, they might find our collective lack of faith disturbing enough to fix these issues in the next game, if not the previous.",FractaLTacticS,1h4gog6,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,2024-12-01 23:22:05,1077,0.76,1077,0,410,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4gog6

pcgaming,"Introducing my chill, story-driven survival-crafting game, AETHUS.","Hey PC gamers!

I wanted to introduce my solo-dev project, a sci-fi survival-crafter/base-builder, [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming).

**[Check out the trailer here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwB0r5f6T80)**

**AETHUS is a story-driven survival game, meaning there's always a narrative-driven reason to go on your next expedition into the underground open world!** 

You'll mine and gather resources in a physics-driven world rendered with Lumen and Nanite in UE5, while building up your mining outpost on the surface with easy to use yet extremely powerful building and decoration tools.

I've spent a lot of time making these tools as simple to use as possible and the whole game is **packed with quality-of-life features** like building/crafting/cooking from storage automatically, the ability to disable collisions when building so you can position things JUST right, and much more.

I left my AAA job after 7 years in the industry back in 2023 to go indie on my own and make this game, with **no AAA bullshit** - no AI, no microtransactions or cosmetics, no predatory development, no releasing a half-done bug-filled product in Early Access, just good old-fashioned gamedev.

[I'd love to get your thoughts on the game, so there's a demo you can try out right now on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming)

A [Wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming) would be super appreciated if you like the look of the game, single every one helps a solo indie dev like me!

It is made by 1c, a studio based in Moscow. This is one thing that would make me hesitate buying the game, and apparently their CEO is close with russian government. Is this something that would impact your decision to buy a game? Of course I understand the CEO does not represent the whole company and that it is noteasy to really oppose the government in a country like Russia

pcgaming,Anyone out there still like written video game reviews/articles?,"Just curious if anyone out there still enjoys reading video game articles/reviews? Like - oldschool style - longform text + screenshots.

I myself tend to just skim down to the review score (not that these really mean much these days in the world of sponsored reviews) - but once upon a time, I used to really enjoy a good, longform review.

I myself wrote them freelance for a while, for a local gaming site and the small amount of money I made from it coupled with review copies of various games was always pretty exciting.

But I've been thinking a lot lately - possibly because I'm getting on in age these days, if anyone actually reads the reviews / articles rather than just skim them? Reading for the enjoyment of reading.

* Be detailed! If you're looking for a roguelike, say that. If your game must include zombies, you should probably mention that. The more detailed you are the better the recommendations will be.
* Are you limited by PC specifications or a budget? That's all good stuff to include.

pcgaming,Are classic games overrated?,"TLDR: are older games getting an advantage in rating because there were fewer games back then?

I’ve been thinking about this from time to time. There are good and solid games now for sure but a common consensus is that old games were made with more passion, with more focus on it being fun instead of selling well, with simpler but more fun design, thus resulting in being just, better. However a good analogy would be being seated at a table with almost everything you can think of, then you get to be more picky about which food tastes good. The same food that you hate right now may be the best tasting thing if you’re stuck in a desert for several days. It may not be that extreme but the point is, our perception can sometimes be influenced by the context and become deceiving/subjective.

From another angle, almost everything in game developing is considerably complex and requires years of experience to master (things like level designs, quests, gameplay, character progression, story, sound, what have you). How can it get worse over time? If you put me 20 years back I definitely wouldn’t predict that the games are going to become worse in the future right? It is true that with the inflated economy, increasing competition, developer/publisher separation, things can get complicated and out of control, still I would have thought things will become better in general.

I’m currently still in school so I wanted to wait to get a full on pc until after I graduated so I wouldn’t have to transport it as much. I’ve been getting a lot of emails from Best Buy about their Black Friday deals and they have some nice pcs for not too bad of a price so I just wanted to see if anyone had some input on whether I should just go for it now or maybe wait until next Black Friday when I’m graduated? It’s probably just a preference thing anyway but I’m just curious if anyone’s had some similar thought processes :) thanks!",haykay417,1h0wvmm,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h0wvmm/get_a_pc_now_or_later/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h0wvmm/get_a_pc_now_or_later/,2024-11-27 05:16:40,0,0.17,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h0wvmm
pcgaming,"Windows 11 - turn ""Automatic Colour Management"" off","!!!This only tip works if you have a screen that is able to display colours beyond the sRGB range - those are 10+ bit IPS/OLED panels.

Simply go to display -&gt; Color and you'll see it as the toggable setting. Switch it off and all colours will look a bit more vibrant.

You can test this by looking at an image of something bright and red - such as a fire hydrant. The image will be a bit more vivid with ACM off.

What ACM essentially does is, it analyses the display's native Color profile and tone-maps the image sent to the display in such a way as to ""emulate"" the sRBG colour space in an attempt to ""trick"" the display - that is by compressing the brightest and darkest colors, and by reducing Color vibrancy to fit the standard colour range for internet pages, etc. This would be great if the monitor itself weren't doing a double-conversion back into its native Color space unless it's specifically set to ""sRGB mode"" in its OSD menu - and as you'll quickly notice sRBG mode just looks bad.

pcgaming,BACKROOMS 0 - Announcement Trailer - A psychological horror walking simulator set in an abandoned office complex. No monsters. No jumpscares.,"Hello everyone,

I've been working on creating a **psychological horror game that focuses purely on atmosphere** \- a vast abandoned office complex with repeating yellow corridors, humming fluorescent lights, and your camcorder. This is my take on the Backrooms.

The Backrooms represents one of the internet's most fascinating horror concepts - **a vast maze of empty office rooms** that exists just outside our reality, where people can accidentally 'noclip' into and find themselves trapped. Something about these empty spaces gets under everyone's skin.

**No monsters, no jumpscares** \- just pure environmental horror where the very absence of threat becomes unsettling. The game creates tension through architecture, sound design, and the feeling of being lost in a vast abandoned building.

[Watch the Announcement Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpZZE41i4U)

pcgaming,Has gaming gotten less social?,"Has gaming gotten less social?

I remember playing games like Halo, COD and other online games. There would always be people in game chat and you’d talk crap, make friends etc.

These days when playing multiplayer games, lobbies are dead quiet. Add to the fact that with things like SBMM lobbies pretty much always disbanded after every match so there’s less opportunity for online games to be social.

Though when I started to notice this, it was around the time that I moved over to PC from console. So does anyone else think games have gotten less social? Or is it possibly the difference in platform? As in could it be that most people on PC are just using discord and don’t use the in game chat?

pcgaming,Thoughts on a completely new Game of Thrones game? ,"So I’m a massive fan of game of thrones series but overall dragons are so cool to me. Now there are many dragon games like Day of Dragons, ARK and so on. But I think we need a massive open world game where we have a detailed campaign as long as a coop/multiplayer.  Ability to find dragon eggs around the map and then waiting for them to hatch and train the dragon and so on. Have the ability to ride the dragon and just fly around in a detailed and nice open world 🌍.  Now ik there is a game of thrones game but tbh I hate it and it’s not good.  Need a modern graphic game made 🔥🔥

Would be cool to even have game of thrones dragons in the game as well, even house of dragons as well.

pcgaming,"To the older crowd, how do you guys go about making friends in games now a days?","I come from the days of community servers on CS, TFC and TF2. These guys, youd find a group you thought you might like and played with 30 people every night and eventually made friends, but over the years my friends list has grown to a couple hundred but has dwindled down to just a few who actually want to play. Some have died, some have grown apart, some dont play multiplayer games much, some quit playing all together. I miss those days though, made a lot of good friends over the years. 

However most games now a days are matchmaking, you see some guys once for 30 - 40 mins and thats it.

I play a lot of games with matchmaking like deadlock, valorant, apex, etc... Ive seen people make friends on these games and Ive tried, but very rarely does it turn into anything. Most people will only add you if youre good at the game. Since I only have good games every now and then, they quit being interested in playing after losing the next few. Anybody experience making friends in matchmaking?

pcgaming,I'm very impressed with how good remote play has become,"When Resident Evil 7 came out, I bought a Steam Link with the plans to stream it to a TV and despite the PC being 10ft line-of-sight from router, and then the router 6ft wired to the Steam Link, it was a nonstarter and I shelved the Steam Link. It could not maintain any smoothness at all, and it was a crashfest.

I revisited remote play with the Deck and I was surprised how consistent it could be. Pulling out my Steam Link again, I set it up in the living room and honestly? Not as good as a couple feet from my PC monitor, but 12ft back on a couch looks great besides some loss of dynamic range. And this is with a good 40ft, a floor, and a concrete wall between Link and router.

I beat a few games this year this way and I had a great time. No noise from fans, no worry about thermals, I can even use a lower resolution because I'm not so close to the display that it would matter = better performance. Besides sometimes a connection being lost and needing to manually reconnect to the session, I've had zero issues.

pcgaming,"[Blackwell Update] Historical analysis of NVIDIA GPUs relative performance, core count and die sizes across product classes and generations","Hello there!

Some 9 months ago I posted here and in some other subs about some discoveries and overall analysis I did over NVIDIA GPUs and their performance and core count across their generations (from Maxwell 2.0 (9xx) up to Ada (4xxx)). You can check out the complete comprehensive original post [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1b0ln9d/historical_analysis_of_nvidia_gpus_relative/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). It gained a fair bit of traction back then.

&amp;#x200B;

With the new leaks and rumors (sources below, not unfounded), I just grabbed the rumored SM/CUDA core count for the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and 5070 cards and plotted them against the previous generations up until Maxwell 2.0.

If you haven't read the original post, here's what matters to understand this chart:

* The X-axis in the chart (named ""Generation Name"") plots all released, rumored to release (4090 Ti, back when Ada wasn't EOL) and the new leaked Blackwell (marked with two asterisks) GPU SKUs for each generation.
* The Y-axis in the chart plots each of these cards according to the maximum CUDA core amount possible for each generation. This maximum value is derived by the most powerful GPU die each generation. Quoting from the original post: in Pascal (GTX 10 series), the TITAN Xp is the fully enabled top die (GP102), with 3840 CUDA cores, so it is at 100% relative core count. In the other hand, the 1060 6GB (GP106) has 1280 CUDA cores, which is exactly 33.3% as many cores as the TITAN Xp, thus, it has 33% relative core count.

Effectively, this means that when buying a 1060GB you're getting 33% of the most powerful GPU compute technology available at the time for the gaming cards (considering how advanced the manufacturing, nodes and processes were available at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

The results speak for themselves. I'll leave you with the initial chart and I'll give some insight afterwards:

[(Can't post images directly in this subreddit, here's a link)](https://i.imgur.com/B4sqraS.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The results are... depressing? I've sourced the data from leaked, but not unfounded information from minimally reputable sources such as [VideoCardz](https://videocardz.com/newz/geforce-rtx-5090-5080-5070ti-and-5070-to-launch-in-q1-rtx-5070-expected-to-feature-6400-cores) and [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/?generation=GeForce+50&amp;sort=generation). Let's dive into some thoughts:

* For Ada, the fully unlocked AD102 die never released (I put a fake 4090 Ti in the charts in both posts to give some perspective), but yeah. The 4090 was cut down to \~89% of the full AD102, and the full leaks suggest that the 5090 might also be \~88.5% of the full GB202. Seems fair and leaves room for a TITAN BLACKWELL or 5090 Ti, which might or might not release. **I don't see competition from AMD so I find it difficult to believe in a 5090 Ti**. That die makes more money as an AI card.
* In my original post I highlighted the **MASSIVE** abyss between the 4090 core count and the 4080/4080S core count. Never did we get such a small fraction of the top die for so much money. The base 4080 had 52.8% of the cores of the full AD102 die, and the 4080S had 55.6%. For comparison, in Ampere (RTX 3xxx), the 3080 had 81% of the cores of the full die used in the 3090 Ti. In all honesty, that was an outlier, because the trend up until then (Maxwell 2.0, Pascal and Turing) all had their xx80 cards hovering at the 66.6% relative core count. Well... If you thought that the gap between 4080 and 4090 was massive, **then the rumored gap between 5080 and 5090 is EVEN LARGER. The 5080 is rumored to have 10752 cores, which is only 43.8% of the cores of the top die.** This puts the 5080 at the same ""cut down level"", or to say, it is as cut down as a 4070 Ti was when compared to its top die. **If we go back to Ampere, the 5080 is as cut down as a 3060 Ti was compared to the top Ampere die (!!!!!).**
* **The 5070 Ti has 36.5% of the cores of the top Blackwell die.** In past generations, getting roughly 33-36% of the top die was something that the 960 (33.3%), 1060 6GB (also 33.3%) and 3060 (also 33.3%) cards achieved. **This means that the 5070 Ti is almost as cut down as previous generations xx60 cards.**
* **The RTX 5070 is 26% of the full die**, putting it in the range of previous generations RTX 4060 Ti (which was already a big disappointment as per my original post, at 23.6% of its top die) and brace for it... **the 5070 seems to be almost as cut down as an RTX 3050 (23.8%).**

&amp;#x200B;

So, it seems despite the newer generations increasing the total amount of raw CUDA cores that are possible to manufacture and put on a chip, we're getting less and less of a fraction of these node/tech advancements.

Here's the chart with some guiding lines to try and show some trend. I've been liberal in placing xx80 Ti cards as replacement for xx90 cards in past generations because there never was a 990, 1090 or 2090 card, despite there being TITANs, they would be the modern equivalent of a xx90 Ti. In case there are base and SUPER versions of the same card, I tried putting the trendline in the middle between them.

[(trendline chart)](https://i.imgur.com/ToFA2Nm.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Unless Blackwell proves to be a revolutionary architecture generation (difficult, it is on the same node as Ada), then I can see really meh performance gains for the lower end. Pricing will dictate everything, and also, consumer feedback. We actually do have SOME power (remember the unreleased 4080 12GB?) in regards to product segmentation!

I'll update these charts with the Relative Performance database once these cards are out as TechPowerUp provides raw data.

pcgaming,I don’t understand the philosophy justifying pirating games,"Whenever I have a discussion about why people pirate games it always comes down to “pirating games has no effect on the games sales!” And “it’s ok because the company is rich and I’m not!”

But isn’t this fundamentally flawed? 

Like, if everyone pirated games then the gaming industry would literally cease to exist. There would be no money in it at all. 

So these thieves are only getting by because there are honest people who purchase their games.

pcgaming,Stop Destroying Games plans to eliminate digital planned obsolescence and bolster consumer rights,"There's a European Citizens' Initiative going around to stop publishers from intentionally bricking video games they have already sold to customers, a practice that may well violate EU consumer law. If passed by gaining 1 million EU signatures before July 31, it would address the legally untested practice of whether publishers can design games and digital content so that they can expire after an arbitrary length of time. This would also act as a bolster for digital consumer rights and ownership and stop online-only dependency spreading to other industries (extra citations)

pcgaming,hogwarts legacy is actually REALLY good,"honestly, this is one of those games that i see in the store, think ""oh cool, looks like a nice game to play"", and then after playing it i start to realize ""HOLY SHIT, this is actually a REALLY REALLY good game, wow. holy fuck""

there's many reasons why it's such a good game in my opinion

first of all, if you like harry potter and wizardry/magic themed stuff, you will definitely like this game

you essentially get to create your own character and name them, this is your avatar that you play with throughout the game

then you find yourself enrolled as a student in hogwarts

yes, you are a wizard that is attending the school of hogwarts, to fine tune your skills in wizardry

part of the challenge of the game is that you SHOULD be a good student

if you want to be a reckless student that fucks off in the back of the class, doesn't learn anything, causes trouble, you can certainly play the game that way

but if you want to actually learn something, then you should be a good student

you should go to class, listen to the professors, etc

once you're no longer in class, you have the opportunity to do other quests. either within the castle of hogwarts or outside of the castle

that's another thing, hogwarts is very BIG, so just walking through the halls of the castle makes you feel like an important student of wizardry

you also get to see other students walking through the halls as well, talking and discussing about unimportant matters or what have you

you as a higher level student have more important matters to attend to so you go about your business accordingly

you also develop a bond with your professors and get to know them well

in particular, the herbology professor is very nice. she reminds me of some of my professors i had when i was in university in real life

she is a very nice lady that teaches you very good information on herbology

for you to cross these professors and make them disappointed in you would be very bad. it depends though, at least for me i find the herbology professor to be a very nice professor, so i wouldn't want her to be disappointed with me as a student

overall the point i'm trying to make is that the way i like to play the game is i take my magic studies seriously

the world is very whacky, all sorts of things can happen. it's the harry potter world, so people can make objects disappear, there are spells that set you on fire, cause you to fly, and cause objects to phase into and out of existence

this is a very incredible world that you are in and you have to be aware of the different things that can go wrong or go in your favor as you are exploring and doing quests

in short, there is really a lot to do in this game

hogwarts is huge, there's always new things you will run into as you are walking through the halls

i will say that this is a pretty good game

once i graduate from hogwarts i will feel very satisfied

another thing i like to do is dress for the occasion

so if i'm attending classes for the day i make sure my clothing is a proper school cloak and uniform

once class is over for the day and i am exploring outside of the castle or going to Hogsmeade, i change into more casual attire, maybe even put on a sorcerer's hat

it's all about dressing for the proper environment

you wouldn't go to class in real life wearing a trench coat and a top hat would you? probably not. so why would you do that in this game? exactly, that's how you should think about it

and one last thing i will say is that if this game were possible to play in a full dive virtual reality setting, it would be pretty epic

walking outside the castle really produces some cool sights that would pretty epic to see if you were physically standing there

it would be a scary situation though, given that in a world like that, someone could cause you to vanish into thin air or light you on fire with magic

just something to think about",nervomelbye,1gxkybx,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gxkybx/hogwarts_legacy_is_actually_really_good/,2024-11-22 23:02:01,0,0.28,0,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gxkybx

**Tips to get the best suggestions**

* Be detailed! If you're looking for a roguelike, say that. If your game must include zombies, you should probably mention that. The more detailed you are the better the recommendations will be.
* Are you limited by PC specifications or a budget? That's all good stuff to include.

pcgaming,"Beloved games by fans, not by critics ","I want to see a discussion about which games are beloved by the fans of a game, but perhaps seen as underrated, or just not loved by so many (hidden gem/ very niche).

A few examples could be Outer Wilds, Valheim, Deadly Premonition, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Heavy Rain and Old School RuneScape. Some people swear they are the best games ever. Or at least amongst their favorite games. 

Please provide better examples.

I'm guess I just think that I've somehow gotten impossibly high standards and see anything less than Overwhelmingly Positive as a ""shit"" game in my mind.

pcgaming,So how did Quantic Dream create the amazing character models in Detroit?,"Probably the only game that has gotten closest to realism as far as character designs go.

Senua's Saga looked good but it still looked akward at times especially the expressions.

Tiny facial movements and emotions can actually be read in the game and I find it truly remarkable that the developers are able to render all of that in real time. 

Is it because of the linearity?

I was thinking why can't every dev go with the same design when it comes to rendering human characters.

Pretty amazing what they did with the game.

pcgaming,Handheld gaming PC comparison table I made to compare Steam Deck and 35+ alternatives on their specs and features,"Hi, I did a deep dive into handheld gaming PC's, and created a pretty comprehensive comparison table that I hope some of you might find useful:

[https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/)

It's got every handheld gaming PC available right now (that I could find), and allows you to compare all of them on their specifications and features; from display specs, CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD, built in sensors, connectivity, ports, battery, available buttons and inputs, physical specs like size/weight/available colors, and more.

There's options to filter the table on specs or features, too. So you can for instance filter on screen size, resolution, refresh rate, whether it's got a trackpad, gyro controls, detachable controllers, or a built-in keyboard, etc.

You can also sort columns. So for instance, to easily find the cheapest handheld that has the specs you're filtering for, you can sort the table on the price (MSRP) column.

Also, if you want to compare aby two models side-by-side, there's a separate tool available for that. So for instance, if you want to compare the Zotac Zone vs the Asus ROG Ally X: [https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs](https://comparisontabl.es/handheld-gaming-pc/?product1=Zotac+Zone&amp;product2=Asus+ROG+Ally+X#sbs) \- and you can use the checkbox for 'Differences only' to only show the specs/features with differences.

Other than that, I've made sure to apply conditional formatting to most specs, to make it visually clear what the pros and cons of each model are.

There's also a size comparison image of some of the most popular options if you scroll past the table.

Let me know if you have any feedback! It's totally possible I've made a mistake somewhere, or missed a product or spec that could be interesting to add. I'm considering adding benchmarks to the table as well, but am not sure which ones would be best to use in this case - and if there's data for all or most of these handhelds? If anyone has thoughts on that, let me know!",CookieDelivery,1gv5y1x,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gv5y1x/handheld_gaming_pc_comparison_table_i_made_to/,2024-11-19 19:41:27,127,0.91,127,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gv5y1x

pcgaming,"Valve Developer Greg Coomer Retires After 27 Years, Leaving Behind a Legacy","Looks like he actually retired back in January 2024 based on his [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregcoomer/)and what his acquittances are saying, but nobody really noticed until now.

Here are some things you might not know about Greg Coomer.

* He worked with Gabe Newell at Microsoft before joining Valve in 1997 as one of its first employees.
* He helped to name the company Valve, designed the company's website. He also was one of the people who worked on the legendary Valve intro for Half-Life and beyond.
* His [face](https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Greg_Coomer#/media/File:Greg_coomer.jpg) was one of several that designers used as a reference for Gordon Freeman’s model. 
* Coomer worked on every single Half-Life title as a game designer and/or art director.
* You can see his surname in the [Half-Life Locker room](https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/kzz0tl/hmmm_is_that_why_hes_always_in_the_bathroom/).
* He did the HL2 tech demo [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ddJ1OKV63Q&amp;t=491s&amp;ab_channel=muffinhunter).
* He was one of the designers for both Steam Machine, and Steam Deck. 

While Gabe Newell is a prominent figure, it's crucial to remember that Valve is built by a team of incredibly talented individuals who deserve just as much credit for shaping the gaming world.

pcgaming,Detroit: Become Human on PC,"Just bought it at $11.99 and I have to say it's quite a steal.

The short episode format is perfect and it definitely promotes replayability.

The acting and character renders are one of the best I've seen in a video game.

Visuals are stunning at 4k with the image resolution doubled (so basically 8k?).

Performance is pretty steady keeping the framerates close to 60fps most of the time.

It's like playing an interactive dystopian scifi novel.

No wonder the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews.

I kind of find a sense of fulfillment when missing on these types of games and eventually finding it.

Just wanted to share and I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

When I saw the announcement last week that ""Episode 1 and 2 are now included with the base game on Steam"" I thought - what the hell? Wasn't it like this the whole time? 

No. HL2 is standalone, and Episode 1 and 2 are extra content.

I legit thought for nearly 15 years that Episode 1 was the first segment of the game, kinda like Life is Strange or other episodic games, and when you buy HL2 on Steam you get all the episodes released. I thought it was the reason people were pissed about Episode 3, because the game was never actually finished.

pcgaming,8 Years on and 0 lessons learned. Another swing and a miss for Frontier with Planet Coaster 2 - and barely anyone is talking about the broken state of the game.,"Frontier has once again excelled at creating a pretty Sandbox. Unfortunately, there's supposed to be a Theme-Park management game behind this and it's hard to believe that they learned zero lessons from their failures with Planet Coaster back in 2016.  

With a meaty update coming in December that promises to fix only some of the most egregious concerns, I really can't see how this game will maintain any kind of longevity, but with that little preamble let's start tearing apart this carcass for the juicy, gossipy flesh.  

---  

**As a game, it is completely and utterly broken.** We all know these games, right? Put rides down, put shops down, connect them all together with paths and scenery to balance your guests needs and hire a roster of staff to keep everything running. A simple enough premise.  

Planet Coaster 2 falls completely flat on its face. Both the guest *and* staff systems are utterly broken, but scandalously, they work *just well enough* to pass the sniff test with the Play Testers &amp; reviewers before release.  

**How is it broken?** You might ask, shall we start with the staff? 

* Rides will degrade less than an hour after placing them.
* Janitors ignore overflowing bins
* Mechanics ignore broken down rides
* Mechanics ignore ride and facilities maintenance 
* Rides degrade *minutes* after placing them down and need maintenance, but the Mechanics are too busy wandering around ""looking for work"".
* Ride operators and shop vendors leave to go on break without waiting for the person who's supposed to relieve them to even show up, suddenly leaving gaps in operations.  

**What about the guests?** The logic for these guys is completely busted. 

* If a coaster has a capacity of 32 guests, when the queue has 31 guests in it, nobody else will queue up, thinking ""That queue is too long"". They will walk up to the queue and do a 180 and walk away.
* Guests will be dying to use a toilet, and walk to the opposite end of the park, even though there's a toilet next to them. 
* If you open the park and place one tiny teacups ride down, it will attract thousands of guests.
* If you have a mix of water park slides and rollercoasters in your park, every guest will flip-flop into all wanting to go on one, or the other. But they'll all buy pool-passes despite not needing them.  
* Guests will drop trash on the floor even if there's an available trash bin nearby.  
* If there's too many rides, guests just won't use pools and flumes at all.  
* Still no guest wandering mechanics. They just move in a straight beeline from A to B.
* Major guest congestion issues. It's not uncommon to see 300 guests all mashing against each other in a mosh-pit  
* They added weather but it appears to be cosmetic and doesn't affect guest riding decisions.  
* They added picnic benches but guests won't sit down and eat. In fact, I've not seen any guests sitting down and eating on anything.  

---  

So yes, you can build rides, spend an hour creating the perfect station, filling in all the scenery, adding shops and weaving paths around. *But the actual, core aspect of the game just doesn't work*. There's no management here, it is just a glorified sandbox with a piss-poor campaign and completely broken staff and guest system.  

Avoid, and even then think twice if/when they fix it, because releasing a game as broken as this should not be rewarded with sales.",Chaoslava,1gu48ts,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gu48ts/8_years_on_and_0_lessons_learned_another_swing/,2024-11-18 13:05:20,447,0.89,447,0,148,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gu48ts

pcgaming,How is no developer making a Bethesda-Equivalent RPG (a la Skyrim) but updated/less buggy/less complacent?,"Skyrim was a great (although flawed) game but it's been so long since it was released that it's incredibly dated, and the intervening releases from Bethesda across its IPs have depleted a lot of the trust in the fan base. So it seems that the first person, sword and magic (or sneak and bow) open world RPG genre would be ripe for competition. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't really see any alternatives in the offing.

Conversely, there seems to be an insane amount of competition in the Soulslike genre (the very name of the genre gives away how many titles have attempted to supplant Fromsoft). Why would you attempt to follow up one of the sharpest developers with an imitation that almost certainly won't measure up to the Souls games or Elden Ring (in my opinion one of the greatest games ever made, and I'm not really a Soulslike fan)? Where's all this effort in the Skyslike arena?

I really just wish there were an updated, cutting edge open world fantasy RPG that would be the next generational timesink, having the added benefit of forcing Bethesda to not just phone it in with their own IPs.",lakadazakal,1gtla4a,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gtla4a/how_is_no_developer_making_a_bethesdaequivalent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gtla4a/how_is_no_developer_making_a_bethesdaequivalent/,2024-11-17 19:20:55,0,0.49,0,0,218,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gtla4a
pcgaming,"Hi folks!  I'm making Kitchen Sync: Aloha!, a cooking strategy RPG, inspired by a mashup of Overcooked and Fire Emblem.  There's a free demo update on Steam for Cooking Fest!","Hi r/pcgaming! I'm the developer for Kitchen Sync: Aloha!, a cozy cooking RPG set in Hawaii.  My game is currently featured in the Steam Cooking Fest with a free demo and wanted to make sure fans of cooking games and quirky strategy games know about it!

Steam Page, Trailer, and Demo: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333930/Kitchen\_Sync\_Aloha/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333930/Kitchen_Sync_Aloha/)

I've always been a fan of cooking games and tactical RPGs, and wanted to try mashing up my favorite parts of each genre.

* 🍳 Take on the role of head chef of your family's pop-up restaurant. Rather than cooking everything yourself, issue orders to your team of chefs in your kitchen.  Deliver food tasty enough to clear your customer's Hunger Points (HP) and satisfy all your guests before running out of time. The game automatically pauses whenever your chefs need direction, giving the game a laid back, turn based tactics feel.
* 🌟 Kitchen planning with strategic depth.  Fine tune your chefs' builds with ability trees and learnable skills, and combine them with specialized menus, kitchen layouts, and team skills to make your restaurant the best around.  Optimize for certain flavors, build in synergies between your chefs, go all in on a powerful special ability, or keep it casual and randomize it all.  It's up to you!
* 💞 Chefs build relationships when paired together - whether or not they're the player's character! Each pairing leads to friendships or even romantic endings, unlocking a ton of unique dialogue scenes, side quests, and special abilities for your favorite characters.  If you're familiar with the support system from Fire Emblem/Unicorn overlord and other tactical RPGs this will feel familiar!
* 🗺️ Master dozens of different kitchen layouts around the Hawaiian Island of Maikai. Beaches, backyards, resorts, malls, and more, each with different challenges.  Like Overcooked or Plate Up, even small changes in layout or menu mean a big difference when efficiently moving around the kitchen and wasting as little time as possible.
* 🐟 Take a break between levels with minigames like fishing and hiking.

Kitchen Sync's demo was previously featured this year in the Wholesome Games Festival, the PixElated Festival, and the Seattle Indie Expo, and player feedback has been incorporated along the way to make the game even better. For this event, the game's gotten an entire UI overhaul and new tutorials to make getting started as easy as possible.

If you're a fan of cooking games and/or strategy RPGs, I'd love for you to give the demo a try and let me know what you think either here or on our discord! Wishlist are also always helpful!

The game will be skipping early access and go straight to a full launch, planned next year.

pcgaming,A way to instantly improve all modern/futuristic open world games,"If your game features driving, give an option for some sort of cruise control/speed limiter. Sometimes I just want to drive around in a low speed and appreciate the world your devs and artists have spent so long to build. This is impossible to do on a keyboard. Even if you're playing with a controller, the trigger buttons are not sensitive enough to keep a stable speed.

pcgaming,Games that need a remaster,"I’ve been playing **Warcraft 1 Remastered** and having a blast. It’s a lot more difficult than I remember (probably because I used cheats all the time as a kid) but being able to select more than four guys at once, change zoom settings (now I can actually see catapults coming!), and the introduction of control groups is a godsend.

It got me thinking: What other old PC games, classic or otherwise, could use a remaster?

Playing this has me thinking that **Dune 2** would be a great game to have a similar remaster. If it was essentially the exact same game but more zoomed out and with control groups and larger selections of units, I’d be totally on board! That music and the “wormsign” sound byte live rent free in my head…

Another more obscure one that I doubt too many will remember or recognize is **Blood and Magic**. It’s a super cool but super slow RTS game with an official DnD license that they took more than a few liberties with. I’d love a remaster that pumps the game speed up and adds similar features to what we received in the Warcraft 1 remaster. It’ll probably never happen though. The game was a commercial failure and doesn’t really even have much of a cult following.

I think **Lord of the Rings: Conquest** would be amazing as well, especially since we got a remaster of Star Wars Battlefront. I would particularly love it on the Switch, split-screen, but since this is a PC gaming sub I’d play the hell out of it on PC as well.

Finally I’d love a near 1:1 remaster of **Master of Magic**. I know there was a recent remake, but when I looked into it I felt like a lot of the personality of the original game was lost. What I *really* want is the exact same game, graphics and music and all, but upscaled and with some quality of life improvements. In my mind the original was a nearly perfect game and even its imbalances were part of its flavour.

pcgaming,Forgotten Valor is an upcoming RPG being released on December 6th!,"Forgotten Valor takes place in 2091 and revolves around a time of war where the nation of Vivica in secret produced mass amounts of weapons that utilize around AI. With this new power, they were able to quickly sweep over the smaller nations of Arcadia along with its neighboring nations.  
  
Within a matter of months, Arcadia falls and becomes a puppet state to the seemingly unstoppable Vivica. With this, camps are built throughout the nation, where mass productions of these AI, formally known as 'Metalgeists', are being created to help pursue the war.

Almost 2 years have passed now and we assume the role of a former Arcadian solider who Vivicans refer to as ""The Reaper"". With the war still raging on as Vivica invades the bigger nation of Dorfrine, Reaper tries to find out more about himself whilst also trying to free the nation he abandoned. Or at least that's what he likes to believe.  
  
Through his journey he will run into many companions, people who are battling their own demons as they struggle to find light in all the chaos that is happening in this war. Will Reaper be able to unite with them to end the seemingly endless waves of Metalgeists, or will he potentially fall victim to them himself?

pcgaming,Why aren't games published in a universal format?,"I'm sorry this turned into more of a rant.. but the TLDR is I'm wondering why we can't own games anymore, and why can't we play them where we want after buying the game?

~~It's 1997, your mom just took you to K Mart and you convinced her to buy you that new CD. On the drive home you pop the CD into the car stereo made by Sony, and when you get home you start listening to it on the boombox in your room that was made by Toshiba. A few years later, you rip the songs from that CD and play them on your iPod. You owned those songs for good, and only had to pay for them once. If you wanted to listen to them today, you can.

The same goes for VHS, DVD, etc. The formats for audio and video were (close to) universal, and it was up to the owner to determine how they used and consumed the media.

When you look at games, it's the total opposite.
PC games used to be on the cusp of this, but that's almost completely gone now as well. I don't even know where you can buy an actual copy of a PC game now..

Let's say I buy Cyberpunk on Steam for $60. I can play it on any PC, as long as I have Steam installed. Cool. But if I move to the living room and boot up my Xbox, I can't just load my copy there - I have to pay $60 again to have the Xbox version. Want to play that on your handheld Switch? That'll be another $60... But oops, despite buying 3 copies of the same exact game for $180, you can't play, because there is no Internet on this 8 hr flight. Finally, once you get a connection, have fun starting from the beginning because your save data won't even load from the other platform.

It seems pretty criminal to me lol. What are we actually buying when we ""buy"" a game? What happens if steam or Xbox shuts down? Why the hell can't I have a subpar experience trying to run my games on a 20 year old PC with no internet if I want?

Is there any movement to protect the consumer in 2024? Am I overlooking something?",glooppoop,1gr5ple,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gr5ple/why_arent_games_published_in_a_universal_format/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gr5ple/why_arent_games_published_in_a_universal_format/,2024-11-14 14:15:47,0,0.14,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gr5ple

pcgaming,Try to survival Today - The DEMO is already on STEAM,"Hi, I am a single developer of the game Try to survive Today.

  
Steam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082840/Try\_to\_survive\_Today/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082840/Try_to_survive_Today/)

A little bit about my game:

In 2507, the planet Manoan was abandoned due to the depletion of its resources, but the legacy of these crystals lived on. Over time, scientists have mastered the process of synthesizing energy crystals on space stations, opening up new horizons for research and technology development in the country and beyond. So the settlers began a new chapter in the history of space exploration, leaving a mark on every tiny star system they explored.

During the long-forgotten and lost centuries, when people went to the far reaches of space in search of new worlds, each colony sought to increase its population. To explore minerals and the suitability of planets for exploration, geological expeditions were sent to unexplored territories - desperate researchers who were ready to risk everything for the sake of what they wanted. One day, a young girl, Zlata, who has completed an internship on Mars and won the hearts of the scientific community with her knowledge, is sent on one of these daring outings.

Such expeditions were sent on small spaceships without weapons. The team consisted of a geologist pilot and a mechanized exoskeleton.

And so, in the very heart of the abode of ancient forces, where darkness is woven from timeless years, she hears the echoes of the SOS signal coming from the planet Manoan. This signal strikes her imagination, because the planet has been abandoned and uninhabited for fifty years according to all known archives. Having decided to take an amazing step into the unknown, Zlata is faced with mysteries that can turn all her beliefs and ideas about the cosmos upside down.

GAME FEATURES:

A distinctive feature of the game is its character leveling system, which allows players to experiment with different strategies and game styles. The combat system is based on the use of various types of weapons and magic, as well as on the competent use of the character's skills and abilities.

TYPE OF GAME:

When scrolling the mouse wheel, you can switch between three different views: first-person, third-person, and top view.

This allows players to choose the most convenient angle for passing the game and viewing the game environment.

CHARACTER SELECTION:

Two modes: ""MECH Warrior"" and ""MECH Pilot"".

In the ""MECH Warrior"" mode, the player controls a huge and powerful robot combat mech. The mech is equipped with weapons, armor and special abilities that allow it to fight enemies and complete various tasks. The player controls the movement of the mech, its attacks and special abilities.

In the ""MECh Pilot"" mode, the player can use his robot as a companion that helps in battles. The robot can attack enemies, protect its pilot and help him in various tasks. The ability to play as a pilot without being inside the robot. In this case, the player becomes a full-fledged participant in the fighting on earth and can use his weapons and abilities to destroy enemies.

An incredible adventure awaits you on the planet Manoan, where every step is filled with danger and mysteries. Your first task is to turn a geological exoskeleton into a powerful combat robot suit capable of protecting you from all threats.

After studying many types of weapons, from firearms to magic, you will be able to choose the right tool for each type of enemy. Magic crystals will surround you with magic, giving you the opportunity to use unique abilities in the fight against enemies.

Every riddle, every puzzle on your way will be a test of your intelligence and resourcefulness. By solving them, you will come closer to understanding the mysteries of the planet Manoan and its amazing secrets.

Faced with a difficult choice that will affect the outcome of the entire operation, you will have to weigh your decisions and take responsibility for every step of this dangerous journey. Your courage and ability to think on the move will become your main weapons in the fight for survival and victory.

I have released a demo version of the game, and you have the opportunity to evaluate my work on the game.

Man time sure flies as I just realized that by November 2024, Half Life 2, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, and World of Warcraft will all be turning 20 years old as that’s kind of scary if one thinks about it.

pcgaming,DIGESTED,"***Digested is a horror survival game where you try to escape a giant snake!***

Years ago, I learned how to control my dreams but simultaneously developed a fear of snakes. One night, while dreaming, I saw a huge snake trying to eat me. This recurring nightmare didn't go away, and it inspired me to create a horror game called ""Digested.""  
**Announcement Trailer**: [http://youtu.be/lwgdsHYB4HM](http://youtu.be/lwgdsHYB4HM)  
**Nightmare mode**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9Fg5AxDXw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9Fg5AxDXw)

This was my way to fix this absurd situation and make my personal horror less scary for myself. I recreated a real-life island that I have visited many times before. Its filled with dense forest and abandoned buildings. Added a big snake that tries to hunt you so it can digest you and the main protagonist, who is a slow, stumbling human wearing an anti-digestion suit.  
Survival is more than just dodging a giant snake. It’s about making smart decisions and managing your resources effectively. You need to find navigation points scattered across the island to figure out where your escape pod is located. Each time you find and deactivate a navigation point, you'll gain a power-up that helps you outsmart the snake. But these power-ups are temporary, lasting only 20–30 seconds, so you have to use them wisely and strategically.  
**Wishlist now on Steam**: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605900/DIGESTED/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605900/DIGESTED/)

Running around aimlessly won't help you either. The snake can sense vibrations, so every footstep and noise you make could give away your position. And it’s not just slithering on the ground—it can climb trees too, making the threat even more omnipresent. You have to be constantly on the lookout, planning each move carefully to avoid detection.  
**Reddit profile:** [**https://www.reddit.com/user/digestedgame/**](https://www.reddit.com/user/digestedgame/)  
**Discord server:** [**https://discord.gg/**](https://discord.gg/)

The island’s layout changes every time you play—new starting points, different power-up locations, and a correct escape pod.

pcgaming,Next Age of empires titles could be in UNREAL Engine 5,"

https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1781800/Principal-Build-Lead-Engineer---World’s-Edge

It’ s my personal opinion but i think that all World’s Edge Is moving on Unreal Engine because It’s a very know Engine into Xbox studios with mastera of development (coalition) which could help a lot with It.

Unreal Engine Is the most supported Engine in the world and the most spectular, allowing developers to implement excelent graphic and very good performance with DLSS.

Now, AOE4 graphic has been one of the most critized aspect of the game in every community (from reddit to steam, to the ageofempires forum) and also in many professionale review (included Digital foundry).

The main problem Is the Essence Engine by RELIC Entertainment that It has been implemented for different type of RTS (Company of Heroes and Warhammer) and It doesn’t support DLSS.

Artistic choices of Relic art directory (Sclappy, if i Remember well) to make a game too much coloured with exagerered weapons, low textures on units (this Is the reason why you can’t zoom in on them too see battles more close. You are able to zoom in only With a “free camera mod” that’s a Total mess) and bad animations (destructions of siege weapons or chickens and horses in the stables) alienated the most of fans. After the launch and After One year of critics the most of threads on often community are related to e-sport. Basically the only players who are actually playing the game are multiplayer gamers.

Unfortunately and despite of what streamers wanna share, the multiplayer fans are the Little percent of the base of AOE. The most of fans (where developers gain) are casual Who play only With campaigns, skirmish, scenarios and co-op and It has been confirmed by Forgotten Empires in the lastest interview about the upcoming “Battle of Greece” DLC for Aoe2de. For casual gamers graphic Is really important too because It helps a lot with immersion.

This Is the reason why the Sultan’s Ascend has been the most sold DLC in the history of AOE: new campaign (made by Forgotten Empires), new graphic improvements (water reflections) and Better stories to told.

In the lastest AOE survey (july or August) ther were many questions about graphic (realistic or stylized, High detailed textures, realistic weapons impact, wheater effects, Natural disaster and more).


Age of Empires Forum – 20 Jun 24

New survey!
Age of Empires IV
IV - Discussion
There is a new survey in Steam about Age of Empires IV. Folks, please take it. The devs take into account our feedback and make the necessary changes (most of the time).

Reading time: 11 mins 🕑Likes: 47 ❤

So It seems also Developers listened all critics about graphic and they are looking for really improvents.

Unreal Engine seems the right choice for all of these reasons and also because Relic Entertainment, After the lastest layoffs and the sold by Sega, are not involved on AOE4 anymore or in very Little percent. I think the upcoming and confirmed DLC in 2025 there Will be the latest for the AOE4 or World’s Edge with Forgotten Empires could redone all Aoe4 in Unreal Engine.

But what It seems Is that next titles Will probably run on Unreal Engine.

pcgaming,Recent SegaSammy Financial Report pays close attention to Total War: Warhammer III Steam User Reviews,"Just a friendly semi-regular reminder that even multi-billion dollar corps, contrary to ""popular"" belief, do very much pay attention to Steam user reviews. As stated in [page 33 of the report](https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20241108_q2_presentation_e.pdf),  the recovery and turn around of TW:WH3 was directly tied to the intense ""reviewbomb"" the game and its DLC received last year driven by customer dissatisfaction.

Not unlike what the [Take-Two](https://www.gamefile.news/p/take-two-review-bombs-gta-nfl-2k) stated earlier this year about the effect negative user reviews on profits as well.

pcgaming,I wanted to shoutout a game that's not popular enough: Cosmoteer,"I'm no affiliated with the dev or anything i'm just someone desperate for less known indie game gems to get the attention (in my opinion) they deserve. 

Cosmoteer is a 2D scifi ship manager. Imagine FTL + Starsector (if you don't know starsector shame on you). 

What made me fell in love with it is that it doesn't have frustrating mechanics for a ""manger"" game. You don't need to gather fuel to keep going, your crew will constantly produce energy cells to power your components. 

What makes it stand out is that at ANY point you can stop and redesign your entire ship on the spot. You destroy an enemy ship? Get the crew to work and disassemble it, gather materials and attach new pieces to yours. 

Or just repair the enemy ship, send some of your crew in and have a second ship that follows you. I love bringing smalls ships with me to work as defense platforms when i'm in a fight, or as factories since you can mine asteroids and build small refineries for each material. 

Progression is simply tied to the number of crew you can have and ships can get ridiculously large.  

What it's missing is simply more to do outside of combat. You could trade but there's no trade economy, just sell what you don't need. More different quests, encounters, things to do. 

Also i would argue some mods i find essential.

It has coop, pvp, mod support, editor, i mean... Give it a look, hopefully by getting more popular updates get more beefy",Pender8911,1gmfazs,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gmfazs/i_wanted_to_shoutout_a_game_thats_not_popular/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gmfazs/i_wanted_to_shoutout_a_game_thats_not_popular/,2024-11-08 10:14:09,15,0.58,15,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gmfazs

**Tips to get the best suggestions**

* Be detailed! If you're looking for a roguelike, say that. If your game must include zombies, you should probably mention that. The more detailed you are the better the recommendations will be.
* Are you limited by PC specifications or a budget? That's all good stuff to include.

pcgaming,'New Game+' - Anyone else never play it?,"I always strive to get there, as it's motivating, but once I do, I just have no desire to run through the same game, though mobs are harder, without experiencing the upgrades along the way.

For me, the things you earn along the way, and the fact you have so little to begin with, are what draws me in.

I'd rather start over on a harder level, if not already maxed, from scratch.
