pcgaming,Beware ordering items from Max Gaming (international reseller),"Hi all,

Like many, I was intrigued by the appearance of new lightweight high performance mice that have cropped up recently.

I was building a new PC, so ordered a Santali S1-O from [Maxgaming.com](https://us.maxgaming.com/)

Despite having a US prefix on their website URL, they are in fact based in Sweden, and will ship any orders internationally.

So far, everything seems fine, right? The internet is international, and borders are such a 20th century conceit.

However, the problem arose when things did not work according to plan.

According to the carrier (DHL Express), the package was delivered to my mailbox on Monday.

However, my mailbox was empty when I checked it, and neither my condo office nor the package locker had any packages in my name.

When I contacted Maxgaming, their response was that since the package was shipped internationally, and the carrier reported it as 'Delivered', there was nothing for them to do.

No refund, no resend, not even an attempt to contact the carrier to confirm receipt of delivery.

I was just supposed to eat up the item and delivery charge and have nothing to show for it, like a chump (my words, not theirs).

It's not egregious to describe this situation as 'Extremely Unprofessional'. A legitimate business should have the means to ensure safe delivery of purchased items to the consumer, and to resolve disputes with the carrier if things go south on delivery. ""Tough luck, you're SOL"" is not an acceptable means of doing business, especially in the long term. 

Consumer Protection Laws in the US protect me from being charged for items I have paid for but did not receive.

I have filed a dispute claim with Paypal and with my bank, and hopefully they will b able to resolve matters on my behalf.

But in the meantime, a cautionary tale to people who may be tempted by the low prices and deals at maxgaming. You get what you pay for, and sometimes, you don't.

pcgaming,Did PC gaming use to not be very popular in some parts of the world?,"Hello everyone. I am Polish. I have been playing on PC since I was a kid. It seems to me that Poland is predominantly a country that games on PC. I have always believed that PC gaming IS the default way to game.

However, it appears to me that this probably hasn't been the case in other countries?

As an example, Americans pretty much only refer to games made between 2000 and 2011 as, ""a PS2 game"" or ""an Xbox 360 game"" even if said game had a PC release. Most of the discourse regarding gaming around that time revolves around the PS2, the 360, the GameCube, etc.

Also, most Americans seem to know console games like Ocarina of Time (which I will admit I have no clue what that game even is) but they probably have no idea what games like Baldur's Gate or Baldur's Gate 2 are, because they released on PC.

pcgaming,Our World War II airbase builder got a new demo with new major features,"Hello r/pcgaming, my team and I are making a base builder set on World War II military airfields, called [Ground of Aces](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/). In this game, you build your own air base, manage your ground crew and aircraft, and send your pilots out on missions.

And we just released a **major update for our**[ **demo on Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/) with new features and content.

The key updates are:

* Four new aircraft: Avro Lancaster, Bristol Blenheim, Bristol Beaufighter, Gloster Gladiator
* Expanded mission systems with new missions and mission types
* Plane maintenance system, incl. fuel as a new resource, multi seat plane logic and pilot class and task system
* New metal building blocks for hangars, fences, fuel tanks
* Gardening system that lets you grow plants and harvest your own food
* and many more improvements

Play the demo here:[ https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground\_of\_Aces/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/)

Here is an overview video of the new Alpha 3 features:[ https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R](https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R)

As a big fan of base building games like Rimworld and as a World War II aviation nerd, this is a passion project for me. Almost 10 years ago, I had the idea of a base builder game set on World War II airbases, and it feels unreal to see this idea coming to life now and have people play this alpha version of the game.

We are in the alpha phase of development, so everything is still a work in progress. It would be **great to hear your opinion and feedback about the demo**. Is it satisfying to collect resources and build your first structures? How long did you play and how big did your air base get? Anything in particular you like/dislike about the experience? Getting early feedback helps the ongoing development and will make the game better for everyone.

pcgaming,"Ubisoft, Why Do Your Games Stop Working After a Year?","I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm absolutely done with Ubisoft. Over the years, I‚Äôve spent hundreds‚Äîprobably thousands‚Äîof dollars on their games. I‚Äôve built a library of some of their best franchises: *Assassin‚Äôs Creed*, *Far Cry*, *Watch Dogs*. These are games I *wanted* to love, games I poured hours of my life into. But what‚Äôs the point of owning them when they just stop working after a year?

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve dealt with repeatedly:

* **Ubisoft Connect**: More like Ubisoft *Disconnect*. Every other update breaks something. Games that ran fine one day refuse to launch the next, and troubleshooting is like banging your head against a wall.
* **DRM Nonsense**: I‚Äôve paid for these games‚Äîfull price in most cases‚Äîand yet they can‚Äôt verify licenses? How does that even happen? Why do I feel like a pirate for trying to play games I legally own?
* **Servers, Servers, Servers**: Why does every Ubisoft game, even the single-player ones, seem to rely on servers? And when those servers inevitably go down or get shut off, good luck trying to access your progress or even start the game.
* **Updates That Break Everything**: Instead of fixing bugs, updates sometimes *add* new ones. Or they tank performance, making games unplayable. I shouldn‚Äôt have to *fear* clicking ""Update.""

And just when I thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse, in the past month alone, I‚Äôve lost access to *Ghost Recon Breakpoint*, *For Honor*, and even *Battlefield 1* and *Battlefield 2042*. That‚Äôs FOUR games I can no longer launch no matter what I try. At this point, it feels like a ticking time bomb before the few games I still have that work also join the pile of dozens that don‚Äôt.

Speaking of Battlefield, let me throw EA into the mix, too. Their games are plagued by the *same* issues: DRM problems, launcher headaches, server reliance, and updates that break what didn‚Äôt need fixing. It feels like these companies are competing to see who can frustrate their customers more.

And what‚Äôs with the unnecessary third-party launchers? If I bought a game on Steam, I should be able to launch it *from Steam*. Why do I need Ubisoft Connect or EA Play or whatever other launcher shoved down my throat? It‚Äôs clunky, unreliable, and adds yet another layer of potential failure. Enough is enough!

It‚Äôs not just their old games, either. Ubisoft‚Äôs new games have been circling the drain in terms of quality. Remember when their titles felt groundbreaking and polished? Now it feels like every new release is rushed, bloated with microtransactions, or half-baked. They‚Äôre more focused on squeezing money out of players than creating games that work reliably or stand the test of time.

I‚Äôm tired of wasting my time, energy, and money trying to keep Ubisoft games functional. Gaming is supposed to be fun‚Äînot a second job where I‚Äôm troubleshooting errors or waiting on forums for a patch that may never come.

At this point, I‚Äôve made up my mind: I‚Äôm not buying another Ubisoft or EA game. Not now, not ever. What‚Äôs the point of owning their games if I can‚Äôt trust them to work a year down the line? Why should I invest my money in companies that clearly don‚Äôt care about their customers once they‚Äôve made the sale?

And I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.

* Have you had your games just stop working randomly?
* How do you deal with DRM, launcher issues, and server reliance?
* Do you feel like these companies are prioritizing cash grabs over long-term quality and support?

Honestly, Ubisoft (and EA), get your act together. You‚Äôre making incredible games‚Äîwhy are you ruining them with this garbage? You‚Äôre alienating loyal customers like me who actually *want* to support you.

I‚Äôm fed up, and I‚Äôd love to hear from others who‚Äôve been through the same thing. Is it just me, or are these companies actively driving away their fanbase with these problems?

Thanks for reading. I needed to vent.

  
**Edit:** 

Hey everyone, thanks for contributing to this discussion I want to make a few things clear. After reading through the comments it's became apparent that a lot of people haven't experienced the same kind of issues I have in relation to games completely not working. I'd like to say that it was not my belief that this issue was common to many people however in my mind that still does not throw out the other points that I do believe are common issues that have always plagued the gaming landscape, however I felt that specifically Ubisoft and EA tend to have the most issues. 

I understand that I may have upset many people by posting this which was not my intention. It's hard to see this as anything other than rage bait or farming karma since I provided no real solutions to any of the problems I listed. I've also aggravated some people who noticed that this wasn't my own original words and that I used ChatGPT to generate a lot of this content. These are all true and I can not deny them, however despite my shortcomings I still believe in everything I posted here and I hope one day things will change. 

I could have done a better job at putting more effort and time into this post, but at the time I was simply fed up with having the same experience over and over again. I've kept my mouth shut about this and figured it had been beaten to death already, but for some reason I finally felt enough of a push to post about it. 

Even if this hasn't changed any bodies perspectives, I'm glad to see I'm not the only person who's had terrible experiences with these game companies. 

And again thanks to everyone who contributed to this discussion, no matter the side taken.

pcgaming,Did I just get older or have things changed?,"I'm sure my experience mirrors others. When I was a kid, I trusted the Ubisoft logo. Prince of Persia, Hawx 2, Blazing Angels, and Just Dance, to name a couple of the ones i played on the family Wii. Granted, i was a child and not the best judge of games, but I had fun with all of those and that's what games are for. Nowadays that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Skull and Bones, which i thankfully avoided buying altogether when reviews were less than stellar. Shame the tailers made it seem like exactly my type of game, i LOVED Sea of Thieves. 

Most of the recent Assassin's Creed games selling permanent double money and experience points (imo should not have even been offered, if the feedback you get from testers is that progression is too slow, it's scummy to sell a solution). Did the fact that they sell those boosters spoil my enjoyment of Oddysey/Valhalla? Mostly no, but I was far more conscious of the fact I COULD be progressing faster like my friend who bought them. We would play the game on a voice call, share loot locations and strats, it became frustrating hearing the things I couldn't access because of my low level. 

Games like Call of duty seem to be slowing the progression of the battle passes to get you to play their game and ONLY their game if you want to reach the top tier within the time limit. Could be just placebo, unsure how true this is.

As I said above, I'm not alone in feeling this way. A few of my friends share my sentiment. It's not only Ubisoft that does this, they're just a prime example. Create a problem and sell a solution is a great business move, but shitty for consumers.",dadodavedude,1h9z4hz,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h9z4hz/did_i_just_get_older_or_have_things_changed/,2024-12-09 02:09:27,0,0.24,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9z4hz

pcgaming,Bad optimization vs poor optimization the real reason.,"This is not asking for tech support or providing it, please don't auto delete this mods :-)



There's this age old argument of whether games are optimized well or not by developers and I think I have the simple answer that I don't see being talked about. It maybe so obvious that it doesn't need mentioning, but then again it may be so obvious that no one sees it.

Since the PS3/360 generation of gaming fidelity became more important to developers than fluidity and response time. If optimized well 30 frames per second (33.3ms) 6ft from your TV with a wireless controller could be satisfying and to those new to gaming that generation is was just normal. In the PS3/360 era, PC gaming was just a drop in the bucket of the market share too. Every generation there's a leap in fidelity potential and despite the demand for 60fps on consoles it was always an after thought until this generation. Now it's kind of a frustrating joke.

Because games are still being made with a render bandwidth of 33.3ms at the base level, that's where the majority of games start. For those who don't understand, developers know at 30fps they have 33.3ms to render a frame which is double the amount of time (bandwidth) to render 60fps (16.6ms.) So they design and optimize the game around the flexibility that 33.3ms provides. If a game like that sticks to a solid 30fps it is actually optimized well and functioning as intended.

But enter performance mode though... All modern performance modes are doing is trying to scale back the fidelity on a surface level usually just by cutting back on the resolution and level of detail. But with games full of lighting, Ray Tracing and effects based around using all 33.3ms of render time your CPU has available 60fps is just not possible for most CPUs.

Some games however are designed to run within a 16.6ms render time on console, usually less graphically intensive games. But sometimes we get standout games like the new Indiana Jones, CoD (I don't like CoD but it performs very well,) Hogwarts Legacy (had some PC issues at launch, but super optimized for a UE4 game,) Dragon Age 4, Helldivers 2, Evil West, Stellar Blade (proof will be in the PC launch,) and Resident Evil 4 Remake to name a few.

The list of games that run a 30fps well and not 60fps is much longer, but there's a few games that have issues that don't even stay at 30fps.

We also have the new standard emerging that is 40FPS/25ms which feels so much better than 30fps but not at good at 60fps. Maybe that's a new baseline we should hope for going forward? But it only works if you have a 120Hz display. But if they target 25ms render time it provides a potential Frame Interpolation (Frame Generation) target of 80fps/12.5ms which can feel like 60fps. I could live with that instead of being stuck at using FG to go from 30fps to 60fps on PC. But I'd prefer if developers would push the limits and figure out how to best utilize 60fps/16.6ms.

I believe poor optimization is when games crash and or can't hit their intended target framerate (which is rarely 60fps) and bad optimization is the unwillingness to give gamers what we've wanted for 3 console generations now which is 60fps. I honestly don't care about 4K, render to a super clean 1080p or 1440p and bilinearly upscale with the GPU - go play TLOU Remastered on a PS5 and tell me if you can really see a difference between performance or fidelity modes. Poor PC port though, that was just a botched/rushed job. But this 4K and faux 4K (FSR - looking at you) is stealing precious render time that could be spent making the game more stable.

Most games are well optimized they just have poor optimization limits.

pcgaming,is it common to lose interest in a game after completing the main storyline?,"I'm honestly new to playing modern AAA games, I used to watch gameplay videos a lot but now that I have somewhat of a proper rig to game on, I noticed that I lose interest in games after the main story. when the main story is still ongoing I do the side missions and stuff a lot, I like it then but once the story concludes I don't want to do the side missions anymore, maybe I feel like there are too many other good games to dive into to waste my time on side missions after the main game ends? Also, I feel a bit sad when the main story ends, which is of course a common thing for everyone when something they like comes to an end.

I recently played Arkham Knight and I haven't seen the knight fall protocol in action yet as I lost interest after the identity reveal. And I just finished Spiderman 1, it's 70 completed and now I'm downloading the Miles Morales one. I really liked the Spiderman game maybe even more so than Arkham Knight.

pcgaming,Ink. - All that glitters is not gold - Just got its first big update releasing Chapter 3 on Steam!,"Hi! I'm one of the (two) developers of Ink. a colorful roguelike singleplayer/coop adventure, and I just wanted to announce that today our game just got its first big update after the early access launch on Steam. I am still actively developing the game, but everything is in a really solid state currently.

**To make it short, what is Ink. ?**  
Ink. is the story of a little boy named Liam. Liam lives in a small country house with his grandfather. His parents separated some time ago, due to his father's violent behavior. Liam often misses his mother, since she works as a stewardess for an airline. Liam spends his days drawing in a book, the Ink. book that his mother gave him for Christmas some time ago, together with a stuffed cat named Spok, the protagonist of his drawn adventures.

In Ink. you will face various chapters, in which there are many different enemies and bosses to defeat. During your adventure you will collect cards and powers that can synergize with each other creating combinations of unique effects.  
The peculiarity of this game is precisely the ink: the drops that you can collect will be your lifeblood, and the same can be used to strengthen yourself, but putting you at risk, or as a bargaining chip with other characters that you will meet during your adventure.

We've been working on this for almost 3 years now, and there's truly so much to discover in this game, all the details that makes every game unique. I hope you find some time to check it out and let us know your impressions.  
In the future you can expect regular updates of new chapters (there are 9 planned in total, some of them are almost already completed) and many enemies, cards, effects but also original soundtracks and if the interest is high even a cartoon for the intro (it costs a lot to do this, unfortunately).

Thank you for your attention, I'll leave you with some links:

pcgaming,"I'm working on a new game ""Roguebound Pirates"", inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates! If you've played Pirates!, I would love to hear what your favorite features were in it.","I was thinking about new game ideas and somehow I always kept going back to nostalgic memories of playing Sid Meier's Pirates! I feel like there hasn't been a similar game since, so why not make my own and try to scratch that same itch?

I'm trying to strike a good balance between making my game unique (for example my game will have a focus on deep ship customization by letting the player have full control over what kind of weapons &amp; equipment the ship has and where they are placed) and still scratching that nostalgic Pirates! itch. To help with this, I would love to hear what you enjoy the most in Pirates! Hopefully I can add those features/aspects to my game also.

If you are interested in the project, I just opened a Steam page for it:

*I hope we managed to surprise some of you with a new combination of mechanics.*

**A bit of narrative that is implied:**

Imagine that you defeated a very dangerous enemy - elite techno-zombies, tore out his heart and absorbed it. As a result, you got a mutation. Which one? - You don't know in advance, but now it's part of your deckbuilding.

By the way, you can get several mutations in one run.

pcgaming,Why does Uplay still suck so bad? ,"I have to vent.... I've just tried to replay Far Cry 5 because I'm in a nostalgic mood, but Uplay is just utter garbage - no better still: It aspires to be garbage because now it's rat feces and pestilense. It's probably the worst piece of software I've ever had on my PC including viruses.

1. Start Uplay. Nothing happens so you try again. This time a popup comes with a request for Uplay to make changes to your disk. I say yes - even though I know the futility of this since I've said yes about a billion times now, and whaddayaknow...
2. Another popup with the same request. This repeats about 5 times before the launcher starts and then says it needs to update. I catch myself thinking that maybe the update will fix the trash program before I remember that it's Uplay and there will be peace in the Middle East before this trash is fixed.
3. Uplay has been updated and restarts with a popup requesting to make changes to disk. Repeats 3 times.
4. Now finally it starts up and greets me with.... a login screen. I've only saved my username and password about a trillion times, but no, I need to manually enter it again.
5. I'm now enraged. It's been maybe 5-7 minutes in Uplay-hell and I just want to.... meet whoever made this hellish and evil malfunctioning piece of raw sewage!'

pcgaming,"[Steam Giveaway] REMNANT 2+DLC, Persona 4 Golden, and Cassette Beasts.","Greetings all. 

Now that the Steam fall sale has ended, I wanted to dump a few keys that are no longer on sale, I'll be giving away

[Remnant 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/REMNANT_II/) + [DLCs](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/remnant-2-dlc-bundle)

[Persona 4 Golden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/)

[Cassette Beasts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/)

___

**Rules**: To enter, simply comment below with your favorite kind of soup (I'm cold and its lunch, don't judge) **And which ONE of the THREE games you would like**. One key per person (except for Remnant which includes DLC). NO DUPLICATE POSTS, I will be checking. I will distribute the keys via **Reddit messages** after 24 hours of this post being live. Please know how to access your messages in Reddit, as people love to say I haven't given them the key because they don't know the difference between Reddit messages and Reddit chat. 

Best of luck! This will be my last giveaway for 2024, but I have some additional keys ready for next year. 

Shameless plug: [My small Steam review curator group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Synik_GR), only join if you want to.


___
EDIT: There are a ton of people not fully reading the rules. If you do not put the title of the game you want in your post, and I end up choosing you, I will now be skipping over you and will choose another. Really simple - 1 game per person, please note the game you want most. Pro-tip: Remnant 2 is by far the most popular so you have a better chance at scoring one of the other ones, just sayin :)

___
EDIT 2: I am starting up the process now to give away keys. I did a terrible job at outlining the rules above, but just know this is completely random, post age/upvotes have no bearing. 

Starting with the first winner.... Remnant + DLCs..... /u/LineRepresentative19

EDIT 3: 2nd winner is /u/Parthj99 with Cassette Beasts

EDIT 4: 3rd winner is /u/flippantcash with Persona 4 Golden! 

That's all I got! I wish I had more with only 3 keys and over 1200 comments. Until next time - Merry Christmas/Happy New Years!

EDIT 5: I am learning that Humble Bundle keys will only work on U.S. Steam accounts due to my Humble account being activated in the U.S. region. So I've had to redistribute keys unfortunately. I am working with the original winners of the keys and will provide them a copy of the promised game through Steam gift with my own money. 

/u/mauaus is the secondary winner for Cassette Beasts.

/u/Walton557 is the secondary winner for Remnant + DLC",Synikx,1h6ngcq,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6ngcq/steam_giveaway_remnant_2dlc_persona_4_golden_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6ngcq/steam_giveaway_remnant_2dlc_persona_4_golden_and/,2024-12-04 18:35:48,257,0.86,257,0,1205,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6ngcq

pcgaming,"Announcing ""Do No Harm"" - A Lovecraftian ""Papers, Please""-like Medical Simulator","Earlier this year we decided to make a game that would be about a Spooky Doctor in a Spooky Town. I just got verified, so I wanted to share with gamers in here. If you like *Papers, Please* or *Strange Horticulture*, I think you'll like my game too!  
  
*Do No Harm* is a Lovecraftian medical simulator where you play as a 19th-century doctor using Galenic medicine (think Four Humours theory) to heal patients on an eerie island village.

* Steam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do\_No\_Harm/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming)
* YouTube:¬†[https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE](https://youtu.be/IRYVUEQe2XE)

The gameplay revolves around patients coming to you with symptoms‚Äîsome they‚Äôll describe, while others you‚Äôll notice visually or diagnose using tools. You‚Äôll consult your Book of Medicine, which offers hints and narrows down potential treatments, but ultimately, you‚Äôll need to experiment with different medicines to see what works. Sometimes, your patients get better; other times‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt make it.

All the while, a Lovecraftian story unfolds in the background, mixed with eerie events and subtle resource management elements.

**What makes** ***Do No Harm*** **unique?**

* **Doctor Simulator with Galenic Medicine**: Immerse yourself in medieval medical practices as you analyze symptoms and treat patients.
* **A Lovecraftian Twist**: Unravel a chilling narrative where reality blurs and cosmic horrors creep into your everyday life.
* **Moral Choices**: In this cultist ridden island village, you'll have to decide whom to trust, heal or maybe even kill. Each choice leads to a different ending.

If you‚Äôre intrigued, you can [Wishlist the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pcgaming) to support us and stay updated on its release.

pcgaming,[Dev] Xukaackque - An Isometric Roguelite Where You Escape a Spider's Surreal Dreamscape,"# Hello! I'm excited to share Xukaackque, an upcoming isometric roguelite with a unique premise.

# Game Overview

In Xukaackque, you play as a ninja trapped within a spider's dream - a surreal, shifting landscape where each death pulls you deeper into a nightmarish realm. Your goal is to escape through portals, navigating a world that changes with each attempt.

# Key Features

* Isometric roguelite gameplay
* Procedurally generated dream environment
* Experimental music layering system that dynamically adapts to your journey
* Unique narrative concept of escaping a spider's subconscious
* Dash and shoot shuriken that seek out enemies
* Master the shield's slide and bounce abilities
* Abilities that evolve based on depth level

# Current Status

The game is currently ready for release and will be coming very soon to Steam, likely next week. We're just waiting on final store page changes from Steam, but the game itself is complete. I'm looking to build wishlist support to help gauge community interest!

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252270/xukaackque](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252270/xukaackque)

I'll be around to answer any questions about the game's concept and looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

pcgaming,How Indiana Jones Proves That Game Engines Don't Matter,"I have been vocal about this topic a few times before, that a game engine inherently does not decide how a game performs, looks or feels to play.

People praise IdTech for being ""Optimized"", Source &amp; Source 2 for how it feels smooth and fluid, but criticise Unreal Engine for how every game that seems to be made with it runs poorly.

Let me try to explain the point one last time, a game engine is just a tool, it's up to you how to use it, and wether it will be used properly is also dependant on your skills, or the time you have, or what type of game you are making, what type of environment a game has, what kind of artistic, narrative or design decisions were made.

Case in point, Doom Eternal, which gets endless praise for running so well, is a fully linear game, with almost no dynamic environment elements, only enemies, projectiles and some objects are movable, this allows the developers to precalculate or ""bake"" all lighting information before hand, reducing computational load.

Although we are yet to see the true nature of Indiana Jones game design, we can already assume that due to certain reasons, the devs realized that baked lighting would not work, thus necessitating some sort of dynamic lighting system, like UE5's Lumen, also using higher res textures and models, making the requirements to run it steep.

To address the point about why Unreal Engine games always turn out poorly optimized, it's simply because it's the most widely used tool, and simply due to that, there will be a higher probability that some devs for whatever reason did not put in the time to make proper decisions and did not properly optimize the game. Batman Arkham Knight is a prime example, as bad as the game ran at launch, it was fixed, and now runs and looks fantastic despite being from the same time as Doom 2016. I can guarantee that if IdTech was used by more developers, we would quickly realize that it's not the silver bullet we thought of.",Danyaal_Majid,1h70dmv,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h70dmv/how_indiana_jones_proves_that_game_engines_dont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h70dmv/how_indiana_jones_proves_that_game_engines_dont/,2024-12-05 04:04:09,0,0.23,0,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h70dmv

pcgaming,Pathfinder: Wraith of the Righteous Could Be My Next Dragon Age: Origins ,"## Background

Apart from the Mass Effect Trilogy and Fallout games, Dragon Age: Origins is my all-time favorite CRPG-ish title. I could never get that experience again, even with Dragon Age II, or Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Being in my late 30s, and having difficulty finding time to play videogames, I've been pushing myself to play those shorter experiences like Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch, even though I somehow managed to finish the Metro Trilogy recently, and that says something about that series.

But, there's always that itch for an immersive RPG experience.

## My Requirements for The Ideal RPG (across sub-genres)

1. Good story
2. Party-based gameplay (Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Origins have spoilt me)
3. Choices should matter
4. Voice-acted dialogues
5. Shouldn't take an eternity to complete the main quest (adult/parent gamer)
6. Should be able to motivate me to keep playing till the end

Basically, the game should hook me in during my play session so that I return to play it before real life pulls me away until I forget the plot, characters, controls, etc. I've lost interest in several very good games just due to this.

## What Didn't Work (along with reasons)

### Divinity Original Sin

- I could not connect to the story, probably due to being my first Divinity game
- Restricted camera movement felt awkward

### Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2 (Enhanced Editions)

I picked these up after tens (if not hundreds) of positive reviews.

- As much as I liked the original and could appreciate it, I found it hard to push myself past the aged graphics and gameplay style.

### Pillars of Eternity

Amazing story, execution, etc. making it feel like a modern Baldur's Gate

- Too much reading
- No camera movement
- Something was missing!

### Wasteland 3

Was a natural choice given how much I liked Wasteland 2

- Dark plot (darker than I can take)
- Too much gore for my taste
- Visuals were not as good
- Buggy experience
- I messed up a major choice after hours into the game, and didn't feel like continuing or starting over

### Divinity Original Sin 2

- Overwhelming interactions and conversations right during the start of the game
- Felt lost till the time I met all the companions after the intro mission on the ship

### Pathfinder: Kingmaker

An interesting start to the game, and felt well-made

- Too much reading
- Lost interest

### Baldur's Gate 3

Feels like a perfect game, but this one's expensive!

## Evaluating with Steam Deck Recently

I've had a preference for the Steam Controller against keyboard+mouse due to my Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and have recently been trying to move some of my gaming to the Steam Deck. I did not evaluate the above-mentioned games with the Steam Deck except Wasteland 3 which felt unnatural.

### Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire

Seemed very close to what I was looking for

Pros:
- Great gameplay
- Decent scaling on the Steam Deck
- Deep mechanics

Cons:
- No camera movement
- Unclear controls on Steam Deck, had to guess a lot
- Overall, felt more suitable with mouse+keyboard

### Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Seemed exactly what I was looking for!

Pros:
- Love the audio and soundtrack
- Native support for Steam Deck controls
- All controls are ""right there"" and feel natural
- A lot of voice-acting
- Camera rotation!

Cons:
- HowLongToBeat reports the gameplay hours to be way more than what I can afford

## Conclusion

Given my requirements, expectations, and time limitations, mostly around being able to spend enough time and focus on these huge games, it makes this pretty much impossible to find something that works for me.

If at all I could play something from what I mentioned, it may only be one unlike what I see on other posts where people beat these lengthy games multiple times, getting all the achievements, and then moving to other titles.

With that being said, and with all my research and experience, I'm settling with Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous on the Steam Deck until I can afford (or justify spending on) Baldur's Gate 3.

I haven't started a real playthrough yet, but I'm happy to hear your thoughts!",myTerminal_,1h6lv3u,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6lv3u/pathfinder_wraith_of_the_righteous_could_be_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h6lv3u/pathfinder_wraith_of_the_righteous_could_be_my/,2024-12-04 17:33:37,0,0.33,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6lv3u

2 days ago I stumbled upon **8-Bit Adventures 2** (don't let the 2 in the title confuse you, you need no prior knowledge, the game provides you with everything) and I'm having a blast right now. I'd even go so far and say that I vastly prefer this game over most 2D FF games?! Combat is great, NES graphics and sounds are VERY charming and authentic, the writing is witty and the game comes with all of the more modern features that just save time (f.e. no random battles, enemies are visible on the map).

pcgaming,"Star Wars Jedi Survivor &amp; Fallen Order are still broken on PC, do not let the dark side tempt you with sales","In light of the all the sales now til the end of the year, here's a little reminder or notice if you're unfamiliar:

Jedi Survivor and Fallen Order infamously suffer from shader and traversal stutters. These occur on *every* PC, regardless of hardware or whether you're able to notice them. There are other bugs too, like white flashing when turning corners/the camera, flickering lights, and even basic things like menu settings not engaging. Is DLSS on or is your PC just that bad? Who knows! 

To get you caught up, here's Digital Foundry's analysis of the most recent [Jedi Survivor Patch 9 - Improved but still very poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw) by Alex Battaglia, preeminent expert on PC game performance and leader in the #StutterStruggle. 

So, while Patch 9 improved shader comp and shader stutter, **both Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor *still* to this day suffer from shader compilation and travel stutter.** **Everyone** on PC will encounter several types of stuttering, *regardless of how good the hardware.* There's also **[animation stutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw&amp;t=573)**, which affects camera movement and character animations. A triple threat stutterer!

I can also vouch that the issues occur on the current fastest CPU for gaming, the 9800x3D, which I use OC'd to 5.7Ghz and run with 48gb DDR5-8000 CL40 EXPO, Crosshair X870 Hero, and RTX 4090; all stability tested &gt;24hrs, latest drivers, no issues like this with any other games that aren't also known and common.

Oh, and [even the PS5 Pro version of Survivor is having issues right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8?si=wYfe9swwp0dpR98K). EA is aware and investigating, patch is assumed/confirmed to come soon, but it's just another example of their poor standards.

I don't think it's appropriate to continue rewarding EA's and Respawn's repeated lack of respect for paying customers by spending more money or playtime on these lackluster products. Just means they will continue to reward you with the same or lower standards next time. If as many of us as possible opt not to purchase them, even at a steep discount, they might find our collective lack of faith disturbing enough to fix these issues in the next game, if not the previous.",FractaLTacticS,1h4gog6,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1h4gog6/star_wars_jedi_survivor_fallen_order_are_still/,2024-12-01 23:22:05,1076,0.76,1076,0,410,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h4gog6

I'm the indie developer of *Flocking Hell*, a whimsical-yet-sinister roguelite where you defend your pasture from demonic invasion.

* Release date trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9\_\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN8pEig9__U)

As you'll see in the attached trailer video, in BOWLOUT you'll throw lots of bowling balls or use pins as weapons to proceed through a pin-infested bowling centre and eliminate the source of the attack. It's a relatively short game with a simple gameplay loop - perfect to blow off some steam without getting attached to a long story. There's also achievements, unlockable ball colors and controller support!

Hopefully you'll enjoy this trailer and share/wishlist the game - it helps us with the algorithm, increasing the chances of the fabled 'front page' slot! If you have any questions about the game or would like to create content/articles on it, I would gladly help! Comment here or message me directly.

I wanted to introduce my solo-dev project, a sci-fi survival-crafter/base-builder, [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming).

**[Check out the trailer here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwB0r5f6T80)**

**AETHUS is a story-driven survival game, meaning there's always a narrative-driven reason to go on your next expedition into the underground open world!** 

You'll mine and gather resources in a physics-driven world rendered with Lumen and Nanite in UE5, while building up your mining outpost on the surface with easy to use yet extremely powerful building and decoration tools.

I've spent a lot of time making these tools as simple to use as possible and the whole game is **packed with quality-of-life features** like building/crafting/cooking from storage automatically, the ability to disable collisions when building so you can position things JUST right, and much more.

I left my AAA job after 7 years in the industry back in 2023 to go indie on my own and make this game, with **no AAA bullshit** - no AI, no microtransactions or cosmetics, no predatory development, no releasing a half-done bug-filled product in Early Access, just good old-fashioned gamedev.

[I'd love to get your thoughts on the game, so there's a demo you can try out right now on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming)

I myself tend to just skim down to the review score (not that these really mean much these days in the world of sponsored reviews) - but once upon a time, I used to really enjoy a good, longform review.

I myself wrote them freelance for a while, for a local gaming site and the small amount of money I made from it coupled with review copies of various games was always pretty exciting.

But I've been thinking a lot lately - possibly because I'm getting on in age these days, if anyone actually reads the reviews / articles rather than just skim them? Reading for the enjoyment of reading.

pcgaming,"Star Wars Outlaws - Some really good bones, but I have to put it down for a while.","Weird crashing and broken saves, along with some strange tech hiccups.

Bought the game for $25 so I‚Äôm not upset, they just need to do a lot more patching.

Overall, I really like the game. 

As a Star Wars guy, the open world is pretty amazing, and REALY stunning to look at.

The faction system is great. The blaster combat is fine and the stealth kind of sucks.

I‚Äôm even starting to like the story; I think they‚Äôve nailed the ‚ÄúOutlaw‚Äù aspect of the characters and numerous interactions and choices the game presents.

Looking forward to returning to it once everything gets patched up a bit more.

pcgaming,"Will you get War of the worlds or not, knowing 1c is based in Moscow?","Hello, I saw a game inspired by HG Wells today, namedThe War of the World: siberia.

It is made by 1c, a studio based in Moscow. This is one thing that would make me hesitate buying the game, and apparently their CEO is close with russian government. Is this something that would impact your decision to buy a game? Of course I understand the CEO does not represent the whole company and that it is noteasy to really oppose the government in a country like Russia

pcgaming,I started a video series where I interview (mostly PC) game developers to close the gap between gamer &amp; creator,"My name is Oswald de Bruin and I‚Äôm an indie game developer from Leiden, the Netherlands. Not too long ago I attended the Dutch Game Garden Network Lunch in Utrecht and interviewed a bunch of interesting game creators about their motivations and behind the scenes craft secrets.

After playing it i once again feel how painfully bad are combat in ""modern"" AC games where you simply hit enemy many times with your weapon just going trough the body and... that's all.
