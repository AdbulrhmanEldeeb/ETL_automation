webdev,How I got out of tutorial hell,"Don't get me wrong, tutorials are important when you are first starting your web development journey. They should not be where/how you build the majority of your projects from.

This took me a long time to realize, I thought hiring managers and recruiters would find these projects interesting enough to give me a shot... I was very wrong.

This realization is what got me out of tutorial hell, I realized that re-building an already made product that showcased no effective problem-solving skills of my own was going to get me no where.

As someone who was in tutorial hell myself for a long time, I know how hard it is to think of what to build; it seems like everything that has a chance of being successful is already built.

What I found best to building a successful project was fulfilling these requirements:

1. I needed to be passionate enough to finish the project
2. It needed to serve a particular unpopular niche to have the best chance with establishing presence for SEO to eventually have organic growth.

What I landed on was a platform, similar to dribbble, where developers could easily find images from developers portfolios for inspiration.

This was:

✅ Something I was passionate about

✅ Serving a purpose within a particular untouched niche

Unfortunately, at the end I was left with a project with no users (of course) like a lot of projects we make. So I decided to take a leap and do what is known as ""building in public"".

I made an X account, started to find users apart of the niche and directly messaged them about my project. This did not work at first as everyone's always a little skeptical being the first user on a new website.

As I continued to publicly market my product on X, I decided to find ways to market my product directly to users email inboxes.

Where I struck gold was finding this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios)

This single repository got me my first 20+ users that helped establish the foundation of my site.

The repository is filled with developers who uploaded their portfolio link, along with their name, to be publicly showcased. This was my niche served to me with no fluff.

The approach I took was sincere when emailing users from this repository, clearly stating how I came across their email address, and portfolio site and why I thought they would be interested in my site.

Within the email, I also included positive feedback I had from their site as I did have to browse it to find their email address.

From this, I was then able to continue ""building in public"" with a decent enough level of success by eventually getting 80+ users and about 20k monthly visitors for my first month after launching my project.",yeahimjtt,1hc2fv1,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc2fv1/how_i_got_out_of_tutorial_hell/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hc2fv1/how_i_got_out_of_tutorial_hell/,2024-12-11 19:57:35,49,0.79,49,0,31,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hc2fv1

webdev,Developer (from a non web background) looking for framework suggestions for a side project,"Hey folks,

I'm a developer, however my experience is not in the world of web development. I have a number of years of professional experience using Java/Javascript/C#/SQL/Bash and random other bits along the way.

  
This project falls outside of my career and is more of a pet hobby project. What I'm trying to do is just build a simple website/web app used to pull and filter various information from a Mysql database. The data is just membership data for a student organization I was involved with more than a decade ago. I've been keeping up with it as a favor since then as the individual who used to do it before is very senior at this point and has been relegated to an assisted living facility.

  
The original site was built using Drupal 7 ages ago and I've kept it up to date with whatever version they are on now I think its Drupal 10. But this variant of the site is just using static pages and is a pain in the ass to update when I have all of the data in a database anyway that has all of the appropriate relationships to generate any dataset with just a sql query.

  
I think most people who would be using it would be accessing from mobile devices and only using a desktop when they wanted to print off information so it needs to display well on mobile.

  
As of now the webhost which is being provided free of charge does not support Node.js. I can of course switch the host but free is a great price so if I can get something decent enough without moving that would be ideal.

Looking for framework suggestions that ideally don't require node. I'm certain that I will not be creating the most fantastic site ever seen but I have enough development experience that I expect I can get something that works and does what I need once I fight with it for a bit.

- Responsive site, with an image carousel just below the navigation. I've used the carousel here: https://codepen.io/andrewchaika/pen/mEqRPz. And then modified/added to, etc. to fit my needs.
- Placed on top of the carousel are a headline/subhead and a button link. These work great on desktop sizes. Since they don't fit on mobile, I moved them to underneath the carousel.
- There are three images in the carousel. On image 1 &amp; 2, the buttons seem to be covered by something invisible. Changing the z-index doesn't help. On image 3, the button works fine!

Things I've tried:

- Adjusting the z-index for the buttons. No effect.
- Using a display: none on the other two carousel states, but that seems to just make the entire thing invisible.

I've recently started applying for full-time jobs, and they assess using coding problems. I get to the solution, but it is not optimal. In my little work experience, I've always been focused on getting things done in an appropriate time and resource, but not on optimizing them to the fullest.

I've started recently to improve that by working on Leetcode problems but I still struggle with the output optimality, and I take a long time to solve even with easy problems.

1- Is algorithm optimality a crucial factor in full-stack/back-end positions? Should my focus be targeted at something more important like working more on the languages/frameworks?

2- Through practice, does this get better? My brain seems to get lost in working on complex algorithms and resort to brute force when blacked out. And, I still never got the hang of dynamic programming.

webdev,"Alignment to a ""global"" grid?","I haven't ""laid out"" a website in some time and I'm starting work on a web app. A question popped up in my head: is it worth trying to align as much content as possible to a multiple of some base width/height (say 12px)? I.e., to a global grid of dividing the page up into multiples of 12, both horizontally and vertically? 

Traditionally, I've tried to align as best as possible but acknowledge that outside of more controlled layout contexts like cards and lists that relative alignment and spacing between elements would suffice. 

Honestly, I think it looks great when the content of the page seems to be universally aligned; it makes it much easier to parse and partition the page in my mind. 

One caveat is that the width of the viewport isn't guaranteed or likely to be a multiple of 12, but this isn't a complete deal breaker when you see that most elements could still be aligned and that the only elements touching the left/right borders would likely be containers and it's sufficient if their content is aligned.

My plan is to lay the page out with a combination of grid and flexbox, using grid for elements where there is a need for unambiguous arrangement, and then use multiples of the base unit (12) to space, pad or position things as best I can.

webdev,Is there any way to efficiently query Firestore documents using both where() and limit() in React?,"I'm trying to optimize the read/writes from my restaurant management project, and I think I've run into a brick wall as they say.

I'm using Firebase as my backend, and right now I'm working on the process of fetching and displaying items on a Menu to customers. It's easy enough to get all documents in the 'items' collection. And if I wanted the customers to be able to sort by categories I can simply use filter() for client side field validation.

But what if I wanted to further optimize the reads I'm using up? I've thought about using limit() to either paginate or lazy load items in the menu so that at least the customer won't be getting all documents at once. However, since only the first *n* documents are loaded in, I can't properly use filter() since it will only show, say, items with a category of ""meat"" within the first *n* documents currently loaded as opposed to the first *n* items in the collection with category == ""meat"".

I've also thought about combining where() and limit() to get items of a specific category and maybe incrementally adding those objects to a variable within React. But wouldn't restaurant menus usually start by displaying all items, and give customers the option to sort after? Besides, if I get the first *n* items with no specific category first and then add the first *n i*tems of one category after, won't that run the risk of duplicating objects within the variable? Checking if the document id already exists before adding it in the variable would also defeat the purpose of optimizing my reads as much as possible since we'd still be getting, say, 20 documents for 14 items (if 6 items in the second query already exists in the variable).

I'm sure there are tools meant to solve this exact problem out there and Firebase even recommends services (albeit not free) in acknowledgement of their product's limitations, but I'm curious if anyone in this sub has any ideas or solutions that could help me.

webdev,Are Microservices Feasible for a Budget-Conscious SaaS Project?,"Hi all,

I’m building a SaaS platform and considering whether to use a microservices architecture or stick to a monolithic approach for the initial release. The platform involves several domains, such as user accounts, profiles, search, bookings, notifications, and payments, each of which could theoretically be its own service.

**The Challenge:**  
I’m working with a tight budget, and I also plan to set up multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production), meaning hosting costs will multiply for databases and services. Additionally, I’m currently a solo developer, so while I see microservices as a great learning opportunity, I recognize they might not be strictly necessary for my initial launch.

For context, I expect the launch period to handle no more than 10000 users, and that's if things go absurdly well. I’m not sure at what scale microservices actually make sense in terms of benefits outweighing the added complexity.

One idea I’m exploring is using a single shared database backing domain-based services split into an ECS cluster. This could help me reduce hosting costs while still giving me a microservices-style structure. However, I want to avoid building myself into a corner where a future refactor to full microservices becomes unnecessarily painful.

**Questions:**

1. Is a monolithic architecture a better starting point for a SaaS project with budget constraints and modest user expectations?
2. If I go with a single database backing multiple services, are there pitfalls I should watch out for?
3. If full microservices are worth pursuing, what are the most cost-effective options for hosting databases for each service?
   * Managed cloud databases like AWS RDS or Cloud SQL seem ideal but expensive for multiple services.

I have double checked the endpoint and it looks as it should, and I have contacted formspree support, but it seems I might be missing potential clients (and how could I know what I am missing?) I am not a tech-savy person. Are there simple ways to test the reliability of formspree? Can anyone recommend a better service or method of embedding a contact form?

webdev,"I’m afraid to open source the data for my website, should I be?","I have made a free price comparison website for SaaS dev tools. And as the different categories and all the providers keep growing it will reach a point where keeping this up to date stops scaling time wise for me alone.

The project is still small-ish, but its growing and the requests for adding and updating data is growing as well.

So I’m thinking of open sourcing the pricing data so others can contribute if they want to, to keep the data up to date, and letting people add new categories or providers themselves.

But my worries is that in the day of AI assistants like v0 and bolt, the data source will be used to copy my little site and that it will be overtaken by others.

Is this a legit worry, or is the potential upside of having the tool grow and be a good resource for the community too great?

The target audience is developers so most of them can copy this pretty easily, its not complicated code. It’s the gathering of data that stops the copies I think.

I’ve been thinking of adding APIs for adding data as well, but I dont really think people will use that, what do you think?
