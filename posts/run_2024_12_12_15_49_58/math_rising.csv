math,Will Math always require this much dedication?,"I’m an undergraduate in my last year. Currently taking Complex Analysis, will take Differential Equations next semester. Completed courses in Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Topology, Measure Theory and Graph Theory. I was doing an exercise today, and one of the questions was to prove that a sequence of curves converges uniformly to Koch’s Snowflake. This was one question out of 10, and it took me all day and a little bit of yesterday. The given definition of the sequence of curves wasn’t really rigorous (“here’s the first curve, and the nth curve is obtained by rotating and shrinking this other curve”) so most of the time I was working on it I was trying to wrap my head around getting a “formal” definition of each iteration. And again, it took me the whole day. This isn’t the first time in my studies that it takes me a lot of time to wrap my head around a question. I want to pursue a Master’s degree in pure math - mainly because I love it and I find myself thinking about whatever I learn pretty much all the time. But the amount of dedication and the time I need to invest has been so demanding, and after three years this is really starting to making me feel burned out. I still don’t want to stop, and I do wish to continue in academia. But it’s hard to juggle between the work I have to put in and my personal life. I’ve let go of hobbies and I hardly have time for friends and family, not to mention being tired and mentally exhausted most of the time. Will it always be like this?

math,Why is there no proof of the Church-Turing thesis?,"I heard there is no proof of it, even though it seems obviously. There are proofs of Turing mahines being equivalent to various systems, but according to some people, there is no formal definition for an effective method.

I am assuming that this topic is actually important, and that someone would actually benefit from the Churing-Turing thesis being proven. If that is the case, then whoever would benefit from it must have a formal definition of what an effective method is, since they would need a formal definition just for their brain to be able to think about it. In that case, I don't see why it wouldn't be very hard.

If it's worth anything to you, I came up with an idea for a proof. Wikepedia says that ""\[A finite method\] consists of a finite number of exact, finite instructions."", so I'm assuming that means we have some f:A -&gt; B, where A and B are both finite. Turing machines work with a finite alphabet on a tape, and the alphabet can be mapped to the natrual numbers, so A and B would both be sequences of natural numbers. Since A and B are finite, even if their inner sequences are infinite, we can map them to finite sequences. Therefore, we can replace f with a function that only takes in finite sequences of numbers.

A finite sequence of numbers can be equivalently mapped to a vector. A mapping of any set of vectors to another set of vectors can be represented by a matrix, as long as we pick a mapping with vectors that have the same sizes.

My proof is therefore this:

* Turing machines are equivalent to matrices, if we only look at a specific finite slice of the tape before or after the machine halts.
* Matrices are equivalent to functions that are effectively computable.
* Therefore, turing machines can be mapped to effectively computable functions with the same inputs and outputs.",Simanalix,1hbumro,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hbumro/why_is_there_no_proof_of_the_churchturing_thesis/,2024-12-11 14:26:34,42,0.78,42,0,45,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hbumro
math,"A nice little generalization of the homomophism theorem I ""found""","Of course I didn't really ""find"" it, as I am certain that someone else thought about it centuries ago, but nonetheless, I'd like to present this neat little generalization of the homomophism theorem for groups.

We start with a generalization of group homs. Given two groups `X` and `Y`, we say a **group relation** `R` is a subgroup of the product `X \times Y`. By the closed graph theorem of groups, a map `f: X\rightarrow Y` is a homomorphism iff the graph `\Gamma_f=\{(x,f(x))\}` is a subgroup of `X \times Y`. Thus, group relations can be regarded as a generalization of homomorphisms. You even can compose relations in a natural way such they are mimicking homomorphisms.

Note that this notion is symetrical and more flexible than homs, e.g. it might happen that the elements of `X` are ""related"" to more than one element of `Y` or that only the neutral elements are related to each other.

Either way, for each group relation `R`, we have group homs `p_X` or `p_Y` maping from `R` to `X` or `Y` respectively. Note that since the surjective image of a normal subgroup is still normal, `p_X(ker p_Y)` is normal in `p_X(R)`.

Now to the generalization of the homomorphism theorem. In its classical form it states: ""If we, on the left side, treat elements as equals if they get mapped to the same thing and on the right side only consider the image, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short: ""`X/\ker f \isom f(X)`"".

This theorem - and this is what I ""found"" - can be generalized to the following:

""If we, on the left side, only consider the image of a relation and treat elements as equals if they are related to the same elements and do the same thing on the right, then we have the same object left and right"", or for short:

`p_X(R)/p_X(ker p_Y) \isom p_Y(R)/p_Y(ker p_X)`

If our relation is the graph of a homomorphism, this formula gives us pricisely the classical hmomorphism theorem, but is, as group relations are, more general than this. Which is quite nice.

The proof of this theorem is of course an exercise for the reader ;-) But in all seriousness, it is very much like the proof of the classical version, give it a try if you like.

If any of you have a source where this generalization is stated and there is more to read about the things I called group relations, I'd be more than happy if you'd inform us about that.
