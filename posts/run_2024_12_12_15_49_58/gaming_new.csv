gaming,The intentionally confusing world of laptop GPUs. ,"Like most ppl, I don't have every GPU's capability memorized. I also am unaware of how any given chip will perform at any given TDP. Which makes it awfully difficult to purchase something at the level that I need, and no more, to save money. This is clearly an intentional action by all the major players. Naming chips the same as desktops, not disclosing TDP to the chip in a clear and straight forward manner, changing naming schemes every few gens, these are all anti-consumer actions that increase their sales of higher end options and screw the customer into paying more for what they don't need just to ensure they get what they do need. 

Clearly, none of the big tech companies is going to change their behavior. They have the market cornered, can limit production to increase pricing, and clearly have no further concern than their bottom line. So I think someone independent but in the arena should handle this for them. Someone like steam. 

I see all the reviewers talking about the demands of certain games, and how some chips can handle a game at low TDP because it is ""light weight"". Or how some games are ""more CPU bound"". Or any other gaming euphemism that gets tossed around in game review and laptop reviews. How exactly is the average consumer (who is a casual gamer remember) supposed to know what any of this means. More importantly, how do they know this info about a game prior to purchase?

I don't think it would take that much for Steam to make a chart showing the performance of each chip at each TDP that is available for purchase in mainstream laptops for the last 5 gens of GPU. Then this table could be sectioned off into 10% sections (or even 5% sections) to show which chips will perform at expected level in each section. In this way, every chip with its individual TDP could at least be approximated to give the user an idea of its performance. Each game would then get a rating of 1-10 (or 1-20 if you use 5% sections) to give the customer at a glance the info they need to make an informed decision. This could be displayed right on the game page in the store. So you would know, my laptop is in tier 8 so I could only comfortable play games with an 8 rating or lower. The standards for the rating could be something like able to play at at least 60 fps, 1080p, high settings or whatever arbitrary settings you want. 

Currently I am still using a 2020 Zephyrus G14 with a 2060 max q. I would assume this would probably rate like 6-7 on this scale (pure guess). I was looking at the PX13 with the 4050 @ 95w. I have absolutely no idea if this would be an upgrade, lateral move, or downgrade from what I currently have. It is 2 gens newer so I assume it is better. But it is also a 4050 where my current is a 2060, so that seems like a step backwards. But again, the Max Q is underpowered by a lot. Even though the 4050 can take more juice, it gets 95W (though it is diminishing returns after 100w from what I have seen with 40 series chips. They both have equal VRAM. In the end I assume it is a slight upgrade, but I don't really know. And honestly, is it worth the cash for only like a 10% boost 4 years later?

The whole gaming landscape is already extremely anti-consumer. Companies like Steam have shown in the past that they will buck that trend and work with customers or do things clearly to their benefit unlike so many other gaming companies. I think this would go pretty far in allowing users to make informed decision when it comes to purchasing games or new hardware. 

tldr: Laptop GPUs should be tested and ranked, data compiled into a chart, and given ratings 1-10 to show general GPU capability. This could then be used to inform purchases of games, or purchases of laptops with specific games playability in mind.

gaming,Idea: Ranking games by their devs,"This is an idea I've had for a month or two now, and I can't imagine I'm the first person to suggest something like this:

People want to be able to experience works of art made by artists they like.  But with video games, the art in question is being developed by potentially hundreds or thousands of people, and it's harder to ascribe authorship to any one person.  Yes, AAA gaming still has the rare Hideo Kojima or Sam Lake, but it's more common for people to follow game companies- which is fine in the short term, but once enough developers leave or get laid off, it turns into the Studio of Theseus.  And all the while, the big publishers want us to focus on the franchise itself rather than the people behind it.

So what if you could keep track of all the individual game devs from project to project?  My idea here is a website that would keep track of games and their devs, and be able to compare them based on how many devs are shared.  So for instance you'd be able to select Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, and find out that they shared (wild guess) 85% of the same devs.  The most obvious challenge is how much weight you give to certain devs, since a game's director is probably more responsible for its vision then, say, a guy who modelled some of the enemy bicycles.  I know basically nothing about how responsibility is divided up within a studio, but just for example you could have the director given 25% of the credit, the department heads another 25%, and the remainder split among everyone else.

I feel like a lot of people would have the same kinds of problems with this that they do with systems like RottenTomatoes, but respect for artistic vision in AAA gaming is in such dire straits, I'd think any version of this would be an improvement.",MiloHawkins,1hcn5np,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hcn5np/idea_ranking_games_by_their_devs/,2024-12-12 15:10:54,0,0.37,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcn5np

gaming,Are we ever going to get a sense of normalcy back for the AAA gaming space?,"Just saw a post that explains how Activision has a patent in place for a system that maximizes exposure of players with bought skins towards non-paid skinned players. Just reminds me of how desperately greedy every AAA company as seem to turn into. It's as if 
 
-The push for live service for every single company in the industry. 

-Ubisoft's yearly pumping out of same formulaic copies for every IP they have, becoming worse and worse every time till they get to the point where the entire company is looking to sell

-Xbox's constant fumbling of so many first party studios that they've bought out and subsequently shutdown, that's if they were able to finish their projects and release their flops of games. 

-Sony's obsession for high 
profile/cinematic/high fidelity games to get block buster sales numbers. Apparent push for live service games when single player games were what made them get the lead in the I dustry in the first place. Why does it seem

-Rockstar's refusal to develop any games outside GTA and RDR to utilize their extremely monitored online modes for years/decade to come

-EA's total flop of battlefield/battlefront do to short sighted decisions of the company, and there entire scorched earth approach towards shutting down so many studios

-So many god damn broken releases with studios having to deal with outside forces that always end up prioritizing money so far from the actual quality of the product. Even outside of that, we have constant stories of infighting in long standing studios that one way or another have an inherent lack of direction and leadership to get a working product out. This makes the lack of quality in a lot of games an issue involving terrible leadership in developer studios as much as outside interference from share holders.

Can make the list twice as long but you get the picture. It's crazy just how fucked the industry is, especially with how many studios have shut down during and after COVID, and I honestly don't believe the aftermath of COVID has had the most affect in this regard. These companies have been going down this route throughout the late 2010's and took it to overdrive this generation. I mean just look how far Sony has fallen from before, it's good damn mind blowing how much they are fumbling this generation, it's as if anyone in the company with any sense of the industry were lobotomized. 

With the pending recession thats bound to happen soon, along with the aftermath of so many studios shutting down in the past 5 years, I feel like decades of progression and development of the industry itself from now to at least the 90's is going to be totally lost. There are a handful of high profile leaders in the thick of it that are rumored to be developing new studios as we speak, but the economy is turning to shit and these kinds of studios need proper funding to get through and I just don't think many publishers are going to have reasonable demands anytime soon.

I can't help but to feel we aren't going to back to a sense of normalcy in the AAA space. We got some AA studios that have show up, plenty of indie's, but I for one miss the kind of quality, tightly and fully developed games we used to have back in the ps2-ps3/xbox-xbox360 and some of the PS4 eras (where the momentum for monitizaion really picked up). I personally don't believe the amount of indie's, majority of them on early access most of its life on the market, makes up for the lack of experiences we used to have before hand in the gaming space. And I don't believe that's speaking with rose-tinted glasses, as much as reddit likes to preach otherwise.",NamedFruit,1hc87kj,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hc87kj/are_we_ever_going_to_get_a_sense_of_normalcy_back/,2024-12-12 00:11:19,0,0.27,0,0,47,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hc87kj

gaming,"Thoughts on a game mechanic i had. ""Editing""","I love storytelling. Whether its movies or games.

Id even say that the interactive medium perfected the way stories could be told.

That being said we as gamers have our classics of story games.

Sadly a lot of them are dated by game mechanics and gameplay loops/pacing. 

Also the modern ""remake/remaster"" approach of today actually causes a lot more problems than making the initial game perfect.

For me its like. I love AC and the batman arkham games.

But hate the remaster for not fully doing what they were supposed to do.

I love the quality of live improvements like the gameplay in that being better. The world looking gorgeous.

But then the developers of those games remasters botched the cut scenes and made them ugly.

On one end their good. And on the other it would be great if they turned back to the original.

And i started thinking.

Im a big fan of ""fanedits of movies"". For the people who don't know what that is.

Fanedits are well..edits...by fans of movies where said fan cut or added scenes from a movie to make said movie better.

Whether is pacing or else.

What if games had this feature after your first play through. Making certain passages shorter. Choosing art direction form either version

Idk how that would work as far was the developers budget or time. 

OR...if that would even work.

But to it would be like a chapter menu. Where you can delete long gameplay section that just wasnt for you. Ect....

To make future play throughs easier.

Just a random thought. Curious to what you think.

gaming,Why are most new games that aren’t AAA titles coming out as early access?,Don’t get me wrong there are a few gems that are still in early access that are well worth the buy. My biggest issue is a lot of these games shouldn’t even be released because they’re early alpha builds at best. Damn near unplayable due to numerous bugs and glitches. I know deadlines and impatient shareholders are some reasons for early access releases. I just wish devs would go back to the way things used to be and release the finished game on launch. Early access to me feels like a cop out where the dev can keep a small team working on the game for its future updates. Then use the rest of the dev team to start working on their next game.

gaming,Why doesn't Steam get involved in Android Gaming/Emulation?,"Mobile gaming is appareantly the biggest market in gaming: [Global increase State of Mobile Gaming Industry | GO-Globe](https://www.go-globe.com/state-of-mobile-gaming-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20the%20Mobile,2.8%20billion%20mobile%20gamers%20worldwide.). The reasons are clear. Everyone has a smartphone, but not everyone has a PC fit for gaming or a console. So the obstacles for getting into gaming are pretty low.

Sadly the Playstore mainly constists of garbage games, with a free-2-play and in-app-store monetization model. This model does not aim for good gameplay, but for pulling your money out of your pocket. There are some pearls standing out, like Dead Cells, Slay the Spire and so on, which are direct ports of their pc/console counterparts, but as they have upfront cost, appareantly the big mass does not want them or does not find them in the pile of thrash, that the Playstore is. Since they don't generate enought revenue, the willingness of other publishers to port their already existing games to Android is also neglectable.

Now comes the neat part: If you checkout r/EmulationOnAndroid , basically the whole gaming history, with the exception of the latest consoles, is available on Android through emulation. Using **Winlator** or similar, it is even possible to emulate PC games, without much hassle. I have seen videos of Skyrim, Witcher 3 and even Cyberpunk getting played on High End Android devices. Since this is possible, this eleminates the need for porting games, you can just play the PC version, if you want to. As i understood it, the Steam Deck does the same. It creates a compatibility layer for PC games for the Steam Deck hardware/OS, they were not initially made for.

Now comes the big question: Since such feats can be accomplished by just a few developers worldwide, why is lets say Valve/Steam so not interesed in this topic? They already have a mobile app, with Steam Link a powerful editor for mobile controls and the compatibility layer through their Steam OS. If they tie these parts together they could have a third platform, they could distribute their games for. Imagine you buy a game on Steam and you could play it on PC, on the Steam Deck AND on Android!

It is definitely technically feasible, as it was already shown by others. So why does no one use that potential?",dibade89,1hbntng,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hbntng/why_doesnt_steam_get_involved_in_android/,2024-12-11 06:57:57,0,0.1,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbntng

Unfortunately, Pathfinder was also a tactical RPG D&amp;D style with all the elements i can't suffer in games.

gaming,Revisiting classics can be heartbreaking sometimes,"For example, I’ve recently reinstalled Battlefield 1. I had some major memories with this game as I used to take my PlayStation over to my friends house every Friday night and we used to sit there with two monitors so it was as close to split screen as it gets. For those that are familiar with the game type “Operations” you’ll know what I’m talking about when I say THAT was the game mode you would play. It was both hectic and chaotic all at once.

Coming back to it now there’s just no player base numbers to fill up the lobby so you have to resort to smaller games in different modes like “frontlines”. Makes me think about all the classics shutting down or just not having a player base anymore like rainbow six vegas 2 and Halo 3. I feel these games live forever in our memories but sometimes trying to go back to them just feels so different. Almost like revisiting a house you used to live in. You have the memories but it’s just not home anymore. I think that’s the bitter sweet thing with online games these days….

gaming,My thoughts on TGA Nominees having now played them,"I finally played all of the TGA GOTY nominees thanks to Black Friday deals and I wanted to share my thoughts as award season approaches 

Balatro (9/10)

This game is a masterclass in deceptively simple design and It’s astonishing how easy to lose hours to its “one more run” hook. 

If you’ve avoided it because you think it’s “just poker” or “just a card game,” you’re seriously missing out and doing yourself a disservice. It’s a deeply engaging experience that I think you should try if you haven’t 

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (9/10)

While there’s some debate about its eligibility, for me personally there’s no denying that SOTE delivered one of the absolute best gaming experiences of the year. 

This expansion earns a spot on my Mount Rushmore of DLCs, right alongside Blood and Wine, Shivering Isles, and Phantom Liberty.

Astro Bot (9.5/10)

This. Game. Fucks.

As a fan of classic Nintendo 3D platformers, this felt like a love letter to the genre with a modern twist. 

My only complaint with the game is that I just wanted more of it at the end of the short run time to a platinum trophy. 

The final challenge run and the themed X, Square, Circle, and Triangle levels were brilliant and I’d kill for more levels of that difficulty and quality

If this game was just an appetizer, I can’t wait to see what Team Asobi has in store for the main course. If not for my ultimate favorite this year, this would have been my pick for GOTY.

Black Myth: Wukong (7.5-8/10)

While I enjoyed my three playthroughs of BM: W, I don’t think it quite reaches the same level as the other nominees. 

That said, for the developers’ first big swing, this is a fucking crazy impressive showing. I’m excited to see where they go next as this was an incredibly solid starting point and a downright great game in its own right 

Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (8.5/10)

As a huge fan of the original FF VII, the remake series has been a delight for me. 

The visuals are stunning, and it’s fucking sweet seeing the locations I remember in full 3D recreations. 

However for me it ultimately suffers from some modern open-world fatigue (developers seriously need to retire map towers and their equivalents lmao) 

Despite that, it’s a standout gaming experience, and I can’t wait for Part 3.

Metaphor: ReFantazio (9.5/10)

Jesus Christ, this game.

The characters, world-building, and narrative are utterly fantastic. 

At 40 hours in, it’s easily my GOTY—though, of course, a poorly executed ending could change that. 

My only (minor) gripe is that the soundtrack, while great, doesn’t quite hit Persona levels of perfection.

Final Rankings:
1.	Metaphor: ReFantazio
2.	Astro Bot
3.	Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
4.	Balatro
5.	Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
6.	Black Myth: Wukong

gaming,I’ve Had Enough of The Diablo 4 and PoE 1 &amp; 2 Discourse,"About a month ago I got back into Diablo 4 and while it’s not perfect by any means it’s a fun, turn your brain off, action RPG. While playing for a month I remembered I pre-order POE2 early access a while back and also was incredibly excited to try it out.

Since then I’ve been switching back and forth between them and have been having a blast because ultimately I understand, that while they occupy the same genre, they are two completely different types of ARPG.

Diablo 4 is a fast paced power fantasy with a lot of high quality polish. POE2 is the spiritual successor of the Diablo 2 formula. It’s a slower more methodical ARPG that requires more thought, with a lot of customization for how you want your builds.

Both are serviceable to their audiences, and both have incredibly loyal fanbases. An while comparisons are inevitable and fair in some cases. Certain sects of each fanbase, like children, look for constant opportunities to shit on the other acting as if there is this “one true” ARPG.

The ARPG community is similar to the JRPG community in that, you have these incredibly vocal voices, who do not make up the majority of players, set these arbitrary “rules” on what constitutes a true game of the genre. So anything that goes against these “rules” is deemed as not a “true” this or that. 

Which then creates this very negative, and unhealthy mindset, that limits your ability to accept anything new or genre pushing. To someone like me, this type of behavior is shallow and embarrassing. Not to mention it’s hypocritical given that most ppl like games within genre for different reasons.

gaming,"I don't know if a game like this exists, but I'm looking for suggestions. ","Hey everyone, I'll try to keep this as concise as I possibly can. I am looking for a game to play to scratch an itch that I have and I don't know if a game like it exists, but here we go.

MUST HAVES:

- A talent/skill system that allows for high build variety. Something between Elden Ring and PoE.
- Multiplayer. Not so much in MMO, maybe MMOlite, or something that doesn't rely on multiplayer, but supports it and is an integral part of the game.
- Character Customization. Doesn't have to be super in depth.
- Somewhat active community. I don't want to play a game that's practically dead. 


OPTIONAL FEATURES:

- PvP. I can take it or leave it but it will be cool if it had something like it. 
- Base Building. Again, same as above, would be cool if it had it but okay if it doesn't. 

There it is.

gaming,Can someone explain the Indiana Jones hype right now?,"I downloaded it yesterday on my Xbox, and I have to say it’s a pretty mediocre experience for me so far. But the consensus seems to be that it’s going to be GOTY, with people just giving high praise to it.  I feel like I’m missing out on something that’s keeping me from enjoying it. 

My major complaints with this game are that it feels more like an interactive story where I sometimes get to open doors by pressing X and then moving my thumbstick to the left.  When I finally get to see some actual gameplay, it’s mostly stealth. Indiana Jones should be an adventure game, not a stealth game.   Combat when it happens is okay but there’s way better combat in games out there. 

The one thing I do like about combat is there’s lots of options for weapons just lying around that can be easily picked up.  Another thing that’s really the only thing keeping me playing is that the story feels like a real Indiana Jones story, so I keep playing just to find out what happens next. 

Anyway I’m not here to hate on the game, I’m just trying to find out why people love it so much. If I understood that maybe I’d enjoy it more too.  In the meantime I feel like this is a game I’ll play once and never pick up again.

Along with a PS3 hooked up to play some older exclusives. I've never owned a gaming PC but have played PC games back in the early to mid 2000's. I wasn't really concerned with PC gaming up until I got the Steam Deck and was floored with the how cool and versatile it is. I also have a Steam Deck Dock so I can hook it up to my TV. It does well for what I use it for. But I think I would like to get a gaming PC to play some older games but with much higher resolution and frames. I also was super impressed by Steam sales, people are not lying when they say you can rack up a library for the price of one game on PlayStation or Xbox. I also have both ps plus premium, and xbox game pass ultimate. So I'm not missing any online action when it comes to those systems. But if I could play online for free on PC for most games, that would save me money in the long run. Plus I think I would like to have options ultimately.

Using the opening scene of the first movie as a tutorial is ingenious. Puzzles and actions are good, but I do not think that is what is going to make or break the game. I am hoping for great set pieces and a good story (which is what the reviews said it has).

I have xbox game pass ultimate, so this is already include in the sub but so far (which admittedly I am not that deep into the game yet) I like it.

I think we need more single player, well written narrative based, AAA adventure games. A very much fresh take from the online service games that become more like a job, or the souls like ""can't-beat-without-practice-for-weeks"" beat-them-ups.

gaming,Why people act like every Xbox game is on PlayStation right now?,"Dont get me wrong guys, i get all the talk and i especially get the doubt (now everything is an ""what if this goes to PS at some point, and i get it)

And i also dont really care about esclusivity at all, im a all platform owner and i would like to own just one lol.

But recently, especially when people ask what console to buy, i've noticed that people tend to say like ""PlayStation since it has Xbox games anyway""

Now, it is true that they've ported some games here and there, and we have some future games confirmed, but as it is now is **far** from having any decente number to say ""all"". 

Just looking at this year, Xbox released 5 fp games (not counting Ara on PC). Of these, only 1 is multiplatform. And is Cod, a game that was always multiplatform. Indiana Jones will be multiplatform but is a 4-6 months exclusive, still i can see the point.

But also looking at next year, out of 6 announced fp games, only 2 are confirmed for PlayStation and yet again they where always multiplatform. Cod and Doom.

I think is kind of dishonest to push people to a console with the promise of playng everything when is clearly not true. You cant play Starfield on PlayStation, you cant play Halo, you cant play Gears, Flight Sim, Age of Mythology, Hellblade 2, Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, Towerborne ecc.

I get that they might get ported in the future, but that's a theory and not a fact.

Anyway, enjoy gaming on all platform!

gaming,This New Indy Game Has Led Me To Believe a Good 007 Game May Be Possible,"Put some time into this new Indy game today and I gotta say that they've really nailed the feel of ""being"" Indiana Jones. The game's cleverness and great storyline (so far) have me feel like I'm in the midst of a real Indiana Jones movie, and it's easily the best Indy content of the 2000s. I'm enjoying it so much that it got me thinking of another movie franchise that I have been wishing could return to the glory days..... 007.

  
GoldenEye is obviously considered a high mark of the series and the N64 era, but I, as a fan of the series, even enjoyed the Nightfire, Agent Under Fire and even the terrible multiplayer of Quantum of Solace on the 360. Bond, like Indiana Jones, is a great protagonist/seires that when written well, could have an amazing return to console. While movie licensing has typically meant awful games for the past few decades, this launch is giving me hope that out there is an opportunity to ""be"" James Bond in a well-developed and modern adaptation that I think is sorely missing from our current gaming world. Ideally, if we could see something that grabs a little inspiration from the Hitman games as well, I could die a happy man!

gaming,Easy open world games like Mario Odyssey?,"My five year old son loves video games and while I’ve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I’ve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There’s basically no way to play that game wrong. It’s a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There’s a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.

We’ve tried some other games to varying success, but I’m looking for more options. We are also somewhat system agnostic as I have the means to provide him with different systems.

1. Kirby and the forgotten lands: probably his second favorite. Very youngster friendly. However, it’s not a sandbox and the linear nature frustrated him sometimes (no going backwards, game forces you in a certain direction).

2. Super Mario world 3d and bowser’s fury: the difficulty was a bit too high for 3d world after the first world and suffers the same linear design issue. Bowsers fury was great but ultimately short for him.

3. Animal crossing new horizons: youngster friendly art and design but honestly not in game play. It seems simple, but is heavy on reading and understanding the motivations of progression (paying off your house, earning money, etc.) it also has the issue of not being able to start from scratch and my island is already pretty decked out. He can start his own tent but the island is still the same as my decked out one.

4. Yoshi’s crafted world: great difficulty for kids but again… not open world

5. Captain Toad Tracker: fun bit too difficult as the puzzles get harder

6. Sonic frontiers: way to clunky. He lost interest pretty much right away because of terrible controls.

7. Zelda: breath of the wild: too difficult for him for progression

8. Pokémon: his reading needs to be polished a bit more for him to really get it.

9. Spider-Man: Miles Morales: hilariously is super fun for him to just swing around the city. He even started getting good at fighting, but the puzzles grind him to a halt and then I have to play all those parts.

Anybody have any suggestions that I’ve missed?

gaming,Multiplayer Teamwork/Minigame Game Recommendations?,"I have grown exhausted of all the ""kill the other people!"" Games. A lot of them are great, well made games. Don't get me wrong. But, I am sick of the sweat. The skill ceilings and the absurd amount of stress they can sometimes bring about instead of joy. I work a full-time job and have fully accepted I will never be on the same level as someone who's either naturally gifted (which I am not), or has the majority of their day to practice (which I do not). So, I ask in hopes that some of you might have some amazing recs!

When I say MP Teamwork, I mean things like Vermintide 2. Deep Rock. Ready or Not. Phasmophobia. The list goes on forever, but I hope you get what I mean. The mission of the game is not ""Kill the other people!"" It is ""All of you are on the same team, working towards the same goal."" Or hell, the examples I listed were just violent (for a lack of a better word) games. Chill games like Party Animals, or other ""minigame"" style experiences are also welcome!

Multiplayer is my favorite type of game to play. I am incredibly anti-social in real life despite wanting social interaction, so it's nice to sit back and play games with other people. It creates this sphere where I am interacting and hanging out with others, but there's really no pressure, and it's a bubble I like to exist in. Thus my preference for it over singleplayer games. But, trying to find games like the ones I'm searching for-outside of the ones I already listed-feels like pulling teeth.

This game is one of the most brilliant games I ever played. And a short one, which I appreciate having now a toddler. 
What a wonderful time to be alive to play such an awesome piece of art. Lucas Pope if you ever read this, I'll pay you a drink, whenever.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

For me this game was as marking as Outer Wilds, or Subnautica. Two games with surprising aspects you shouldn't know about prior to playing them.

Yes they have screwed up a couple of times over the last year chasing trends in the free to play marked, trying to be both the new trendsetters with Roller Champions and BattleCore Arena while still trying to take players from Fortnite and Warzone with Xdefiant.   
  
But besides that, they have also released a bunch of good and great games in form of Assassins Creed: Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla and Mirage, Far Cry 5 and 6, Rainbow Six Siege, The Crew 2 and Motorfest, Riders Republic, Anno 1800, Prince of Persia, TrackMania, Settlers, Star Wars Outlaws and more. Yes, not all aspects with Outlaws was great, but in the end it was a good game, that has gotten better with the latest patches. 

And there lies the flaws with UbiSoft today, their shareholders demanding a quick return on their investment, not allowing the devs to actually do their job and create something and finish it, but half ass it out the pipeline, just as the majority of AAA have been doing the last couple of years. Because when we all got house arrest during the pandemic, and start buying games along with new generation of consoles, wall street suddenly understood that it might be some money to earn on us geeks out here. 

But what they failed to understand is that quality and art takes time, unlike Ford and Apple who can crounch out x amount of cars and phones each hour. So when they investment didnt return a profit the next morning, they started to push on the companies, that again started to push their devs, who in return needed to push unfinished builds to marked. So when we yell at AAA devs creating bad products, we should instead yell at the finance in the background for not having the patient too wait for a complete product.

This false narrative is being abused more than ever by industry leaders. We want to change the direction the industry is heading so that sufficient hardware is not buried for the sake of unnecessary hardware sales and mass consumer manipulation. But we need both gamers and developers more aware of this massive industry oxymoron.""
""Key words:
TAA, Upscaling, Fake Optimization, Blessing or Curse,
Hybred, DLSS, DLAA""


So this video about how most game studios are offloading development costs onto your GPUs and I wanted to spread the word about it.
I'd like to hear from some people about why this could not be true, but specifically from Design oriented background individuals who deal with graphics design. 

TAA in my opinion is the worst looking one and always made my PC lose a ton of frames instead of using fxaa or something but the visual quality and detail games have done according to this video is that extreme TAA is almost necessary due to it being relied on entirely to mask how badly rendered things are. Other than that, the optimization standard is for 30 fps so that is mainly what games apparently are optimization for as a standard in the industry buy mainly if those games are on console. What would the gaming industry projects look and play like if the standard for optimization was at 120 or higher FPS?",Placzkos,1h9luw7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9luw7/fake_optimization_in_modern_gaming_and_how_we/,https://youtu.be/lJu_DgCHfx4?si=OknaXDpQtMpEojEr,2024-12-08 15:58:52,0,0.45,0,0,77,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5kHodCQXPcqQsvzOqdjkBGHZXF462rAD86T-WDi53eU.jpg,t3_1h9luw7

Like I wish I could go back to looking at the screen and thinking ""how tf does that work??"".

gaming,"Don't Be Me, Save Your Game (SMTV:Vengeance)","I'm a fool. So I played and beat SMTV when it came out on Switch a while back. I liked it a lot and bought Shin Megami Tensei V:Vengeance on steam while it was on sale this past week. 

I was lulled into a false sense of security because the last two games I played were Metaphor and P3R both which have some level of auto-saving.

I was starting my playthrough of SMTV and going around and eventually get to this one red enemy that they warned me were strong. Well the first red one I fought I defeated easily so I thought it was no big deal. Engage this second one and in it's opening move it hits my whole team with an Almighty attack and wipes me out in one go.

I lost 2 1/2 hours of gameplay lol. First time in a long time I've lost that much gameplay it nearly brought tears to my eyes lol. I had gathered so many demons and leveled them. *sigh*

I know SMTV Vengeance adds some new stuff so I don't know if these red enemies are new or not, it's been so long I forgot most of the original game.

Anyway...make sure to regularly save. What's making me kick myself is I recently had passed a save point and I'm in hindsight mode of WHY DIDNT I SAVE?!

Needless to say I learned my lesson the hard way. At least it was early in the game.

gaming,Nintendo Switch Lite or Xbox Series S for my kids' Christmas ,"I have three kids(9, 6, 6), one already has a Switch lite.  
I went to a pawn shop and they have two Switch Lites going for $75 each or an Xbox Series S going for $149.

Our household uses both Gamepass and Nintendo online subscriptions.  
I already personally have a Switch and Xbox Series X, so the kids could use my Gamepass subscription or even play on my Xbox maybe, but I want to get them something they can play whenever they want.

My kids mostly play Minecraft on their Amazon tablets.

Which one should I get? My wife is worried our oldest would take over the Xbox, but there are tons of Gamepass games on there. All three seemed to work fine when I tested them, one of the Switches had some cosmetic damage(like a bite or indention in the corner??) and the Xbox seemed a bit dusty in the vents, but I'm sure I can clean that and put a case on the Switch.

I feel odd buying used stuff for Christmas presents, but these seem like really good deals.

Should I even get either option? I'm a bit worried something could be wrong with either system.  
There was something sticky on one of the switches, but I was going to clean it up real good if I got it.

The Xbox I also don't know how to check if it's banned already and I would have to get controllers.  
The Switches I would need protective cases, screen protectors and games are more expensive outside of gamepass.

gaming,Game console just for LAN?,"EDIT: Some people keep saying other companies CAN do this already. Yes they CAN but they aren't. There are many reasons why they don't but that is a different discussion. 

Also, to reiterate, I'm talking about a game console, not a PC. This means a curated OS specifically engineering for local play, controller driven, self contained system. 

The difference here isn't just the console but the licensing relationships and inhouse development studios that enable this console to function as intended. 

=================

Would you be interested in a game console that was specifically marketed for local multiplayer?

priced similar to a switch, and whose games are specifically made with couch co-op, local system link multiplayer, and LAN parties in mind. 

This specific market segment has been long abandoned and I believe there is a desire, especially among older and much younger gamers, to play games together. 

The system would leverage existing local multiplayer title licenses along with building a strong portfolio of purpose developed games. The idea would be to leverage inhouse studio licensing at higher rate fees for 2nd party systems to help cover the cost of the console. The inhouse studios would also help ensure continuity of local multiplayer cross-console play.

gaming,Choices matter hell...,"I have a very big issue with this type of games.

It's not a rule, but more often than not it completely breaks the game for me.

My problem with those games, is that in most cases you get locked out of part of the content, based on the decisions you made.

In my opinion this is a very poor game design, artificially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs, if you want to see complete content.

As I never do more than one playthrough of any single player game, I feel somewhat robbed of a full experience.

Another complaint that I could log, is that at their launch many of these games are not balanced well enough, meaning if you pick a ""wrong"" side, you might be underpowered, compared to others.

This inherently leads me to not playing them until at least one or two major patches land, or I might skip them completely, if they fall off my radar.

If I am being completely honest, I would also have to blame my OCD, for wanting to see, and do, everything there is in every game I play, and wanting to min-max my character(s) each time.

Anyone else out there, with similar issues?   

Edit: based on early comments, I want to elaborate.

gaming,Bring Back Good Co-Op Games,"Marvel Rivals came out. Was pretty cool for like 15 minutes and then I just felt kinda bored and a little sad. 

I’ve been playing games since the 80s and idk, I’m just tired of PvP stuff. Really missing the cooperative games of old.

I remember stuff like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or Left 4 Dead or Gauntlet Legends or Halo or even Destiny or the arcade beat em ups like X-men or the Simpsons or Turtles game when it first came out and these games were just so epic and fostered such great teamwork and camaraderie. Helluva dope feeling and rush having to work together to win. Especially back in the days of arcades, nothing cooler than actually assembling 4 people dedicated to pulling it off.

Idk. Everything just feels so competitive, battle royale, hero shootery, and it’s just beginning to feel unnecessary and kinda forced and stale.

Maybe I’m just feeling nostalgic and outta touch lol but I feel like bringing these kinds of great co-op games back in a modern sense in actual abundance would really inject some love and positive vibes back into the community while also, bringing in a whole new demographic of gamers looking for something less demanding and stressful than PvP gaming which I feel like is just low key bloating the market at this point.

P.S. this is no dig Marvel Rivals or to gamers that enjoy these games, I’m just getting this off my chest lol sorry it’s late, I’m high, rant over.

lol nope just a husband, father, business owner and student. I’ve been playing games since the 80s. I know major titles and indie games exist guys no offense lol. Mostly all the ones that have been named so far are not new names to me or games I haven’t tried at some point that just didn’t capture my interest.

Edit: Idk why I’m getting downvoted so much lmao are you taking offense to the fact that I just don’t like the games you’re suggesting as much as you or others do or haven’t played them? 

Idk I think I’ve been pretty respectful about the games I have talked about, even the ones I may not care for as well but idk. Either way, I’ve played Indie game guys. I’ve played games like stardew valley (well technically my wife played and I watched) or warhammer (specifically the vermintide one) and that was honestly years ago. Maybe I’m wrong but, those I don’t feel like are recent games (came out this year) and when I did watch/play them, they weren’t my cup of tea. I guess I should have been specific (like when I mentioned Destiny, I meant specifically the first one as I played 2 and did not care for it as much).

I’m almost 40 and a pretty avid gamer blessed to be able to play a PLETHORA of games over the last few years through different means (work, personal life, events), with 2 kids and a wife who are all also gamers either various taste whether that be in console (we have most past and present) or game type. I do not live under a rock, maybe a more a pineapple under the sea and my only burden is the business of life but, I’ve still found time to do my gaming and follow my hobbies (for business/pleasure) so I’m not completely out the loop.

I’ve had some great suggestion here to help solidify the push to try certain titles (maybe the art style has been putting me off or mechanics or story didn’t capture me) that I have been putting off or stayed away from. And I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and even opinions but let’s not trip on each other off of video games. The post was meant to just be light hearted and random, not this deep dive into my personal gaming preferences or an attack on others interest lol. 

From one gamer to another, let’s try to foster more positivity and cohesion so we gamers don’t always have to carry the title of toxic and negative and build a more appealing and inviting community.

gaming,Marvel Rivals unpopular opinion ,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, I've been waiting since the first play test for the game to release, but between godwaful matchmaking and low-key pretty unbalanced hero's, I think I'd rather play overwatch 

Sure, there's something to be said about running around as spider man punching dudes into the sky and webbing them up, or using Loki's decoys to escape and punish people, but overall the balance on character abilities feels extremely lacking. 

Like why is punishers ultimate so broken, but scarlet witch needs to be within slapping distance to get a kill with it, while having a huge red **SHOOT HERE SIGN** on top of you. Making it early impossible to use even if you get the drop on people.

That's not to me to mention the amount of times Hawkeye has one shot me across the map, or how groots stun ability lasts like 10x as long as Wanda's. 

Just feels like after that many play tests, the balancing should have been in a better spot at launch.

gaming,Initial Marvel Rival Thoughts?,"I’ve only put about 3-4 hours into Marvel Rivals last night, so it’s still really early, and I don’t have any real definitive opinions yet.

But my initial thoughts are more so about how great of an initial “free to play, GaaS package” this game is starting out as.

These past few years have been pretty rough for new GaaS titles with the majority of them outright failing.

Now there’s different reasons for these failures, that are unique to the titles themselves. 

But I am really impressed that NetEase clearly “read the room” and ensured that a lot of quality of life aspects are in Rivials day one. Which is sadly far from the norm with GaaS titles. 

Not to mention this is probably one of the best performing GaaS titles to come out in a long time. I didn’t wait at all to get into matches, no lag, no replay in inputs. 

Overall I’m pretty positive on Rivals for now.

So my nephew - 12, m - is getting a PS5 from his parents. He's historically gamed on the Switch, and he (and I) LOVES the Legend of Zelda series. We've played BoTW and ToTK together, and regularly share tips, tricks, and advice.

I want to get his something for his PS5 that he'll enjoy, I'm looking for: open-world, lots of content to explore, appropriate levels of violence and language (he'll be playing it in the same room as his mom/my sister; I don't want it to be over the top), and fun. Something that someone who loves Zelda will be into.

Teardown is a game where you can destroy anything and everything. It’s the perfect vandalism/heist game too. But I do not recommend the DLC’s. Most are hit or miss. But there is a modding community that frequently makes new content for others to play.

As for Children of the Sun. It’s a game where you have one single Sniper Rifle bullet, and you must make the bullet change trajectory to kill multiple enemies. 

Think of it like the Sniper Elite games, but it’s also a puzzle as well. You have to find out the best path and use shortcuts to your advantage.

gaming,Ghost of Yotei pushback,"So, the latest anti-woke controversy is brewing, and it's giving me a lot of amusement, honestly.

Not gonna delve too far into Ghost of Tsushima because I haven't personally played it, so I'm not able to offer my own opinion on its gameplay or quality, but it was generally highly acclaimed.

Now, following the successful launch of a new IP, the obvious goal for gaming companies is to turn it into a franchise, so a sequel started getting discussed almost before the ink dried on the sales reports. 

Sony just had their - otherwise honestly lackluster - press event to announce upcoming products. 

One of those products was the intended sequel, Ghost of Yotei. As opposed to a direct sequel to the first game, continuing the story specifically of the male protagonist of the first game, Jin Sakai, Sony opted to turn the Ghost series into more of a related anthology apparently; Yotei follows a new character, a female samurai named Atsu.

And there was considerable backlash about that sequel, which Sony apparently didn't expect. 

That backlash has split into three slightly overlapping camps; I'll discuss two before zoning in on one specifically.

The first, and honestly the most reasonable and valid of them, is the gamers who were specifically looking for a continuation of Jin's story. Disappointment there is totally understandable; regardless of how complete a story is, if you are invested in the character, you want there to be more. More time with them, more insight into them, more story about them, more interaction with them, more. 

Since Yotei is still in development, we don't know how much of that there is. It's entirely possible that Sony is taking a page from Mad Max here and using the first game as an origin story for someone who then appears as a recurring character in other people's stories; we *do not know.*

But that viewpoint, that **""we wanted more Jin and this isn't that, wtf""** is the sane people objection to the announcement.

Second is objection to the voice actress. This is less reasonable but comprehensible, because Erika Ishii is a known and outspoken activist. This doesn't affect their voicework in the game one tiny bit - and the people who have discussed it so far have said it is absolutely top notch - but if you disagree with someone's personal stances, disapproving of their choice for your media is understandable.

For me, Erika is a fantastic choice; if you're not familiar, they are on Dimension 20 and a lot of other Dropout network stuff, and is a fairly prominent activist for LQBTQIA+ rights, but they're also immensely talented, creative, and funny. Especially on Dimension 20 you can see this; their characters are usually only second to Emily Axford's routinely game breaking creativity in terms of their impact, and despite their often super extra appearance on the show, they are very very good at submerging herself into the character, which is honestly literally the entire goal of voice acting for video games.

So, the people who are objecting to the game based on Erika have, you know, no taste and are also bigots, but at least it's a comprehensible sort of consistent bigotry.

The third group of objectors, however, is the one I think is funniest.

Now, I'm gonna reveal something totally unimportant that actually I promise will be sort of relevant: in video games, I almost always play a female character. *(In fact, one of my very few actual gaming regrets involves this; right after launch, I decided to play Genshin Impact with two accounts, one for each Traveler, and the account playing as Aether, the male Traveler, got so much luckier in the gacha that I ultimately ended up with that as my main account, and I'd frankly much rather be playing as Lumine.)*

My reasoning is, maybe silly, but very simple: I think girls are pretty. If I'm gonna be playing a game for hours on end and staring at a single character the whole time, I'd rather be looking at a girl. Not because I identify as a girl, but because I think looking at girls is a lot more fun than looking at other guys.

So, the third group of people who are objecting to Ghost of Yotei is entirely made up of guys, who are objecting on the exclusive grounds that they don't want to play a female character.

Unlike the other two reasons for objecting to the game, which while not necessarily reasonable are at least based on something that's a real thing, these guys are objecting based on the fact that a virtual avatar - an inherently unreal, sexless thing made of pixels - is shaped with slightly more curves. 

In other words, they're so utterly dedicated to staring at male bodies that the idea of looking at a female body makes them utterly revolted.

Now, as a guy who likes looking at girls, I gotta say, even as heterosexual as I am, I can't imagine being *offended* that I had to look at a guy; the most I can muster would be *disinterest.*

And that's what makes this so funny for me.

Can you even imagine *how* gay you have to be, to be willing to start a huge flame war online over the idea that you might have to *not* stare at a male for hours and hours on end for the entire duration of your gameplay?

That's way gayer than I am straight, man.

They keep saying it's ""woke"" or ""DEI"" as cover.

But y'all.

They're really saying that they *hunger* for those tasty man butts.

That's fucking funny.

gaming,"Open World Games For PS4 That Feel Drenched In Melancholy Despite Not Necessarily Being A ""Sad Story""?","I know this sort of question has been asked many times, but this is my spin on it. As the title says, I'm not looking for a game with a ""sad story"", but rather an open world game where the world, music, overall atmosphere, and the protagonist just feel drenched in a deep sense of melancholy/sadness. I think a good example of what I'm looking for is Red Dead Redemption 1... despite what happens in the end, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a ""sad story"", but rather a story that gives this overwhelming sense that the world is changing, the old ways are dying, and you are powerless to stop it. Just simply stopping to stand somewhere in the middle of the desert plains, and hearing the haunting music in RDR1 gives this feeling, like the whole game just has this constant, overhanging thick layer of melancholy, no matter where you go. In other words, it's as if the world itself is sad.

gaming,Quick review of (almost) all current mini bluetooth controllers!,"Images here: https://imgur.com/a/SZ3VbEy


I love local multiplayer and the easiest way to find people for it is on the go. Lugging around proper full size controllers* would be a chore, and with micro size I can always have even 4 without thinking.

So for starters: my use case is quick plays, 30-90 minutes. Using these regularly for long time would get uncomfortable (and carpal-tunnely I suppose).

The landscape of small controllers is pretty dire to be honest: 8BitDo (for a long time the only option) and rando chinese suppliers.



**8BitDo Lite 2**

It has every button from a classic PS/Xbox layout - including stick click/L3+R3. High quality plastics. Shoulder and trigger button placement is genius and usable. Joystick has a good movement area. Clicks and presses are exquisite. Size is great for the hand, and still light. This is the one controller I could imagine being usable in daily gaming even.

This would be my dream controller. IF it had XInput. Unrelated, but I'm mighty pissed at 8BitDo for not including this with newer models. Yes, these are all aimed for the Switch, but it would have costed next to nothing to add one more mode. Vibration also only works in Switch mode. Yes you can remap with XOutput and the like, but it's a hassle and strangely does not work in every game.

Modes: Switch, Android
Verdict: so close to be perfect, but not reaching it


**8BitDo Zero 2**

My current go-to mini controller. Has XInput. Sadly charges via micro usb (all other are usb-c). No vibration. Buttons feel right. The L/R button is clickable from all directions despite the length, but not really comfortable - which isn't a problem, this size is only used for simple layout games anyway. I wish it would have toggle for modes, there is no visible sign in which it is (toggle is via shortcut combinations).

There is now also a Micro with the same layout as the Q36 below - not ordered becaus missing XInput and I had enough of that after Lite 2)

Modes: Switch, Android, Windows
Verdict: ol' trusty working horse, shows it's age

**LinYuvo Meteor**

Now this is an interesting animal. You can order it for less than half the zero. It has bajillions of color options - I suggest ordering the covered ones, as the LEDs are so bright that you wouldn't want to use them on transparent versions, despite them looking cool as well. It has a circular dpad which I'm neutral about. For some it's easier to hit corners, but it's not as easy as eg. XBox controller's circular one. But it's really clicky, and a bit hard to press, as you can read in the few reviews it has. So dpad is certainly it's biggest drawback. Has vibration. It has a really interesting feature, you can replace keys - dpad with joystick directions and L/R buttons with trigger - without any software, just shortcuts! You can also toggle the light effects and colors, there are quite a few, as gimmick, or turn it off completely (will be remembered).

Verdict: price/features orders of magnitude better than the Zero 2, even Micro. Buttons just don't feel that good, but it's a close call.

**ShanWan Q37**

There exists a version with horizontal and cross (PS and XBox style) joystick placement. You can tell they used CADs from 8BitDo, the inputs have the same appearance - albeit with a very, very cheap plastic. The rounded off body is a bit smaller but thicker and overall harder to hold. But the presses feel ok. There is vibration - both sides even. It has a weird gyro mode in non-switch mode as well where gyro controls the joystick. Can be accidentally triggered and a useless gimmick. But a very welcomed feature is that every single key can be remapped (including this shortcut). It needs a seemingly unrelated mobile app (""GamepadSpace"") - connecting is hacky as you need to enter firmware upload mode - but once done, you are free to customize, even sensitivity, and everything is saved to the controller. This is great, especially since very stupidly in XInput mode the buttons match the switch layout (eg A is B) by default. Until now you would think this is in the endvery ok controller, but you'd be mistaken. Sadly it all falls apart by how incredibly bad quality this controller is. You will get constant disconnects, lag, ghost presses and stuck input. It's just bad, and generic QC issue. I had multiple controllers showing the same sign.

Verdict: It could be the ""good version"" rip-off of 8BitDo, but sadly it's just a mess, and costs the same as 8BitDo.


Modes: Windows/Android, Switch, Playstation

**ShanWan Q36**

The same as Q37, just with copying the 8BitDo Micro form and layout - which makes it even more sad that it's bad.

Modes: Windows/Android, Switch, Playstation


**Keychain controller**

Being available for 8+ years this is more like an afterthought rather than a serious contender, I included it only for fun. But it's by far the smallest you can go! It only has Android and keyboard function. The ""joystick"" is actually moving only on a 2D plane. Very practical and interesting, but a bit hard to move. Buttons are too mushy. But it is useful as a remote, eg. A is mapped to take a photo in Android.

Modes: IOS/Android, Keyboard",poisonborz,1h6svb8,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6svb8/quick_review_of_almost_all_current_mini_bluetooth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h6svb8/quick_review_of_almost_all_current_mini_bluetooth/,2024-12-04 22:15:09,14,0.64,14,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6svb8
gaming,I've become a demotivated gamer,"I often get into a new game that I've looked forward to, either at launch or because of discounts on Steam, but then I play for maybe 2-3 hours, a would-be normal session which I would naturally resume the next day or later in the week except... I don't.

I feel like in 2024 I've started so many games that I intended to play through but as soon as I get the first break from them the thought of booting them up again a day later, or the week after declines completely. FTR I don't actually ""game"". I never played League or CS or anything, and even my WoW days clocked in at lvl 50 during the Lich King stuff.

But I always had an affinity for single-player games that are anywhere between 12 hours or 100 hours long. I would get hooked on them, love them and obviously play them until the credits roll, especially RPGs. But now it's weird. I love it, I really have nothing negative to say but I just can't get myself to play it again. For example, I made it to Chapter 3 in Half Life Alyx, finally playing a VR game -- loving it. I don't feel like playing it at all right now. I made it almost to the end of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and I'm like bruh... I don't even hate it like all the haters do, why am I suddenly not playing it anymore?

2) Graphics aren’t an issue.

3) Strategy games are a good shout if they aren’t overwhelming.

4) Need something I can pick up and put down as and when I’ve got 5 minutes.

5) Need to have a story behind them to some degree.

6) Love to grind levels/stats/materials anything but need to have a reason for the grind, grinding for the sake of grinding is a no go.

7) This may be controversial but I love open world/survival/crafting games

Games I’ve played and completed/got bored of recently and don’t want to go back to are as follows.

BG3
Elden Ring
Total war warhammer 3
Final Fantasy 7/9/10/7R

gaming,What game has the biggest issue with money being worthles?,"Money makes the world go round, but in many video game worlds, it often ends up worthless, so monetary rewards can end up moot.

The Legend of Zelda series has a recurring problem, the worst cases I have seen are Breath of the Wild and Echoes of Wisdom (I haven't played Tears yet). Despite Breath of the Wild not having money you can find by cutting grass, you still end up with more than you'll ever need because you can sell virtually anything you come across. I often ended up netting a profit from shopping by selling a fraction of the stuff you collect. The are items for sale you can use in cooking, and I didn't buy most of them because the stuff I found worked fine.

The most annoying part for me was that shops did sell special arrows except they quit restocking them if you had enough in your inventory so I was better off find enemies to get more. Past the early game I didn't need money for anything besides upgrading armor and quests.

Echoes of Wisdom has health items for sale, that there isn't a ton of need for when you can use a bed to recover your health for free.

However, the worst case I have seen is Xenoblade 3. This is a JRPG where you don't buy weapons or armor. Like its predecessors, you also heal out of combat, KOed characters revive after a fight, and in this game, your healers can be revived KOed characters an unlimited number of times during a fight. As a result, a lot of commonly seen RPG items aren't in this game removing a lot you can spend money on.

There are items for sale you can use in quests and cooking, I got buy without needing to use the cooking mechanic and for the most you can find items for quests without spending any money. The accessories for sale have use on paper except exploring the map almost always let to better ones.

The Land of Challenge DLC was the final nail in the coffin since while it does require grinding resources there you can get better stuff for clearing its challenges than from shops.

It made me wonder how many of us are playing for the love of gaming or because it’s become an easy habit to fall into.

gaming,I actually found a good mobile game and I want to talk about it. ,"The name of the game is Arcane Rush Battlegrounds. 

It’s a battleroyale card game that’s perfect for folks looking for a TFT like experience but something more casual. 

The game starts with 2 groups of 8, the top 4 players of each group then duke it out to find the top player. The original group stage is based on points and the second stage everyone gets 3 life and last one standing wins. 

The cool thing with this is that you’re playing against offline players. So there is no time pressure if something comes up which is great. I found that in the beginning it was very easy to score first place as I am getting to higher ranks I do take some losses against the AI. You earn gold for each elimination you achieve while offline. 

There is also an arena that takes your top builds from the battleroyale to test them against other players and I have found this to be very challenging. 

The game has dealers that have their own cards, and a hero collection they can draft from every game. On top of their being a number of unique races to play while in game each with their own strategy. My personal favourite race are demons and the discard strategy they play with. 

The only time the game pushes ads is to gain extra gold rewards or arena battle chances. Otherwise there are no ads. 

The negative, each of the races are kind of insular, there isn’t many combos to be found. If you start building a race your only real option is to fully build that race since they are all designed to work with themselves. Also the cost of upgrading your dealers is high,300 gold a shot where dailies may not give you enough to enough gold for an upgrade. There are currently 2 dealers with a third on the way and I hope they make some changes to upgrade costs or the amount of gold you can get. 

Well that’s the long and short of it. I hope you all check it out because I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the game.

Off the top of my head here are some I can Think of:
Classic Doom in Doom Eternal: well in 2016 you can play a lot of the classic levels, they are all in a separate menu so out of universe but in Doom Eternal, you access them in universe in Doomguy’s computer inside his fortress

Crash in Uncharted: in the first few chapters of Uncharted 4 you get to a part where Elena tries to get Nate into a PS1 game she really likes and it happens to be Crash Bandicoot.

Classic Activition Games in Call of Duty Cold War: in Cold War there is a section where you go through a mock city used by the russians to train for a US ground invasion. In this mock city you can find arcades with classic activition games.

Those are the 3 I can think of, I also thought of the classic levels in Wolfenstein but those are see as nightmares so they don’t actually exist in universe but what are some others you guys can think of??",Plastic-Fly9455,1h5snb4,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5snb4/what_are_some_irl_games_that_exist_inside_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5snb4/what_are_some_irl_games_that_exist_inside_other/,2024-12-03 17:20:51,151,0.88,151,0,220,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5snb4

gaming,"Unreal Tournament 99 still has active multiplayer servers, while later versions don't?","Just the other day, I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h3qz7g/are_there_any_alternate_online_servers_for_unreal/) about how it's hard to find arena shooters with active online multiplayer servers. I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004).  Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.

The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I'll play that now for online multiplayer.  I'm curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?

Also, I think it's cool that the original Unreal Tournament (a game from 1999, which I originally played on Windows 98) still runs without a problem on modern PCs (I have it on my current PC, which has Windows 11 and an Intel i9-9900k and an Nvidia 3080 TI).  I have the Game Of The Year edition from Steam though, so I think it was pre-packaged to work on modern PCs.  It also seems to be the 3DFX version; and I remember seeing a 3DFX Glide wrapper DLL years ago, which this version of UT99 must be using in order to work with modern graphics cards.",RolandMT32,1h5899f,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5899f/unreal_tournament_99_still_has_active_multiplayer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5899f/unreal_tournament_99_still_has_active_multiplayer/,2024-12-02 22:48:49,146,0.89,146,0,91,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5899f

gaming,"It might sound weird, but I really like when the corpses are done well and remain instead of magically disappearing","TES has probably my favorite approach to this. When you kill an NPC, their body and gore remain for a while before they disappear. You can not only loot their corpses but move them around. After a big battle you look around and see how many lives were lost, how terrible was the encounter, and it feels nice and realistic.

Games where enemies get Thanos snapped like in Elden Ring or turn into a puddle of blood and few random ribs Dragon Age: Origins style or turn into a lootable pouch like in Witcher 3 kind of lack that magical feeling of realism.
