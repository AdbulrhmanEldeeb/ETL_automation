I have never had this problem, I’ve read a lot of books similar to this, example {Beyond good and evil}. HOWEVER as of late I’ve been reading “garbage” like ACOTAR and fourth wing, and realized that I cannot for the love of me read anything that doesn’t produce fast dopamine.

books,The fear of running out of something to read is called Abibliophobia.,"Have you ever felt a sudden sense of panic at the thought of finishing your last unread book and having nothing left to dive into? If so, you might be experiencing something called *Abibliophobia*—the fear of running out of things to read.  
  
Is that even possible? I only know people who have a huge pile of books to read and who long for more time to read! I think it may also be due to the overwhelming amount of books being published, so it's not a fear of not having anything to read, but of not being able to choose, or of not having anything that feeds the mood.

books,[Swiss Family Robinson] Rereading this book as a modern reader was WILD ,"*Disclaimer: I've not read too many ""classics"" for most of my life, the only other exception aside from this book is Dracula, most of the time I read nonfiction. Please pardon if I'm not too familiar with the ""genre conventions"".* 



Back when I was about 10 or 12 years old, I had a copy of Swiss Family Robinson that eventually got ruined by me spilling a glass of milk on it. I have always been fascinated by survival stories of various kinds and had a fascination with zoology, so young me (as much as I could recollect) absolutely loved the book. Anyways, three weeks ago I decided to purchase a copy to see if it has held up after all these years. 

**Oh boy.** 

For the most part, despite being influenced by Robinson Crusoe with its castaway and survival setting, it really stood out to me the sheer lack of \*strife\* the family experienced. Aside from the initial event of the shipwreck and having to survive on an exotic tropical landscape, the family for the most part lives very comfortable lives as the island itself seems to spawn whatever kind of flora and fauna that would help them live comfortable lives. In the edition that I read, there are kangaroos, buffaloes, hippopotamus and a whole bunch more on a single island. 

What was even more darkly hilarious is that the characters never once lampshade on how weird this was, rather opting to shoot and consume any animals they come across (understandable given the context but lmao). A constant barrage of ""see new animal, shoot animal because we own this island now and we can do it"". 

The family themselves were ""interesting"". I'm gonna be honest, the dad was what I could only described as the ""platonic ideal"" of what a M A N should be. Not only he was so religiously devoted that he could quote the Bible rivaling that of a senior clergyman, but knows about every plants and animals, their uses and can build practically anything. The children were well, just there, mostly to make things happen by running around doing shenanigans. The mother meanwhile was barely a character, mostly there to smooth out whichever things that stumps the father. Overall though, there was a distinct lack of character arcs for any of them, no new revelations about each other, no one gets changed by anything that happened. They got stuck on that island for years, and left it none the worse for wear.

Ultimately, I'd say that the online reviews I read before reading the book really was correct, it TRULY FELT like a product of its time. The specifics are too much for a post, but the overall constant occurrence of overt religious theming of the family's mass exploitation of nature because god gave them dominion of it and the whole ""ideal parental figures"" as I've mentioned above. For me, it encapsulates quite a fair bit of the common worldview at the time it is written, but there were points where it felt like quasi-absurdist humor at times. In conclusion for those that wants to read/reread it, it was a fun read but be prepared for some occasional ""weirdness"". 

Tl;dr: People weren't kidding about it being ""a product of its time"" ",BattleMedic1918,1hbwgh0,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbwgh0/swiss_family_robinson_rereading_this_book_as_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbwgh0/swiss_family_robinson_rereading_this_book_as_a/,2024-12-11 15:49:15,292,0.89,292,0,100,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbwgh0
books,1980s Dad Lit,"If you were a dad in the 1980s, you could expect two things for Christmas: a bottle of Old Spice and whatever the latest Michener was. Or Ken Follett. Or Robert Ludlum. In the '90s, it was likely Crichton or Grisham (John, not his brother Kevin, who wrote *The Rural Juror* and *Urban Fervor*).

Are there ""Dad"" books any more? My sense is that:

(a) in general, the population isn't reading as much; 

(b) men (outside of this sub) are reading even less than the general public; and

(c) television has taken the place of reading.

books,Fahrenheit 451 and Martial Law in South Korea,"Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books. Different people have different thoughts on what it's about. Is it about censorship? Is it a critique of Television? What makes it great is how versatile it is.  



One of the things that I think gets missed sometimes is what it can tell us about the nature of authoritarianism. First, however, I want to talk about some key scenes.  



On the second page of the story, Montag is heading home and we're told that he ""let the escalator waft him into the still night air."" Later, Mildred is listening to music through her ""tamped-shut ears, and her eye all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.""  


In each of these early scenes, air plays an important role in characterizing both Montag and Mildred. In Montag's case, him being wafted up the escalator shows his lack of agency. Later we learn he only even became a fireman because someone suggested he should be one. He didn't actually choose for himself. This is where he is at the beginning of the story, a man who isn't even aware of his lack of agency. I think many of us living in the world as it is feel similarly. It's easy to say, what can *I* do to make a difference? Why even bother trying? The more we think like this, the less we assert our agency, the less we're able to utilize our free will.  
 

In Mildred's case, this air imagery conveys her apathy. She can't be bothered to breathe because she is so bored and discontent. She knows something is wrong but can't put her finger on it, and that's why she takes too many sleeping pills and has to have her stomach pumped.  


Both of these scenes serve to show the impact living in an authoritarian, dystopian hellscape can have on people. It hollows you out and leaves you stuck, unable to pinpoint what's wrong and even less able to do something about it if you could.  



Here's where it ties into authoritarianism and tyranny. Fire is the symbol of authoritarian power in this world/story. The firemen are the enforcers, they're meant to be feared and respected. When the power of authoritarian rule makes itself felt on any citizen deemed problematic, that power is manifested through fire.  
 

So what Bradbury is saying is that the flame of authoritarianism/tyranny is sustained on the air of apathy and lack of agency.  
 

I think in light of how the people of South Korea stood together and said ""fuck this shit,"" and how quickly they organized and how immediate their success was, it's worth pointing out this subtle, easily missed, nugget of wisdom from Bradbury. We need to remember that people who strive to erect an authoritarian, tyrannical government designed for their own benefit depend on the indifference of the masses.",flyingjesuit,1hbw1yc,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,2024-12-11 15:31:32,28,0.81,28,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbw1yc

books,A Well-Trained Wife by Tia Levings and Self-Revisionism,"I recently finished Tia Levings' memoir, ""A Well-Trained Wife: My Escape from Christian Patriarchy."" I found the story engaging and emotional. The author grew up in an evangelical church and was indoctrinated into fundamentalist Christian beliefs. When she was very young, she married an abusive man and became pulled even deeper into radical Christian beliefs and ""tradwife"" living. The memoir details her childhood in mainstream evangelicalism, all the way to her eventual escape from her abusive marriage and journey through healing from her trauma.

What I found interesting and wanted to discuss with y'all was the parts of Levings' memoir that seem anachronistic(?) and a bit revisionary. Throughout the book, we hear a story of Levings existing in a culture that was aggressively misogynistic, racist, homophobic, you name it. However, throughout this, Levings' inner narrative is *conspicuously* progressive in comparison to the people around her.

Some examples:

1. When her husband Allan believes Neo-Nazi ideology and wants to vote for Pat Buchanan in 2000, we hear how Tia stays home to avoid being caught lying about who she voted for. She implies that she would have voted for Al Gore because of his environmental policies.

&gt;""I stayed home because he'd catch me lying if I voted for someone else, but I wondered how it would've gone if women like me had voted. I'd liked what Gore had to say about the planet. His convictions struck me as more compatible with protecting creation--the very first mandate God ever gave humans."" (pp. 129-130)

2. When her husband criticizes a rector for seeming gay, she pipes up:

&gt;""Allan had an issue with the rector. ""I think he's gay,"" he said. ""I can tell that man is hiding his sexuality. He probably preys on little kids.""  
""Being gay doesn't mean he's a molester,"" I said. ""They aren't the same thing.""  
""Bull,"" he said."" (pp. 184)

3. She helps a friend's mother accept that he is gay:

&gt;""I wanted Michael to be fully accepted for who he was, not just tolerated while his family hoped he'd change his mind."" (pp. 204-205)

&gt;""But what about what the church says about homosexuality?"" ""God is a good God who loves mankind,"" I quoted Father Stephen. ""We're just supposed to love people. You love him. Love means you celebrate his joys alongside him. Being there for him is what God wants, I'm sure, and I would be there too if I could get there."" (pp. 205)

&gt;""I knew Allan hadn't changed enough to let me say Michael' name, let alone travel to his gay wedding."" (pp. 205)

4. She never switches or ""blanket trains"" her children:

&gt;""William was two, Katie eight months. I'd never switched either of them, which is why I got an F for blanket training.....Judith noticed my lack of results...She took a long white tube from her diaper bag and demonstrated against her palm. The spanker whistled and slapped against her skin. I flinched. ""It should sting,"" she said. ""You want repentance. You want your child to avoid what precipitated the switch."" I didn't want this next thing. My blood churned like a swirling undercurrent against the tide."" (pp. 93).

To summarize, in a lifestyle that promotes racism, homophobia, and child abuse - Levings' never commits these offenses.

I find this hard to believe. In fact, I find it to be kind of infantilizing - throughout the memoir, Levings is cast as more confused and anxious than hateful. She never says she thinks her gay friend, Michael, is going to hell or is sinful - she says she is *unsure* and *confused* instead. I think this selective memory compromises the integrity of the memoir. 

To add to this, the preface of the memoir says that it includes ""composite characters, and some names and identifying details have been changed"" (pp. xi). While the practice of changing names/details is standard, I find the composite characters a bit suspect, especially when the scope is not disclosed. Is ""Michael"" the gay friend **one real person**, or a composite of several interactions? Are these vignettes included to reassure readers that the author was **actually a good person**, despite their circumstances?

I wonder if this approach to Tia Levings' story is her own, or done at the insistence of her publisher. Maybe admitting period- and culture-accurate biases (outside of her complicity in sexism and promoting the lifestyle, which Levings owns up to several times) makes selling copies more difficult.

What do you think? Am I way off-base? Do you think this is self-revisionist, or done at the behest of a publishing company to make for a cleaner narrative? Please let me know. I would love to discuss this memoir with people who have read it. :)",slimetheturtle,1hc4yhg,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hc4yhg/a_welltrained_wife_by_tia_levings_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hc4yhg/a_welltrained_wife_by_tia_levings_and/,2024-12-11 21:43:47,5,0.56,5,0,27,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1hc4yhg

books,The Other Valley - no quotation marks,"I am currently reading The Other Valley by Scott Alexander Howard and I’m finding it pretty jarring that the author refuses to use quotation marks. When characters are speaking to one another it reads like a stream of consciousness, rather than a conversation, and gives the book a slightly “dream like” feel, which might be what the author is going for… I’m undecided at this point. I’m really starting to miss quotation marks though because they are just so useful!

I’d like to hear your thoughts on why the author would choose to write this way, if you think there’s an advantage to it, and if you’ve come across this particular breaking-of-conventions in any other books.",clumsyguy,1hbxpzx,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbxpzx/the_other_valley_no_quotation_marks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbxpzx/the_other_valley_no_quotation_marks/,2024-12-11 16:42:53,0,0.5,0,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbxpzx
