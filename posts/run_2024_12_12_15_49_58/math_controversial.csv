math,I am trying to construct integer multiplication without using subtraction and simply still using the definition of the equivalence relation but nothing seems to resolve. Is it possible to do so without resorting to using subtraction which isn't defined for the natural numbers?,"The basic equivalence relationship the integers are built around is ⟨a,b⟩\~⟨c,d⟩  iff a+d=b+c.

Integer multiplication works as follows. A\_Z B\_Z=\[⟨a\_1,a\_2 ⟩\]+\[⟨b\_1,b\_2 ⟩\]=\[⟨a\_1 b\_1+a\_2 b\_2,a\_1 b\_2+a\_2 b\_1 ⟩\]

It seems problematic to me that people seem to always switch to defining multiplication as (𝑎−𝑏)⋅(𝑐−𝑑)=𝑎⋅𝑐−𝑎⋅𝑑−𝑏⋅𝑐+𝑏⋅𝑑, and then they go on to resolve the arithmetic using rules of subtraction. However, as all of these numbers are natural numbers and subtraction can't be used with natural numbers. It makes no sense to me how this is acceptable.  


It seems to me like integer multiplication has to be constructed by proving the following:

  
if ⟨a,b⟩  \~⟨c,d⟩ and ⟨v,x⟩  \~⟨y,z⟩, then ⟨a,b⟩⟨v,x⟩=⟨c,d⟩⟨y,z⟩, meaning: 

⟨av+bx,ax+bv⟩\~⟨cy+dz,cz+dy⟩↔av+bx+cz+dy=ax+bv+cy+dz. However I cannot figure out how to get anything we have already proven to resolve into this.

math,Will Math always require this much dedication?,"I’m an undergraduate in my last year. Currently taking Complex Analysis, will take Differential Equations next semester. Completed courses in Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Topology, Measure Theory and Graph Theory. I was doing an exercise today, and one of the questions was to prove that a sequence of curves converges uniformly to Koch’s Snowflake. This was one question out of 10, and it took me all day and a little bit of yesterday. The given definition of the sequence of curves wasn’t really rigorous (“here’s the first curve, and the nth curve is obtained by rotating and shrinking this other curve”) so most of the time I was working on it I was trying to wrap my head around getting a “formal” definition of each iteration. And again, it took me the whole day. This isn’t the first time in my studies that it takes me a lot of time to wrap my head around a question. I want to pursue a Master’s degree in pure math - mainly because I love it and I find myself thinking about whatever I learn pretty much all the time. But the amount of dedication and the time I need to invest has been so demanding, and after three years this is really starting to making me feel burned out. I still don’t want to stop, and I do wish to continue in academia. But it’s hard to juggle between the work I have to put in and my personal life. I’ve let go of hobbies and I hardly have time for friends and family, not to mention being tired and mentally exhausted most of the time. Will it always be like this?

math,Divergence of a Tensor,"I have seen conflicting information about the formula for the divergence of a tensor.

For example, a rank-2 tensor, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_derivative_(continuum_mechanics)#Divergence_of_a_tensor_field) has the divergence taken with respect to the second index which agrees with some textbooks I have seen, whilst other resources I have found take the divergence with respect to the first index. 

I know it doesn't matter for a symmetric tensor, but most authors don't indicate if they are dealing with a symmetric matrix.

I tried looking at historical texts like Levi-Civita's *""Absolute Differential Calculus""* and it seems they present the divergence with respect to the second index. I also looked at Gibb's and Wilson's *""Vector Analysis""* (they treated dyadics, not tensors in general) and the divergence is w.r.t the first index.

This is confusing me, so does anyone know the correct definition, and perhaps more importantly, why it is the correct one?
