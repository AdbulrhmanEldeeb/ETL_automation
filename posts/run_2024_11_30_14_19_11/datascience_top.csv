datascience,Interview Query in 2024?,"Hi, I’m currently a manager to a ML team at a mid sized startup, and looking to prepare for my next steps.. I stumbled upon InterviewQuery and it seems like a good platform to familiarize with the technical questions asked for ML roles across companies (and its BF right now..)

I’ll be very grateful if you are willing to share your experience using them (number of questions , do they end up helping you with interviews, etc) , or if you think that it’s better to learn from some other resource like books or YouTube. It’s been awhile since I had my last interview, so I’m looking to gauge and plan my preparation..

Thanks!",ArticleLegal5612,1h2r4d0,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h2r4d0/interview_query_in_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1h2r4d0/interview_query_in_2024/,2024-11-29 17:37:12,30,0.83,30,0,22,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2r4d0
