books,Why do booktubers not all of them but some of them put so much pressure on themselves when it comes to reading? why don't they do it for fun anymore?,"Have any of you that watch booktube noticed booktubers acting like this lately because I have and I wonder. why? Some of the booktubers that I've been watching lately have been making these challenges for themselves where they have to read a certain amount of pages for the month and when they don't they get disappointed with themselves. 

Saying I'm going to try again next month and I'm going to beat it. Also they will make videos doing wrap ups talking about all the books they read the previous month and how sometimes they're disappointed with themselves because they haven't read as many as the month before that or as many as they normally do. 

These same people also get disappointed with themselves when their yearly goal isn't the same or more as the previous one. Meaning they haven't read as many as last year or more than last year. So I'm genuinely curious why they're doing this to themselves? What happened to just reading books as long as you're enjoying them and who cares how many?

 Is it because so many people feel the need to turn their hobby into a job nowadays and want to make money so they feel like they have to do these kinds of things in order to keep up their viewership and bring in the coin? Because if so I could kind of understand but still. And I should also say not just booktubers do this I'm sure there's plenty of book TikTok accounts that do as well. But I only ever see it on booktube.",inyoureyesiremeberu,1hf9m8n,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hf9m8n/why_do_booktubers_not_all_of_them_but_some_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hf9m8n/why_do_booktubers_not_all_of_them_but_some_of/,2024-12-16 03:01:18,317,0.71,317,0,218,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hf9m8n
books,The Child Thief by Brom is the best Peter Pan retelling (and the best retelling in general) I'd read so far,"Wow. Just...wow. I am speechless. It's been one month since I finished this book and I have yet to decide how I should write this review for I am afraid I will not do justice to it. Isn't it funny? How unpredictable books can be? You enter to a book with little to no expectations and somehow, it ends up becoming one of your most favourite books. There's something magical with this. *Just like there was something magical with this book.*

I can't say that I am a huge fan of the original novel of Peter Pan. Sure, it is very whimsical, adventurous and fun and it also has some dark elements that add more to the story. But I never felt any particular connection with it. That being said, last year I developed a keen interest on Peter Pan's retellings. I was always a firm believer of how easy it is to twist the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland and how much scope of imagination one can find in this story. Last year, I had the chance to read two of these retellings: Peter Darling and Darling Girl: A Novel of Peter Pan. While I liked the first more than the latter and while they weren't terrible, I cannot say that I found what I was seeking in these. They felt lackluster and my expectations were not met.

While I was searching for more Peter Pan retellings, I came across The Child Thief. I read the blurb and I was immediately hooked (no pun intended). I always feel lured by darker versions of Peter Pan's tale. Even as a child, the darker aspects of the classic novel always peaked my interest and I had found myself wondering: ""How could someone make it even darker?"". Well, I just got my answer with Brom. And I couldn't be happier about it.

From the very first pages, Brom makes his message and intentions clear enough: this is not a story made for children. Far from it. This is his own version of Peter Pan which is one hundred times darker than the one you know. While in the original novel, the dark elements are more subtle, in Brom's version everything is in your face. You can't escape the darkness and cruelty no matter how hard you try.

Although the story is inspired by Peter Pan, the novel can be interpreted as something original. Aside from the character of Peter (who is just known as ""Peter"" and not ""Peter Pan""), there are no direct mentions from the original story. Of course there are some easter eggs, like the Pirates, faeries, the ""lost boys"", a girl named Wendilyn but aside from these, the story is very original and fresh. And this is another reason why I loved this novel. It doesn't rely on the original and it presents something unique.

For a standalone book, I found the world-building to be very well-crafted and detailed. Instead of Neverland we have Avalon, a place full of magic and mischief, where creatures of all kinds can live. The descriptions of the characters and Avalon were so vivid and rich and at times, I wished I could be there (minus when things got dangerous). It is remarkable how Brom took inspiration from the arthurian legends and other folklores and combined them to create his own story. What I really appreciated in the book was the characterisation of the magical inhabitants of Avalon. Brom's portrayal of the faeries was exactly how I've always envisioned them: mystical and charming, yet unpredictable and mischievous. The beautiful illustrations that accompany the text help really helped me to picture the characters and the places in my head and they really make the story come *alive*.

In the book, we get to see Avalon in its full glory (from Peter's backstory) and in its current state. While Avalon used to thrive and be a lush, enchanted paradise, now it has become a dangerous and dark wasteland. After the arrival of a ship full of men, the island began to decay. And it is up to Peter and its ""devils"" to make it flourish again.

Since the story provides multiple point of views, it's shown that this war was lead by fear and misunderstandings. With one way or another, everyone wanted the same thing; Avalon's inhabitants wanted Flesh Eaters to leave and the Flesh Eaters wanted to escape from Avalon. Had they spoken to each other instead of being hostile, the matter would have been solved. But the fears and hatred from both sides left no room for civil conversations. Just like in real life where people prefer to act on their prejudice and irrational worries, in the book both sides never tried to get to know each other and understand their goals. Brom reminds us how pointless violence is and what a merrier world it would be, if humans weren't guided by fear.

&gt;*Both sides so blinded by their fear and hate of each other that they couldn't see they were all fighting for the same thing.*

The story was oh so adventurous and packed with action. There were many moments which made me excited and impatient to see what would happen next. I kid you not, at times I would literally shiver from anticipation and adrenaline. During the fight scenes, I was always on edge, waiting to see which side would take over. The deeper I dived into the story, the more eager I got to see how it would escalate. Right when I thought I had it all figured out, something would happen that would shatter my mindset and make me create new theories. The book was very unpredictable but that made it even better. I couldn't tell which character I should trust or not, what would happen next, who would win in a battle etc. The unpredictable rotation of the story matched with the unpredictable nature of Peter and Avalon and yet every event had a purpose and didn't feel unnecessary.

Some moments made me sick in the stomach. If you cannot handle descriptions of dead children's bodies or any other body horror elements, maybe this book isn't for you. I eventually kinda got used to them but the uncanny feeling they gave me never left. Combined with the mysterious yet dangerous atmosphere of Avalon, it was enough to send shivers up and down my spine. Aside from the gore descriptions, the context of the book is very dark. Violence in every form can be found in almost every single page and we are constantly reminded of the cruelty not only in Avalon but the real world - our world - too. The book opens with Peter saving a little girl from her abusive father. Then we follow Nick who is trying to escape from the drug dealers that torment him and his family. And that's only the beginning.

For a fantasy book, The Book Thief liked to remind me of the ugliness of our world and the cruel nature of the human race. I was very surprised actually to see that it tackled many serious topics, like child abuse or racism. Two of the most promiment themes of the book were religious fanatism and colonialism and if you asked me, we truly need more books that explore these serious subjects. The depiction of religious radicalism through the Reverend was scary to say the least and it truly showed how far can someone go in the name of their belief.

Besides a detailed and unique setting, Brom weaved a cast of complex and morally ambiguous characters. Truth be said, someone could describe the majority of the protagonists as unlikeable. And they wouldn't be wrong. Many of the characters did horrible things. Some of them were justified and some of them were not. And I loved that. I like it when a book challenges my opinion on the characters and when it makes me question their actions and motives. That was exactly the case in this book. There were obviously some characters whom I liked more but overall, I was invested in all of them.

Let's analyse some of them, shall we?

First of all, we have Nick, one of the main protagonists alongside Peter. At the beginning, I was quite sceptical about him. I didn't expect him to grow on me. At first I believed he would be the typical teenage protagonist but that was not the case here. Nick was a pretty complex character. On the one hand, he was desperate to escape from Marco and his gang that harassed him but on the other hand, he felt guilty for abandoning his mother and grandmother. Once he arrives in Avalon, he begins questioning Peter's morals and the more the learns about the island, the more he calls Peter out. And he did it very often which I'm honestly thankful for because Peter really needed it.

Nick was brave in his own way. He showed fear but he was always ready to put on a fight whether it was to protect himself or his friends - for he became close with some of the Devils. On top of that, after his arrival to Avalon, he realises that he's turning into a Flesh Eater which consumes his thoughts and torments his mind. The passages with his dreams of turning fully into a monster were quite creepy and when the story focused on him, I felt like he was slowly losing his mind. I genuinely enjoyed following his story and I was rooting for him to return home and fulfil his goal to protect his family. 

The Devils, Peter's ""gang"" as I liked to call them were very charming to read. Although they would act like bloodthirsty creatures, deep inside they were still children. But they remained brave warriors who didn't hesitate to thrust themselves in a battle. Their loyalty to Peter was evident and it was constantly shown that they were willing to die for him and for Avalon.

As Nick got to know the Devils, he was constantly wondering how they could endure and support Peter. The answer was very simple: they saw Peter as their savior who had given them a chance for a better life compared to their past one. All of these children had been abused, belittled and neglected. How could they not trust Peter, who had lead them to a better place (according to them) and who had put an end to their problems (despite bringing up more...).

My most favourite members of the Devils were definitely Sekeu and Red Bone, whom the books explores more. The first one is a nod to Tiger Lily, a strong native American warrior and Peter's closest companion. Sekeu was one of my favourite characters in general. She seemed cold and strict at first but she had some moments when she expressed her softer side. She was supportive towards Nick and she helped him to become a better warrior. She was so cool to read and it was good to see that among the other boys, she was always respected and was treated like a co-leader alongside Peter. 

**SPOILER, SKIP THE PARAGRAPH You can imagine how baffled I was when she died, like, WE HAD SPENT ONE CHAPTER SAVING HER ONLY FOR HER TO BE KILLED!? WHY DID BROM DO THIS TO ME!?**

As for Red Bone, he was very fun to read. I liked his attitude and how ironic he was and he acted like a big brother to Nick. Compared to the rest of the devils, he appeared to be more humorous but if the circumstances required it, he was deadly serious (literally and metaphorically).

A character whom I didn't expect to like as much as I ended up to like was the Captain on the Flesh Eaters. I mean, how could I? Throughout the whole book we get reminded of the atrocities he and his men has committed in the island and we get to witness it first-hand. But once the narration changed and started following the Captain, everything shattered. I got to see his own point of view and how he felt about the situation he was put in. Brom did a marvelous job at building up his character and highlighting his own doubts and concerns (especially about the Reverted). He wasn't the heartless monster I thought he was. He was a man who was desperate to escape from the hell he was trapped in and who wanted the best for his people. He wasn't a saint. But he thought he did what was best by fighting children like the devils - even if it caused him pain.

And at last, we come to Peter. Or as the book calls him, the child thief. And thief he was. That is more than clear. But under the facade of the cruel leader who trains a bunch of soldiers to save Avalon...a little boy was hidden.

I feel like I could write a whole essay regarding Peter's complexity in this book. Brom took the original character and gave him a breath of fresh ear, while keeping traits of his original personality. In the book, Peter is witty and playful. He finds enjoyment in killing his enemies and he is often humorous about it - sadistic even. He treats battles as a game and even in the face of death, his cocky attitude would not leave him. It was interesting to see this split; he was both a man and a child.

Having a big part of the narration focusing on Peter's point of view really added more depth to his character. Through his flashbacks it is shown how he was treated as a child, how he was raised and how he ended up in Avalon. Peter had a rough childhood. Unwanted by his family, ostracized by the rest of the people, he felt alone and like he had nowhere to go:

&gt;*What’s here for me? he wondered, and again grimly shook his head. Death, or at best a life of hiding in holes, like Goll. Peter fought back the tears. Is there no place for me?*

And then, he came to Avalon and met someone who showered him with love; the Lady. Whether it was by her spell or his own will, Peter loved her. And how couldn't he, for she was the only person after a very long time to care about him? While Nick was not able to fathom Peter's devotion to the Lady, the more I got to know about Peter, the more I understood him.

Peter was not innocent. He did MANY mistakes and he wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice his own Devils for the sake of Avalon and the Lady. He appeared apathetic. Uncaring. But that was not the truth. In his own way, he cared. And this passage proves it:

And how couldn't he, for she was the only person after a very long time to care about him?

Peter was not innocent. He did MANY mistakes and he wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice his own Devils for the sake of Avalon and the Lady. He appeared apathetic. Uncaring. But that was not the truth. In his own way, he cared. And this passage proves it:

&gt;*Peter thought it’d be a while before she’d be able to fight, but she looked on the mend and he couldn’t help but smile. Almost lost you, he thought, surprised to find himself blinking back tears. Been through too much, me and you. We’re going to finish this thing together.*

Above, we can see how much Peter cared about Sekeu. Not because she was a mere soldier to fulfill his purpose but because she was someone close to him. And that goes for the rest of the children too. Their deaths were affecting him. Through the passage of time, Peter started to become more and more indifferent, treating them as something tragic yet typical. But deep inside, guilt was eating him up. He knew how far gone the war was. He knew how many lives he had sacrificed. And yet he wouldn't stop.

Peter was many things. Lethal, unpredictable, cruel, arrogant. But he was also vulnerable and desperate. Desperate to save the place he came to call home. Desperate to save the one person who was a mother figure to him. Desperate to reclaim the happiness adults had taken from him. He was someone who more than anything needed affection.

I had conflicted feelings about Peter. There were times when I enjoyed his witty attitude and fights. There were times when I wanted to scream and talk some sense into him. And I wanted to hug him for he was a little boy who hadn't known better. If I were to summarize his personality, I would use this extract, for it's perfect for Peter:

&gt;*Ever the contradiction, Tanngnost thought. One moment a cold-hearted killer, the next a sentimental boy, always the eternal optimist despite a lifetime of tragedy. Of course, that’s his glamour. The very thing that draws the children to him, makes them love him despite so many contradictions.*

If I were to complain about something, that would probably be the inconsistent pacing of the book. I never got bored but sometimes, right when the story had more action, it would progress in a slower way and drag a little. There were times when I had to stop reading, not because I was uninterested but because I wanted to take a break and re-pick when the pacing felt better.

In addition, I found the ending to be kinda rushed. It needed more exploration in terms of development because it really felt like everything was happening at once. I wouldn't change a thing about it, it was great the way it was, but if it had more built-up, it would be ideal.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed the ending. It was...bittersweet to say the least. I genuinely did not expect it. Thinking about it, it actually made sense and why Brom chose that. Once I read it, I gasped and for some minutes, I was unable to form words.

Sorry for getting carried away with this post. This book will be engraved in my memory for a very long time. It's the type of book which no matter how much time passes, I won't stop recalling its story or details. I am so happy for enjoying it so much and I can't wait to dive into Brom's other works.

Would I recommend it? Obviously yes! A thousand times yes! Even if someone is not a Peter fan, they could enjoy the book just fine. But be ware of the trigger warnings and the gore descriptions. And most importantly: be ware of a fierce boy with a contagious smile...
