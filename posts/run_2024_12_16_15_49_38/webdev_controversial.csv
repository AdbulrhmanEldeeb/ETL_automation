webdev,How much time do you normally need to build this?,"2 years front end half a year back end dev, self taught, curious to know if there is anyone who can achieve this faster, and if experience really matters. 

I'm building a full car rental management system for a car rental shop owner, and I promised him to deliver the app in a month or two, now I'm in day 28 of building it, and I can see myself completing it by day 40. The app consists of almost all he needs to manage his work: dashboard, clients, cars, rentals, expenses... with all CRUD operations fully working, with reusable components. and I didn't reach the authentication and notification parts yet. Almost completed the front end but struggling with the server side logic.

This is my first freelance project -- out of my full time work, and I don't even know how much I should charge him (third world country). I work on this project daily for about 2 to 4 hours per day. He expects the project as a cross platform app, so I may be wrapping it later in Electron. 

So I just need to know your opinion about this, and how much time would it normally take you to build this cuz 2 months seems like a lot",WadieZN,1hex2wa,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hex2wa/how_much_time_do_you_normally_need_to_build_this/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hex2wa/how_much_time_do_you_normally_need_to_build_this/,2024-12-15 17:09:06,1,0.51,1,0,61,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hex2wa

The website has quite high numbers across the board. And I'm super confused.

You see, I spent the week trying to fix a website which embeds a video and is excruciatingly slow. I thought this particular website might be using a different format like 'WEBM' or some other strategy. But turns out they simply reference a video, kinda like a CDN.

webdev,Resume feedback for full-stack dev for fully remote global roles,"Hi! Would love general feedback.

**About**

* Will job hunt in Feb 2025 onwards
* Targeting fully remote full-stack or backend roles globally
* Targeting larger companies over startups, but open to either (would love to work on large systems, I really like learning about scalability)
* Prefer not to relocate and currently unable to, but can as a last resort in second half of 2025 onwards. Planning to relocate in future years
* Was a working student during all of my listed experiences
* Have never interviewed for jobs globally before

**Requesting feedback on**

* Feedback on the metrics and bullets
* Formatting: I put the technologies per position below the bullet points since it might be more readable for interviewers. Would this cause ATS to think I'm spamming keywords?
* I've read most companies hire fully remote but only within their country like ""Remote US"", and most are now shifting to hybrid. Do you think it's still realistic to target companies with fully remote roles abroad for 2025?
* General resume impressions or interview advice

webdev,How to debug Largest Contentful Paint on mobile being slow?,"I'm working on a large site with multiple plugins using a C# CMS. A Lighthouse scan in Chrome shows an LCP of 1.5 seconds on desktop but 10.1 seconds on mobile. Lighthouse results vary significantly across runs—ranging from 11.2 to 15.3 seconds—so I'm skeptical of its consistency. Could the slow mobile performance be due to simulated 3G speeds?

I've checked [WebPageTest.org](http://WebPageTest.org), which reports a 6.776-second load time. The LCP element is a div with a 12KB compressed WebP background image, so it’s already optimized. I suspect render-blocking resources might be a factor, but there are only five of them, each under 200ms, so they account for less than a second.

webdev,Is this what web development is like?,"I have been working on web/mobile development since ~2019 as a hobby. I took a course on HTML/CSS/JS and then moved into learning react and more recently react native. I’ve definitely improved over this time, and can make higher quality things faster. Recently I’ve been more serious about it and am trying to make stuff which could actually be used by other people. While I find the general process really fun and addictive, I notice that I also feel a lot of stress and burnout when I’m working on a project. But the thing is, I don’t feel that stress from the actual programming- dealing with errors and things not working the way I want etc. is stimulating if not fun, since I know that there is some error in my thinking that I need to resolve. 

What frustrates me is constantly fixing a seemingly endless onslaught of environment/set-up related issues. For example, right now I’m trying to use the expo-linking module in my expo development build and am getting a “Cannot find native module ExpoLinking” error. “main” has not been registered. “A module has failed to load due to an error and ‘AppRegistry.registerComponent’ wasn’t called.”

Lately it feels like my time spent programming has been 20% actually writing code and 80% jumping between stackoverflow questions trying to resolve issues like this, fiddling with package.json when I don’t really understand what I’m doing. What is the name for this sort of problem?

Is this simply what web development is like? Does it get easier? I am passionate about what I create so I usually just grind through these issues and slowly move forwards. I think I’m better at resolving these issues than when I started 5 years ago, or at the very least am suffering because I’m taking on more and more sophisticated projects.

But to some extent I worry that I have a fundamental lack of knowledge which severely slows me down. I’ve only ever done this as a hobby which has mostly meant ‘learning by doing’ rather than ever actually sitting down and properly studying any of it. Is that what I need to do? What are the best resources for doing this? I study computer science at university but they don’t touch any of this sort of stuff.

 [https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/your-source-to-prompt.html](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/your-source-to-prompt.html)

Unlike the many other existing competing projects-- to name just a few: 

1. [files-to-prompt](https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt)
2. [repo2txt](https://repo2txt.simplebasedomain.com/)

6. [1filellm](https://github.com/jimmc414/1filellm)
7. [repo2file](https://github.com/artkulak/repo2file)

...there are some real advantages to this one that make it stand out:

* It's a single html file that you download to your local machine-- that's it! just open in a modern browser like chrome and you can use it securely. 

* Because it's locally hosted, with no requirements like python or anything else, it's very quick to get it running on any machine, and because it's local, you can use it on your own private repos without worrying about using a github authorization token or similar annoyance. 

* You don't even need to be working with a repo at all, it works just as well with a regular folder of code files.

Also, I added tons of quality of life improvements that were major pain points for me personally:

These include laboriously re-selecting the same or very similar subset of files over and over again; now you can save a preset (either to localStorage in the browser or exported and saved as a JSON file) and dramatically speed this up. There are also a few other features to speed up the file selection process, such as quick string based filtering on file names, and common quick selection patterns (such as ""select all React files""). 

It also keeps track of the total size in KB and lines of text that have been selected in a handy tally section which is always visible in the upper right corner, so you always know when you are reaching the maximum of the context window of whatever model you're working with. Based on my experience, I added in warnings for GPT4o and o1 and also Claude3.5 Sonnet.

Before the listing of the files and their contents, it also automatically includes the hierarchical file/folder structure of the files you select, and next to each one, shows the size in KB and the number of lines, which helps give the model context about which files are the most important. 

I also added the ability to minify the code so you can cram more into the context window.

You can also specify a ""preamble"" that you can save and quickly edit, as well as a ""goal"" where you specify what you're trying to accomplish.",dicklesworth,1hf0yrg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hf0yrg/your_source_to_prompt_turn_your_code_into_an_llm/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hf0yrg/your_source_to_prompt_turn_your_code_into_an_llm/,2024-12-15 20:02:12,0,0.22,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,self,t3_1hf0yrg

Apologies in advance if this question is either not allowed or has been answered before, but I just wanted to get an idea of the best methods to generate really visual reports based off form data.

With that said, once a user submits this information, I want a report generated that could be presented at an executive steering committee - so think high visuals, fact based information, quick and to the point to capture attention, while still remaining professional.

webdev,Help with HTML and CSS layout for a row of images with various aspect ratios,"I have what I feel like is a very simple problem, but I can't figure it out (and AI has been no help). I have a website that is randomly selecting 4 images from a set of images to display. Many of the images have different aspect ratios, which is making this complicated. The images should be displayed in a single row and they should all have the exact same height. There should be no gaps or blank space between or around any of the images. None of the images should be cropped. Basically, the height of the entire container should adjust to line up all 4 images in a row with the same height while taking up the full width of the page.  The images do *not* need to all have the same width, but every solution I find seems to have this behavior.

        height: auto;
        width: 100%;
        filter: brightness(75%);
    }

And here's how it's rendering:

As you can see, the second image has blank space above and below in order to fill the space, but I don't want that. What I want is the rest of the images to shrink until they all have the same height, then all grow together until they fill the width of the page.

I hope my explanation makes sense. Any help is appreciated.

webdev,Best Approach for Authorization in a Nested Resource Structure ,"I have an app with the following structure:

* A `Company` has many `Clients`.
* Each `Client` has many `Projects`.
* Each `Project` has many `Tasks`.
* A `User` belongs to a `Company` and can only access/edit/delete tasks associated with the same company.

I need to ensure that users can only access resources (like tasks) that belong to their company. I’m considering two main approaches:

1. **Option 1: Add** `company_id` **to all related tables (e.g.,** `tasks`**,** `projects`**,** `clients`**)** This would allow quick authorization checks by comparing `company_id` directly, reducing the need for joins when querying.
2. **Option 2: Use a purely hierarchical approach** This would maintain relationships (`task → project → client → company`) and enforce access through the hierarchy, resulting in complex joins but no redundant data.



In my opinion Option 1 feels better because i can straight away check if a user can edit a task or not, instead of joining tasks with project and client and then checking the company\_id's of them both.

Would there be significant performance or maintainability trade-offs with each approach? Which method would you recommend and why?

webdev,"Seeking a Secure, Asynchronous, and Rapid-Development Full-Stack Framework","Hello everyone,

I'm on the hunt for a modern full-stack web framework that comes ""batteries included."" Here are my key requirements:

1. Security on par with Django
2. Asynchronous capabilities like those found in Node.js frameworks
3. Rapid development similar to Laravel, Django, or Ruby on Rails

I've consulted three AI tools—Perplexity, ChatGPT-4, and Claude 3.5—for their insights. Here’s what they suggested:

So I am trying to find out before I set off down a new path of learning, if either Drupal or Laravel are worth pursuing for developing ecommerce? And are either inherently better / easier for building secure sites for handling payment or customer data",Various_Ad5600,1hf74t8,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hf74t8/how_are_laravel_and_drupal_for_ecommerce/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hf74t8/how_are_laravel_and_drupal_for_ecommerce/,2024-12-16 00:52:03,2,1.0,2,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hf74t8
