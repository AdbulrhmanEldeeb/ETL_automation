pcgaming,Playstation games to release day one on PC by 2028? ,"Was just reading an old thread on the insomniac leak and the leaked budget allocation for Insomniac's PC ports.

https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/18mpilz/playstation_games_pc_port_budgets_revealed/

The last fiscal year for budget seems to represent when the PC port arrives. We can see FY 2025 listed for Spider-Man 2 (March 2024-April 2025), which did just become true with Spider-Man 2 releasing early next year on PC. Seems Wolverine will come to PC just a year after it's console release as well (console release leaked for 2026, PC budget lists FY27)

The interesting part is Spider-Man 3, FY2027 with 7 million budget. This game was leaked to release in 2028, but this allocation suggests a huge PC development push before the game comes out, possibly suggesting a day one PC release. The fact no other FY are listed is interesting. 

What do you guys think? I think as of right we are just at a 1 year delayed PC port, but in just a few years that shrinks to day one.

pcgaming,Dead Rising 2/OTR/Case Zero/Case West/3 Mouse Injector Release (Raw Input),"Hello everyone, 

I've spent the last few days working on mouse injectors for Dead Rising 2, Off the Record and 3. Additionally, [Clippy95](https://github.com/Clippy95) and I added raw mouse input to the 360 exclusive games ([Case Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNd-IZvk5YU) and [Case West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_f34AbGlGQ)) for [Xenia Canary's Mousehook build](https://github.com/marinesciencedude/xenia-canary-mousehook).

[Bonus DR3 FOV Tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/deadrising3/mods/21)

They *should* be compatible with all current working mods for these games. I have specifically tested [DR2 Hookary](https://github.com/Xinerki/DR2Hookary/releases) and [Off the Record Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/deadrising2offtherecord/mods/37) and found no problems as long as you put them inside the included DLLMods folder. 

I don't own Dead Rising 4 but I would imagine that it wouldn't be too hard to fix either. Additionally, I spent some time trying to fix the mouse input in the original PC port of Dead Rising 1 but it's a bit trickier unfortunately. 

I haven't found any bugs in any of the games yet, but please let me know if you see any. If you play Dead Rising 3, make sure that you cap the framerate at 100FPS or the ADS won't work (in general, not related to my mod).",Desgeras,1hf1zd1,https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hf1zd1/dead_rising_2otrcase_zerocase_west3_mouse/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1hf1zd1/dead_rising_2otrcase_zerocase_west3_mouse/,2024-12-15 20:48:35,85,0.92,85,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hf1zd1
