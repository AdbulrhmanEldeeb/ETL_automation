learnprogramming,I have no idea what to do with my programming knowledge ,"I am 17M, I've been coding in Java for 4 years doing Minecraft modding. I've contributed to some open source projects there, at this point I think I can accomplish any type of programming project quickly, Minecraft modding gave me ability to search across large code bases with no documentation and do what I want to do with them. Also I am really into linux stuff, I use Gentoo and DWM as my daily driver. But one and a half years ago I had a really bad burnout out of all of this because I lost interest in Minecraft community, and gaming in general, for straight up a year I wasn't able to even open IDE, yet write any code. Recently I kinda got out of it, started learning C++ and digging into lower level programming/reverse engineering just because I felt like it. I had a pet project coding my own digital synthsizer in C++ because in that year of programming burnout I taught myself electronic music production, tried out opengl too. For now what I try in programming doesn't have any goal, nor I want to seriously publish it or promote it, just for the sake of practice. I no longer have that much of a motivation and enthusiasm I had when I was starting, my main passion being music production nowadays. My programming knowledge feels really like an elephant in the room, it's big, it's always there, but I seem to hardly ignore it most of the time.

I thought about video game development since I've chosen more artistic niche and already have done modding, but personally I don't play them at all, nor have any video game idea worth spending my time.

I have a youtube channel about Minecraft modding which got popular by an accident. (1,3k subscribers, not that much but not too small, the most popular video has 20k views) but I literally make videos once half a year, and honestly I no longer want to make any videos for it because I am no longer interested in Minecraft, nor I want to be a youtuber, because I am definitely not a media/entertainment kind of person. I tried live streaming and even made some money off donations, but it's too exhausting for me.

I think I'll get a programming job at some point just because it's what goes easy to me and plan to go into CS uni after finishing high school. Tho honestly I have absolutely no idea who I am and what I want to do in my life. Am I an artist? Am I a technical person? Am I a youtuber? I feel like none of them.

Has anyone here had an experience similar to this? Did you just abandon programming, or suddenly found a programmig niche you are passionate about?

learnprogramming,Help me create a structured 6-month roadmap to crack an SDE role at a product-based company!,"Hi everyone,

I need some guidance and advice! I have **3 years of experience** (primarily in Flutter development), and I'm now aiming to transition into an **SDE role** at a product-based company like **FAANG, Zomato, Swiggy, PhonePe, Cred**, etc.

I’ve taken a **6-month career break** and can dedicate **12 hours daily** to preparation. My goal is to crack an SDE-2 role within the next **5 months**. I understand this role requires strong **DSA, system design**, and **backend knowledge**, areas I need to strengthen.

# What I need help with:

1. **DSA**:
   * How do I structure DSA prep efficiently? Which platforms are best (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.)?
   * What topics should I focus on, and how many problems per topic are realistic for mastery?
2. **System Design**:
   * Any resources for both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**?
   * How can I make system design concepts stick?
3. **Backend Development**:
   * Key topics (databases, REST APIs, microservices, etc.) I should focus on.
   * Recommended projects or resources to build practical understanding.
4. **Projects and Portfolio**:
   * Should I build new projects that showcase system design or backend expertise since my experience so far is in Flutter?
   * What kind of projects will stand out for SDE-2 roles?
5. **Mock Interviews**:
   * When should I start practicing mocks? Any platforms or groups you recommend for peer interviews?

# My Plan:

I want to make the most of these 5 months with a **structured and focused approach**. Given I can dedicate **12 hours daily** (a mix of learning, coding, and practice), I’d love input on a clear **timeline or weekly/monthly roadmap**.

If you've successfully cracked similar roles or have experience preparing for these positions, your suggestions would mean a lot!

Thanks in advance for helping me map out this journey. I’m ready to put in the work, but I need your insights on the **best strategy, resources, and milestones** to follow.",VikAnk,1hfi6qy,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfi6qy/help_me_create_a_structured_6month_roadmap_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfi6qy/help_me_create_a_structured_6month_roadmap_to/,2024-12-16 12:39:28,0,0.38,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Resource,,t3_1hfi6qy

In my opinion it really feels like the whole low level vs high level situation, where you would have to move on to a new methodology and get used to it, But we shouldnt underestimate how fast you can see through codebases understanding the dataflow, flaws, how the architicture is structured.  
Its mind boggiling that we use this all the time in high quality learning materials with aws and web apps or even concepts yet not much implementation was made for direct usage. imagine just opening any repo and visualizing its structure directly.

I've seen some web apps that applied it but none came close to [CodeSee.io](http://CodeSee.io) but they went out of business, when you look at their implementation its so smooth for a new dev to understand the flow and funcionality  just with how condense the contexual view they get from these diagrams.

learnprogramming,Struggling to use git for personal projects,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been trying to improve my skills in both frontend and backend development by working on personal projects. But there’s something that keeps getting in the way: Git.

It’s not that I don’t understand Git. I know how branches work, how to write commit messages, and the basics of version control. The problem is when I actually try to use it for personal projects. My projects are usually super spontaneous, I just dive in and code without a clear plan.

When I try to involve Git, I feel paralyzed. I overthink everything: *“How do I structure my code so I can commit it properly?”* or *“What if I change a component five times in one session, how do I organize that into meaningful commits?”* It’s like I can’t let myself commit anything less than perfect, and the pressure completely kills my flow.

Sometimes I spend so much time worrying about *how* to commit that I stop coding altogether. I know Git is supposed to make things easier, but instead, it’s making me overthink everything.

Has anyone else dealt with this?   
How do you use Git in personal projects without feeling overwhelmed?

learnprogramming,"If you've been practicing and using Powershell, and your workplace uses Powershell, would learning Python in addition help, hurt, or have no effect on your Powershell skills?","I've been using Powershell for the better part of a year. I work as a performance engineer and eventually want to transition into the data-centric roles (like data sciences). 

The reason I'm asking this question is because Python is seemingly used *everywhere* whereas Powershell is more often used in Microsoft-centric shops. Also, because everything is Microsoft where I'm at the scripts and automation tooling is using it so I will always be touching Powershell primarily.
  
That being said, if I wanted to use Python for other (smaller) scripts at my job, do you think this will hurt my growth or effectiveness in Powershell? I'm not yet an expert in Powershell, so I don't want to do be a jack of all trades but master of none, but I can't tell if using Python (for personal projects in addition to smaller work projects) would help or hurt my skills in Powershell.  Also, by smaller work projects, they will essentially be small scripts that fetch API data or something similar as my team does not work with or troubleshoot or know Python, they only know powershell (so in essence, I won't be getting the feedback like I do in powershell from seniors)

learnprogramming,Got marked wrong for saying SELECT is 'the SQL keyword for querying' in my DS exam - am I wrong?,"Quick sanity check needed regarding a Data Science exam question I'm disputing.

Question asked: ""The SQL keyword for filtering after grouping is **(i)**, and the SQL keyword for querying is **(ii)**.""

I correctly put HAVING for (i), and put SELECT for (ii) but was marked wrong. Prof says WHERE is correct because ""SELECT is for specifying a subset of columns; querying is the act of specifying a subset of rows.""

However, PostgreSQL's documentation literally states: ""The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. In SQL the SELECT command is used to specify queries.""

When I disputed it, prof mentioned it was meant to parallel Pandas concepts from lecture, but the question itself made no mention of Pandas or specifically asking about row filtering.

I get that WHERE filters rows. But if you're asked ""what's the SQL keyword for querying"" with no other context, isn't SELECT a valid answer? The question doesn't specify row filtering anywhere.

I'm 1.3 exam points from an A in the course, so this isn't just me being pedantic. Would love to hear what other DS folks think.

Additional context: This was in an intro DS course where we covered both Pandas and SQL.

Edit: here's the conversation that ensued with a grader:

ME: ""I believe this question is ambiguous. SELECT is fundamentally the main querying keyword in SQL, beginning every query statement. While WHERE filters rows, 'querying' isn't exclusively about row filtering in SQL terminology. Could you please reconsider this answer?""

GRADER: ""Hi \*\*\*! I see where you're coming from. But, the idea behind this question was to identify the SQL equivalent of various ideas in pandas that we discussed at length. Filtering after grouping is an idea we know about in pandas. Similarly, querying was well-defined as a Thing in pandas in Lecture, and so we were looking for the SQL equivalent of that. I hope that clarifies things; sorry about that!""

ME: ""Thank you for explaining the Pandas connection. However, the question only asks about 'the SQL keyword for querying' without mentioning Pandas. I interpreted it from a general SQL perspective, where SELECT would be a valid answer. I'm currently just 1.3 exam points away from an A in the course, so I'd really appreciate if you could reconsider this question. Thank you for your time.""

GRADER: ""Unfortunately, even within a SQL context, select is for querying specific columns, not rows.""

ME: ""From PostgreSQL docs 7.1: 'The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. In SQL the SELECT command is used to specify queries.'

If the question specified 'the SQL keyword for filtering rows' rather than 'the SQL keyword for querying,' then WHERE would be the clear answer.

Description of the strategy behind the code is as defined Below: 



Here's a basic outline for your Expert Advisor (EA) in MQL5 based on your parameters:



\### Explanation:



1. \*\*Entry Criteria:\*\*

   \- \*\*RSI:\*\* The EA checks if the RSI is below 70.

   \- \*\*MACD:\*\* It checks for bearish divergence by comparing the MACD histogram's latest values.

   \- \*\*Volume:\*\* It compares the current volume with the previous volume.



2. \*\*Exit Criteria:\*\*

   \- \*\*Stop Loss:\*\* Set slightly above the previous daily high.

   \- \*\*Take Profit:\*\* Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, starting with the 38.2% level.



3. \*\*Additional Filters:\*\*

   \- Confirm the broader trend on a higher timeframe (you can add this part to the EA).



4. \*\*Alerts:\*\*

   \- The EA will send an alert when entry criteria are met.



5. \*\*Risk Management:\*\*

   \- The lot size is adjusted based on a fixed percentage risk of the account balance.

1. \*\*Entry Criteria:\*\*

   \- \*\*RSI:\*\* The EA checks if the RSI is below 70.

   \- \*\*MACD:\*\* It checks for bearish divergence by comparing the MACD histogram's latest values.

   \- \*\*Volume:\*\* It compares the current volume with the previous volume.



2. \*\*Exit Criteria:\*\*

   \- \*\*Stop Loss:\*\* Set slightly above the previous daily high.

   \- \*\*Take Profit:\*\* Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, starting with the 38.2% level.



3. \*\*Additional Filters:\*\*

   \- Confirm the broader trend on a higher timeframe (you can add this part to the EA).



4. \*\*Alerts:\*\*

   \- The EA will send an alert when entry criteria are met.



5. \*\*Risk Management:\*\*

   \- The lot size is adjusted based on a fixed percentage risk of the account balance.

### **The Challenge:**

This isn't just a coding challenge—it's a test of how AI interacts with evolving patterns and theories. Solving it requires more than just technical skill; it demands an understanding of the logic beneath the code.  If you want the challenge to remain more mysterious and cryptic, you can remove or minimize the clarifications and leave more open to interpretation. The goal would be to make it intriguing and open-ended for those who attempt to solve it, relying more on the code's complexity and the hidden factors.

I'm a junior CS student, and I’m starting my first serious personal project. My goal is to create a website where users can download YouTube videos, TikTok sounds, etc., as MP3 files.

That said, I’ve never worked on a project that exists outside my laptop, and I’m feeling a bit lost about where to start. Here’s what I’ve figured out so far:

* I’ll use VS Code as my IDE.
* The back end will be written in Python, using Flask.
* The front end will be built with basic HTML and CSS.
* I plan to figure out how to implement a web scraper as I go (I've never made one), and how to download files to someones computer/phone.

While I feel confident I can handle the coding with enough time and troubleshooting, I’m unclear about some broader aspects of the project:

1. **Project Structure:** How should I organize my files and code for a web app like this?
2. **Hosting:** What’s the best way to host a project like this so others can access it online?
3. **Best Practices:** Are there general tips or advice on managing and structuring a project like this?

  
Ultimately if this pans out smoothly I'd love to try even monetizing it with something like Google AdSense. I know I'd probably get next to zero traffic, but it'd sound even better on a resume.

He says automatizations is today's game, and told me about [make.com](http://make.com), where he just created an assistant (really really good) to create appointments. I told him i don't like the idea of being dependent of a platform and i want to create my entire own structure, my objectives are clearly different to his; i want to create neural networks and ultimately my own llm to help me. 

  
My argument is the following: i do not want to depend on anything or anyone, i want to fully understand what i'm doing and why i'm doing it, i absolutely fucking hate a solutionist approach to things and believe that's the world that's being built right now. That is why i want to learn from scratch: CS/ML math, python, and then build my NNs.

This is the function I'm using to fetch the thumbnail data [I got the function from this article](https://medium.com/@louistrinh/get-the-thumbnail-url-from-a-youtube-video-551748da161d):

    async function getThumbnailURL(videoId) {
       const response = await fetch(`https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&amp;url=${videoId}`);
       const data = await response.json();
       return data.thumbnail_url;
    }

  
This is my renderItem function:

    const renderItem =({item}) =&gt; {
    const thumbnailURL =  getThumbnailURL(item.id);
    console.log(typeof(thumbnailURL))
    
    return(
    &lt;View style={styles.video}&gt; 
                        &lt;Image
                            source={{
                              uri: thumbnailURL

                    &lt;/View&gt;
    );
    }



What displays when 'console.log(thumbnailURL)' runs for the 9 youtube ID's is

    (NOBRIDGE) LOG  {""_h"": 0, ""_i"": 0, ""_j"": null, ""_k"": null}
    (NOBRIDGE) LOG  {""_h"": 0, ""_i"": 0, ""_j"": null, ""_k"": null}

and this is the flatlist I'm using to display all the thumbnails



    &lt;View&gt;
      &lt;FlatList

I’m seeking advice on how to **build the framework for a machine learning software**. The goal is to create software where:

1. A user inputs a **dependent variable** (e.g., Maths Score).
2. The software predicts the **independent variables** (e.g., Classes Attended, Daily Practice Hours, etc.).
3. The framework should allow for training models (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest) on a dataset (CSV) and then predict values based on the user input.

Here’s what I want to focus on:

* How to **design the framework** (frontend, backend, database).
* Resources for **learning about modular and scalable architecture**.
* Any tips on tools/libraries that can make this process easier for a beginner.

**Background**: I'm new to this field.

learnprogramming,Is it a ok to stream a paginated array?,"This is probably a noob question but I haven't been able to google streaming a big array of items from the server to the browser.

Let's say I have a list of 10k (or even just 100) bank transactions that I must get into the browser for some reason. Naturally, I want to paginate this maybe loading 10 items each so that in case the client network is bad they don't stare at a loading spinner for too long.

Which option is better?

1. Traditional Pagination: send a request, wait for 10 items to load, render them, send the next one. This is the easiest and most common. But we gotta wait for 10 items and 10 is kinda a magic number, if the network is really good, we might want to load 1k at a time, or if it's really bad, then perhaps 5 items per page is better. In the context of reactive programming, this seems like a waste, we stream the array from db but right before writing response stop and buffer it up?
2. Streaming Pagination: establish a connection, send a request message, parse and render 10 items as they come in one-by-one, send the next request, ... , at the end close the connection. Same as above but now we don't wait for 10 items! However if the connection is good, constant rendering might be overkill but we can throttle it on the client, so it shouldn't be an issue.
3. Streaming: establish a connection, send an unbounded request, parse and render one-by-one all of them, close the connection. Same as above but we don't need to keep sending the requests for ""10 more"".

I left the protocols out of it as I don't know much about them, but I am aware that there's HTTP that's good for #1, long-lived HTTP that's good for #2 (but I don't think any of my tools support it: apollo graphql client, spring graphql webflux - I know that's how Next.JS streams the webpage in the same request as it loads), websockets that's good for #2 and maybe #3, and rsocket that's good for all 3 options.

I see a problem with #2 and #3 where the client can get overwhelmed with processing items but the connection is still open - is that a big deal? In case of #2 it will not request next until it is done processing the current. And in case of #3 it will need to tell the server to stop explicitly - with websockets, that would have to be a custom logic, and with rsocket, it would be naturally done via backpressure (if done via backpressure, will the server pause or will it keep reading the db and buffer until it runs out of memory?).

Let me know if there's anything else to consider but it seems to me neither of these options are ideal but #1 is the easiest. The perfect solution would be lightweight end-to-end and the items would smoothly pop up in the UI as they come straight from the backend db.",MrJaver,1hfd6ys,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfd6ys/is_it_a_ok_to_stream_a_paginated_array/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfd6ys/is_it_a_ok_to_stream_a_paginated_array/,2024-12-16 06:35:30,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfd6ys

learnprogramming,Best way to program for cross platform?,"I want to make an app that works on desktop ios snd andoird. Just a personal project to learn some nee things. So probably won't actually post it somewhere.

I was woundering if there is a simple solution that doesn't involve writting it three times. Just once and editing the ui to fit large and small screen.
My initial thought was unity, but I have no idea how smart that is.

The app I want to make would be something a kin to a simple notes up, practice read write files, saving write protections blah blah blah, something simple that has a simple ui",Mrsnowmanmanson,1hezd8f,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hezd8f/best_way_to_program_for_cross_platform/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hezd8f/best_way_to_program_for_cross_platform/,2024-12-15 18:50:59,8,0.8,8,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hezd8f
learnprogramming,Question in python About Index,"if you are working with an api in python program and the api send a a json response like:

    response = {'data': [
                    {'node': {'id': 2, 'title': 'name1', 'title1': 'name1', 'key': 'value1'},
                    {'node': {'id': 3, 'title': 'name2', 'title1': 'name2', 'key': 'value2'}
                  ]}

and you want to get all the values of node values using For Loop lets say in a list like this:

    my_data = [2, 'name1', 'name1', 'value1', 3, 'name2', 'name2', 'value2']

but lets say the api did not send all the data like:

    response = {'data': [
                    {'node': {'id': 2, 'key': 'value1'},
                    {'node': {'id': 3, 'title2': 'name2', 'key': 'value2'}
                  ]}

**My Question is:**

what can we do in the index so there is No KeyError or IndexError? 

meaning if you indexing to some keys and you can not find it (KeyError or IndexError) set it to some default value, Is this possible ?",IntrepidInstance7347,1heyn1i,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1heyn1i/question_in_python_about_index/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1heyn1i/question_in_python_about_index/,2024-12-15 18:18:20,3,1.0,3,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1heyn1i
