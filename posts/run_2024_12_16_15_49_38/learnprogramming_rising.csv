learnprogramming,I have no idea what to do with my programming knowledge ,"I am 17M, I've been coding in Java for 4 years doing Minecraft modding. I've contributed to some open source projects there, at this point I think I can accomplish any type of programming project quickly, Minecraft modding gave me ability to search across large code bases with no documentation and do what I want to do with them. Also I am really into linux stuff, I use Gentoo and DWM as my daily driver. But one and a half years ago I had a really bad burnout out of all of this because I lost interest in Minecraft community, and gaming in general, for straight up a year I wasn't able to even open IDE, yet write any code. Recently I kinda got out of it, started learning C++ and digging into lower level programming/reverse engineering just because I felt like it. I had a pet project coding my own digital synthsizer in C++ because in that year of programming burnout I taught myself electronic music production, tried out opengl too. For now what I try in programming doesn't have any goal, nor I want to seriously publish it or promote it, just for the sake of practice. I no longer have that much of a motivation and enthusiasm I had when I was starting, my main passion being music production nowadays. My programming knowledge feels really like an elephant in the room, it's big, it's always there, but I seem to hardly ignore it most of the time.

I thought about video game development since I've chosen more artistic niche and already have done modding, but personally I don't play them at all, nor have any video game idea worth spending my time.

I have a youtube channel about Minecraft modding which got popular by an accident. (1,3k subscribers, not that much but not too small, the most popular video has 20k views) but I literally make videos once half a year, and honestly I no longer want to make any videos for it because I am no longer interested in Minecraft, nor I want to be a youtuber, because I am definitely not a media/entertainment kind of person. I tried live streaming and even made some money off donations, but it's too exhausting for me.

I think I'll get a programming job at some point just because it's what goes easy to me and plan to go into CS uni after finishing high school. Tho honestly I have absolutely no idea who I am and what I want to do in my life. Am I an artist? Am I a technical person? Am I a youtuber? I feel like none of them.

learnprogramming,Giving up programming after 5 years trying it.,"This is more of a vent than anything else, and maybe it will be useful to someone as to not give up too late as I did.

You see, Programming is an ability that much like a Soccer Player, an Artist, etc, you either can do it or you can't. You see some people simply sit in front of the keyboard, and in less than 10 seconds they write 30 lines of code, whereas others like me, even trying so hard to dig in deep into the subject, couldn't even get past my 5th line. To have that level of understanding, in less than one year some people may do what you took 3 or 4 to make.

Programming is an exceptional and amazing ability, maybe professional programmers don't see it as outsiders like me do, but if you can code, you do HAVE a really valuable ability that sooooo many people wish they had, so try not to stress that much over non important things, because you are amazing.

Unfortunately, I won't be there with you guys. The competition is harsh, and I can no longer keep being left behind in a market I can't compete. Just wanted to let it all out.

It's no shame if you're in doubt if you should quit or not. To lose a battle is natural, but as long as you can keep standing. I will still stand, but somewhere else that fits me more. It's not healthy either to keep doing something that clearly isn't giving results. It was a good (and LONG, long long) journey.

I was initially thinking to keep the auto inc integer ID for internal operations, then UUID for any requested interaction, but still having an ID I would assume \_could\_ in edge cases where for example a DTO mistakenly keeps an ID to be open to guessing an ID.

So in 2024, whats the most accepted approach.

learnprogramming,Got marked wrong for saying SELECT is 'the SQL keyword for querying' in my DS exam - am I wrong?,"Quick sanity check needed regarding a Data Science exam question I'm disputing.

Question asked: ""The SQL keyword for filtering after grouping is **(i)**, and the SQL keyword for querying is **(ii)**.""

I correctly put HAVING for (i), and put SELECT for (ii) but was marked wrong. Prof says WHERE is correct because ""SELECT is for specifying a subset of columns; querying is the act of specifying a subset of rows.""

However, PostgreSQL's documentation literally states: ""The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. In SQL the SELECT command is used to specify queries.""

When I disputed it, prof mentioned it was meant to parallel Pandas concepts from lecture, but the question itself made no mention of Pandas or specifically asking about row filtering.

I get that WHERE filters rows. But if you're asked ""what's the SQL keyword for querying"" with no other context, isn't SELECT a valid answer? The question doesn't specify row filtering anywhere.

I'm 1.3 exam points from an A in the course, so this isn't just me being pedantic. Would love to hear what other DS folks think.

Additional context: This was in an intro DS course where we covered both Pandas and SQL.

Edit: here's the conversation that ensued with a grader:

ME: ""I believe this question is ambiguous. SELECT is fundamentally the main querying keyword in SQL, beginning every query statement. While WHERE filters rows, 'querying' isn't exclusively about row filtering in SQL terminology. Could you please reconsider this answer?""

GRADER: ""Hi \*\*\*! I see where you're coming from. But, the idea behind this question was to identify the SQL equivalent of various ideas in pandas that we discussed at length. Filtering after grouping is an idea we know about in pandas. Similarly, querying was well-defined as a Thing in pandas in Lecture, and so we were looking for the SQL equivalent of that. I hope that clarifies things; sorry about that!""

ME: ""Thank you for explaining the Pandas connection. However, the question only asks about 'the SQL keyword for querying' without mentioning Pandas. I interpreted it from a general SQL perspective, where SELECT would be a valid answer. I'm currently just 1.3 exam points away from an A in the course, so I'd really appreciate if you could reconsider this question. Thank you for your time.""

GRADER: ""Unfortunately, even within a SQL context, select is for querying specific columns, not rows.""

ME: ""From PostgreSQL docs 7.1: 'The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. In SQL the SELECT command is used to specify queries.'

If the question specified 'the SQL keyword for filtering rows' rather than 'the SQL keyword for querying,' then WHERE would be the clear answer.

learnprogramming,Help! Help!     Wanna Build a Framework for ML Software to Predict Independent Variables Suggestions and Resources Needed!,"Hi everyone!

I’m seeking advice on how to **build the framework for a machine learning software**. The goal is to create software where:

1. A user inputs a **dependent variable** (e.g., Maths Score).
2. The software predicts the **independent variables** (e.g., Classes Attended, Daily Practice Hours, etc.).
3. The framework should allow for training models (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest) on a dataset (CSV) and then predict values based on the user input.

Here’s what I want to focus on:

* How to **design the framework** (frontend, backend, database).
* Resources for **learning about modular and scalable architecture**.
* Any tips on tools/libraries that can make this process easier for a beginner.

**Background**: I'm new to this field.

Would love your advice on:

* Framework design (how to structure the software).
* Best subreddits/resources for beginners tackling ML software development.
* Any step-by-step guides/tutorials you recommend.

Thanks in advance for any help!",ChampionshipSolid515,1hfe143,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfe143/help_help_wanna_build_a_framework_for_ml_software/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfe143/help_help_wanna_build_a_framework_for_ml_software/,2024-12-16 07:37:57,3,1.0,3,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfe143
learnprogramming,How to periodically take  screenshots of live webcams websites and Youtube livestreams?,"I've been wanting to create an app where users can take a picture of the view / skyline and it'll estimate the current air quality.

To make this, I think I need to train a model that uses a dataset of images of view / skylines paired with a nearby air quality data.

I'm thinking of using the live webcams on [SkylineWebcams](https://www.skylinewebcams.com/en/webcam/china/shanghai/shanghai/skyline-of-shanghai.html), [EarthCam](https://www.earthcam.com/usa/newjersey/weehawken/?cam=lincolnharbor), or even [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_bUVExv_Cg) and pair the screenshots with air quality data from nearby stations.

I don't really have any experience with ML or meteorology but based on this [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666498423000844?via%3Dihub) that I stumbled upon. It looks like it's accurate enough for the idea to be a low cost solution for places where ground stations aren't ideal. I don't need the model to be big and accurate either, just a fun thing to test out and learn about ML.



Question is, how can I take screenshots of the live media player in these website and Youtube?

And would this even be the ideal way?",PathonScript,1hfj5ae,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfj5ae/how_to_periodically_take_screenshots_of_live/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hfj5ae/how_to_periodically_take_screenshots_of_live/,2024-12-16 13:32:17,0,0.33,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hfj5ae
learnprogramming,Struggling to use git for personal projects,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been trying to improve my skills in both frontend and backend development by working on personal projects. But there’s something that keeps getting in the way: Git.

It’s not that I don’t understand Git. I know how branches work, how to write commit messages, and the basics of version control. The problem is when I actually try to use it for personal projects. My projects are usually super spontaneous, I just dive in and code without a clear plan.

When I try to involve Git, I feel paralyzed. I overthink everything: *“How do I structure my code so I can commit it properly?”* or *“What if I change a component five times in one session, how do I organize that into meaningful commits?”* It’s like I can’t let myself commit anything less than perfect, and the pressure completely kills my flow.

Sometimes I spend so much time worrying about *how* to commit that I stop coding altogether. I know Git is supposed to make things easier, but instead, it’s making me overthink everything.

Has anyone else dealt with this?   
How do you use Git in personal projects without feeling overwhelmed?  
Would love to hear any tips or advice!

learnprogramming,"If you've been practicing and using Powershell, and your workplace uses Powershell, would learning Python in addition help, hurt, or have no effect on your Powershell skills?","I've been using Powershell for the better part of a year. I work as a performance engineer and eventually want to transition into the data-centric roles (like data sciences). 

The reason I'm asking this question is because Python is seemingly used *everywhere* whereas Powershell is more often used in Microsoft-centric shops. Also, because everything is Microsoft where I'm at the scripts and automation tooling is using it so I will always be touching Powershell primarily.
  
That being said, if I wanted to use Python for other (smaller) scripts at my job, do you think this will hurt my growth or effectiveness in Powershell? I'm not yet an expert in Powershell, so I don't want to do be a jack of all trades but master of none, but I can't tell if using Python (for personal projects in addition to smaller work projects) would help or hurt my skills in Powershell.  Also, by smaller work projects, they will essentially be small scripts that fetch API data or something similar as my team does not work with or troubleshoot or know Python, they only know powershell (so in essence, I won't be getting the feedback like I do in powershell from seniors)
