books,Why do booktubers not all of them but some of them put so much pressure on themselves when it comes to reading? why don't they do it for fun anymore?,"Have any of you that watch booktube noticed booktubers acting like this lately because I have and I wonder. why? Some of the booktubers that I've been watching lately have been making these challenges for themselves where they have to read a certain amount of pages for the month and when they don't they get disappointed with themselves. 

Saying I'm going to try again next month and I'm going to beat it. Also they will make videos doing wrap ups talking about all the books they read the previous month and how sometimes they're disappointed with themselves because they haven't read as many as the month before that or as many as they normally do. 

These same people also get disappointed with themselves when their yearly goal isn't the same or more as the previous one. Meaning they haven't read as many as last year or more than last year. So I'm genuinely curious why they're doing this to themselves? What happened to just reading books as long as you're enjoying them and who cares how many?

 Is it because so many people feel the need to turn their hobby into a job nowadays and want to make money so they feel like they have to do these kinds of things in order to keep up their viewership and bring in the coin? Because if so I could kind of understand but still. And I should also say not just booktubers do this I'm sure there's plenty of book TikTok accounts that do as well. But I only ever see it on booktube.",inyoureyesiremeberu,1hf9m8n,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hf9m8n/why_do_booktubers_not_all_of_them_but_some_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hf9m8n/why_do_booktubers_not_all_of_them_but_some_of/,2024-12-16 03:01:18,319,0.71,319,0,218,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hf9m8n

books,The Child Thief by Brom is the best Peter Pan retelling (and the best retelling in general) I'd read so far,"Wow. Just...wow. I am speechless. It's been one month since I finished this book and I have yet to decide how I should write this review for I am afraid I will not do justice to it. Isn't it funny? How unpredictable books can be? You enter to a book with little to no expectations and somehow, it ends up becoming one of your most favourite books. There's something magical with this. *Just like there was something magical with this book.*

I can't say that I am a huge fan of the original novel of Peter Pan. Sure, it is very whimsical, adventurous and fun and it also has some dark elements that add more to the story. But I never felt any particular connection with it. That being said, last year I developed a keen interest on Peter Pan's retellings. I was always a firm believer of how easy it is to twist the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland and how much scope of imagination one can find in this story. Last year, I had the chance to read two of these retellings: Peter Darling and Darling Girl: A Novel of Peter Pan. While I liked the first more than the latter and while they weren't terrible, I cannot say that I found what I was seeking in these. They felt lackluster and my expectations were not met.

While I was searching for more Peter Pan retellings, I came across The Child Thief. I read the blurb and I was immediately hooked (no pun intended). I always feel lured by darker versions of Peter Pan's tale. Even as a child, the darker aspects of the classic novel always peaked my interest and I had found myself wondering: ""How could someone make it even darker?"". Well, I just got my answer with Brom. And I couldn't be happier about it.

From the very first pages, Brom makes his message and intentions clear enough: this is not a story made for children. Far from it. This is his own version of Peter Pan which is one hundred times darker than the one you know. While in the original novel, the dark elements are more subtle, in Brom's version everything is in your face. You can't escape the darkness and cruelty no matter how hard you try.

Although the story is inspired by Peter Pan, the novel can be interpreted as something original. Aside from the character of Peter (who is just known as ""Peter"" and not ""Peter Pan""), there are no direct mentions from the original story. Of course there are some easter eggs, like the Pirates, faeries, the ""lost boys"", a girl named Wendilyn but aside from these, the story is very original and fresh. And this is another reason why I loved this novel. It doesn't rely on the original and it presents something unique.

For a standalone book, I found the world-building to be very well-crafted and detailed. Instead of Neverland we have Avalon, a place full of magic and mischief, where creatures of all kinds can live. The descriptions of the characters and Avalon were so vivid and rich and at times, I wished I could be there (minus when things got dangerous). It is remarkable how Brom took inspiration from the arthurian legends and other folklores and combined them to create his own story. What I really appreciated in the book was the characterisation of the magical inhabitants of Avalon. Brom's portrayal of the faeries was exactly how I've always envisioned them: mystical and charming, yet unpredictable and mischievous. The beautiful illustrations that accompany the text help really helped me to picture the characters and the places in my head and they really make the story come *alive*.

In the book, we get to see Avalon in its full glory (from Peter's backstory) and in its current state. While Avalon used to thrive and be a lush, enchanted paradise, now it has become a dangerous and dark wasteland. After the arrival of a ship full of men, the island began to decay. And it is up to Peter and its ""devils"" to make it flourish again.

Since the story provides multiple point of views, it's shown that this war was lead by fear and misunderstandings. With one way or another, everyone wanted the same thing; Avalon's inhabitants wanted Flesh Eaters to leave and the Flesh Eaters wanted to escape from Avalon. Had they spoken to each other instead of being hostile, the matter would have been solved. But the fears and hatred from both sides left no room for civil conversations. Just like in real life where people prefer to act on their prejudice and irrational worries, in the book both sides never tried to get to know each other and understand their goals. Brom reminds us how pointless violence is and what a merrier world it would be, if humans weren't guided by fear.

&gt;*Both sides so blinded by their fear and hate of each other that they couldn't see they were all fighting for the same thing.*

The story was oh so adventurous and packed with action. There were many moments which made me excited and impatient to see what would happen next. I kid you not, at times I would literally shiver from anticipation and adrenaline. During the fight scenes, I was always on edge, waiting to see which side would take over. The deeper I dived into the story, the more eager I got to see how it would escalate. Right when I thought I had it all figured out, something would happen that would shatter my mindset and make me create new theories. The book was very unpredictable but that made it even better. I couldn't tell which character I should trust or not, what would happen next, who would win in a battle etc. The unpredictable rotation of the story matched with the unpredictable nature of Peter and Avalon and yet every event had a purpose and didn't feel unnecessary.

Some moments made me sick in the stomach. If you cannot handle descriptions of dead children's bodies or any other body horror elements, maybe this book isn't for you. I eventually kinda got used to them but the uncanny feeling they gave me never left. Combined with the mysterious yet dangerous atmosphere of Avalon, it was enough to send shivers up and down my spine. Aside from the gore descriptions, the context of the book is very dark. Violence in every form can be found in almost every single page and we are constantly reminded of the cruelty not only in Avalon but the real world - our world - too. The book opens with Peter saving a little girl from her abusive father. Then we follow Nick who is trying to escape from the drug dealers that torment him and his family. And that's only the beginning.

For a fantasy book, The Book Thief liked to remind me of the ugliness of our world and the cruel nature of the human race. I was very surprised actually to see that it tackled many serious topics, like child abuse or racism. Two of the most promiment themes of the book were religious fanatism and colonialism and if you asked me, we truly need more books that explore these serious subjects. The depiction of religious radicalism through the Reverend was scary to say the least and it truly showed how far can someone go in the name of their belief.

Besides a detailed and unique setting, Brom weaved a cast of complex and morally ambiguous characters. Truth be said, someone could describe the majority of the protagonists as unlikeable. And they wouldn't be wrong. Many of the characters did horrible things. Some of them were justified and some of them were not. And I loved that. I like it when a book challenges my opinion on the characters and when it makes me question their actions and motives. That was exactly the case in this book. There were obviously some characters whom I liked more but overall, I was invested in all of them.

Let's analyse some of them, shall we?

First of all, we have Nick, one of the main protagonists alongside Peter. At the beginning, I was quite sceptical about him. I didn't expect him to grow on me. At first I believed he would be the typical teenage protagonist but that was not the case here. Nick was a pretty complex character. On the one hand, he was desperate to escape from Marco and his gang that harassed him but on the other hand, he felt guilty for abandoning his mother and grandmother. Once he arrives in Avalon, he begins questioning Peter's morals and the more the learns about the island, the more he calls Peter out. And he did it very often which I'm honestly thankful for because Peter really needed it.

Nick was brave in his own way. He showed fear but he was always ready to put on a fight whether it was to protect himself or his friends - for he became close with some of the Devils. On top of that, after his arrival to Avalon, he realises that he's turning into a Flesh Eater which consumes his thoughts and torments his mind. The passages with his dreams of turning fully into a monster were quite creepy and when the story focused on him, I felt like he was slowly losing his mind. I genuinely enjoyed following his story and I was rooting for him to return home and fulfil his goal to protect his family. 

The Devils, Peter's ""gang"" as I liked to call them were very charming to read. Although they would act like bloodthirsty creatures, deep inside they were still children. But they remained brave warriors who didn't hesitate to thrust themselves in a battle. Their loyalty to Peter was evident and it was constantly shown that they were willing to die for him and for Avalon.

As Nick got to know the Devils, he was constantly wondering how they could endure and support Peter. The answer was very simple: they saw Peter as their savior who had given them a chance for a better life compared to their past one. All of these children had been abused, belittled and neglected. How could they not trust Peter, who had lead them to a better place (according to them) and who had put an end to their problems (despite bringing up more...).

My most favourite members of the Devils were definitely Sekeu and Red Bone, whom the books explores more. The first one is a nod to Tiger Lily, a strong native American warrior and Peter's closest companion. Sekeu was one of my favourite characters in general. She seemed cold and strict at first but she had some moments when she expressed her softer side. She was supportive towards Nick and she helped him to become a better warrior. She was so cool to read and it was good to see that among the other boys, she was always respected and was treated like a co-leader alongside Peter. 

**SPOILER, SKIP THE PARAGRAPH You can imagine how baffled I was when she died, like, WE HAD SPENT ONE CHAPTER SAVING HER ONLY FOR HER TO BE KILLED!? WHY DID BROM DO THIS TO ME!?**

As for Red Bone, he was very fun to read. I liked his attitude and how ironic he was and he acted like a big brother to Nick. Compared to the rest of the devils, he appeared to be more humorous but if the circumstances required it, he was deadly serious (literally and metaphorically).

A character whom I didn't expect to like as much as I ended up to like was the Captain on the Flesh Eaters. I mean, how could I? Throughout the whole book we get reminded of the atrocities he and his men has committed in the island and we get to witness it first-hand. But once the narration changed and started following the Captain, everything shattered. I got to see his own point of view and how he felt about the situation he was put in. Brom did a marvelous job at building up his character and highlighting his own doubts and concerns (especially about the Reverted). He wasn't the heartless monster I thought he was. He was a man who was desperate to escape from the hell he was trapped in and who wanted the best for his people. He wasn't a saint. But he thought he did what was best by fighting children like the devils - even if it caused him pain.

And at last, we come to Peter. Or as the book calls him, the child thief. And thief he was. That is more than clear. But under the facade of the cruel leader who trains a bunch of soldiers to save Avalon...a little boy was hidden.

I feel like I could write a whole essay regarding Peter's complexity in this book. Brom took the original character and gave him a breath of fresh ear, while keeping traits of his original personality. In the book, Peter is witty and playful. He finds enjoyment in killing his enemies and he is often humorous about it - sadistic even. He treats battles as a game and even in the face of death, his cocky attitude would not leave him. It was interesting to see this split; he was both a man and a child.

Having a big part of the narration focusing on Peter's point of view really added more depth to his character. Through his flashbacks it is shown how he was treated as a child, how he was raised and how he ended up in Avalon. Peter had a rough childhood. Unwanted by his family, ostracized by the rest of the people, he felt alone and like he had nowhere to go:

&gt;*What’s here for me? he wondered, and again grimly shook his head. Death, or at best a life of hiding in holes, like Goll. Peter fought back the tears. Is there no place for me?*

And then, he came to Avalon and met someone who showered him with love; the Lady. Whether it was by her spell or his own will, Peter loved her. And how couldn't he, for she was the only person after a very long time to care about him? While Nick was not able to fathom Peter's devotion to the Lady, the more I got to know about Peter, the more I understood him.

Peter was not innocent. He did MANY mistakes and he wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice his own Devils for the sake of Avalon and the Lady. He appeared apathetic. Uncaring. But that was not the truth. In his own way, he cared. And this passage proves it:

And then, he came to Avalon and met someone who showered him with love; the Lady. Whether it was by her spell or his own will, Peter loved her. And how couldn't he, for she was the only person after a very long time to care about him? While Nick was not able to fathom Peter's devotion to the Lady, the more I got to know about Peter, the more I understood him.

Peter was not innocent. He did MANY mistakes and he wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice his own Devils for the sake of Avalon and the Lady. He appeared apathetic. Uncaring. But that was not the truth. In his own way, he cared. And this passage proves it:

&gt;*Peter thought it’d be a while before she’d be able to fight, but she looked on the mend and he couldn’t help but smile. Almost lost you, he thought, surprised to find himself blinking back tears. Been through too much, me and you. We’re going to finish this thing together.*

Above, we can see how much Peter cared about Sekeu. Not because she was a mere soldier to fulfill his purpose but because she was someone close to him. And that goes for the rest of the children too. Their deaths were affecting him. Through the passage of time, Peter started to become more and more indifferent, treating them as something tragic yet typical. But deep inside, guilt was eating him up. He knew how far gone the war was. He knew how many lives he had sacrificed. And yet he wouldn't stop.

Peter was many things. Lethal, unpredictable, cruel, arrogant. But he was also vulnerable and desperate. Desperate to save the place he came to call home. Desperate to save the one person who was a mother figure to him. Desperate to reclaim the happiness adults had taken from him. He was someone who more than anything needed affection.

I had conflicted feelings about Peter. There were times when I enjoyed his witty attitude and fights. There were times when I wanted to scream and talk some sense into him. And I wanted to hug him for he was a little boy who hadn't known better. If I were to summarize his personality, I would use this extract, for it's perfect for Peter:

&gt;*Ever the contradiction, Tanngnost thought. One moment a cold-hearted killer, the next a sentimental boy, always the eternal optimist despite a lifetime of tragedy. Of course, that’s his glamour. The very thing that draws the children to him, makes them love him despite so many contradictions.*

If I were to complain about something, that would probably be the inconsistent pacing of the book. I never got bored but sometimes, right when the story had more action, it would progress in a slower way and drag a little. There were times when I had to stop reading, not because I was uninterested but because I wanted to take a break and re-pick when the pacing felt better.

In addition, I found the ending to be kinda rushed. It needed more exploration in terms of development because it really felt like everything was happening at once. I wouldn't change a thing about it, it was great the way it was, but if it had more built-up, it would be ideal.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed the ending. It was...bittersweet to say the least. I genuinely did not expect it. Thinking about it, it actually made sense and why Brom chose that. Once I read it, I gasped and for some minutes, I was unable to form words.

Sorry for getting carried away with this post. This book will be engraved in my memory for a very long time. It's the type of book which no matter how much time passes, I won't stop recalling its story or details. I am so happy for enjoying it so much and I can't wait to dive into Brom's other works.

Would I recommend it? Obviously yes! A thousand times yes! Even if someone is not a Peter fan, they could enjoy the book just fine. But be ware of the trigger warnings and the gore descriptions. And most importantly: be ware of a fierce boy with a contagious smile...

books,"I forget the books after I read them, and it makes me a bit frustrated","When someone brings this matter up, usually the following quote is posted: 

&gt;I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

While I understand how perfectly natural and reasonable this phenomenon is, it still irks me from time to time. Isn't it quite irritable that, say, eight month after finishing a novel, I can recall only some vague details and general atmosphere, maybe one or two motifs? 

For example, the books I read about 2 years ago, that captivated me for weeks after I had finished them - *Les Miserables* by Victor Hugo, *The Idiot* by Dostoyevsky or *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem - are now almost vanished from my memory, for I recount only their outline, some random impressions. I bet I couldn't speak about them for more than ten minutes if I were forbidden to make vague statements like 'the writing was amazing', 'the characters were multi-dimensional', etc. Theoretically I even lack the proof that I ever opened them. 

And the matter is worse! This summer I have read, among others, two magnificent novels that produced on me the most profound impression - *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck and *Joke* by Milan Kundera. I was so excited that I hastened to write some (flawed) reviews here on Reddit. And now I feel that they are fading away from my memory, the same novels that I reckoned the height of literature, among the finest masterpieces I have ever read! 

This week I finished two novellas of Steinbeck that held me engrossed from first page to last, and I can't help thinking that in six months time, I won't even remember the characters' names. 

Once again, I perfectly understand that this all natural and intrinsical. I can only hope that in the end there is *something* indefinite that persists from every book, remaining somewhere in my subconsciousness.

books,The Long Walk by Stephen King ,"Now, first I want to say the book is pretty good BUT I have one major, glaring issue with the book. The whole premise of the book is that these boys are walking for miles and miles and if they drop below a certain pace they get a warning. After three warnings the boy is shot and killed. Okay, that’s a great premise and I loved the execution of the story! Here’s my one issue….the walking pace is set to 4mph. For anyone who has been on a treadmill would soon find out, four miles per hour is a breakneck walk. In the book I am often picturing boys just barely shuffling along at the minimum speed, and some boys end up crawling for a time at the right speed!! I’m on a treadmill as I write this walking at a reasonable 3mph and the guy next to me is jogging at 4mph. I just remembered this main plot point in that book and how much it bothered me and apparently still bothers me. Unless Stephen King has an amazing walking pace, I don’t think he ever stepped on a treadmill to see if his main plot point even made sense…",DanielGaff,1he8orv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he8orv/the_long_walk_by_stephen_king/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he8orv/the_long_walk_by_stephen_king/,2024-12-14 18:10:12,161,0.85,161,0,96,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1he8orv
books,"Just finished Let the Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist, some questions","As the title says. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride but had a few things that stood out to me as either I missed something, or that were a wrinkle for me in the story's consistency. A lot can be left up to imagination, certainly, but some things felt unintentionally missing. 

&gt;!1: Elias has to ""turn off"" Jocke after biting him. Those he does not disconnect this way become infected, indicating that saliva as well as blood transmits the disease. Though the wound is made with a razor, Elias drinks directly from Tommy. How was Tommy not infected?!&lt;

&gt;!2: Elias sleeping in a bathtub full of blood raised a lot of questions. Where did the blood come from and what was it's purpose? Elias needed to consume relatively fresh blood, and there was nothing I found indicating either Hakan or Elias getting hold of so much, certainly not in a short time span as to be ""fresh"". So then was it Elias' from the wound in his back, or something similar to how he began emptying out when not invited into Oskar's apartment - like he rests in his own blood that seeps out of him? If that was the case, it was all lost when Lacke ran it down the drain which seems would have left Elias severely weakened. And, did the wound in the back come from the fight with zombie Hakan? The other damage suffered in that scene seemed to be mostly correcting itself before Elias had even left the basement.!&lt;

&gt;!3: Probably the biggest, as it's a sizeable element of the story, why was Elias acting as a girl? What's more, how did he even come to be infected? The initial vampire - the royal pervert - had Elias castrated and bled from the wound into a bowl, drinking from that. How then was Elias infected? And, more complicated because I get the idea that, *should anyone look down there* it might be an easier explanation to start from the premise of being a girl. But given what Elias is capable of, who is going to be inspecting him to find out? And, anyone who was allowed/able to inspect would find exactly what Oskar saw, a flat nothing space with a scar. So then, what's the value of acting as though he's a girl, unless as a means of manipulation - which really doesn't work because Hakan liked little boys.!&lt;

Thoughts? Opinions? I do try to be attentive in my reading, though can be distracted at times and able to miss details. Are any of these easily explained or am I raising similar questions now for others who read the book also?",dl00lIl00lb,1helwf3,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1helwf3/just_finished_let_the_right_one_in_by_john_ajvide/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1helwf3/just_finished_let_the_right_one_in_by_john_ajvide/,2024-12-15 05:32:25,20,0.83,20,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1helwf3
books,How to step outside your book comfort zone more?,"So I’ll step outside it a little but not usually and while obviously if it’s my comfort zone that means I love it but still I need to branch out I feel.

My book comfort zone is Romantsy, found family trope, and enemies to lovers. 

It’s to the point where like every book I open has the same layout of young woman who is strong but deep down is broken by her traumatic past and there’s magic and a training arc and oh wow she has magic now and the guy who seemed so tough on the outside who she hated but now theres some feelings there. And ofc a whole found family that is just like her with traumatic passes and magic and are so badass and hot and cool in a laid back way and would do anything for each other. I mean I just eat it up every time! 

It’s the adult version of the type of books I devoured as a child. It’s magic but also there’s sex and trauma and the stakes are way higher lol.

Oh and how can I forget I also love Gods and different mythology elements and just all that.

But I do think it’s time to maybe branch out a little bit more than I do. I think I could be convinced to take a leap into horror, probably not regular romance, and I’m ok with historical fiction (it’s still better with magic though). We can’t scare me away here though ok nothing too modern and calm ok no romcoms.

You know I just how do y’all stop reading practically the same book every time?

Not every book needs to be 500+ pages of magic and fighting and love and break my heart! I say as I just ordered another of that exact type…",MooMooTheDummy,1hekfy9,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hekfy9/how_to_step_outside_your_book_comfort_zone_more/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hekfy9/how_to_step_outside_your_book_comfort_zone_more/,2024-12-15 04:01:10,19,0.71,19,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hekfy9
books,"Paradise Lost (John Milton, 1608-1674)","So, I have been reading Paradise Lost by John Milton again for a while now, and I can fully say that I am enamored with this book. Ever since reading Milton a couple of years ago I have been captivated by his sheer prose and poetic works. Two years ago I bought Paradise Lost, a Poem that I've grown to love and to place in the literary Parnassus along with Dante, Virgil, Ovid, Shakespeare and other major works of ancient and modern literature.

Paradise Lost was written during a time of political and literary upheval in Britain (Civil War, execution of Charles I, rule of Lord Protector Cromwell over Britain until his death in 1658, the Restoration of King Charles II), and so many themes about Monarchy and Republicanism can be found in it. Milton composed this work when he was already blind (he became blind in 1652) with the help of friends and amanuenses, and he sold the rights of the poem in 1667 for only 10£ (Milton was severely impoverished by the time he concluded the poem in 1665). Either way, this Poem placed him in the Parnassus of English poets and went on to place him on the pedestal of many romantic writers in the 1800's (most notably William Blake, Lord Byron, John Keats, etc...). 

Paradise Lost describes the struggle of Satan (show in comparison with Achilles, Aeneas, Odysseus, etc.), following the Epic tradition of Homer and other Greek Poets. The Poem begins with an invocation to a muse (but Milton skilfully puts Urania, the Muse of Astronomy and Divine Wisdom, instead of the classical muses), and the poem begins with the fall of Satan and all of the other rebel angels after the angelic war in Heaven. Satan resolves to cause chaos on God's new creation (Earth) and on God's newfound race: Humanity. He sneaks inside the Garden of Eden and whispers into Eve's ear when she is sleeping, but he gets caught by Michael and other celestial angels. 

The plan is slowly set in motion: Eve, frightened, searchs for comfort in Adam's arms; Raphael, one of God's Archangels, describes the dangers of Satan to Adam and the celestial war that was fought in Heaven to save Heaven from the yoke of the terrible apostate angel. Eve, meanwhile, is approached by Satan (in the guise of a snake) and is tempted into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge, causing the original sin and the fall of man from Eden. Adam, seeing Eve eat the fruit, decides to share the guilt of the sin togheter with his wife (which he himself had requested as a ""consort""), ultimately getting condemned by God to work the fields, for they will never give Adam the fruits that he had freely enjoyed in the Garden of Eden; Eve is condemened to suffer through the pains of childbirth. The poem ends on a soft note though, as Adam can find a ""Paradise within thee, happier far"". 

This is honestly one of the best works in English literature that I have ever read, and I want to know more from people who live in the United Kingdom themselves. What do you think about this Epic Poem? Is it good? Is it bad?",Justanotheryankee-12,1heb6e5,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1heb6e5/paradise_lost_john_milton_16081674/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1heb6e5/paradise_lost_john_milton_16081674/,2024-12-14 20:04:01,44,0.88,44,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heb6e5
books,A Year of Reading to a 5 Year Old,"My son turned 6 this fall and this is the first really consistent year I've spent reading chapter books with him. I've looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I'd look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old's perspective.

**The BFG** by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it's fun.

**Charlie and the Chocolate Factory** by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We've been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)

**Fantastic Mr. Fox** by Roald Dahl - A lot shorter than I was expecting and probably my kid's least favorite Dahl.

**James and the Giant Peach** by Roald Dahl - Kid liked it fine, it was my least favorite Dahl and there are a lot of voices to do if you do that.

**The Wild Robot Trilogy** by Peter Brown - We finished the 3rd one about a week before the movie came out by coincidence. The first 2 are really good and my son was constantly asking if we could read just one more chapter since the chapters are short. The 3rd one is fine but it's not as connected as the first 2 are. It felt more like an afterthought.

**Stuart Little** by E.B. White - I thought this was a pleasure to read as an adult. The kid enjoyed it although he was startled by the abrupt ending.

**The Horse and His Boy** and **The Silver Chair** by C.S. Lewis - This concluded Narnia for us, I think. We've read everything but The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. I loved Narnia as a kid but it's rough for this age. There are some very talky and slow parts that my kid just didn't get. He really like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which we read last year but otherwise, Narnia is maybe better left for an older kid.

**The Wizard of Oz** by Frank Baum - This seems like a perfect book for this age group.  It's very episodic in it's structure.  The language was a little old fashioned (which isn't surprising), but the kid really liked it.  The tornado scene was very memorable and he really liked the color coding that happens in the book.  The biggest surprise here was that the movie was likewise a huge hit.

We're currently reading **Phantom Tollbooth** by Norton Juster and while I don't dislike it,  I wish we weren't.  There is a lot of word play that is missed by reading out loud (witch vs. which, weather vs. whether).  But he seems to be enjoying it.

For this age, what is working for us is shorter chapters, not too talky, some pictures, and a touch of silliness.  I don't think we need all those ticked off for a successful ""read aloud to a 5/6 year old but it helps.  Reading a lot of older books means explaining somethings that just aren't a part of my kid's life like porcelain and corporal punishment.",CliffDiverLemming,1hdsiyd,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdsiyd/a_year_of_reading_to_a_5_year_old/,2024-12-14 02:08:52,1042,0.97,1042,0,173,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdsiyd

books,"Polygamy, by Paulina Chiziane (2002)","This author is from Mozambique (SE coast of Africa, bordering Tanzania in the north and South Africa in the south).  The book is basically a story of the struggle of one woman to keep her man, who is apparently irresistible to women and has no interest in monogamy.

I thought it was hilarious and poetic and also representative of a culture so different from ours that if you were to make a list of books representing cultures by how different they are, this one would have to go at the top.  Chaucer's Canterbury Tales was not about a more different society.  Snow, by Orhan Pamuk, which is (at least to me) basically a machine for turning an American into a Turk, is less dramatically different, by about half.

In fact, the way the author thinks of her life, the way the people she tells us about think of their lives, they approach society and themselves so differently that I think the book must be an education even to a psychologist.  It seems to reveal a new dimension of perception of humanity.  If properly considered.  I did not know people could behave like this.  I didn't know it was possible to think this way.  The poetry I'm used to, by comparison, seems to me now to hammer down along the path across its images (Frost said a poem is a tune or a ground of images, across which we may choose to strike a path) as though it were laying rail.  The poetry she tells flies like a bird.  Like a flock of birds, actually.

It's different.  I won't forget it.  I hope not, anyway!!  At one point our heroine was ""well and truly kutchingered,"" and you'll have to read the book to learn more about THAT, but I'm sure the search will be worth while lol...",tolkienfan2759,1hdfigo,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdfigo/polygamy_by_paulina_chiziane_2002/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdfigo/polygamy_by_paulina_chiziane_2002/,2024-12-13 16:06:05,14,0.76,14,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdfigo
books,Just finished reading Into Thin Air in 6 hrs,"I think this is the only book that I have read in literally one sitting. It got delivered at 6 PM, and by 12:30 I finished ravaging the book. Now I just feel like crying 😭😭

I went online and got a sense of all the controversies around the difference in what happened. But to me they are irrelevant. 

What wrenched my heart is the way the author has captured the struggle of mankind braving the harshest elements in nature. Maybe in 1997 there was a different motive for the book but now in 2024, when people everywhere are trying to solve complex social problems in a tweet or two, it is proof that human psyche and our interactions with this world are both extremely complex.

books,“Tom Sawyer” is making me realize that writing can be beautiful outside of Speculative Fiction.,"Hello all. 

I’m about halfway through “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” and I’m absolutely adoring it. I just recently finished The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb and it left me with a severe case of post-book depression; online it said that in order to alleviate this feeling I should read something completely different. 

Enter Mark Twain.

I thought it was witty and charming throughout the first few chapters but what really started to grow on me was the atmosphere of the book. Twain has a way of putting you right in Missouri to the point where I feel as if I’ve been there before. I’ve met Tom and Huck; Aunt Polly and Sid. I’ve been to that church or schoolhouse. I can practically smell the air wafting off the Mississippi.

The characters are simple and charming. Tom is a dramatic and mischievous kid, prone to curiosity and trouble. Sid is exactly like my own little brother — a little tattle-telling goody-two-shoes. Becky Thatcher is the girl that we all had a crush on simply cause she was pretty. It’s a very nostalgic book.

I was under the impression that only speculative fiction — specifically fantasy — could leave this much of an impression on me. I’ve only read speculative fiction…for years now. I feel like my eyes are being opened to whole new walks of reading

books,"Weekly Recommendation Thread: December 13, 2024","Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

**The Rules**

* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

____

**How to get the best recommendations**

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

____

All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.

If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

books,"My review of ""The Road to Wisdom"" by Dr. Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institute of Health for the last three presidents, and the director of the Human Genome Project before that. He's also a Christian. The book discusses truth, science, faith, and trust.","I've been following [Dr. Francis Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins) for quite a while since he's the founder of [BioLogos](https://biologos.org/), a foundation dedicated to helping Christians understand faith and science.  He was also the director of the National Institute of Health under Presidents Biden, Trump, and Obama, and prior to that he was the director of the Human Genome Project, discovering what each one of the genes in our bodies does. He's also the author of *The Language of God*, a memoir about how he went from atheism to faith in medical school, and why he believes there is reasonable evidence to have faith in a Creator.


*The Road to Wisdom* is a different kind of book.  It's more his reflection on truth, science, faith, and trust, different kinds of truth, where we find truth, how we determine what is true, and most importantly - how we have difficult conversations about what is true and what isn't.  As part of that, he discusses his experiences with [Braver Angels](https://braverangels.org/), an organization dedicated to helping depolarize America by bringing people of opposing viewpoints together for dialogue.  As one of the major figures who devised America's response to the Covid pandemic (he was Dr. Fauci's boss), he also discusses what he got right, what he got wrong, and what he wished he'd done better.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I've always been interested in things like metacognition - thinking about how we think - and he spends a fair chunk of the book breaking that down in a very accessible way, although he doesn't use that term.  He writes,

&gt;The premise of this book is that by reclaiming the solid ground of truth, science, faith, and trust, we can find ourselves back on the road to wisdom - that ability to bring together experience, knowledge, and good judgment to allow wise personal and professional decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society.  

He discusses some of the philosophical underpinnings of truth, as well as different areas of knowledge, arranged in concentric circles outward:


* **Necessary truth** - 2+2=4, the value of pi, etc.

* **Firmly established facts** -  (DNA is the hereditary material of humans, HIV causes AIDS, the earth is a slightly elliptical spheroid, gravity is related to mass, the accelerating rate of warming on the Earth, Germany and France share a border, and so on.)  He differentiates these two categories by saying, ""These statements are all essentially settled scientific facts.  Unlike 2+2=4, these firmly established truths might have turned out otherwise in a different universe (hence, philosophers call these contingent truths) but in this one we have compelling evidence they are correct.""

* **Uncertainty** - claims that are potentially true but there is insufficient evidence to move them towards firmly established facts.  For instance, cosmologists believe that there is something missing in the composition of the universe, but we don't have enough evidence yet to identify what they are.  Currently we call them things like ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"".  Another uncertain claim would be life on other planets.  Maybe there is, maybe there isn't, but we don't have enough data to say yet.

* **Opinion** - areas where facts and evidence are scanty, or irrelevant.  Dogs are better than cats, tattoos are cool or not cool,  the Red Sox are the best baseball team, Taylor Swift is the best artist, etc. 

He spends a little bit of time decrying postmodernism and its claims of nothing being really true, but I had to quibble with that, since I've not really (personally, at least) seen that postmodernism is interested in tearing down scientific claims - it's much more about deconstructing social, cultural, and personal ideas, and examining them individually. 

He also discusses six categories of untruth:

* **Ignorance** - not having relevant information about a particular topic.  This is not the same as stupidity - very smart people are also usually ignorant about areas of knowledge outside their fields of expertise.

* **Falsehood** - a statement that can be convincingly be shown to be untrue, like a Facebook post saying that drinking seventeen glasses of wine a day keeps cancer away.

* **Lies** - an intentional distortion of truth, intended to deceive.

* **Delusion** - Common forms of delusion (not rising to the level of mental illness) are widespread.  He specifically cites the study that gave rise to the Dunning-Kruger effect, wherein people who are untrained or inexperienced in an area overestimate their competence or knowledge in that area.

* **Bullshit** - Information that has no interest in whether or not it's actually true.  [Scientific American called ChatGPT a bullshitter](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chatgpt-isnt-hallucinating-its-bullshitting/) - it's not trying to be truthful, it's trying to sound human.

* **Propaganda** - A massive scaleup of lies and distortion with political intent (i.e. Putin's justifications for invading Ukraine). 

Collins goes on to talk about biases and cognitive fallacies, which I greatly enjoyed, but won't list out here.  However, he brings up a model of cognitive thought that I found to be very helpful, similar to the concentric circles of truth above.   Citing the work of philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine, he talks about our cognitive thought as a web of belief, like a spiderweb.  Near the center of the web are nodes of fundamental beliefs - my spouse loves me, the scientific method is effective, Jesus died and rose again, etc. As the web goes outward, the nodes are rather less critical or important - GMOs are safe, I'm a good driver, my cat loves me. 

He goes on to share [his own personal web](https://imgur.com/tWD5sUN), as well as [the web of Wilk Wilkinson](https://imgur.com/XNHvUTn), a conservative he had long discussions with through his partnership with Braver Angels.   He also discusses how while these webs are not set in stone, they are resistant to change, especially the closer to the center they are.  [I would add to this the idea that when someone changes their mind about something important, it can also risk their relationships, connections, and social standing.  If you ask a Christian to change their mind on something like LGBTQ rights or evolution, you are asking them to possibly risk their place in their church, in their family and friends, and other important relationships.  It doesn't matter how strong or Biblical or factual your arguments are, if you are asking them to give up the most important relationships they have in their life.]

He goes on to discuss additional factors like news media and social media that make our ability to distinguish what is true very difficult.  He recommends three strategies that the individual can do:

1) Try constructing your own web of belief

2) Consider the general question of how to decide whether to accept the truth of a surprising new claim - What is the source?  Is that source an expert source who knows what they're talking about? Is the claim based on an anecdote, or a larger study or set of studies?  Is the language sober and accessible, or is it hyperbolic and designed to induce fear or anger? He recommends the very helpful [Ad Fontes Media Bias Chart](https://adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/). 

3) When you encounter someone who disagrees with you, approach the discussion with openness and generosity.  ""Resist the temptation to demonize - if you demonize them, they will probably demonize you, and then there will only be demons in the discussion.""  Recognize that you may have flaws or gaps in your own understanding.

Collins concludes this section by encouraging the reader that while people may have different webs, all those webs generally have a few fundamental pillars of value that they are anchored to - Love, beauty, truth, freedom, family, faith, and goodness.  While our webs may look different, most of us can find common ground with those underlying pillars.  

Collins spends the next chapter discussing his own experiences in the scientific field as a doctor, a geneticist, and an administrator.  He discusses how he got involved with the Human Genome Project and the achievements it made, including finding the genes responsible for cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, and Huntington's Disease.  He shares why scientific research is reliable and accurate when it comes to the treatment of diseases, and why rigorous testing is required.  He warns that ""the plural of anecdote is not data"", and shares an example where treatments were advanced without sufficiently rigorous testing, and people suffered and died because of it (specifically women with a certain type of metastatic breast cancer). 

He adds that science has made terrific contributions to human health and longevity.  He says, ""At the beginning of the twentieth century, the average person in the United States lived just to age forty-seven.  One out of four children died in childhood.  Now our average lifespan is seventy-nine, and only one out of 150 children die in childhood.  Vaccines are a major reason; diseases like pertussis, measles, diphtheria, and polio that used to take the lives of tens of thousands of children every year are now rare.""  He goes on to discuss major culprits for vaccine distrust - men like Andrew Wakefield who claimed that the MMR vaccine caused autism - without revealing that he was being paid by lawyers who were suing the vaccine manufacturers, and that he had falsified the data in his study to fit his conclusions. He also names Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has no medical training but whose connection to JFK lends him credibility.  Kennedy claims that childhood vaccines are dangerous, while he himself profits from snake oil cures he sells instead. [That last part is my assertion, not Dr. Collins'.]

Collins also admits that scientists don't always get it right.  Sometimes important details are missed, sometimes researchers act unethically. But science is a self-correcting process in that if a single research study draws an incorrect conclusion, other studies will be able to figure that out and correct the inaccuracies, which is exactly what happened with Wakefield's study - there's now more evidence than ever that vaccines do not cause autism.  

If I'm not careful, I'm going to summarize the whole book, and I don't have time or energy for that.  I was predominantly interested in Collins' discussions on truth and science.  I learned a lot from it, including several studies I hadn't been aware of before.  He spends the latter half of the book discussing faith, including his own experience of faith, how faith and science interact, and his experiences interacting with people who profoundly disagreed with him about science.  He also gives several strategies for dealing with conflict and beliefs in our own lives, which were good.  All in all, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is struggling with ideas about faith, science, and truth, or is struggling to have difficult conversations about science, faith, and politics in our world today.",TheNerdChaplain,1hd1dyv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hd1dyv/my_review_of_the_road_to_wisdom_by_dr_francis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hd1dyv/my_review_of_the_road_to_wisdom_by_dr_francis/,2024-12-13 01:49:04,35,0.83,35,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hd1dyv
books,Stoner - not finished yet but this one is not what I expected,"This has spoilers; I tagged it but just an extra heads up.


You may have come to this expecting glowing words about a book that everybody seems to have only good things to say about, but maybe I’m missing something.

One of the many things that I don’t like about this book but chief among them and which I don’t see people mention is the fact that the author just tells the reader everything and you don’t really see it. A character is reduced to a paragraph that basically tells everything about them. This happens many times in the book. 

The character of Edith: She’s super weird. Her behavior and the way the author describes her from Stoner’s first meeting is just completely bizarre. And circling back to my earlier point about how the author tells everything, her strange little speech as Stoner is about to leave her parent’s house, thinking himself rejected, in which she tells him all about herself is one of the prime examples (but not the only one), and it’s bizarre. It’s very offputting. And I’m not saying that I can’t like a book with a weird character, but her characterization and mannerisms  were extremely strange. Unless she’s insane, it’s just not believable. I would actually say she kind of reminded me of Rochester‘s first wife in Jane Eyre.

BUT (big point here) this doesn’t justify Stoner raping her…..yep….

Why Edith married him, I don’t know. I’m almost halfway through and not enthusiastically picking the book up at this point. 

Watch this get downvoted, but thus far, not finding this engaging or gripping or interesting. 

I’ve seen people saying that this is one of the best books they’ve ever read and that Stoner is such a hero. You can certainly think those things. 

What exactly drew other readers in to this book? I’m finding the writing deliberate but very dry and the characters wooden. The atmosphere is dry and bleak. I’m aware of the ending, because there’s so much about this book on this subReddit (and others), that I happened across the ending accidentally. That has nothing to do with any of the things I’ve written. If I had an issue with an ending like what comes in this book, I wouldn’t be reading it. It’s just all the rest of the stuff. 

I’ve gotten to a part where a new character is introduced and the author once again gives the intro paragraph explaining exactly who this person is, telling it all. This has happened so many times in the book. It’s so obtrusive. As far as the characterization of Edith, if Williams intended for her to be a normal woman, (and I can’t imagine how that could be the case) that is concerning.

I do not like when authors tell rather than show it with action or allowing the reader to discover it. Williams reveals a lot well in advance. An author can do that. I’m not a huge fan of that method. What are other reader’s thoughts? If you loved it, great. So far, I’m not at that point. And also, I can’t find the character of Stoner. He’s just kind of there for this ride he’s on.",Neon_Aurora451,1hdpoyo,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdpoyo/stoner_not_finished_yet_but_this_one_is_not_what/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hdpoyo/stoner_not_finished_yet_but_this_one_is_not_what/,2024-12-13 23:43:38,0,0.47,0,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1hdpoyo
books,Fjordensaga: Saga of the Champions. A top-notch fantasy that's ideal for gifting and exploration.,"I was really impressed by the amazing attention to detail in **Fjordensaga**, both in terms of world-building and character development. The world is well thought-through, with lots of detail that makes it really engaging. Every element of the setting is the result of careful consideration, creating an immersive experience that draws you deeper into the story. The descriptions are **detailed and sweeping**, which makes the world feel alive and epic. It's as though it could exist beyond the page.

One of the main ideas in the book is a competition to choose the next leader (or female leader), which made me think of *The Hunger Games* at first. I was a bit skeptical at first, wondering if the concept might feel a bit derivative and lose the uniqueness that originally intrigued me. However, I was really pleased to find that, although there are some similarities at first glance, *Fjordensaga* quickly establishes **its own identity**. The contest's dynamics, the stakes, and the interplay between the characters feel fresh and original, carving out a distinctive space for the story. It held my attention all the way through and even managed to subvert my expectations in several places.

I was really impressed by how well the characters were developed, especially given the relatively short length of the story. Each character feels like they have **a clear purpose** and are complex in their way, and their actions are driven by the plot in a way that makes sense. The author deserves credit for balancing detailed character work with a fast-moving narrative. The story is always focused on the action, but the characters are fully realized, so their choices and struggles resonate.

If you're looking for a story with a big, **epic feel**, and a fresh take on familiar themes and characters that feel real and grounded, then Fjordensaga is definitely worth a look. It's a book that stays with you long after reading.",inabookhole,1hd8yca,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hd8yca/fjordensaga_saga_of_the_champions_a_topnotch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hd8yca/fjordensaga_saga_of_the_champions_a_topnotch/,2024-12-13 09:54:25,0,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hd8yca
books,Does reading ”trash” books rewire your brain?,"I recently started reading {Parable of the Sower} and been having a difficult time finishing it. I keep getting bored, and even though logically I know it’s a promising read, I struggle to even finish a chapter.

I have never had this problem, I’ve read a lot of books similar to this, example {Beyond good and evil}. HOWEVER as of late I’ve been reading “garbage” like ACOTAR and fourth wing, and realized that I cannot for the love of me read anything that doesn’t produce fast dopamine.

books,Are all the girlies reading ACOTAR and Fourth Wing?,"I had been hearing a bit about them (especially ACOTAR) so I finally bit the bullet and read the first book of A Court of Thorns and Roses and Fourth Wing. I do love fantasy and YA (think Percy Jackson, the Hunger Games, etc.) and I enjoy a cute slow burn romance but I haven’t really read a lot of “romantasy”. And I have a lot to say lmao😭.
If anyone has read them please share your experiences and thoughts!

I want to keep this post short so I’ll probably say more in the comments but a short summary of my thoughts so far:

ACOTAR
(I only read the first book.)

It was overall a fun/ easy read. The writing and pacing make it hard to put down. But tbh it felt kind of unserious. The world felt like it existed for the plot, rather than the plot naturally happening because of the world it is set in. Which in turn made the world feel less real to me. Some goes for the characters (especially Feyres family).

Now to my biggest issue: Feyre. I was honestly so frustrated with how stupid she is in 99% of the book😩😭 I think she might be somewhat inspired by Katniss Everdeen but she lacks the intelligence and forethought that made Katniss feel real- like she has what it takes to survive.
Feyre on the other hand is constantly doing things that she has been repeatedly told are dangerous and life threatening and then acts surprised when those things are actually *shoker* dangerous and life threatening.. Then she doesn’t even listen to the advice she almost dies for 🫠 oh well.

My second issue was the sheer amount of violence and suffering at the end of the book. Idk what I was expecting but it just kind of felt gross to me and like I was “watching” a weird “fetish”(?). Like I don’t mind violence if it feels like it furthers a point or an emotional payoff but here it just felt an over the top and unnecessary. Ultimately it’s what stopped me from getting the second book because I simply didn’t enjoy or see the point.

Summary: pretty fun/ entertaining to read but frustrating main character (the other characters too tbh) and violent ending. (Also very weird/inappropriate timing of the last s*x scene)


Fourth Wing:
(currently reading Iron Flame)

I read this after ACOTAR and actually enjoyed it way more! The world felt more real and the romance was a nice slow burn and the payoff felt satisfying. The writing is also pretty good and the characters feel more real. 

Again my main gripe is the intelligence of the MC. Even though Violet is often described as this extremely intelligent person I don’t feel like we actually get to see it often. She’s not stupid but the fact that her high intelligence is constantly mentioned highlights how average it is. How are you that intelligent but talking “secretly” in places where you are so easily spotted? Especially in Iron Flame she’s become kind of annoying with this whole woe is me. Like girl the life of literally millions of people are on the line and you are mad someone held secrets about things that are dare I say way more important than you?? Especially after what happened in the last book? Isn’t trying to survive and save humanity a bit more important rn? You don’t really need more secrets to keep. But anyways I digress.. I understand that it’s hard to write a really intelligent character.

Summary: Fun read, interesting world, nice romantic build up, but the main character isn’t as intelligent as she is described to be. I wish we saw her have more forethought and strategic thinking.

Tbh I kind of went in blind reading these books so I didn’t really know what I was getting into but overall it’s been fun. I’m curious what people like so much about them.
I think I have just read too many really well written books growing up (as many of us probably have) lol.

books,Gabriel's Moon by William Boyd: The ideal thriller novel to give as a Christmas gift.,"I recently got this book through NetGalley, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on it. It's a great thriller with a strong focus on espionage, keeping the genre's mysterious and suspenseful elements alive.

The story follows Gabriel, a 30-year-old writer with a troubled past. He was orphaned at the age of six after his mother, who was an alcoholic, died in a fire. Fast forward a few years, and Gabriel's life takes an unexpected turn as he becomes involved in the world of espionage.

I thought it was great to see so many strong female characters in Gabriel's life. They're not just background characters; they influence his decisions, challenge him, and guide his journey in meaningful ways. There's also a subplot about his family history that's woven really well into the narrative, which gives readers a deeper understanding of his struggles and motivations.

What really stood out to me was the author’s ability to create characters that feel so real and relatable. It’s easy to connect with them and become invested in their stories. Combine that with a plot full of twists and turns, and you have a novel that’s impossible to put down. The way the story builds tension and unravels its secrets kept me hooked until the very end.

This is easily one of the best thrillers I’ve read this year, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone who loves mystery or espionage. It’s also a great Christmas gift idea for thriller fans who enjoy gripping stories with complex characters!",inabookhole,1hcnfid,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hcnfid/gabriels_moon_by_william_boyd_the_ideal_thriller/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hcnfid/gabriels_moon_by_william_boyd_the_ideal_thriller/,2024-12-12 15:23:14,10,0.78,10,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hcnfid

books,[Swiss Family Robinson] Rereading this book as a modern reader was WILD ,"*Disclaimer: I've not read too many ""classics"" for most of my life, the only other exception aside from this book is Dracula, most of the time I read nonfiction. Please pardon if I'm not too familiar with the ""genre conventions"".* 



Back when I was about 10 or 12 years old, I had a copy of Swiss Family Robinson that eventually got ruined by me spilling a glass of milk on it. I have always been fascinated by survival stories of various kinds and had a fascination with zoology, so young me (as much as I could recollect) absolutely loved the book. Anyways, three weeks ago I decided to purchase a copy to see if it has held up after all these years. 

**Oh boy.** 

For the most part, despite being influenced by Robinson Crusoe with its castaway and survival setting, it really stood out to me the sheer lack of \*strife\* the family experienced. Aside from the initial event of the shipwreck and having to survive on an exotic tropical landscape, the family for the most part lives very comfortable lives as the island itself seems to spawn whatever kind of flora and fauna that would help them live comfortable lives. In the edition that I read, there are kangaroos, buffaloes, hippopotamus and a whole bunch more on a single island. 

What was even more darkly hilarious is that the characters never once lampshade on how weird this was, rather opting to shoot and consume any animals they come across (understandable given the context but lmao). A constant barrage of ""see new animal, shoot animal because we own this island now and we can do it"". 

The family themselves were ""interesting"". I'm gonna be honest, the dad was what I could only described as the ""platonic ideal"" of what a M A N should be. Not only he was so religiously devoted that he could quote the Bible rivaling that of a senior clergyman, but knows about every plants and animals, their uses and can build practically anything. The children were well, just there, mostly to make things happen by running around doing shenanigans. The mother meanwhile was barely a character, mostly there to smooth out whichever things that stumps the father. Overall though, there was a distinct lack of character arcs for any of them, no new revelations about each other, no one gets changed by anything that happened. They got stuck on that island for years, and left it none the worse for wear.

Ultimately, I'd say that the online reviews I read before reading the book really was correct, it TRULY FELT like a product of its time. The specifics are too much for a post, but the overall constant occurrence of overt religious theming of the family's mass exploitation of nature because god gave them dominion of it and the whole ""ideal parental figures"" as I've mentioned above. For me, it encapsulates quite a fair bit of the common worldview at the time it is written, but there were points where it felt like quasi-absurdist humor at times. In conclusion for those that wants to read/reread it, it was a fun read but be prepared for some occasional ""weirdness"".

books,Fahrenheit 451 and Martial Law in South Korea,"Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books. Different people have different thoughts on what it's about. Is it about censorship? Is it a critique of Television? What makes it great is how versatile it is.  



One of the things that I think gets missed sometimes is what it can tell us about the nature of authoritarianism. First, however, I want to talk about some key scenes.  



On the second page of the story, Montag is heading home and we're told that he ""let the escalator waft him into the still night air."" Later, Mildred is listening to music through her ""tamped-shut ears, and her eye all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.""  


In each of these early scenes, air plays an important role in characterizing both Montag and Mildred. In Montag's case, him being wafted up the escalator shows his lack of agency. Later we learn he only even became a fireman because someone suggested he should be one. He didn't actually choose for himself. This is where he is at the beginning of the story, a man who isn't even aware of his lack of agency. I think many of us living in the world as it is feel similarly. It's easy to say, what can *I* do to make a difference? Why even bother trying? The more we think like this, the less we assert our agency, the less we're able to utilize our free will.  
 

In Mildred's case, this air imagery conveys her apathy. She can't be bothered to breathe because she is so bored and discontent. She knows something is wrong but can't put her finger on it, and that's why she takes too many sleeping pills and has to have her stomach pumped.  


Both of these scenes serve to show the impact living in an authoritarian, dystopian hellscape can have on people. It hollows you out and leaves you stuck, unable to pinpoint what's wrong and even less able to do something about it if you could.  



Here's where it ties into authoritarianism and tyranny. Fire is the symbol of authoritarian power in this world/story. The firemen are the enforcers, they're meant to be feared and respected. When the power of authoritarian rule makes itself felt on any citizen deemed problematic, that power is manifested through fire.  
 

So what Bradbury is saying is that the flame of authoritarianism/tyranny is sustained on the air of apathy and lack of agency.  
 

I think in light of how the people of South Korea stood together and said ""fuck this shit,"" and how quickly they organized and how immediate their success was, it's worth pointing out this subtle, easily missed, nugget of wisdom from Bradbury. We need to remember that people who strive to erect an authoritarian, tyrannical government designed for their own benefit depend on the indifference of the masses.",flyingjesuit,1hbw1yc,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hbw1yc/fahrenheit_451_and_martial_law_in_south_korea/,2024-12-11 15:31:32,35,0.78,35,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hbw1yc
books,A Well-Trained Wife by Tia Levings and Self-Revisionism,"I recently finished Tia Levings' memoir, ""A Well-Trained Wife: My Escape from Christian Patriarchy."" I found the story engaging and emotional. The author grew up in an evangelical church and was indoctrinated into fundamentalist Christian beliefs. When she was very young, she married an abusive man and became pulled even deeper into radical Christian beliefs and ""tradwife"" living. The memoir details her childhood in mainstream evangelicalism, all the way to her eventual escape from her abusive marriage and journey through healing from her trauma.

What I found interesting and wanted to discuss with y'all was the parts of Levings' memoir that seem anachronistic(?) and a bit revisionary. Throughout the book, we hear a story of Levings existing in a culture that was aggressively misogynistic, racist, homophobic, you name it. However, throughout this, Levings' inner narrative is *conspicuously* progressive in comparison to the people around her.

Some examples:

1. When her husband Allan believes Neo-Nazi ideology and wants to vote for Pat Buchanan in 2000, we hear how Tia stays home to avoid being caught lying about who she voted for. She implies that she would have voted for Al Gore because of his environmental policies.

&gt;""I stayed home because he'd catch me lying if I voted for someone else, but I wondered how it would've gone if women like me had voted. I'd liked what Gore had to say about the planet. His convictions struck me as more compatible with protecting creation--the very first mandate God ever gave humans."" (pp. 129-130)

2. When her husband criticizes a rector for seeming gay, she pipes up:

&gt;""Allan had an issue with the rector. ""I think he's gay,"" he said. ""I can tell that man is hiding his sexuality. He probably preys on little kids.""  
""Being gay doesn't mean he's a molester,"" I said. ""They aren't the same thing.""  
""Bull,"" he said."" (pp. 184)

3. She helps a friend's mother accept that he is gay:

&gt;""I wanted Michael to be fully accepted for who he was, not just tolerated while his family hoped he'd change his mind."" (pp. 204-205)

&gt;""But what about what the church says about homosexuality?"" ""God is a good God who loves mankind,"" I quoted Father Stephen. ""We're just supposed to love people. You love him. Love means you celebrate his joys alongside him. Being there for him is what God wants, I'm sure, and I would be there too if I could get there."" (pp. 205)

&gt;""I knew Allan hadn't changed enough to let me say Michael' name, let alone travel to his gay wedding."" (pp. 205)

4. She never switches or ""blanket trains"" her children:

&gt;""William was two, Katie eight months. I'd never switched either of them, which is why I got an F for blanket training.....Judith noticed my lack of results...She took a long white tube from her diaper bag and demonstrated against her palm. The spanker whistled and slapped against her skin. I flinched. ""It should sting,"" she said. ""You want repentance. You want your child to avoid what precipitated the switch."" I didn't want this next thing. My blood churned like a swirling undercurrent against the tide."" (pp. 93).

To summarize, in a lifestyle that promotes racism, homophobia, and child abuse - Levings' never commits these offenses.

I find this hard to believe. In fact, I find it to be kind of infantilizing - throughout the memoir, Levings is cast as more confused and anxious than hateful. She never says she thinks her gay friend, Michael, is going to hell or is sinful - she says she is *unsure* and *confused* instead. I think this selective memory compromises the integrity of the memoir. 

To add to this, the preface of the memoir says that it includes ""composite characters, and some names and identifying details have been changed"" (pp. xi). While the practice of changing names/details is standard, I find the composite characters a bit suspect, especially when the scope is not disclosed. Is ""Michael"" the gay friend **one real person**, or a composite of several interactions? Are these vignettes included to reassure readers that the author was **actually a good person**, despite their circumstances?

I wonder if this approach to Tia Levings' story is her own, or done at the insistence of her publisher. Maybe admitting period- and culture-accurate biases (outside of her complicity in sexism and promoting the lifestyle, which Levings owns up to several times) makes selling copies more difficult.

What do you think? Am I way off-base? Do you think this is self-revisionist, or done at the behest of a publishing company to make for a cleaner narrative? Please let me know. I would love to discuss this memoir with people who have read it. :)",slimetheturtle,1hc4yhg,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hc4yhg/a_welltrained_wife_by_tia_levings_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hc4yhg/a_welltrained_wife_by_tia_levings_and/,2024-12-11 21:43:47,8,0.57,8,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1hc4yhg

books,Should I Have Been Allowed to Read That?,"What was the most inappropriate thing you had read by the time you were 15 or 16? Some things I had read by that age include the following:

- Flowers in the Attic

- Interview with a Vampire (which my science teacher asked to borrow after I was done?)

- Almost everything Stephen King had written up through 1987

- The Happy Hooker 

(It doesn't fit in with scandalous list above, but I was also obsessed with Erma Bombeck starting around age 11 or 12. I desperately wanted to be seen as the world-wearied housewife and mother of two that I, a pre-teen boy, apparently so identified with.)

Did you feel like you were getting away with anything? 

Did you feel as if you had to keep this reading secret? 

Or were you reading this stuff openly?

books,Average Books Read Per Year by Country 2024,"As an Italian, I’ve grown accustomed to hearing a common lament: *“No one reads anymore.”* It's a phrase that echoes through discussions about cultural habits, often paired with reports of dwindling readership statistics. So you can imagine my surprise when I recently stumbled upon a report claiming that Italy ranks fifth in the world for readership. Naturally, this raised a mix of curiosity and skepticism—can such a claim be trusted, or is it an anomaly amidst the usual narrative? While I remain cautious about the source, it did prompt me to reflect on the broader landscape of reading habits.

I’d love to hear from you: in your country, do you also sense a decline in readership, or perhaps a shift in the way people engage with books? Is there a growing preference for digital formats, or are traditional books still holding their ground? I find this topic fascinating, especially since it speaks not only to our personal habits but to the cultural and educational priorities of our societies. What’s your perception?

books,Reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac made very nostalgic for a time I never lived in ,"Disclaimer: I know, like most books in its vein, On the Road was sensationalized to a degree. I also understand that the Beat Generation was countercultural and Kerouac’s writings do not represent the general views of people of the 1950s. 

That being said, as a Gen-Z guy who recently finished this book, I was really struck by how unusual so many of the formative, chaotic experiences portrayed in this story would be in the America of today. On an obvious level, hitchhiking and carpooling with random people cross country are largely a thing of the past. I also found the characters rolling into random towns and instantly getting informal work as unrealistic. I mean, these days you have to submit an online resume for Walmart, and they’re also gonna run a background check, which would have severely hampered Dean’s employment opportunities. People also just take fewer chances now. Statistically, our generation uses way less drugs, has way less sex, and is a lot more cynical than the On the Road crew. 

But also on a deeper level, it feels like there’s a huge difference between what “finding yourself” involves now and what it involved then. Maybe more than in the late 40s and early 50s, people are expected to take their 20s to find themselves today. But you don’t really get lost anymore. People usually study abroad or see Europe through a tour company. If they go to Africa, it’s through a safari; Mexico is through a resort package. Even Mount Everest has somehow been commodified. And of course, for all of those trips you’ll be in constant contact with the outside world, have directions to everything on your smartphone, and be cataloguing the whole thing on social media. How many people are camping in the middle of the Mexican jungle on the roof of their car, as Dean and Sal did? Moreover, in contrast to the live  jazz clubs where Dean acted like an absolute madman, you’ll be paying $20+ covers to get in today’s clubs for the opportunity to stand around and take pictures of the light show while listening to remixes of 20 year old music. It’s like when the majority of people start to see young adulthood as a time of impulsive hedonism and self discovery, a framework for how that hedonism and self discovery is supposed to be done starts to emerge, and the whole thing feels a lot less adventurous. It becomes scheduled, ordered, and expensive—sometimes done more for others than yourself. Maybe adventure is still there, but it’s certainly way less messy. 

And I guess in more concrete terms, that’s what On the Road makes me nostalgic for: a time before we’d set out to remove all the messiness from life. In Kerouac’s day you could bounce around the West for a few years without having to worry so much about how the gap on your resume would look to employers. You could earn fine money living in the Dakotas and hitching rides to work on the harvests. People weren’t always connected; they couldn’t just Google how places looked, and when they went out on an adventure, it felt like they were really going into the unknown. Paradoxically, it feels like in a time that is seen as much more socially restrained, life could be much freer. 

The message I took out of On the Road was that, ultimately, the chaos of youth gives way to adult responsibilities. But, that doesn’t make the chaos pointless, unfulfilling, or wrong. It’s really a necessary step in development that challenges your preconceptions, puts your life in perspective, and gives you a concept of something beyond yourself before you do surrender to responsibility. I see the diminishment of this developmental phase and the commodification of chaos and adventure today as being a very unfortunate thing. Of course, Dean’s philosophy had major drawbacks (his general sexism and willingness to abandon women read pretty badly today), but I think the general point stands: adventure isn’t the same now as it was then. 

I would be interested in how others read the “beat” writers today, or, if any of you are of that generation, if you see this analysis as true. I think overall, while this book was definitely a product of its time, I found it to be very thought provoking and enjoyable, largely because of how well it captured spontaneous youthful exuberance and the atmosphere of the era.

For me, it's *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin. The title of the book is what pulled me in. It's directly quoted in the book as ""Light is the left hand of darkness, and darkness the right hand of light"". Its referring to the age old thought that light and dark need to exist together and you can't have one without the other. Its not just a reference to the duality of light and dark, but to others as well such as gender and class structure, and how these things are not so black and white.",Jeranda,1hadvd9,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hadvd9/your_favourite_book_titles_its_significance_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hadvd9/your_favourite_book_titles_its_significance_or/,2024-12-09 16:38:29,64,0.96,64,0,77,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hadvd9

books,1Q84-Haruki Murakami,"Just finished the novel yesterday. First of all, even though I say that every single I finish a long novel by Murakami, no matter how much doubt or hate he may be receiving as of late, it's an objectively challenging task to write a novel 1318 pages long and have the reader's boredom or weariness be minimal (or to be honest close to nonexistent) and he absolutely achieved that, so I take my hat off to him. Having said that, I found 1Q84 to be a particularly enjoyable and gripping page turner. This is not always necessary to make for an amazing read, and every novel that is enjoyable to read is not necessarily amazing, but if I'm being honest, the best reads are those in which those two qualities come together. That in my humble opinion of course. And 1Q84 certainly was one of those for me. As a reader I generally tend to believe that the journey is more importnant than the destination, but it would be a blatant lie to not admit that 1Q84 had one of the most satisfactory endings of any piece of fiction I've read in recent momory both from a somewhat objective literal standpoint and my personal view/interpretation/liking/preference of its characters and story&gt;! (with the exception of Ushikawa's death which I found totally unfair and frustrating but I guess that wonderful scene featuring the creation of an Air Chrysalis out of his dead body by the little people makes up for it).!&lt; All in all, despite the novel's main thesis being relatively simple and old as time (basically a slightly more sophisticated take on the whole concept of soulmates and the inescapability of fate), Murakami always has his special ways to make everything so magical, so vivid, multi layered and lively that even though it's not always entirely necessary, it's always what I want going into a novel of his. And it was welcome especially in this kind of novel which in my eyes is far less cold and distanced compared to other novels by Murakami and which demands its reader to surrender his own life a bit for the ones of it characters, for quite some time due to its length.  I guess that's all I wanted to say for now, but I would love what other people who have read it feel about it. Specifically I would also like to hear the other readers' opinions and thoughts on Fuka-Eri as a charcter and her significance to the story. To me, she really was the border that ended up bringing Tengo and Aomame together, but what I'm not sure about is whether this was her real mission from the very start.&gt;! Did the guys from Sakige, knowing that Leader would sooner or later die costing them the hearing of the voice, send Fuka-Eri just to bring these two together so that Aomame would produce in heir/a dohta to whom the ability would be passed (but why would that have to be Tengo's and Aomame's baby?) or was it just a coincidence, planned not by some human factor but simply the universe itself (if there is such a thing)?!&lt; Intrigued to hear your thoughts.",I-Like-What-I-Like24,1haf463,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1haf463/1q84haruki_murakami/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1haf463/1q84haruki_murakami/,2024-12-09 17:29:35,42,0.75,42,0,45,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haf463

books,Rumaan Alam's Entitlement is one of the worst things I have ever read,"I don't know how to describe how bizarre this book was. I was flabbergasted at least once per chapter. The Guardian's review was apt, the [NY Times review](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/books/review/entitlement-rumaan-alam.html) feels like it's full of lies and exagerrations. The reviewer couldn't possibly have thought this was a good book.

I enjoyed Leave the World Behind, I didn't love it, but it was an easy read and I found it thought-provoking. Entitlement feels like he was in a rush and didn't want to lose the book advance. It feels like it's all telling and not showing. The main character feels 2-dimensional and has only 5 people in her life-- she's not fleshed out at all. The elderly billionaire has a similarly narrow characterization-- nothing going on with him besides his wife and his new charity foundation. I think this guy would be a bit busier?

The writing style- which I don't remember being this confusing in LTWB-- is very irritating. He uses sentence fragments constantly, in a staccato pacing, which becomes tiresome. &gt;!And there were a few scenes where the reality of what happened is not made clear-- one in particular where the main character, Brooke, either hits a woman at a coffee shop or imagines she does, and I could not discern what actually happened, or whether this was supposed to be ambiguous on purpose.!&lt;

&gt;!The main problems were that the main character's arc felt so unreal that she just seems to have gone crazy or had a mental breakdown.. that's the only way to describe the sudden turn he character takes. It's sloppy. !&lt;Oh, also nothing really happens in the book. That seems to be the main complaint on Goodreads from the 2- and 3-star reviewers.

books,Maybe it's not all doom and gloom?,"I know there's been a lot of discussion on this subreddit about the downfall of reading. Kids aren't reading anymore. Everyone's attention span is shot. Booktok is ruining the book industry, etc. Media literacy is dead. But is it really that bad? Has the times really changed that much?

1. Kids aren't being assigned books anymore, just sections of books. And that's a shame, right? But I grew up in the 90's. We often didn't read the full assigned reading. There was immense pressure to have a high GPA, be in all honors/AP classes *and* be in like a million clubs and activities to impress college admission boards. We could Cliffnote our way through Crime and Punishment but not calculus and physics so that's where our time went. Some of us had to work jobs. Some of us had to watch our siblings because our parents worked a lot. Some of us just didn't want to. We did read some of it, but it was highly supplemented by Cliffnotes. 

Were there kids who read every single word of every single assigned books? Absolutely. They genuinely enjoyed reading and prioritized it. But was that all of us, or even most of us? No.

I'm old enough that the many of the English department heads are probably about my age. I can totally see them going, ""Let's be honest, we didn't read the whole book when we were their age, they're not going to read it.  Let's just assign them to read the crucial parts so they can understand the themes and the cultural impact."" 

2. Kids, and people, are reading just as much as ever, just not books. I am ***not*** (again, *not*) saying that reading chats, texts, comments, emails, subtitles, etc is anywhere near the same as reading a book. Of course it's not, they are two completely different form of reading. But our lives have gotten *significantly* more text based in a past few decades. For a lot of us, we probably read more than we speak or listen. Maybe the reason we read less is because we just need a break from written words. You know how when you're at a party, it's just nice to go to the bathroom and enjoy a break from all the noise? Maybe we're not getting stupider or less intellectually curious, we just need a break from text.

3. I don't think booktok is ruining the publishing industry, but I do think that the publishing industry figured out they can sell mass market quality books at paperback prices. Low effort books were always around, they were just mostly sold as mass market paperbacks. And while those still exist, I feel like there's far less of it because, thanks to booktok, publishers can sell them at paperback prices. Sure, the ""As Seen on Booktok"" section is taking up space but it's probably taking up the same amount of space the Harlequin romance books would've taken up twenty years ago.

4. Regarding media literacy, thirty years ago, if I had a stupid hot take on a book, the only person hearing about it are my friends, maybe my teacher if it's for school. Now if I have a stupid hot take online, several somebodies all over the world are shaking their head in disbelief. Has the ideas gotten stupider or has it just gotten much easier to get our stupid ideas out there.  There used to be gatekeepers (newspaper and magazine editors) but now anyone can voice their opinions on a public platform.

And speaking of stupid hot takes... Maybe I'm being naive and optimistic. Reading has changed significantly, for sure. I'm just not convinced that we, as a society, have gotten stupider. I do think that reading will become more of a niche hobby, but just because people are reading less books, does that mean that people are learning less? Being exposed to any less ideas?

books,Jussi Adler-Olsen's final Dept Q,"I just finished and was disappointed with a lighter series when .y pre-ordered final Department Q novel downloaded to my Audible *I am blind) and suddenly I felt I was listening to an author who makes all his interesting characters progress and brings the series to a satisfying conclusion.

These novels had somewhat horrible crimes but very endearing characters. Except for Assad's odd bits, and even they lighten up and he is a full partner. Even Gordon grows. That's what I want in a finale. The wait was worth the quality.

books,"Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy. Yes, it seems you can read a book again for the first time.","I read this book for the first time in high school, which was over 30 years ago.  I remember really liking it but couldn't remember anything about it other than how the book jumped from character to character.  Now that I just finished reading it again, having forgotten nearly all of the details made it like reading it for the first time.

It's a little scary how nothing I read seemed even remotely familiar; I've usually been able to recall a fair amount of details from other books I've read, even ones from way back in childhood.

I highly recommend this one though, for anyone who likes techno-thrillers.  Anyone unfamiliar with the book, it takes place in the 1980s (contemporary to when it was written) and details a conventional war between the Soviet Union and NATO.

books,"I like Stephen King's ""Mr. Mercedes"".","I just wanted to read a thriller about a killer whose weapon would be a car. Although the machine is only used at the beginning, I liked the book.

Let's start with the plot. Someone hit a crowd of people at a job fair with a Mercedes a year ago and managed to get away with it. Now the killer is pestering retired police officer Bill Hodges with letters to kill himself. As a result, this motivates Bill to search for the killer. That's how intellectual games begin.

The first half of the book is a game of ""who is smarter"", because what is Bill, what is Mr. Mercedes are trying to outwit each other in different ways.

The second half is ""to make it to ..."", where the characters must manage to prevent a new crime of Mr. Mercedes.

Let's do without spoilers and briefly. The book turned out to be intense, especially towards the end. The author does not hide the identity of the maniac and at the beginning of the book shows who he is and how he thinks (and his name is Brady). In the first half, it was funny to read how Bill pranked the villain by saying that Brady is not the real Mr. Mercedes (and how it bombed him).

About the characters. Bill Hodges is not a very interesting character yet. I don't even have anything to say about him. His friend Jerome is a funny character. Such a cheerful, brave guy who likes to make the reader uncomfortable by jokingly speaking bad English (because he is black). Holly Gibney, a character who later acquires a own cycle, develops well in the second half from a sociophobic and insecure woman into a completely resolute and talkative (at least, talkative with Bill and Jerome).

Brady Hartsfield aka Mr. Mercedes turned out to be simultaneously cartoonishly angry, pathetic and menacing. Like, look, he's a racist, a sociopath, and he's only turned on by his mother. He gets angry when someone is happy. At the same time, he is quite smart, because he hides well under the guise of an ordinary guy, he gets along well with technology, and in the end he cunningly equipped his new weapon. And when something bad happened to him, I was happy with all my heart, because to hell with that asshole.

I like the author's writing style. This is a regular Stephen King text, that is, a lot of information, especially about the characters, which is easy to read. But the scenes where he describes sex are very uncomfortable.

All in all, a good thriller. He's intense, the villain is nasty, the writing style is good. Maybe not the best of this author, but definitely good.",mystery5009,1h9mvlj,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h9mvlj/i_like_stephen_kings_mr_mercedes/,2024-12-08 16:44:23,84,0.84,84,0,44,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h9mvlj
books,To Paradise-Hanya Yanagihara: Defying history to create a modern masterpiece,"**''We always think that we as individuals are responsible for shaping society. But what if actually society is shaping us?''**

Yanagihara's perception of history in this novel is totally decentered from individuality, an almost living, breathing entity, with her characters (of limited agency) being merely varied along in its wake. After all, To Paradise is a novel about all that history can take away from us: Our freedom, our dignity, our safety, our families, our loved ones (in Charlie's case in the third section of the novel even her literal emotional intelligence and critical thinking ability). But one thing it can not, argues Yanagihara: A series of certain fundemental desires too elemental to what humans are to simply be stamped out of humanity, no matter the society one may live in or how totalitarian a state may be: The desire to love, to be loved, to find affection, beauty and many more. And that has been proven true by human history for century after century, and hopefully will keep doing so. The three sections of the novel are seperated from one another by a century each. 100 years, no more, no less. The active years of the American experiment. The characters of the three sections who all share their first and last names, may be related, maybe not, may be echoes of one another, perhaps a remark about history repeating (or not) itself. Perhaps not. What is certain is that Yanagihara argues (and rightfully so) is that the idea of constant, almost perpetual progress, which is one of the main promises of modernity, is fundamentally non-compatible to the concept of history, and that periods of regression are inevitable. However, if she thinks regression is how it will all end, she doesn't say.

**Book 1-Washington Square:**

Drawing inspiration from Henry James' novel of the same name, Yanagihara twists (the old as time) concept of a marriage story to both to create a version of it which (defying the genre's standards) is not about a gendered association with money, but also the perfect opportunity for her to lay down American history, remove its puritanist, relegious spine, and set up what will be the start of her incredibly detailed reimagining of American history. Also, lots of interesting ideas about paradise actually being one's entitlement to making their own decisions about their own lives, no matter how foolish they may turn out to be. In the center of it all is a gripping story.

**Book 2-Lipo-Wao-Nahele:**

Divided into two sections. The first one dealing with AIDS crisis and the disctively human force (perphaps instict) which is present at every crisis and which drives us to keep on cling to life, to keep on fighting for the hapiness of us and our loved ones. I consider it worth mentioning that in this section, for the first time in any of her books, Yanagihara argues that this process may not be totally futile (I mean, no shit, but she really seems to belive that is the case on everything else she has ever written. Also, no matter how much she doesn't seem to embrace it, optimism suits her real well.). The second one is about the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, the impossibility of returning to state before colanization or contact, but also the enduring romance of it. I would say that the whole movement as well as the general feeling of an irreristible pull of a culture which you have never actually experienced and yet you mourn for all the time are approached with great compassion by Yanagihara.

**Book 3-Zone Eight:**

In a future that feels like a total regression in every sense of the word, driven by plauges and led by a totalitarian state, takes place the third and final section of the novel, narrated by two fundementally tragic characters, Charles and Charle. Charles is a tragic figure because he experienced a scientist's worst nightmare: He became one to contribute to society, to help people, but in a word where alutruism is no longer, appreciated or rewarded he seems to be punished for it. His discoveries and ideas are used to hurt people in the most morally dispicable ways, just for him to become hated by his own family for that, to end up trapped in a system to which's creation he once contributed thinking he was doing the right thing and to even lose his own lose (this is not a spoiler by the way). But what really makes him a tragic figure, is the fact that he experienced true hapiness, even for a relatively short amount of time, just to have it taken away from him without him being to blame, gradually, slowly, painfully, and have him live his remaining years mourning for its loss. Charlie on the other hand has never experienced something even remotely similiar to happiness and also lacks any prospect of ever doing so. And this is fundamentally tragic for a human being.

All in all, I can certainly say I'm in awe of both this wonderful and ambitious novel as well as Yanagihara as a writer. Both her ideas and prose are intruging and fabulous to me. Maybe the pacing of the novel is a bit off at times, but other than that I had no complaint about what this novel that I consider a masterwork and one of my favorite reads of the year. I have actually finished it for a month now but these 30 days or so were absolutely necessary for me to wrap my mind around the novel's scale and to properly articulate some of my thought and feelings on it (yup, this is just the tip of the iceberg).

books,Yet another post on Ulysses.,"As the title suggests, I am currently reading Ulysses by James Joyce. As of now, I’ve finished part 1. And what the hell am I reading?

It’s awful. Both in the technical and literary sense. From
What I’ve read so far, it follows a day in the life of a guy named Stephen Deadalus. An Irish Catholic who is sad because he is Irish and Catholic. As for the technical writing, I was able to follow it at first. The guy talks with his room-mates, and then goes to work as a teacher. After that, it’s like Joyce took acid, threw a bunch of non sequitar sentences at the page, and called it a day.

For example; 
“His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: Mouth to her womb. Oomb, all wombing tomb. His mouth mounded issuing-breath, unspeeched ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globes, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, Blast them. Old Deasy’s letter. Here. Thanking you for hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table rock and scribbled words. Thats twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter. 

That’s one paragraph. Using the same formatting as the book. As far as I can tell he might be looking at a woman? Maybe a prostitute? I can’t tell. 

Joyce chose to write at least ten pages like this. It’s a strange flow of consciousness that goes nowhere. Masters of an art can choose to break the rules. But is that really what happened here?

As for the plot, it’s not great. A little research before hand told me to look out for parallels with the odyssey. This is the closest I’ve been able to get. One of Deadalus’s housemates is an Englishman. It’s kind of like the suitors partying it up while Odysseus is away. 

What I have seen a lot more of is wasted potential. Now, I’m not going to explain the entirety of irelands subjugation. I’d need a history degree k don’t possess to do it justice. There’s a LOT there. But suffice to say that historically, England treated the Irish like second class citizens, going so far as to suppress their language and culture. 

Deadalus is angry about that. However, he is bunking up with possibly the only Englishman who gives a damn. The guy only views it as a trifle, but he wants to know about Gaelic language and culture! Instead of taking the opportunity to educate the man, potentially create a linguistic record, and influence his views, Deadalus considers him to be a nuisance. As if he is somehow trying to usurp the culture. 

This is exemplified during a scene with a milk maid. The Englishman asks if she knows any Gaelic phrases. She asks if he means Irish, and then says no. Deadalus spends the next paragraph thinking about how awful the woman is, because (paraphrasing) her genitals are not like gods genitals and are like the genitals of eve which were tempted and are sinful. (Please note Deadalus is supposed to be a reflection of Joyce) 

(As a small aside, this would be a good place to note that Deadalus has no actual faith. He follows cultural norms, and Thats about it. Except when he can demean women. That seems to be an exception)

Continuing on the theme of wasted opportunity, he goes on to his job as a teacher. There, he sees a student he thinks is similar to himself. As previously stated, he is upset about the loss of Irish culture. As a teacher, he has an opportunity to guide the next generation. Maybe Instill them with some of that language and culture. But he doesn’t. He just teaches them the bare curriculum and sends them in their way. 

It shouldn’t be his job to solve the cultural suppression. Realistically, there isn’t much he can do. But he doesn’t even really seem to make much of an effort. It’s like he’s angry that it’s raining, but doesn’t even bother seeking cover. 

All of this tells a story about a mopey man who has no hope. Not every protagonist should be sympathetic. But so far it’s like reading about paint drying. Instead of a character whose goals I can support, I’m reading about a husk with little to no direction or drive. It’s neither entertaining, nor does it seem to convey any particular message. 

So that leaves me with the question, what is all the hype about? Does it suddenly get better in part 2? I read reviews calling it one of the greatest novels of all time. But about two thirds of what I read so far is barely coherent, let alone “great”

So what am I missing? Am I just not smart enough to see genius buried under the gibberish? I’m willing to believe that. But if Joyce purposefully hid the art and quality, he did a good job of it with words like “contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality”.",cain11112,1hatf4o,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hatf4o/yet_another_post_on_ulysses/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hatf4o/yet_another_post_on_ulysses/,2024-12-10 04:17:05,0,0.35,0,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1hatf4o

books,Stoner by John Williams is absolutely devastating me,"I got sucked into it a few weeks ago...then I got to the part where Edith is gone and he bonds with his daughter, and then Edith comes home...it hurt so much, I had to stop.

I finally came back to it now after weeks only for the Charles Walker stuff to be some of the most intense and stressful stuff I've ever read. I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with that, but I'm in my first year of grad school and intend to continue in academia as a queer person; the thought of being absolutely screwed by department politics and the vindictiveness of those with more social power is horrifying. I think I'm going to have to take a step away from it again.

books,"Faust's Death (Faust Part II, Goethe)","I have been reading Goethe's second part of his most famous verse tragedy ""Faust"", and I have always been fascinated with the Faust's final scene in the fifth act (*Grosser Vorhof des Palasts; The courtyard of Faust's palace).* In this scene we see a blinded Faust (he was blinded in the previous scene by the personification of Depression; ""*Curae""* in latin) walking towards Mephistopheles and his ""Cronies"" (Lemuren; Lemures, ancient roman spirits of death); he quickly lounges into a long speech about progress, happiness and utopic desires (which most 20th century writers and philosophers have interpreted as a ""capitalistic"" desire which Faust tries to apply towards his subjects). During this speech he pronounces the ill-fated words of his deal (*""verweile doch, du bist so schön!; ""stay a while, you are so lovely!"")* and promptly falls on the ground, dead. I have always loved this scene because of its beautiful nature and because I love Goethe as an author in general. What do you guys think?

Anyway, I think I'll leave a copy of Faust's last speech right under here: ""*Ein Sumpf zieht am Gebirge hin, Verpestet alles schon Errungene; Den faulen Pfuhl auch abzuziehn, Das Letzte wär das Höchsterrungene. Eröffn’ ich Räume vielen Millionen, Nicht sicher zwar, doch tätig-frei zu wohnen. Grün das Gefilde, uchtbar; Mensch und Herde Sogleich behaglich auf der neusten Erde, Gleich angesiedelt an des Hügels Krat, Den aufgewälzt kühn-emsige Völkerschaft. Im Innern hier ein paradiesisch Land, Da rase draußen Flut bis auf zum Rand, Und wie sie nascht, gewaltsam einzuschießen, Gemeindrang eilt, die Lücke zu verschließen. Ja! diesem Sinne bin ich ganz ergeben, Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluß: Nur der verdient sich Freiheit wie das Leben, Der täglich sie erobern muß. Und so verbringt, umrungen von Gefahr, Hier Kindheit, Mann und Greis sein tüchtig Jahr. Solch ein Gewimmel möcht ich sehn, Auf freiem Grund mit freiem Volke stehn. Zum Augenblicke dürft ich sagen: „Verweile doch, du bist so schön! Es kann die Spur von meinen Erdetagen Nicht in Äonen untergehn.” — Im Vorgefühl von solchem hohen Glück Genieß ich jetzt den höchsten Augenblick.""*

*English version:* A swamp lies there below the hill,

Infecting everything I’ve done:

My last and greatest act of will

Succeeds when that foul pool is gone.

Let me make room for many a million,

Not wholly secure, but free to work on.

Green fertile fields, where men and herds

May gain swift comfort from the new-made earth.

Quickly settled in those hills’ embrace,

Piled high by a brave, industrious race.

And in the centre here, a Paradise,

Whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,

And though it gnaws to enter in by force,

The common urge unites to halt its course.

Yes, I’ve surrendered to this thought’s insistence,

The last word Wisdom ever has to say:

He only earns his Freedom and Existence,

Who’s forced to win them freshly every day.

Childhood, manhood, age’s vigorous years,

Surrounded by dangers, they’ll spend here.

I wish to gaze again on such a land,

Free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand.

Then, to the Moment I’d dare say:

‘Stay a while! You are so lovely!’

Through aeons, then, never to fade away

This path of mine through all that’s earthly. –

Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,

Now I savour it, that highest moment.

I’ve read 2 books by Bret Easton Ellis,— The Shards and Lunar Park— and they both made me wish I could’ve read them with a book club or something because they’re so fascinating. His “autofiction” approach is something that I don’t see done almost ever and it adds a whole new layer of intrigue onto everything he touches. Not a fan of him as a person but I love his books. 

Mason &amp; Dixon by Thomas Pynchon. This book is an epic, sprawling adventure with an entire fan wiki dedicated to the historical references contained within it. The only book I’ve ever annotated of my own free will. Unexpectedly, though, I think about it constantly not because its crazy plot but because it is deeply, deeply beautiful and moving. I never would’ve thought a silly little book about the two guys who drew the boundaries between states would have this profound of an emotional impact on me. I was MOVED!!!!!!!!

books,An apocalyptic pandemic as imagined in 'The Scarlet Plague' by Jack London (1912) - a short and gripping novel.,"It is quite difficult to choose some words to begin this review. Let's say that the novel gripped me with its fast pace. An almost cinema-like dynamism - the descent of civilization into chaos, through a combination of visceral panic and despair, spred like a fire, devouring everything around - and *a fire* it was, as the onset of *Scarlet Plague* brought forth the innate instincts of self-destruction - murder, looting, arson. For, if once the unexpected symptoms appear, it takes the microbes only half an hour to turn a healthy man into rotting corpse, people seek either salvation - fruitless endeavors, as it turned - or accept their fate and set the world ablaze as a final act of will. 

A dystopian, magnate-ruled society of the 21st America (as it was imagined by a *Belle Epoque* writer) could not withstand the catastrophe. A rigid class system to be torn down, all of the intricacies of progress to be annulled by a single flash of Plague - in just a week! No wonder that the narrator, now an old, sickly man, the last alive witness of *the end*, recalls the events of the long ago with tears and trepidation. 

Jack London imagined an absolute catastrophe, that would leave a score of people alive - deserting all knowledge of civilisation and turning to a primitive way of life within a generation. One might consider this interpretation a little naive - but the tale nevertheless retained its strong grip on me from the first moment to the last. And it is short - no more than eighty pages.

books,No Spoiler Review: The Riyria Revelations by Michael J Sullivan,"First time poster, I generally read a series every week to two weeks depending on other tasks and felt like sharing so those wondering if they should grab that whole series at the bookstore or just the first book can make a more informed decision. 

The Riyria Revelations is a three book series following the thieving duo of Riyria; Royce and Hadrian. They are contracted for a job that turns their lives, and the world, upside down. Enjoy a twist on familiar fantasy themes, succinct but detailed combat sequences, and world building that rivals RR Martin and Anthony Ryan in scope if not detail. 

I don't like star reviews, because books deserve more than that. 

I rate this as a Good Read. The books are thick, detailed, and have just enough uniqueness to let them stand apart from the traditional fantasy fare. 

The plot was convoluted but tied up nicely with several twists that caught me off guard. Despite being self published, the quality of editing is superb, and I feel that it gives the writing more authenticity. If you love Tolkien's work with description, Sullivan accomplishes the same effect with dialog between the characters that pulls the reader deeper into the story and the arcs of the various characters. 

I loved this series for the storytelling through dialog and Sullivan's take on the traditional fantasy peoples of elves, goblins, dwarves, and humans. 

If you're a fantasy fanatic or even a casual consumer, this is a fantastic series that you should definitely grab as a set. If you're looking to jump into fantasy I would recommend picking up something a bit shorter, but it's not quite as beefy as The Raven's Shadow series or Night Angel Chronicles. Regardless, I would put this on the ""To Read"" shelf. 

If you've read this series, what other things would you say about it? And if you pick it up, come back and comment what you thought.

books,I finished Wuthering Heights and am very confused,"I don't understand why this book is held in such high regard. All of the characters are so unrealistic. The elder Catherine and Heathcliff are so emotionally volatile it's ridiculous, the younger Cathy and Linton are also unstable and unsympathetic. I feel bad for everyone, but the main characters are so cruel to each other it's hard to care about anyone. 

Heathcliff is just a monster with no redeeming qualities. His behavior is inexcusable. And apparently, some see this book as romantic because of Heathcliff and Catherine's obsession with each other. 

This book is so depressing. All of these people's lives are lived in abuse and misery because of Heathcliff. I don't mean that every book has to be happy to be enjoyable, but there's a feeling of pointlessness to all this suffering. I feel like I got nothing out of this book other than a sense of hopelessness. 

I wouldn't say it's valuable commentary on human nature since the characters behave in such extreme ways that it's almost inhuman. 

I know I'm looking at it through a modern lens of everyone being traumatized and thus traumatizing each other and wanting for there to be some sort of redemption or recovery that isn't present.

books,Life among the aliterate (a small rant),"In terms of aliterate, I mean people who know how to read, but don't care to. A familiar quote, ""I had to read in college (or high school) but I don't need to anymore.""

I grew up in a household of readers and have family who are still voracious readers.

20 years ago, I moved from a major Northern U.S. metropolis to a major Southern U.S. metropolis.

In my former home everyone I knew read all the time - different stuff, but they read. Poor people, rich people - for most it had been a lifetime avocation. And they did love reading.

When I moved, my partner (who was a former publishing person like me) and me continued our reading adventure. 

But NO ONE is our social circle reads here. Not books, not anything. Our friends don't even have books in their homes. They come to our house and see the books crammed in the 6 big bookcases and usually the first comment is ""Did you read all of these?"" - like it's some aberrant thing, like it's an impossible thing to do.

And they seem suspicious - like, what kind of person would read those books? Definite suspicions about the science books...

I get the impression that if the books were replaced with sports memorabilia, everything would appear normal to them.

I have learned not to talk about my love of reading. I know they will never understand. It's kind of lonely except for the reddit connections - and then, that's just shorthand for any real discussion about anything substantial.

At least my partner still reads - much more than me.
