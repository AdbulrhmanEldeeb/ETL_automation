devops,I failed the last round of a Platform Engineer job interview because of a database migration question. How bad was my answer?,"For clarity, I am a Full-Stack developer, but these days my work is 80% front-end.

I have learnt all DevOps and Cloud-related stuff in my own time by studying and applying it to my own projects. I'm trying to break into a cloud-focused role because it has interested me for a while now.

This round was a whiteboarding session where I was tasked with migrating a legacy system to a cloud provider. We went with GCP for service choice names, as we both have worked this provider.

One of the components of the legacy system was the database. The interviewer said let's assume it's an SQL-based database and it's running on a VM somewhere.

**By this point in the interview, I had asked questions and got the following points:**

\- Developers are manually having to SSH into VM's to make changes and they are struggling to manage.  
\- The company expects to grow within 12 months, up to 100k DAU. They currently have 10K DAU.

**Once we get into the database section, it kind of went like this:**

&gt;**Me:**  
For the database, I would recommend a managed SQL service, Cloud SQL.  
The advantage of this choice is that it takes a big amount of cognitive load from the developers. DB Admin tasks like backups can be done much easier. It is also more suitable to scale than self-managing on a VM.  
The disadvantage of this choice is the cost, it'll easily be one of the most expensive components of this architecture. But I feel like the trade-off is worth it, as managing a database for this scenario can be a full-time job in itself.

&gt;**Interviewer:**  
Ok great, that trade-off makes sense. Let's talk about the actual migration of the data from the current system to GCP. We want minimal downtime, we can maybe afford a maximum of an hour of downtime.

&gt;**Me:**  
Ok, what is the rough amount of data we need to transfer? I'm guessing it's not Petabytes of data?

&gt;**Interviewer:**  
Correct, it's not that level of data, but equally, it's not so little that we can just do a quick and simple export/import

&gt;**Me:**  
Ok, I know that cloud providers do have database migration services available. These aim to do a lot of the work for you. However, I am aware that they only fit very simple scenarios. You have to have a supported db version and a relatively simple schema, so let's assume these services do not fit the bill.

&gt;In that case, I would replicate the legacy database to the cloud-based one. Once replication is done, we can ensure new records are added by adding a dual write strategy at the application level, so both databases are fully up to date. Then, after communicating with users about the expected hour downtime, ideally during a low-traffic period, we can mark the old database as read-only and switch over to the new instance.

&gt;The upside of this approach is that we can get downtime down to &lt; hour. The downside is that we need to write application-level code purely for this migration, which increases complexity and chances of mistakes, so it's something the developers will need to keep in mind.

And to be honest, the interviewer just OK'd that and we moved on to another question.

However, in the feedback, one of the main points was that I need to expand my knowledge on database migration strategies.

Was my answer straight-up wrong? Or did I fail to expand on the solution more?",Squishyboots1996,1hfgw4b,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hfgw4b/i_failed_the_last_round_of_a_platform_engineer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hfgw4b/i_failed_the_last_round_of_a_platform_engineer/,2024-12-16 11:16:10,160,0.94,160,0,83,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfgw4b

devops,The ways to make portfolio/practice different DevOps tools.,"Hi, I have completed couple of courses on different DevOps tools and now I want to practice working with those tools. The thing is I don't know how. 

It might sound stupid but when I was learning something like Python I just came up with some kind of program I want to make and started coding. With Terraform or Docker I find this approach not working as well and when it comes to practicing pipelines or Kubernetes I spend a lot of time on finding app I want to use to learn and not on the tools that matter. 

The same goes with me wanting to build a portfolio to have something to show during job searching. If I want to show what I know Python I just make an app and put it on GitHub but when it comes to DevOps I don't know what should I put there. 

So my question is how to practice the usage of those DevOps tools? Is making my own projects similar to programming ones the way or there is more efficient way? Should I just use some already make apps to learn and just focus on the DevOps stuff?

devops,What is up with pulumi pricing? Or are my expectations off?,"Hi,

Please let me know if this question doesn't fit the rules of the sub, I can remove it.

I was researching today for alternatives to Terraform. The main issue I have with it is that there is little support for different environments - and I want to be able to just reuse the same file in different environments.

Each developer can bring up a stack to check his changes really quickly, before bringing it down when they're done. So each developer can do like ""bring up this stack with name 'abcTest'"" without having to write config files from scratch.

One option is terragrunt, another one is pulumi. I have seen reviews about the benefits of one vs the other, and I am still trying to understand which one I think would be nicer to work with. But before that, there is one thing which is really bugging me and preventing me from even trying pulumi out - the pricing.

The price at 0.37$ \*per resource\*. This is mind-boggling high, no? If we assume you only have 10-20 resources in prod (bare-bones, small project), then multiply that by staging, and dev -  that's 20$/month, which sounds reasonable.

But add the experimental stacks that engineers can experiment on (e.g. the 'abcTest' stack), and you pay 4$ per experiment. Every time you want to try a new setup in a new environment, it's a 4$ cost. That sounds incredibly high to me.

In general I really dislike this form of pricing - the more you use it, the more you pay is great for them, but horrible for you. I \_want\_ to use resources because I want to use Infrastructure as code. I don't want to optimize my setup to use as few resources as possible because each resource costs me a lot of money - I want to use the tool as best as I can, without this additional per-resource constraint.

Anyway, are my expectations off? How do you manage hundreds of resources across dozens of environments, are you paying thousands of dollars for the infra management alone?",Sbadabam278,1heq8xl,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1heq8xl/what_is_up_with_pulumi_pricing_or_are_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1heq8xl/what_is_up_with_pulumi_pricing_or_are_my/,2024-12-15 10:53:56,60,0.97,60,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heq8xl

devops,How to handle test environments - locally and on the cloud? ,"Hi all, 

  
I am new to DevOps, and I have a bunch of questions on what are the best practices / tools to setup  test environments. Let's get a concrete example: you have one frontend app and one backend app (in the same repo - I am using bazel for my monorepo tooling)

The backend app is self-contained, the frontend app makes http requests to the backend app to retrieve some information. 

Let's say you want to provide the following capabilities: 

1. A local test environment. You run the frontend/backend application locally, and you can test your changes. This is easy for the backend. For the frontend, you need to be able to connect to the backend app. My idea would be to use docker to setup a locally-running instance of the backend to which the frontend connects to. Ideally, this is completely isolated from the internet - meaning you can run this without any internet connection. 

  
2. A cloud test environment. Since this is meant to help developer testing things out, each developer can bring up its own test instances of the frontend/backend (with specific name, e.g. abcTest) and see the results on the cloud. 

  
I am currently mostly using GCP + Terraform for the backend (Vercel hosting for the frontend). Terraform doesn't provide an easy way to bring up ephemeral environments out of the box - you have to create a new directory with a bunch of files to get it to work. Ideally, one would have a single .tf file - and you just have to pass the name of the environment to bring it up. This doesn't really work with terraform. 

  
I am also exploring terragrunt for 2), which I hope will make it easier to have different ephemeral test environments. 

  
I would appreciate any suggestions! :)",Sbadabam278,1herh0p,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1herh0p/how_to_handle_test_environments_locally_and_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1herh0p/how_to_handle_test_environments_locally_and_on/,2024-12-15 12:20:12,9,0.84,9,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1herh0p

devops,DevOps vs TestManager vs Test Automation as career ,"Hello, 

I am curious about your advice. I have been working in IT for more than 15 years now. 
I was software developer a few years, then spent around a decade in Test Automation engineer/ Test Lead/ Test Manager positions. 

In the last 3 years I have been working as DevOps engineer. I think I am good in what I am doing but I wouldn't say I am great. In the field of Testing I can say I am great. My personal opinion though is that DevOps is a much more dynamic and challenging field so it is not a suprise. 

I enjoy working on both fields the reason i changed to DevOps wasn't that I hated Testing but that I was afraid that with the emergence of AI there is not really a future of this field. (i am following the number of job posts and that seems to be verifying this) 

Recently went for a few job interviews (mostly out of curiosity). I've got 2 DevOps offers with pretty much the same salary I have currently. 
However, another company I went offered 2 positions :  a Test Automation Lead and a Test Manager one for around 20% salary than my current one. 
Being in either position would be much less challenging, and super easy to do. 

Unfortunately, that still won't negate that if I want to change again in the future probably won't be able to find anything(which is not crap) in testing and would forget enough/changes enough  in DevOps that I would be maximum a junior. 

What donyou think? What would you do? Do you agree that DevOps has a mich brighter future or I am just mistaken?
