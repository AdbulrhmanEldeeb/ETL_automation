devops,I failed the last round of a Platform Engineer job interview because of a database migration question. How bad was my answer?,"For clarity, I am a Full-Stack developer, but these days my work is 80% front-end.

I have learnt all DevOps and Cloud-related stuff in my own time by studying and applying it to my own projects. I'm trying to break into a cloud-focused role because it has interested me for a while now.

This round was a whiteboarding session where I was tasked with migrating a legacy system to a cloud provider. We went with GCP for service choice names, as we both have worked this provider.

One of the components of the legacy system was the database. The interviewer said let's assume it's an SQL-based database and it's running on a VM somewhere.

**By this point in the interview, I had asked questions and got the following points:**

\- Developers are manually having to SSH into VM's to make changes and they are struggling to manage.  
\- The company expects to grow within 12 months, up to 100k DAU. They currently have 10K DAU.

**Once we get into the database section, it kind of went like this:**

&gt;**Me:**  
For the database, I would recommend a managed SQL service, Cloud SQL.  
The advantage of this choice is that it takes a big amount of cognitive load from the developers. DB Admin tasks like backups can be done much easier. It is also more suitable to scale than self-managing on a VM.  
The disadvantage of this choice is the cost, it'll easily be one of the most expensive components of this architecture. But I feel like the trade-off is worth it, as managing a database for this scenario can be a full-time job in itself.

&gt;**Interviewer:**  
Ok great, that trade-off makes sense. Let's talk about the actual migration of the data from the current system to GCP. We want minimal downtime, we can maybe afford a maximum of an hour of downtime.

&gt;**Me:**  
Ok, what is the rough amount of data we need to transfer? I'm guessing it's not Petabytes of data?

&gt;**Interviewer:**  
Correct, it's not that level of data, but equally, it's not so little that we can just do a quick and simple export/import

&gt;**Me:**  
Ok, I know that cloud providers do have database migration services available. These aim to do a lot of the work for you. However, I am aware that they only fit very simple scenarios. You have to have a supported db version and a relatively simple schema, so let's assume these services do not fit the bill.

&gt;In that case, I would replicate the legacy database to the cloud-based one. Once replication is done, we can ensure new records are added by adding a dual write strategy at the application level, so both databases are fully up to date. Then, after communicating with users about the expected hour downtime, ideally during a low-traffic period, we can mark the old database as read-only and switch over to the new instance.

&gt;The upside of this approach is that we can get downtime down to &lt; hour. The downside is that we need to write application-level code purely for this migration, which increases complexity and chances of mistakes, so it's something the developers will need to keep in mind.

And to be honest, the interviewer just OK'd that and we moved on to another question.

However, in the feedback, one of the main points was that I need to expand my knowledge on database migration strategies.

Was my answer straight-up wrong? Or did I fail to expand on the solution more?",Squishyboots1996,1hfgw4b,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hfgw4b/i_failed_the_last_round_of_a_platform_engineer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hfgw4b/i_failed_the_last_round_of_a_platform_engineer/,2024-12-16 11:16:10,155,0.94,155,0,83,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfgw4b

devops,The ways to make portfolio/practice different DevOps tools.,"Hi, I have completed couple of courses on different DevOps tools and now I want to practice working with those tools. The thing is I don't know how. 

It might sound stupid but when I was learning something like Python I just came up with some kind of program I want to make and started coding. With Terraform or Docker I find this approach not working as well and when it comes to practicing pipelines or Kubernetes I spend a lot of time on finding app I want to use to learn and not on the tools that matter. 

The same goes with me wanting to build a portfolio to have something to show during job searching. If I want to show what I know Python I just make an app and put it on GitHub but when it comes to DevOps I don't know what should I put there. 

So my question is how to practice the usage of those DevOps tools? Is making my own projects similar to programming ones the way or there is more efficient way? Should I just use some already make apps to learn and just focus on the DevOps stuff?

devops,EDR and build systems - how to get them to play nicely?,"Our IT are trialing some increased protection settings in our EDR system and we \*think\* it is causing some intermittent build failures. Specifically, even though the EDR system is just in ""learning"" mode, for the C++ build (using VisualC++ / msbuild) it looks like the EDR service might be briefly locking a recently generated file when a subsequent build step also tries to read that file.

I expect that convincing our IT to reduce the level of monitoring on our development environments would be a hard argument, so I'm starting by looking at what mitigations I can make within the build processes. I'm trying to find some guidance / best practices on how to configure ""security software aware"" build processes, and I have not found anything.

devops,DevOps vs TestManager vs Test Automation as career ,"Hello, 

I am curious about your advice. I have been working in IT for more than 15 years now. 
I was software developer a few years, then spent around a decade in Test Automation engineer/ Test Lead/ Test Manager positions. 

In the last 3 years I have been working as DevOps engineer. I think I am good in what I am doing but I wouldn't say I am great. In the field of Testing I can say I am great. My personal opinion though is that DevOps is a much more dynamic and challenging field so it is not a suprise. 

I enjoy working on both fields the reason i changed to DevOps wasn't that I hated Testing but that I was afraid that with the emergence of AI there is not really a future of this field. (i am following the number of job posts and that seems to be verifying this) 

Recently went for a few job interviews (mostly out of curiosity). I've got 2 DevOps offers with pretty much the same salary I have currently. 
However, another company I went offered 2 positions :  a Test Automation Lead and a Test Manager one for around 20% salary than my current one. 
Being in either position would be much less challenging, and super easy to do. 

Unfortunately, that still won't negate that if I want to change again in the future probably won't be able to find anything(which is not crap) in testing and would forget enough/changes enough  in DevOps that I would be maximum a junior. 

What donyou think? What would you do? Do you agree that DevOps has a mich brighter future or I am just mistaken?
